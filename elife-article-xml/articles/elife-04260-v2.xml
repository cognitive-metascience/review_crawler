critically involved in prion diseases where it misfolds into pathogenic PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. Moreover, it has been suggested as a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease. PrP<sup>C</sup> is shed at the plasma membrane by the metalloprotease ADAM10, yet the impact of this on prion disease remains enigmatic. Employing conditional knockout mice, we show that depletion of ADAM10 in forebrain neurons leads to posttranslational increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels. Upon prion infection of these mice, clinical, biochemical, and morphological data reveal that lack of ADAM10 significantly reduces incubation times and increases PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation. In contrast, spatiotemporal analysis indicates that absence of shedding impairs spread of prion pathology. Our data support a dual role for ADAM10-mediated shedding and highlight the role of proteolytic processing in prion disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04260.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04260.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04260.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Prion proteins are anchored to the surface of brain cells called neurons. Normally, prion proteins are folded into a specific three-dimensional shape that enables them to carry out their normal roles in the brain. However, they can be misfolded into a different shape known as PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, which can cause Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and other serious conditions that affect brain function and ultimately lead to death.</p><p>The PrP<sup>Sc</sup> proteins can force normal prion proteins to change into the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> form, so that over time this form accumulates in the brain. They are essential components of infectious particles termed ‘prions’ and this is why prion diseases are infectious: if prions from one individual enter the brain of another individual they can cause disease in the recipient. The UK outbreak of variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans in the 1990s is thought to be due to the consumption of meat from cattle with a prion disease known as mad cow disease.</p><p>An enzyme called ADAM10 can cut normal prion proteins from the surface of neurons. However, it is not clear whether ADAM10 can also target the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> proteins and what impact this may have on the development of prion diseases.</p><p>Here, Altmeppen et al. studied mutant mice that were missing ADAM10 in neurons in the front portion of their brain. These mice had a higher number of normal prion proteins on the surface of their neurons than normal mice did. When mice missing ADAM10 were infected with prions, more PrP<sup>Sc</sup> accumulated in their brain and disease symptoms developed sooner than when normal mice were infected. This supports the view that mice with higher numbers of prion proteins are more vulnerable to prion disease. However, disease symptoms did not spread as quickly to other parts of the brain in the mice missing ADAM10. This suggests that by releasing prion proteins from the surface of neurons, ADAM10 helps PrP<sup>Sc</sup> proteins to spread around the brain.</p><p>Recently, it has been suggested that prion proteins may also play a role in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. Therefore, Altmeppen et al.'s findings may help to develop new therapies for other forms of dementia. The next challenge is to understand the precise details of how ADAM10 works.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04260.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04260.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ADAM10</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>prion disease</kwd><kwd>proteolytic processing</kwd><kwd>shedding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Altmeppen</surname><given-names>Hermann C</given-names></name><name><surname>Prox</surname><given-names>Johannes</given-names></name><name><surname>Linsenmeier</surname><given-names>Luise</given-names></name><name><surname>Saftig</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><name><surname>Glatzel</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001664</institution-id><institution>Leibniz Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Leibniz Graduate School</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Altmeppen</surname><given-names>Hermann C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004431</institution-id><institution>European Commission Directorate-General for Research and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>REGPOT-2012-2013-1,7FP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sikorska</surname><given-names>Beata</given-names></name><name><surname>Liberski</surname><given-names>Pawel P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Werner Otto Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Altmeppen</surname><given-names>Hermann C</given-names></name><name><surname>Linsenmeier</surname><given-names>Luise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Hans &amp;

Misfolding of PrP<sup>C</sup> into its pathogenic isoform, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, occurs by a self-perpetuating process of templated conformational conversion and causes transmissible and invariably fatal prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prusiner, 1982</xref>). In these diseases, PrP<sup>C</sup> not only represents the substrate for conversion but also a prerequisite of prion-associated neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Büeler et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brandner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mallucci et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast to PrP<sup>C</sup>, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is prone to aggregation and is characterized by a high β-sheet content and partial resistance to digestion with proteinase K (PK). Moreover, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> constitutes an essential component of infectious prion particles or ‘prions’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Prusiner, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Silveira et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Recently, a central role in more common proteinopathies, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD), has been attributed to PrP<sup>C</sup> where it was shown to act as a neuronal receptor for neurotoxic amyloid-β (Aβ) oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lauren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dohler et al., 2014</xref>) and a variety of other disease-associated β-sheet rich protein assemblies including PrP<sup>Sc</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Resenberger et al., 2011</xref>). Despite some degree of controversy regarding this receptor function and its relevance in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balducci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benilova and De Strooper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Calella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kessels et al., 2010</xref>), binding of pathogenic oligomers to the flexible N-terminus of PrP<sup>C</sup> is thought to initiate a cascade of events that mediates their neurotoxicity and results in synaptic degeneration and neuronal loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Resenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Um et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>PrP<sup>C</sup> is subject to two conserved proteolytic cleavage events under physiological conditions, termed α-cleavage and shedding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Borchelt et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harris et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chen et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mange et al., 2004</xref>). These cleavages likely influence physiological functions of PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aguzzi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Linden et al., 2008</xref>) and, importantly, its role in neurodegenerative diseases (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altmeppen et al., 2013</xref>). While α-cleavage, occurring in the middle of the PrP<sup>C</sup> sequence and producing a soluble N1 and a membrane-attached C1 fragment, confers neuroprotection with regard to prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Westergard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turnbaugh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Campbell et al., 2013</xref>) and Aβ-associated neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Resenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fluharty et al., 2013</xref>), the role of an extreme C-terminal cleavage in close proximity to the plasma membrane, termed shedding, remains enigmatic. On the one hand, by reducing the substrate for prion conversion and the receptor for neurotoxicity, this proteolytic release of almost full length PrP<sup>C</sup> from the plasma membrane could be protective with regard to prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marella et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Heiseke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Altmeppen et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, recombinant or transgenically expressed anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> mimicking shed PrP<sup>C</sup> has been shown to antagonize both PrP<sup>Sc</sup> propagation and Aβ neurotoxicity, respectively, thus indicating a protective activity by blocking toxic conformers and preventing their access to the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Calella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Nieznanski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fluharty et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, shedding could accelerate an ongoing prion disease by increasing production and subsequent spread of anchorless prions within the CNS. In fact, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> can be shed from the cellular surface in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>) and anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> can, in principle, be converted to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, resulting in an altered type of prion disease in transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chesebro et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2010</xref>). High expression of anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> leads to formation of prions and a late onset neurological disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Stöhr et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>While the in vivo identity of the protease(s) responsible for the α-cleavage of PrP<sup>C</sup> remains a matter of controversy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vincent et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tveit et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Oliveira-Martins et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mays et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McDonald et al., 2014</xref>), we recently showed that <underline>a</underline> <underline>d</underline>isintegrin <underline>a</underline>nd <underline>m</underline>etalloproteinase ADAM10 is the relevant sheddase of PrP<sup>C</sup> in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>), as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>) and subsequently confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ostapchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McDonald et al., 2014</xref>) by in vitro experiments of others. Using conditional <sup>Nestin</sup>ADAM10 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jorissen et al., 2010</xref>), we recently showed that depletion of the protease in neural precursors abolishes shedding and leads to posttranslational accumulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the early secretory pathway indicative of a regulatory role of ADAM10 in PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>). However, due to the perinatal lethality of these mice, the influence of ADAM10 on the course of prion disease remained unsolved. In this study we used novel viable ADAM10 conditional knockout (ADAM10 cKO or A10 cKO) mice with specific postnatal deletion of the protease in forebrain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). We show that lack of ADAM10 leads to (i) elevated (membrane) levels of PrP<sup>C</sup>, (ii) drastically shortened incubation times of prion disease, (iii) increased prion conversion, and (iv) upregulation of calpain levels. In contrast, spread of prion-associated pathology within the brain was reduced.

However, due to the perinatal lethality of these mice we were unable to investigate the impact of ADAM10 deficiency on the course of prion disease. Therefore, new conditional <sup>Camk2a</sup>ADAM10 knockout mice (ADAM10 cKO or A10 cKO) lacking Adam10 in neurons of the forebrain were produced and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). These mice were viable and used for prion inoculations performed in this study. First, we analyzed PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in A10 cKO and littermate controls at postnatal day (P) 19. Reduction of ADAM10 expression was accompanied by increased PrP<sup>C</sup> amounts as revealed by Western blot analysis of cortical homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Residual ADAM10 most likely resulted from glial cells not depleted of ADAM10. In contrast to the cortex, differences in ADAM10 expression and PrP<sup>C</sup> levels between A10 cKO and littermate controls were not seen in the cerebellum, a brain region not affected by our knockout strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis in P19 mouse brains confirmed the Western blot data by showing increased immunostaining for PrP<sup>C</sup> in A10 cKO mice in several regions of the forebrain, as exemplified by the hippocampus and cortex, whereas no such increase was observed in the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, a coronal brain section showing costaining of PrP<sup>C</sup> with the neuronal marker NeuN correlates with the <italic>Camk2a</italic> driven ADAM10 knockout strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>) by showing increased PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in hippocampal and cortical areas as well as in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Increased PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in A10 cKO mice did not result from transcriptional upregulation as there were no significant differences in PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA levels in the forebrain at P19 as assessed by quantitative RT-PCR (mean ± SD: controls: 5.96 ± 0.86; A10 cKO: 6.32 ± 1.04; p = 0.23; n = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

This is reflected by the different PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts found in our different experimental groups (A10 cKO &gt; wild-type littermates &gt; <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic>). The combination of increased PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation in A10 cKO mice might favor increased production of membrane pores (as indicated in the middle row on the left) and neurotoxic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx with possible (‘?’) involvement of calpain. (iii) Finally, spread of prion-associated pathology within the brain also seems to be affected by the levels of ADAM10 expression since <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice showed enhanced whereas A10 cKO mice showed reduced dissemination of neuropathological features (as indicated by size of arrowheads on the right). Key references supporting this model are given in the text. Based on this model, stimulation of ADAM10 might therefore offer a treatment option. With regard to incubation times, protective effects by reducing local membrane bound PrP<sup>C</sup> amounts and by producing a protective soluble fragment able to block PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation seem to predominate the disadvantage of increased spread by production of anchorless prions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04260.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04260.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04260-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Proteolytic processing of the prion protein is critically involved in controlling its physiological functions. For α-cleavage, a protective role for both prion and AD is postulated and attributed to destruction of the neurotoxic domain and production of the neuroprotective N1 fragment respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Resenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Westergard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Guillot-Sestier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Fluharty et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the C1 fragment of PrP<sup>C</sup> is involved in myelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bremer et al., 2010</xref>). The protective role of α-cleavage is also supported by the fact that α-cleavage-resistant PrP<sup>C</sup> deletion mutants are intrinsically neurotoxic upon expression in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Shmerling et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Baumann et al., 2007</xref>) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yusa et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, our knowledge of the consequences of PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding, though being evolutionary conserved and constitutively occurring under physiological conditions, is limited. In a previous study we have shown that ADAM10 represents the principal PrP<sup>C</sup> sheddase in vivo with lack of ADAM10 resulting in a posttranslational increase of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>). This pointed to a key role for this protease in the regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> levels at the neuronal surface, yet its impact on prion diseases remained unknown. We recently generated A10 cKO mice, a viable model with selective postnatal ablation of ADAM10 in neurons of the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). In the present study we demonstrate that prion-inoculated A10 cKO mice show considerably reduced incubation times and increased conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> to PrP<sup>Sc</sup>. In contrast, spread of prion pathology within the brain is reduced, thus indicating a dual role for ADAM10 in the pathophysiology of prion disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>ADAM10 acts as a sheddase for a number of neuronally expressed proteins with important functions in the development and homeostasis of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weber and Saftig, 2012</xref>). For PrP<sup>C</sup> it is now widely accepted that ADAM10 is the PrP<sup>C</sup> sheddase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ostapchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McDonald et al., 2014</xref>). Here we extend our previous findings on increased levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the absence of ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>) in different cellular models and observe colocalization between PrP<sup>C</sup> and ADAM10 at the plasma membrane, which is regarded as the primary site of ADAM10-mediated shedding events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lammich et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). In addition to accumulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> in the early secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>), we here show that lack of ADAM10 also results in elevated membrane levels of PrP<sup>C</sup>. This supports a model where ADAM10-mediated shedding controls PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Altmeppen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>However, cell culture models as well as mice with pan-neuronal depletion of ADAM10 did not allow investigation of the role of PrP shedding in prion diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we used A10 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>) in which we observed increased PrP<sup>C</sup> levels that were not caused by elevated PrP<sup>C</sup> mRNA levels.</p><p>Onset of terminal prion disease in mice upon intracerebral inoculation with defined prion strains occurs after defined incubation times. Once clinical symptoms appear, individual mice reliably succumb to disease within days. In contrast to peripheral prion inoculation where the integrity of the lymphoreticular or autonomous nervous system plays a decisive role in neuroinvasion of prions, incubation time after intracerebral inoculation is mainly influenced by PrP<sup>C</sup> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mabbott et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glatzel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Prinz et al., 2003</xref>). This is nicely exemplified by <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice constitutively overexpressing PrP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sandberg et al., 2011</xref>). Our intracerebrally inoculated A10 cKO mice developed prion disease &gt;40 days earlier than controls, corresponding to a shortening of incubation times of ∼30%. Such dramatic reductions upon intracerebral inoculation with high-dose RML prions have so far only been achieved when PrP<sup>C</sup> is massively overexpressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 1996</xref>). Less dramatic reductions were, for instance, described in mice lacking superoxide dismutase 1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akhtar et al., 2013</xref>) or overexpressing the heat shock protein Hspa13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Grizenkova et al., 2012</xref>). The only other study investigating the role of ADAM10 in prion disease showed that transgenic overexpression of bovine ADAM10 in mice led to prolongation of prion disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Endres et al., 2009</xref>), a finding which is complementary to our data on the effect of ADAM10 deficiency. However, these authors linked this effect to transcriptional downregulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> and not to proteolytic processing events. In contrast, data from the present and previous studies show that transcriptional regulation of PrP<sup>C</sup> is not affected by ADAM10 whereas proteolytic processing clearly is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Parkin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Wik et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ostapchenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McDonald et al., 2014</xref>). We considered the possibility that non-PrP dependent effects resulting from ADAM10 deficiency may have contributed to disease acceleration. Indeed, ADAM10 is involved in a number of developmental and immunological processes and A10 cKO mice show learning deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weber and Saftig, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). It is virtually impossible to dissect out the individual contribution of the multitude of ADAM10 targets to the pathophysiology of prion disease. For instance, microglia contribute to prion pathophysiology and express CD40L, a known ADAM10 substrate. Prion-inoculated CD40L-deficient mice show decreased incubation times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burwinkel et al., 2004</xref>). As CD40L is not expressed on neurons and its receptor (CD40) is not processed by ADAM10, we do not expect that this dyad is altered by our neuron-specific knockout strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schönbeck and Libby, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Burwinkel et al., 2004</xref>). Another microglia-related mechanism relevant to prion disease and influenced by ADAM10 is the Cx3cl1/Cx3cr1 signaling complex. The receptor (Cx3cr1) is expressed on microglia whereas its ligand Cx3cl1 (Fractalkine) is an ADAM10 substrate expressed on neurons. Cx3cl1-deficient mice inoculated with prions show slightly decreased incubation times to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grizenkova et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we do not assume that these events explain the strong effect observed in our study. Most other immune system-mediated effects on prion pathogenesis are only relevant for peripheral prion inoculation and neuroinvasion and do not play major roles in intracerebral prion administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguzzi et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, A10 cKO mice do not show any gross morphological abnormalities in the CNS, have a normal life span once they have survived a critical weaning period, and mock inoculated mice behave normally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, we consider that increased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels found in A10 cKO mice strongly argue in favor of PrP-dependent effects of ADAM10 depletion.</p><p>Analysis of A10 cKO mice and littermate controls at 95 dpi as well as <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice at 65 dpi (which represents terminal disease for these mice) revealed a significant difference in PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation between A10 cKO and the other two experimental groups. This cannot be explained by the increased presence of PrP<sup>C</sup>, since PrP<sup>C</sup> overexpressing <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice showed low levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even at the terminal stage of the disease. How can this be explained? The molecular basis underlying neurodegeneration in prion diseases is under debate and different mechanisms of neurotoxicity have been proposed. In the receptor model, PrP<sup>C</sup> binds oligomeric β-sheet rich protein species, such as PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and mediates neurotoxic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mouillet-Richard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lauren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Resenberger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Um et al., 2012</xref>). In the pore formation model, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> oligomers, either directly or upon binding to PrP<sup>C</sup>, form a membrane channel leading to exaggerated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and calpain activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Falsig et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sonati et al., 2013</xref>). In our study we found evidence for the link between excessive generation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and increased calpain levels in A10 cKO mice, whereas basal (in littermate controls) and low (in <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice) PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels were not associated with calpain upregulation.</p><p><italic>Tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice are hypersensitive to prion disease yet do not show significant levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> even though PrP<sup>C</sup> is strongly overexpressed. In a previous study we have shown and re-evaluated here that ADAM10-mediated shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> in neurons of <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice is increased approximately threefold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>). Of note, soluble GPI-anchorless forms of PrP<sup>C</sup>, which may be regarded as correlates of shed PrP<sup>C</sup>, and experimentally-induced release of PrP<sup>C</sup> in vitro impair PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marella et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yuan et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, high levels of shed PrP<sup>C</sup> in <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice may impair PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation whereas lack of shed PrP<sup>C</sup> in A10 cKO mice may favor PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In line with this concept, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production was decreased in mice moderately overexpressing ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Endres et al., 2009</xref>). In both <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> and A10 cKO mice, increased levels of PrP<sup>C</sup> at the plasma membrane should facilitate PrP<sup>C</sup>-mediated neurotoxicity and thereby determine incubation times. Interestingly, these data provide a potential explanation for the <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> paradox of low PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation despite high PrP<sup>C</sup> levels and short incubation times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>A10 cKO mice and controls showed identical prion titers. On the other hand levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> were elevated and no atypical protease-sensitive forms of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> were found. It is becoming increasingly evident that titers of prion infectivity, PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, and the presence of potentially neurotoxic PrP conformers are not congruent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lasmezas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barron et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Piccardo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Krasemann et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, the exact composition of infectious ‘prions’ (i.e., the entity determined by bioassay) is not fully understood and it may be that ADAM10-mediated shedding affects formation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> while it does not influence production of ‘prions’.</p><p>We did not observe induction of proposed neurotoxic signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mouillet-Richard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schneider et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Larson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Um et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pradines et al., 2013</xref>). It may be that these pathways occur spatially and temporally restricted and future studies will have to address this question using refined methods of analysis. Alternatively, other yet to be discovered pathways may be involved. In A10 cKO mice, the combination of elevated PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels and increased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts may favor increased pore formation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx as indicated by elevated calpain levels. However, since we did not detect unequivocal evidence for calpain activation, further studies are required to substantiate this model.</p><p>In view of the fact that prion-infected mice expressing anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> show PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and deposition in ectopic sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2011</xref>) and prion propagation in the CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chesebro et al., 2005</xref>), we investigated whether shedding contributes to the spread of prion pathology. In fact, A10 cKO mice show prion-related pathology and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> deposition at the site of (striatum) and adjacent to prion administration (hippocampus, frontal cortex, thalamus), whereas brain regions distant from the inoculation site (cerebellum, brain stem) were unaffected, even at terminal stages of disease. In contrast, in <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice, dissemination of prion-related pathology occurred efficiently at a much earlier time point. Non-PrP-dependent effects resulting from ADAM10 deficiency, such as altered microglial activity or reduced processing of proinflammatory molecules, may have contributed to impaired spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). However, the influence of the immune system, including microglial activation on intracerebral spread of prions, is limited, therefore a correlation between PrP shedding and the efficiency of prion spread is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glatzel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grizenkova et al., 2014</xref>). In line with our findings, it has been shown that, upon prion infection of mice, heterozygous expression of normal and anchorless PrP results in earlier death compared with wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chesebro et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, shedding of either PrP<sup>C</sup> (followed by cell-free conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kocisko et al., 1994</xref>]) or PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, both of which have been shown to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Taylor et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>), should be considered as an alternative mechanism of prion spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) aside from direct transsynaptic cell-to-cell transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Glatzel et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shearin and Bessen, 2014</xref>), exosomal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alais et al., 2008</xref>) and viral transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Leblanc et al., 2006</xref>), or tunneling nanotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gousset et al., 2009</xref>). It remains to be investigated whether ADAM10-mediated shedding is also involved in the release of bona fide prions into body fluids such as cerebrospinal fluid, blood, or nasal secretions, which may potentially increase the risk of transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Tagliavini et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Perini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Parizek et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bessen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our data indicate that proteolytic processing, as described here for the shedding of the prion protein, represents a master switch in the pathophysiology of prion diseases by drastically affecting PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and incubation times. Interestingly, protective effects of ADAM10 might be hijacked in prion diseases since a reduction of the protease in prion disease has recently been reported in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast, shedding also seems to affect the spread of prion pathology within the CNS. Understanding this dual role of ADAM10 in prion disease brings together current concepts of prion biology and might reveal a mechanistic insight into important pathophysiological processes. Apart from prion disease, in other neurodegenerative proteinopathies, where PrP<sup>C</sup>-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion does not play a role, ADAM10-mediated shedding of PrP<sup>C</sup> might solely be protective due to reduction of the receptor as well as the production of a soluble blocker of toxic oligomers. In view of a potential role of PrP<sup>C</sup> in AD, further research on proteolysis as a regulatory event in prion biology will likely impact on more common neurodegenerative conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Description of mice and ethics statement</title><p>In this study we took advantage of the recently generated <italic>Camk2a</italic>-Cre <italic>Adam10</italic> conditional knockout (A10 cKO) mouse model with a depletion of <italic>Adam10</italic> in neurons of the forebrain.

Samples were then normalized to yield equal protein amounts and boiled in 4× loading buffer (250 mM Tris–HCl, 8% SDS, 40% glycerol, 20% β-mercaptoethanol, 0.008% Bromophenol Blue, pH 6.8) for 6 min at 96°C. Gel electrophoresis was performed using 20–50 µg of total protein per lane and 8%, 10%, or 12% SDS-PAGE gels. Proteins were subsequently wet-blotted onto nitrocellulose membranes (Biorad) and membranes were blocked for 1 hr using 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T. Immunoblot analysis was performed using the following primary antibodies: rabbit anti-ADAM10 (1:1000; polyclonal antiserum, B42.1), mouse monoclonal antibodies against PrP<sup>C</sup> (POM1 [for most of the experiments] or POM2 [for detection of shed PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>)] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Polymenidou et al., 2008</xref>), 1:2500; A Aguzzi, Zurich, Switzerland), mouse monoclonal 1E4 (1:500; Sanquin, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), rabbit against p35/p25 (1:1000; mAB #2680; Cell Signaling), mouse Anti-Spectrin (1:500; MAB1622; Millipore, Bedford, MA), rabbit polyclonal antibody against calpain (H-240, 1:200; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA), and mouse monoclonal antibody against β-actin (1:2000; Millipore) or rabbit anti-Actin (1:2000; A5060; Sigma). Incubation with primary antibodies (diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk) was carried out overnight at 4°C on a shaking platform. Membranes were then washed 3× for 5 min with TBS-T, incubated for 45 min at room temperature with HRP-conjugated anti-mouse or anti-rabbit secondary antibodies (Promega, Madison, WI) diluted in 5% non-fat dry milk in TBS-T, and washed 6× for 5 min with TBS-T. The signal was detected after incubation of membranes with Pierce ECL or SuperSignal West Femto substrate (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA) using a CD camera imaging system (Biorad). If necessary, quantification of signal strengths was performed using QuantityOne software (Biorad) to measure the ratio of protein bands (glycotyping of PrP<sup>C</sup>) or to determine relative protein expression against β-actin.</p><p>For assessment of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels and for use in inoculation experiments (Bioassay), 20% (wt/vol) homogenates of frontal brain were prepared in sterile phosphate buffer saline (PBS) without protease inhibitors. Again, samples were smashed 30× on ice using a Dounce homogenizer and subsequently spun down at 1000 rpm for 2 min. The resulting supernatant was either further diluted in PBS to yield a 1% homogenate used for inoculation of <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> reporter mice (see above) or 2–5 µl were digested with 20 µg/ml PK (Roche) in a total volume of 22 µl RIPA buffer for 1 hr at 37°C to assess the PrP<sup>Sc</sup> content. For detection of atypical prion fragments, selected samples were digested with 1 or 10 µg/ml or without PK for 1 hr at 37°C. ‘Cold PK’ treatment was performed with 200 µg/ml PK for 1 hr at 4°C. Digestion was stopped by adding 10× loading buffer and boiling for 6 min at 96°C. Subsequent SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis was performed as described above with the exception that commercial Mini-PROTEAN TGX Any kD gels (Biorad) were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Histological and immunohistochemical analysis</title><p>Morphological analysis was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Altmeppen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prox et al., 2013</xref>). In brief, brains were dissected and fixed by immersion in 4% buffered formalin overnight. In the case of prion- or mock-inoculated animals, samples were inactivated for 1 hr in 98–100% formic acid before export from the facility. These samples were then incubated overnight with an excess of 4% buffered formalin. Samples were dehydrated and embedded in low melting point paraffin following standard laboratory procedures. Sections of 4 μm were prepared and either stained with hematoxylin and eosin (HE) following standard laboratory procedures or submitted to immunostaining following standard immunohistochemistry procedures using the Ventana Benchmark XT machine (Ventana, Tucson, AZ). Briefly, deparaffinated sections were boiled for 30–60 min in 10 mM citrate buffer (pH 6.0) for antigen retrieval. All solutions were from Ventana.

Detection was with anti-rabbit or anti-goat histofine Simple Stain MAX PO Universal immunoperoxidase polymer or Mouse Stain Kit (for detection of mouse antibodies on mouse sections). All secondary antibody polymers were purchased from Nichirei Biosciences (Tokyo, Japan). Detection of antibodies was performed with Ultra View Universal DAB Detection Kit or Ultra View Universal Alkaline Phosphatase Red Detection Kit from Ventana according to standard settings of the machine. Experimental groups were stained in one run, thereby providing identical conditions. The counterstaining was also performed by the machine according to common protocols. Additional negative controls included sections treated with secondary antibody only. For PrP<sup>Sc</sup> detection, mounted tissue sections (4 µm) were pretreated with 98% formic acid for 5 min. Further processing was performed on an automated staining machine (Benchmark XT, Ventana). Briefly, sections were pretreated with 1.1 mM sodium citrate buffer (2.1 mM Tris–HCl, 1.3 mM EDTA, pH 7.8) at 95°C for 30 min, digested with low concentration of PK for 16 min, incubated in Superblock for 10 min and then incubated with the PrP-specific antibody SAF 84 (see above), followed by secondary antibody treatment and detection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Small pieces of forebrain (2–3 mm<sup>3</sup>) of terminally prion-diseased A10 cKO mice and littermate controls were fixed in glutaraldehyde, postfixed in osmium tetroxide for 1−2 hr, dehydrated through a series of graded ethanols and propylene oxide, and embedded in Epon.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Overall all three referees agree that this work is interesting and is in principle good material for <italic>eLife</italic>. However the work needs an in depth revision with regard to the conclusions made as they are not all supported by the provided data. Also rewriting the Results section and reorganisation of the way the data are presented is needed before the manuscript can be accepted. The referees are also concerned about the low number of animals used to support some of the conclusions.</p><p>Below follow the list of substantial comments that need to be fully addressed in a revised manuscript. We also urge the authors to address systematically the many other concerns of the referees as those will help to improve considerably this potentially very interesting manuscript.</p><p>Substantial comments:</p><p>1) The most important conclusion drawn by the authors is that suppression of PrP shedding by ADAM10 shortens the incubation time of the disease by ca. 30%, and therefore shedding of PrP by ADAM10 puts a brake on prion pathogenesis. This interpretation may be valid, but ADAM10 deficiency is highly pathogenic by itself, and the authors say that they couldn't even perform the experiment in CNS-specific conditional mutants because of embryonic lethality. It is therefore plausible (and indeed likely) that the accelerated death of prion-inoculated A10 cKO mice results nonspecifically from the combined pathology of prion infection plus absence of ADAM10. This possibility is rendered even more likely by the titer determinations which failed to demonstrate any difference in prion replication between A10 cKO and wt mice. The above is not necessarily a killer of this well-conducted study, but these alternative interpretations must by all means be discussed.</p><p>2) The claim that soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> (generated by ADAM10) explains the spreading of the disease in the <italic>tga20</italic> (and the absence in ADAM) is only based on at best correlative evidence: the alleged reduced pathology in the ADAM may be due to reduced prion spread, but it may also pertain to secondary effects unrelated to prion spread (or to prion pathogenesis altogether), such as reduced processing of proinflammatory molecules, or impairment of neuron-microglia interaction by the lack of ADAM10. The authors have not directly investigated whether prion spread is modified in their mice (an admittedly difficult task, though not impossible). A knockout of ADAM10 in the <italic>tga20</italic> mice would allow investigating more precisely the role of cleaved PrP<sup>C</sup> in the spreading of the disease in these mice. It might also be possible to inject /transduce /transgenically express soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> in the ADAM10 cKO and rescue the spreading of the disease. As these experiments require substantial time, the authors might alternatively reconsider this conclusion and either tone down the interpretation of these findings, or at least mention the many possible alternative explanations.</p><p>3) In the Results section related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1 A and B</xref>, while mentioned in the Methods, the control for reintroducing ADAM10 cDNA into ADAM10 knockout cell lines (Lenti virus lacking ADAM10 cDNA) is not shown. It is important to show that the decrease in PrP<sup>C</sup> signal is independent of the virus treatment itself. It would be desirable to have n&gt;2 for quantification of surface PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in A10 cKO+ADAM10.</p><p>4) The number of mice used for the crucial experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> (incubation times) is meagre. I realize that there is little that can be done about this problem at this stage, but the authors would be well-advised to use numbers of mice appropriate for sufficient statistical power. The same applies to the titer determinations in <italic>tga20</italic> mice: just four recipient mice for each titration is pathetically low and will by necessity undermine the precision of the determination.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>1) In the Abstract a conclusion is made with regard to treatment options for other neurodegenerative diseases (apart from prion). In the absence of any data, I suggest to remove this claim from the Abstract and only mention this in the Discussion as an interesting speculation.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figure 1 and 2</xref>: the paper contains a whole series of experiments (covering two full figures) to proof that in the absence of ADAM 10, prion expression is increased and shedding is decreased. I believe that these data should be summarized in one figure, especially because this is not entirely novel. Moreover, instead of many different data it is better to have a couple of experiments fully documented. For instance it is not clear what was quantified in Figure Panel 1A and this should be complemented with the blot or the figure on which the quantitation is based. Panel 1C should include for the ADAM10 KO a similar analysis as for the control with regard to PrP surface staining. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>: the immunohistochemistry shows a particular strong staining in the mouse brains of the ADAM cKO, more than what is seen in the western blot and expression is very diffuse over all cells (while the ko is only in a subset of neurons). Additional controls e.g. immunostaining of the cerebellum and more precise details of the cellular stainings would help to understand this better and to demonstrate for instance that the slides of wild type and knock out were incubated for similar length of time. It is also important to show that PrP accumulation is only seen in the neurons where ADAM10 was knocked out, as this is an important point also with regard to the conclusions with regard to the propagation of the disease.</p><p>3) The very strong conclusion in the second paragraph of the Discussion: “and show for the first time that PrP<sup>C</sup> and ADAM10 co-localize at the plasma membrane” is based on a single piece of weak evidence (inset in Panel 1C). The resolution of this type of experiment is insufficient to make such a strong claim.</p><p>4) In the ninth paragraph of the Results section: “Taken together, these data indicate that at terminal prion disease, lack of PrP<sup>C</sup>-shedding does not influence local PrP<sup>Sc</sup> distribution while it does impact the appearance of TVS”. This observation is mentioned here, and not further discussed or explained. Why mention it?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: I find it puzzling that there is such a contrast in the accumulation of proteinase K resistant species in the ADAM10 ko versus the <italic>tga20</italic> mouse? In principle both animals have more uncleaved prion protein on the cell membrane. Thus the main difference is the shed prion in the <italic>tga20</italic> mouse. Would one conclude from this that the shed prion inhibits the generation of proteinase K resistant forms of the PrP<sup>Sc</sup>? As also indicated above, I think that it is necessary to study the ADAM10 KO effect in the <italic>tga20</italic> mouse to allow making real conclusions with regard to the precise effect of ADAM10.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>: The activation of calpain is linked to membrane pores in the text.

This needs to be better formulated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>1) In its current form the manuscript has a few areas of weakness that need to be improved. In particular, throughout the manuscript the PrP<sup>C</sup> and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels, the incubation periods, and the spongiosis levels are compared between different mouse lines (A10 cKO, wild-type, <italic>tga20</italic>), different time points (65d, 95d), and different brain regions (forebrain, cerebellum, whole brain), but at present these comparisons are a bit haphazard. It would be great to include a table to assemble all these scattered data into one location. This table would make it easier for the reader to keep track of these differences and better follow the arguments the manuscript makes.</p><p>2) Throughout the manuscript a comma is used as the decimal mark. For proper English a full stop should be used instead.</p><p>3) In several places the A10 cKO results are compared with those that were obtained with mice expressing anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> (e.g. at the end of the third paragraph of the Introduction, eighth paragraph of the Discussion, etc.). At present the comparison is limited to an anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> low-expressor mouse line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Chesebro et al., 2005</xref>), but it would be desirable to also include high-expressor results into this discussion (Stohr et al., 2011). Particularly, since the latter animals express PrP at levels closer to the mouse lines that are used in this study.</p><p>4) The first paragraph of the Results section describes results from a complete ADAM10 knockout mouse line, according to the figure legend the corresponding figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>) show only A10 cKO data. This mismatch needs to be cleared up.</p><p>5) It is difficult to judge the alleged co-localization of PrP<sup>C</sup> and ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), since the magnification is so low. Higher resolution images would be needed to make this a convincing argument.</p><p>6) The electron micrographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> show tubulovesicular structures (TVS), which are claimed to be increased in diseased A10 cKO mice. It would be worthwhile to document and quantify this increase, since TVS and their link to prion disease are controversial. Ultimately, the A10 cKO mice may help to demystify these structures and their role in the prion diseases.</p><p>7) The comparison of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels between different mouse lines is solely based on PK-resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While this surrogate marker is widely used to estimate prion infectivity levels, the possible presence of protease-sensitive forms of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> should be taken into consideration and discussed.</p><p>8) In the conclusions, ADAM10 is being promoted as a potential therapeutic target for prion diseases. The finding that a reduction of ADAM10 leads to a shortening of the incubation period, while its normal function increases the spreading of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, suggests a no-win scenario. Hence, a more refined and discerning discussion would be needed to support such a statement.</p><p>9) Lastly, grammatical errors can be found all the way through the manuscript, a thorough proofreading would benefit the readability of the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>1) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, WB analysis of protein expression was compared only in frontal brain homogenates. This needs to be controlled by including whole brain homogenates as well.</p><p>2) In panel C, the GFAP signal of CD1 mock ADAM10 cKO seems higher than the control. Is this image representative? If yes, is there an explanation for this?</p><p>3) In panel D: How was the quantification done and what is the relevance of higher numbers of tubulovesicular structures in ADAM10 cKO? Does this bear relevance for the paper at all?</p><p>4) Results related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: It would be important to show that the increase of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels in forebrain homogenates of ADAM10 cKO is comparable to the overall PrP<sup>Sc</sup> content of wild type mouse brains. This could underline that the difference resides in the lack of shedding and spreading of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, leading to local accumulation of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in ADAM10 cKO. For this, whole brain homogenates should be compared.</p><p>5) As for the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the comparison of infectivity tests of non-forebrain regions of control and ADAM10 cKO would be important, as it could identify any infectious but non-toxic PrP subpopulations which still might leave PrP<sup>Sc</sup> aggregates in ADAM10 cKO.</p><p>6) Discussion: The authors state that PrP “is a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer's disease”. This is a highly controversial contention propagated by Dr. Strittmatter, and there is more than half-dozen papers out there showing that this idea is, at best, limited to certain animal models. It is the authors' privilege to choose what they wish to believe, and I understand that the charitable interpretation of the Strittmatter paper might add to the perceived importance of the current study, but in fairness they should at least mention the evidence against PrP<sup>C</sup> being the Aβ receptor.</p><p>7) One problematic point is the following: It is stated that ADAM10 cKO mice show massive neurodegeneration in the forebrain, but not in the cerebellum and brainstem, while controls including <italic>tga20</italic> show diffuse neurodegeneration. If this is really true, how can one explain completely identical clinical phenotypes?</p><p>8) As for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the total amount of calpain is most certainly irrelevant to neurodegeneration, since calpains are mostly inactive in the absence of raised intracellular calcium. What matters is the amount of activated calpains. This can be assessed by investigating the amount of cleavage of a calpain substrate, such as spectrin (alpha-fodrin). The mere detection of calpains by Western blot is irrelevant. The whole argument about calpains needs to be revisited by activity measurements, or else it should be deleted in toto. This becomes painfully evident by the authors' finding that on the one hand there is prion toxicity (allegedly through calpain) with profound neurodegeneration in the forebrain of ADAM10 cKO, but on the other hand the significantly faster disease in <italic>tga20</italic> mice goes along with significantly less calpain Also, a comparison of overall (not only forebrain) calpain activity levels to mock inoculated animals could help.</p><p>9) When mentioning the possible inhibition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation by shedded PrP<sup>C</sup>, it would be desirable to prove this statement with PMCA + shed PrP<sup>C</sup>.</p><p>10) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, POM2 is named as the applied antibody, while the Methods section describes POM1 for this purpose.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04260.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The most important conclusion drawn by the authors is that suppression of PrP shedding by ADAM10 shortens the incubation time of the disease by ca. 30%, and therefore shedding of PrP by ADAM10 puts a brake on prion pathogenesis. This interpretation may be valid, but ADAM10 deficiency is highly pathogenic by itself, and the authors say that they couldn't even perform the experiment in CNS-specific conditional mutants because of embryonic lethality. It is therefore plausible (and indeed likely) that the accelerated death of prion-inoculated A10 cKO mice results nonspecifically from the combined pathology of prion infection plus absence of ADAM10. This possibility is rendered even more likely by the titer determinations which failed to demonstrate any difference in prion replication between A10 cKO and wt mice. The above is not necessarily a killer of this well-conducted study, but these alternative interpretations must by all means be discussed</italic>.</p><p>The mice we used for the in vivo experiments are CNS-specific conditional mutants with Cre-mediated deletion of ADAM10 occurring in forebrain neurons under the control of the <italic>Camk2a</italic> promoter. These mice display an almost normal life span once they have survived a critical weaning period, additionally they do not show any gross morphological abnormalities in the CNS (Prox et al., 2013a).</p><p>The ADAM10 KO mice showing perinatal lethality, the reviewing editor is referring to, were only used for the ex vivo experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (determination of PrP surface levels in neuronally differentiated neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and analyses of PrP-shedding in primary neurons derived from embryonal day 14 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In these mice, ADAM10 is deleted under the control of the Nestin promoter with ADAM10 deficiency occurring in progenitor cell types present in the neuroectoderm, the developing mesonephros, and the somites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jorissen et al., 2010</xref>). We have clarified this in the first paragraph of the Results section in the manuscript:</p><p>“To further investigate this we generated neural stem cells (NSCs) from embryonic day (E) 14 wild-type and ADAM10 conditional knockout mice with an inactivation of the <italic>Adam10</italic> gene in neuroectodermal progenitor cells (<sup>Nestin</sup>A10 KO mice) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jorissen et al., 2010</xref>).”</p><p>Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewing editor that effects on prion disease acceleration caused by lack of ADAM10 in forebrain neurons (<sup><italic>Camk2a</italic></sup>ADAM10 cKO) may not solely be caused by lack of ADAM10-mediated PrP shedding and increased neuronal PrP<sup>C</sup> levels. We have thus introduced a text fragment in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion section where we discuss this possibility in detail, with special emphasis on potential contribution by ADAM10 substrates of the immune system:</p><p>“We considered the possibility that non-PrP dependent effects resulting from ADAM10 deficiency may have contributed to disease acceleration. […] Finally, we consider that increased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> levels found in A10 cKO mice strongly argue in favor of PrP-dependent effects of ADAM10 depletion.”</p><p>Regarding the observed identical prion titer, we would like to clarify that titers of prion infectivity and presence of potentially neurotoxic PrP conformers are rather not congruent. In fact, a growing body of published reports indicates a clear dissociation between these. We have clarified and referenced this in paragraph seven of the Discussion section. As suggested by Reviewer #2 (point 7), we have also checked for the presence of aberrant prion species/fragments that could contribute to the uncoupling of infectivity and PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts yet did not find any evidence for those in our samples (at 95 dpi) as shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>“A10 cKO mice and controls showed identical prion titers […] while it does not influence production of ‘prions’.”</p><p><italic>2) The claim that soluble PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>(generated by ADAM10) explains the spreading of the disease in the</italic> tga20 <italic>(and the absence in ADAM) is only based on at best correlative evidence: the alleged reduced pathology in the ADAM may be due to reduced prion spread, but it may also pertain to secondary effects unrelated to prion spread (or to prion pathogenesis altogether), such as reduced processing of proinflammatory molecules, or impairment of neuron-microglia interaction by the lack of ADAM10. The authors have not directly investigated whether prion spread is modified in their mice (an admittedly difficult task, though not impossible). A knockout of ADAM10 in the</italic> tga20 <italic>mice would allow investigating more precisely the role of cleaved PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>in the spreading of the disease in these mice. It might also be possible to inject /transduce /transgenically express soluble PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>in the ADAM10 cKO and rescue the spreading of the disease. As these experiments require substantial time, the authors might alternatively reconsider this conclusion and either tone down the interpretation of these findings or at least mention the many possible alternative explanations.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewing editor that experiments directly investigating if lack of ADAM10 mediated shedding of PrP is responsible for the reduction of prion spread in our mice are difficult if not impossible to conduct. Although the proposed experiment of crossing ADAM10 cKO into <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice or transgenic expression of soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> on an ADAM10 cKO background will likely provide important information on the correlation between shedding of PrP and spread of prion pathology, this will rather not get rid of non-PrP mediated effects. Additionally, we believe that presence of soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> will introduce another variable by potential interference with the PrP<sup>C</sup>-PrP<sup>Sc</sup> conversion process, as discussed in paragraph eight of the Discussion. Nevertheless, we are initiating these breedings which are, as stated by the reviewing editor, time consuming.</p><p>We also agree that our evidence at this point is merely correlative. Therefore, we have toned down our interpretation in the Results and Discussion sections and specifically mention secondary effects unrelated to prion spread:</p><p>“ADAM10-mediated shedding might contribute to spreading of prion pathology” (in the Results section) and “Non-PrP dependent effects resulting from ADAM10 […] efficiency of prion spread is possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glatzel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grizenkova et al., 2014</xref>)” (Discussion section).</p><p><italic>3) In the Results section related to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1 A and B</italic></xref><italic>, while mentioned in the Methods, the control for reintroducing ADAM10 cDNA into ADAM10 knockout cell lines (Lenti virus lacking ADAM10 cDNA) is not shown.

It would be desirable to have n&gt;2 for quantification of surface PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>expression in A10 cKO+ADAM10</italic>.</p><p>We are thankful for making us aware of this oversight. We have now included the data from the empty vector control. As stated in the Method section, we used Nucleofector® technology instead of lenitiviral transduction (this term was mistakenly included in the previous version) to genetically introduce ADAM10 or the linearized vector only. Moreover, we have performed additional surface biotinylation experiments to increase “n” numbers of independent culture samples and now show representative Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We also performed a new set of immunofluorescent stainings including the requested empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The new data are mentioned in the Results section (first paragraph) as well as in the figure legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The number of mice used for the crucial experiments in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A</italic></xref> <italic>(incubation times) is meagre. I realize that there is little that can be done about this problem at this stage, but the authors would be well-advised to use numbers of mice appropriate for sufficient statistical power. The same applies to the titer determinations in</italic> tga20 <italic>mice: just four recipient mice for each titration is pathetically low and will by necessity undermine the precision of the determination</italic>.</p><p>We are aware of our shortcomings in this respect and while it was not possible to increase the amount of A10 cKO and littermate controls for time reasons and limitations in breeding capacities, we have been able to perform new experiments to increase the number of <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> reporter mice for prion titer determination. For the most interesting and important time point (95 dpi) we have inoculated more indicator mice per group (from four to six) and we have bioassayed additional samples (one additional inoculum for both A10 cKO and littermate control, into n=6 reporter mice). The data remain largely unchanged but have now become more robust.

In the absence of any data, I suggest to remove this claim from the Abstract and only mention this in the Discussion as an interesting speculation</italic>.</p><p>We understand the point of this reviewer and followed the advice and have removed this claim from the Abstract and carefully speculate on this interesting issue in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>2)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2"><italic>Figure 1 and 2</italic></xref><italic>: the paper contains a whole series of experiments (covering two full figures) to proof that in the absence of ADAM 10, prion expression is increased and shedding is decreased. I believe that these data should be summarized in one figure, especially because this is not entirely novel. Moreover, instead of many different data it is better to have a couple of experiments fully documented. For instance it is not clear what was quantified in Figure Panel 1A and this should be complemented with the blot or the figure on which the quantitation is based. Panel 1C should include for the ADAM10 KO a similar analysis as for the control with regard to PrP surface staining. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref><italic>: the immunohistochemistry shows a particular strong staining in the mouse brains of the ADAM cKO, more than what is seen in the western blot and expression is very diffuse over all cells (while the ko is only in a subset of neurons). Additional controls e.g. immunostaining of the cerebellum and more precise details of the cellular stainings would help to understand this better and to demonstrate for instance that the slides of wild type and knock out were incubated for similar length of time. It is also important to show that PrP accumulation is only seen in the neurons where ADAM10 was knocked out, as this is an important point also with regard to the conclusions with regard to the propagation of the disease</italic>.</p><p>We thank this reviewer for the helpful comments on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1 and 2</xref>. In light of the fact that Reviewers #2 and #3 as well as the reviewing editor commented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and given that almost all of the data are novel and, as we consider, relevant to the rest of the manuscript, we decided to keep revised versions of both figures. We are convinced that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is a reasonable start into the overall theme of this paper by revealing effects of ADAM10 depletion on PrP<sup>C</sup> levels in different cellular lineages and thus generalizing those mechanisms. Although we previously reported lack of PrP<sup>C</sup> shedding in <sup>Nestin</sup>ADAM10 KO and increased shedding by <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> neurons, we also tend to keep the hitherto unpublished <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> to support our arguments with regard to inefficient PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production and potentially increased prion spread in infected <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice as described in the Discussion. With <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> we then introduce the novel <italic>Camk2a</italic> ADAM10 cKO mouse model with special emphasize on its PrP<sup>C</sup> expression pattern.</p><p>Following the suggestions of this reviewer we now:</p><p>a) Show representative blots (including the empty vector control) and the ADAM10 expression for PrP<sup>C</sup> membrane levels experiment in neuronally differentiated neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>);</p><p>b) Provide new images for the PrP<sup>C</sup> surface staining including the empty vector control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>);</p><p>c) Show detailed, higher resolution images of the colocalization between ADAM10 and PrP<sup>C</sup> on the plasma membrane of control MEF and also included this magnification for the ADAM10 KO MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>);</p><p>d) Include a more detailed panel of the PrP immunohistochemistry of control and ADAM10 cKO brains with higher magnifications now also showing details of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, we provide a new figure with co-staining of a neuronal marker (NeuN) and PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>) to demonstrate the regional variation in PrP immunohistochemistry in the brain and differences between ADAM10 cKO mice and wild-type littermates. This analysis reveals that the signal in PrP immunohistochemistry is increased in regions where ADAM10 is deleted thus conforming previous data on the <italic>Camk2a</italic> driven deletion strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>; Prox et al., 2013a). This is mentioned in the Results (fifth paragraph) as follows:</p><p>“In addition, a coronal brain section showing co-staining of PrP<sup>C</sup> with the neuronal marker NeuN correlates with the <italic>Camk2a</italic> driven ADAM10 knockout strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>) by showing increased PrP<sup>C</sup> expression in hippocampal and cortical areas as well as in the striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>).” Moreover, this is now also illustrated for the prospective readers' convenience and orientation in a new scheme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>The new figures are described in the figure legends. Additionally, we have added experimental details on the highly standardized immunostaining with an automated system guaranteeing identical incubation times and staining conditions (“Experimental groups were stained in one run thus providing identical conditions”, paragraph nine of Materials and methods section).</p><p>With regard to the last point we agree that our immunohistochemical staining for PrP<sup>C</sup> shows a rather general staining yet with differences in intensities between genotypes. We aimed at showing that increased PrP<sup>C</sup> staining is restricted to neurons depleted of ADAM10. Since neurons are highly branched cells and PrP is highly expressed on the neuronal cell surface, single neuron analysis in 4 μ m thick paraffin sections was not feasible. Moreover, all other cell types in the CNS (though not affected by the knockout strategy) contribute to the overall staining. Finally, to the best of our knowledge there is no published reliable antibody against ADAM10 working in immnunohistochemical staining of mouse brain sections. We have nevertheless tried different ADAM10 antibodies (rabbit anti-ADAM10 (B42.1); rabbit anti-ADAM10 amino acids 608-627 (kindly provided by Dr. A. Chalaris, Kiel); rat anti-ADAM10 ectodomain antibody (MAB946)) under different staining conditions in formalin-fixed and cryo-fixed brain samples yet were not able to detect specific signals. Thus, we could not perform co-stainings of ADAM10 and PrP<sup>C</sup> which would help to answer this point of the reviewer.</p><p><italic>3) The very strong conclusion in the second paragraph of the Discussion: “and show for the first time that PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>and ADAM10 co-localize at the plasma membrane” is based on a single piece of weak evidence (inset in Panel 1C). The resolution of this type of experiment is insufficient to make such a strong claim</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer, have provided higher resolution figures, have deleted this strong claim and modified the sentence. Moreover, we became aware of a report published in the meantime also showing colocalization of ADAM10 and PrP<sup>C</sup>.

In fact, we think that shed PrP<sup>C</sup> inhibits the conversion to PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in vivo.

Soluble PrP<sup>C</sup> generated by ADAM10-mediated shedding could represent the physiological correlate of this. We speculate that lack of the protease is responsible for efficient PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production in ADAM10 cKO mice whereas increased production of shed PrP<sup>C</sup> in <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice (partially) explains their poor conversion rate (a known phenomenon of the latter mouse model that, to our knowledge, has not been solved to date). Fitting to this concept, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production was decreased in mice moderately overexpressing ADAM10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Endres et al., 2009</xref>). We have newly added this reference in this context in the main text (paragraph six of the Discussion section). As mentioned in our response to the reviewing editor (major point 2) we agree that the crossing of ADAM10 cKO and <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice is an interesting experiment to gain deeper insight.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5D</italic></xref><italic>: The activation of calpain is linked to membrane pores in the text.

This point is addressed in detail below (Reviewer #3, point 8). To answer this specific point: Yes, if correct, our model would suggest that membrane pore formation leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. This is now clarified in the Discussion (eighth paragraph) and in the figure legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>1) In its current form the manuscript has a few areas of weakness that need to be improved. In particular, throughout the manuscript the PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>and PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>levels, the incubation periods, and the spongiosis levels are compared between different mouse lines (A10 cKO, wild-type,</italic> tga20<italic>), different time points (65d, 95d), and different brain regions (forebrain, cerebellum, whole brain), but at present these comparisons are a bit haphazard. It would be great to include a table to assemble all these scattered data into one location. This table would make it easier for the reader to keep track of these differences and better follow the arguments the manuscript makes</italic>.</p><p>We thank this reviewer for the advice of providing a better structure of presented data. For this purpose we have prepared a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) aiming to clarify the distribution of ADAM10 depletion within the brain and to explain our experimental strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As requested by this reviewer we have also included a table (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) summarizing our most important findings with comparison of prion relevant changes for different genotypes, brain regions and time points. Moreover, this figure provides direct reference to the relevant figures presenting original data. We hope that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> improves understanding of our study and makes it more convenient for readers to follow our arguments. The figure is mentioned in the Results section (paragraphs six and seven) as follows:</p><p>“Based on previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Casanova et al., 2001</xref>; Prox et al., 2013a) […] chosen for immunohistochemical or biochemical analyses.”</p><p>and:</p><p>“For better orientation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> […] showing the original data described below.”</p><p><italic>2) Throughout the manuscript a comma is used as the decimal mark. For proper English a full stop should be used instead</italic>.</p><p>We have now corrected this and use a full stop instead.</p><p><italic>3) In several places the A10 cKO results are compared with those that were obtained with mice expressing anchorless PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>(e.g. at the end of the third paragraph of the Introduction, eighth paragraph of the Discussion, etc.). At present the comparison is limited to an anchorless PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>low-expressor mouse line (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28"><italic>Chesebro et al., 2005</italic></xref><italic>), but it would be desirable to also include high-expressor results into this discussion (Stohr et al., 2011). Particularly, since the latter animals express PrP at levels closer to the mouse lines that are used in this study</italic>.</p><p>We have mentioned these mice and referenced this study in the Introduction (end of the third paragraph).</p><p>“High expression of anchorless PrP<sup>C</sup> leads to formation of prions and a late onset neurological disease (Stohr et al., 2011).”</p><p>We also think that it is a good suggestion to mention these mice since this study contributes to our understanding of roles played by anchorless PrP. However, we have refrained from an in depth discussion of these mice since spread of prion pathology in the CNS was not the focus of that study.</p><p><italic>4) The first paragraph of the Results section describes results from a complete ADAM10 knockout mouse line, according to the figure legend the corresponding figures (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C and D</italic></xref><italic>) show only A10 cKO data. This mismatch needs to be cleared up</italic>.</p><p>We are thankful for this hint. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> show data derived from murine embryo fibroblasts (MEF) of a complete ADAM10 knockout (KO) mouse line. We have corrected this in the figure legend and in the labelling of the figure itself. Moreover, the term “ADAM10 cKO” (or “A10 cKO”) is now only used when referring to <italic>Camk2a</italic>-Cre ADAM10 conditional knockout mice.</p><p><italic>5) It is difficult to judge the alleged co-localization of PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>and ADAM10 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C</italic></xref><italic>), since the magnification is so low. Higher resolution images would be needed to make this a convincing argument</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned in our response to Reviewer #1, we now provide higher resolution images of both wild-type control and ADAM10 KO murine embryonic fibroblasts.</p><p><italic>6) The electron micrographs in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4D</italic></xref> <italic>show tubulovesicular structures (TVS), which are claimed to be increased in diseased A10 cKO mice. It would be worthwhile to document and quantify this increase, since TVS and their link to prion disease are controversial. Ultimately, the A10 cKO mice may help to demystify these structures and their role in the prion diseases</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned in our response to Reviewer #1, we did not put a special focus on TVS in our study. Nevertheless, our observation of high abundance of these structures in terminally prion diseased ADAM10 cKO mice (compared to wild-type controls in this study as well as to prion disease models published elsewhere) might be of interest to the prion field. Thus, we decided to devote an entire supplementary figure to the topic of TVS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>). We now also provide quantification, a short description on TVS and more references (paragraphs eleven and twelve of the Results section). We agree with this reviewer that our model “may help to demystify these structures” and ultimately solve their true significance. However, we are fully aware that this would require a much more refined way of analysis.</p><p>With regard to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) we would like to clarify that we introduced a new EM picture showing vacuolization with membranous structures (A). In addition, we modified the scale bars (in the figure and figure legends of B and C) as we became aware of a mistake in the former version of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) The comparison of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>levels between different mouse lines is solely based on PK-resistance (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>). While this surrogate marker is widely used to estimate prion infectivity levels, the possible presence of protease-sensitive forms of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>should be taken into consideration and discussed</italic>.</p><p>Since our data, as discussed above, support an uncoupling of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> amounts and prion infectivity, we followed the suggestion of this reviewer and analyzed our samples for the presence of aberrant, low-abundance or PK sensitive prion forms/fragments. However, we did not find any atypical banding following digestions with “cold PK” (i.e. digestion with 200 µg/ml PK at 4°C for 1 h) or PK dilutions and detection with PrP-specific 1E4 or POM1 antibodies. This is now shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> and mentioned in the Methods (under the subsection “Western blot analysis”) and in the subsection “Enhanced PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation and calpain levels in A10 cKO mice” in Results:</p><p>“There were no atypical PrP patterns as assessed by PK digestion at 4°C (‘cold PK’) or with lower dilutions of PK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p>Moreover, we mentioned this issue in the revised Discussion (seventh paragraph):</p><p>“A10 cKO mice and controls showed identical prion titers, yet elevated levels of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and no evidence for atypical protease-sensitive forms of PrP<sup>Sc</sup>.”</p><p><italic>8) In the conclusions, ADAM10 is being promoted as a potential therapeutic target for prion diseases. The finding that a reduction of ADAM10 leads to a shortening of the incubation period, while its normal function increases the spreading of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup><italic>, suggests a no-win scenario. Hence, a more refined and discerning discussion would be needed to support such a statement</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that the dual role of ADAM10 in prion disease makes therapeutic approaches questionable. Thus, rather than embarking on a lengthy discussion of this topic we preferred to delete this claim in the conclusion of the Discussion (tenth paragraph):</p><p>“Understanding this dual role of ADAM10 in prion disease brings together current concepts of prion biology and might reveal mechanistic insight into important pathophysiological processes.”</p><p><italic>9) Lastly, grammatical errors can be found all the way through the manuscript, a thorough proofreading would benefit the readability of the text</italic>.</p><p>All co-authors have checked the final manuscript again carefully and we have engaged a professional proofreader to eliminate errors.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>1) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4A</italic></xref><italic>, WB analysis of protein expression was compared only in frontal brain homogenates. This needs to be controlled by including whole brain homogenates as well</italic>.</p><p>As demonstrated in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we had chosen to take samples from frontal brain for biochemical analysis while the rest of the brain was taken for in-depth immunohistochemical (IHC) analysis. Thus, unfortunately we are unable to present the requested controls. However, our IHC analysis of PK-resistant material (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) shows similar staining pattern indicating that equal amounts of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> exist at a terminal state of disease in ADAM10 cKO (at ∼103 dpi) and littermate controls (at ∼146 dpi).</p><p><italic>2) In panel C, the GFAP signal of CD1 mock ADAM10 cKO seems higher than the control. Is this image representative? If yes, is there an explanation for this?</italic></p><p>This reviewer has correctly noticed that ADAM10 cKO mice indeed do show a mild gliosis. This has been published before (Prox et al., 2013a) and is indeed representative yet there is no one obvious explanation for this given the multitude of ADAM10 substrate in the brain discussed above. However, in both genotypes a much more dramatic increase in GFAP signal can be observed upon challenge with prions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In panel D: How was the quantification done and what is the relevance of higher numbers of tubulovesicular structures in ADAM10 cKO? Does this bear relevance for the paper at all?</italic></p><p>As requested by this reviewer and already mentioned in our response to reviewers #2 and #3 we now provide quantification, description and references on TVS and more experimental detail (twelfth paragraph of the Results section). Although we are, at this stage, unable to explain the role of increased TVS abundance in ADAM10 cKO mice (which also show increased PrP<sup>Sc</sup> production), we think that this observation might have some relevance to the prion field. As suggested by Reviewer #2 a detailed analysis of these structures “may help to demystify these structures and their role in the prion diseases” in the future. However, since TVS are not the main focus of the current study, we now present this data in a supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) Results related to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>: It would be important to show that the increase of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>levels in forebrain homogenates of ADAM10 cKO is comparable to the overall PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>content of wild type mouse brains. This could underline that the difference resides in the lack of shedding and spreading of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup><italic>, leading to local accumulation of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>in ADAM10 cKO. For this, whole brain homogenates should be compared</italic>.</p><p>We have to admit that this would be an interesting comparison. However, as stated in our response to point 1 and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> we did not consider taking these samples for biochemical analysis when we planned our experimental strategy but rather decided for a detailed immunohistochemical assessment.</p><p><italic>5) As for the results shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>, the comparison of infectivity tests of non-forebrain regions of control and ADAM10 cKO would be important, as it could identify any infectious but non-toxic PrP subpopulations which still might leave PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>aggregates in ADAM10 cKO</italic>.</p><p>We agree with this reviewer that the discrimination of infectious species, toxic entities and protease resistant PrP<sup>Sc</sup> in the framework of prion diseases is an important issue with relevance to the whole field. Although we believe that our observation of an uncoupling of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> and infectivity titers in forebrain samples at 95 dpi might contribute to this ongoing discussion, we again have to admit that our experimental design did not consider the requested experiment (see response to point 1 and 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Nevertheless we did not find evidence for existence of atypical PrP fragments that could correspond to infectivity and explain this uncoupling observed in forebrain samples (as shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1</xref> and mentioned in our response to Reviewer #2, point 7).</p><p><italic>6) Discussion: The authors state that PrP “is a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease”. This is a highly controversial contention propagated by Dr. Strittmatter, and there is more than half-dozen papers out there showing that this idea is, at best, limited to certain animal models. It is the authors' privilege to choose what they wish to believe, and I understand that the charitable interpretation of the Strittmatter paper might add to the perceived importance of the current study, but in fairness they should at least mention the evidence against PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup> <italic>being the Aβ receptor.</italic></p><p>We agree with this reviewer that there is considerable controversy regarding the suggested role of PrP<sup>C</sup> as a receptor for Aβ. This controversy becomes even stronger with regard to the downstream effects of this interaction and their contribution to synaptic impairment and neuronal loss in Alzheimer's disease (AD). For this reason we have now mentioned this scientific dispute and referenced three studies and a close-up article covering this controversy in the Introduction (as we could not find the statement the reviewer referred to in our Discussion):</p><p>“Despite some degree of controversy regarding this receptor function and its relevance in AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Balducci et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Benilova and De Strooper, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Calella et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kessels et al., 2010</xref>), binding of pathogenic oligomers […]” (second paragraph).</p><p>In addition, we have toned down statements in the Abstract (“Moreover, it has been suggested as a receptor mediating neurotoxicity in common neurodegenerative proteinopathies such as Alzheimer’s disease”) and in the conclusion (“In view of a potential role of PrP<sup>C</sup> in Alzheimer's disease…”; last paragraph of the Discussion section). Given that this issue is not of central relevance for our study, we decided to avoid a detailed discussion in the manuscript. However, to the best of our knowledge the majority of studies that have tackled this topic in the meantime (including a study from our own group investigating binding of Aβ to PrP<sup>C</sup> in AD brains; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Dohler et al., 2014</xref>) rather support the role of PrP<sup>C</sup> as a specific binding partner of Aβ.</p><p><italic>7) One problematic point is the following: It is stated that ADAM10 cKO mice show massive neurodegeneration in the forebrain, but not in the cerebellum and brainstem, while controls including</italic> tga20 <italic>show diffuse neurodegeneration. If this is really true, how can one explain completely identical clinical phenotypes?</italic></p><p>We are thankful for this question as it gives us the opportunity to clarify that we did not describe “completely identical phenotypes”. In fact, <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice show a much more rapid progression of clinical signs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fischer et al., 1996</xref>). While most of those signs were indeed comparable between ADAM10 cKO, wild-type control and <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice, we rarely observed kyphosis and ungroomed fur in the latter. In contrast to the other experimental groups, almost all <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice developed a hind leg paresis. This might be related to the cerebellar pathology found in these mice (although this remains speculative). Nevertheless, we have added the data for <italic>tg</italic>a<italic>20</italic> mice in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and comparisons between genotypes and brain regions are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Fig. 3B</xref> (as requested by Reviewer #2).</p><p><italic>8) As for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, the total amount of calpain is most certainly irrelevant to neurodegeneration, since calpains are mostly inactive in the absence of raised intracellular calcium. What matters is the amount of activated calpains. This can be assessed by investigating the amount of cleavage of a calpain substrate, such as spectrin (alpha-fodrin). The mere detection of calpains by Western blot is irrelevant. The whole argument about calpains needs to be revisited by activity measurements, or else it should be deleted in toto. This becomes painfully evident by the authors' finding that on the one hand there is prion toxicity (allegedly through calpain) with profound neurodegeneration in the forebrain of ADAM10 cKO, but on the other hand the significantly faster disease in</italic> tga20 <italic>mice goes along with significantly less calpain Also, a comparison of overall (not only forebrain) calpain activity levels to mock inoculated animals could help.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we have performed additional experiments and changed the manuscript text to address the points raised here.</p><p>Importantly we showed that increase of calpain expression in ADAM10 cKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) is specifically seen in prion disease since we could not detect differences in calpain level between non-infected ADAM10 cKO and controls. Thus, although calpain activity is of course the most relevant readout these specific differences deserve to be mentioned.</p><p>We used prion-infected mice in most experiments and their tissues have to be handled in a biosafety level 3* laboratory due to governmental regulation. Given this, sophisticated measurements to assess calpain activity (Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging or detection of fluorogenic substrates) were not possible. As mentioned above and described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> all biochemical analyses had to be done on forebrain because the other reasons were used for morphological analysis.</p><p>Nevertheless, we followed the advice of this reviewer and detected spectrin. Additionally we decided to detect p35, another calpain substrate implicated in neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2000</xref>). Full-length versions of both proteins appeared reduced in ADAM10 cKO. This decrease was not accompanied by increased levels of cleavage products, which may be due to technical reasons.</p><p>Thus, this point remains to be further investigated. We have included these data in the Results section (seventeenth paragraph), in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B, C</xref>, and we have toned down our statements in the Abstract, Discussion and in the description of our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>):</p><p>“This is specific for prion disease as no differences were detected in non-prion infected ADAM10 cKO mice (mean: 0.90 ±0.26 SEM; n=4) when compared to age-matched wild-type controls (set to 1 ±0.19; n=5; <italic>p</italic>=0.7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6-figure supplement 2A</xref>). In prion disease, we observed a reduction of the described calpain substrates spectrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Falsig et al., 2012</xref>) and neuron-specific activator p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lee et al., 2000</xref>) suggesting that increased expression in ADAM10 cKO mice correlated with activity of calpain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B,C</xref>). However, it should be noted that we failed to detect differences in specific cleavage products of spectrin and p35.”</p><p><italic>9) When mentioning the possible inhibition of PrP</italic><sup><italic>Sc</italic></sup> <italic>formation by shedded PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup><italic>, it would be desirable to prove this statement with PMCA + shed PrP</italic><sup><italic>C</italic></sup>.</p><p>We agree that a PMCA-based assessment of the role of shed PrP<sup>C</sup> on PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation would be a desirable addition to the paper. However, obtaining quantities of physiologically shed PrP<sup>C</sup> (and its purification) necessary for this method is not trivial. Usage of recombinant PrP has other disadvantages and does not fully recapitulate the in vivo situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al, 2009</xref>). This reference has now been added in the Discussion part covering the inhibition of PrP<sup>Sc</sup> formation by anchorless PrP versions (sixth paragraph). Thus, we have decided to address this in more detail in a separate study.</p><p><italic>10) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1E</italic></xref><italic>, POM2 is named as the applied antibody, while the Methods section describes POM1 for this purpose</italic>.</p><p>This mismatch has been corrected.
