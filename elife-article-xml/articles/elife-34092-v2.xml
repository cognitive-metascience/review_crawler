Once translocated across the membrane, surface proteins are covalently linked to cell wall peptidoglycan via sortase A-catalyzed cleavage at the LPXTG motif of C-terminal sorting signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneewind et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schneewind et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazmanian et al., 1999</xref>). Some, but not all surface proteins are secreted at septal membranes and incorporated into cross-wall peptidoglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole and Hahn, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>). Following division and separation of spherical daughter cells, cross-wall anchored surface proteins are displayed over large segments of the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeDent et al., 2007</xref>). Cross-wall trafficking of surface proteins requires a signal peptide with YSIRK/GXXS motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>). The YSIRK/GXXS motif is positioned N-terminal of the hydrophobic core, common to all signal peptide precursors traveling the Sec pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emr et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emr et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">von Heijne, 1986</xref>).</p><p>Gram-positive bacteria rely on cell wall-anchored surface proteins for adherence to host tissues, evasion from host immune responses and acquisition of host-specific nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foster et al., 2014</xref>). Surface proteins with YSIRK/GXXS signal peptides are produced with high abundance and fulfill essential virulence functions during infection. For example, staphylococcal protein A (SpA) is well known for its attribute of binding to host immunoglobulin and disrupting adaptive immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forsgren and Sjöquist, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2016</xref>). SpA is synthesized as a precursor with an N-terminal YSIRK/GXXS signal peptide and a C-terminal LPXTG motif sorting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahmsén et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneewind et al., 1992</xref>). After initiation into the secretion pathway, the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahmsén et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schallenberger et al., 2012</xref>). Sortase A recognizes the LPXTG motif of the sorting signal, cleaves the polypeptide between the threonine (T) and the glycine (G) of the LPXTG motif and forms an acyl-enzyme intermediate with the C-terminal threonine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazmanian et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ton-That et al., 1999</xref>). The acyl-enzyme is resolved by the nucleophilic attack of the amino-group of the pentaglycine crossbridge within lipid II, the precursor for peptidoglycan synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ton-That et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perry et al., 2002</xref>). The product of this reaction, surface protein linked to lipid II, is then incorporated into peptidoglycan via the transglycosylation and transpeptidation reactions of cell wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ton-That et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ton-That and Schneewind, 1999</xref>).</p><p>Newly synthesized SpA is secreted into the cross-wall compartment, bounded by septal membranes of burgeoning cells during division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeDent et al., 2007</xref>). Upon completion of peptidoglycan synthesis within the cross-wall, its peptidoglycan layer is split (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frankel et al., 2011</xref>). The adjacent cells separate and assume a spherical shape, resulting in SpA display on the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeDent et al., 2007</xref>). Staphylococci divide perpendicular to previous cell division planes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tzagoloff and Novick, 1977</xref>). By incorporating secreted polypeptides into newly synthesized cross-walls, staphylococci distribute SpA and other sortase A-anchored products over the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>). However, not all sortase-anchored products traffic to septal membranes. Those that are secreted at polar membranes are also anchored to peptidoglycan but are not distributed over the bacterial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>). In <italic>S. aureus</italic> strain Newman, thirteen different sortase-anchored surface proteins and four additional proteins are endowed with YSIRK/GXXS signal peptides for septal secretion: lipase (Lip), glycerol-ester hydrolase (Geh), murein hydrolase LytN and the cell size determinant Ebh (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Götz, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frankel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms supporting YSIRK/GXXS precursor secretion at septal membranes are not known. Here we show that the signal peptide of SpA is cleaved at the YSIRK/GXXS motif. Amino acid substitutions in the SpA signal peptide that affect cleavage at the YSIRK/GXXS motif also impair septal secretion. When used as bait for the isolation of the secretion machinery, SpA Ser<sup>18</sup>Leu (S18L) precursor co-purified with SecA, SecDF and LtaS. We studied the contribution of these factors towards protein A secretion into the cross-wall compartment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SpA signal peptide variants</title><p>To facilitate the analysis of signal peptide mutants, we generated SpA<sub>ED</sub>, a variant of protein A that is truncated for its C-terminal immunoglobulin binding domains, region X (Xr) and the LPXTG sorting signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). <italic>S. aureus</italic> WY110 (Δ<italic>spa</italic>Δ<italic>sbi</italic>, pSpA<sub>ED</sub>) cultures expressing <italic>spa<sub>ED</sub></italic> were fractionated into culture supernatant (S) and bacterial pellet (P) and analyzed by immunoblotting. SpA<sub>ED</sub> was found in the extracellular medium; its precursor species was detected in the bacterial pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bc</xref>). Site-directed mutagenesis was used to generate short deletions and amino acid substitutions in the signal peptide of SpA<sub>ED</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Deletion of the YSIRK motif (ΔYSIRK) diminished the abundance of the SpA<sub>ED/ΔYSIRK</sub> precursor and its processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Single amino acid substitutions at two positions in the YSIRK motif (I9S and R10A) resulted in precursor accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). Further, the R10A variant exhibited diminished secretion and accumulated a precursor species that migrated faster on SDS-PAGE than the full-length precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bc</xref>). Amino acid substitution at lysine 11 (K11A) of the YSIRK motif had no effect on SpA<sub>ED/K11A</sub> precursor processing and secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bc</xref>). Deletion of GIAS (ΔGIAS) or of the two variable residues in the GXXS motif (ΔIA) caused precursor accumulation and blocked precursor processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1bc</xref>). Substitution of glycine 15 (G15L) reduced the abundance of SpA<sub>ED/G15L</sub> and led to the accumulation of a unique precursor species that migrated faster on SDS-PAGE than full-length precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).

The SpA<sub>ED</sub> precursor was found in the cytoplasm and membrane, whereas mature product was secreted into the culture supernatant (S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Precursors of the SpA<sub>ED/ΔIA</sub> and SpA<sub>ED/R10A</sub> variants accumulated mostly in the cytoplasm, whereas the SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursor was located predominantly in the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2ab</xref>). Pulse-labeling experiments revealed that wild-type SpA<sub>ED</sub> precursor was processed within 60 s into mature, secreted product (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). In contrast, processing of the SpA<sub>ED/ΔIA</sub>, SpA<sub>ED/R10A</sub> and SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursors was delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). To test whether signal peptide variations affect trafficking of full-length SpA, mutations that encode the ΔIA, R10A and S18L amino acid changes were introduced into wild-type <italic>spa</italic>. Wild-type and mutant staphylococci were treated with trypsin to remove all surface proteins from the bacterial surface and incubated for 20 min to allow for cell wall deposition of newly synthesized SpA. To localize SpA, bacteria were viewed by fluorescence microscopy after labeling with SpA-specific monoclonal antibody and Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated secondary IgG (red) and with BODIPY FL-vancomycin (green), which binds to cell wall peptidoglycan. As expected, wild-type SpA was assembled in the cross-wall compartment, whereas SpA<sub>SP-SasF</sub>, a protein A variant that is secreted via a canonical (non-YSIRK/GXXS) signal peptide, was deposited into peripheral segments of the cell wall envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>).

Earlier work demonstrated that the YSIRK/GXXS motif of the SpA precursor is dispensable for sortase-catalyzed cell wall anchoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae and Schneewind, 2003</xref>). However, precursors with YSIRK/GXXS motif signal peptides are targeted for secretion at septal membranes and sortase-mediated deposition into the cross wall compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>).

We show that the YSIRK/GXXS signal peptide of SpA is cleaved between Leu<sup>12</sup> and Gly<sup>13</sup>, separating the YSIRK sequence from the GXXS motif and from the remainder of the signal peptide. Amino acid substitutions and deletions that affect precursor cleavage and secretion map to three of the four residues (underlined) that are strictly conserved in the YS<underline>IR</underline>K/<underline>G</underline>XX<underline>S</underline> motif: Ile<sup>9</sup>, Arg<sup>10</sup> and Ser<sup>18</sup>. Substitution of the fourth residue, Gly<sup>15</sup>, with Leu resulted in diminished abundance of precursor substrate and secreted product and in accumulation of a cleaved precursor species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). On the basis of these observations, we are compelled to speculate that YSIRK/GXXS motif cleavage may represent a mechanism for precursor translocation at septal membranes. For example, the YSIRK/GXXS motif may inhibit a key function of the adjacent hydrophobic core within signal peptides: promoting the membrane translocation of precursors. Such inhibitory mechanism could be relieved by a YSIRK/GXXS protease that localizes to the septal membrane. Other mechanisms of proteolytic control for YSIRK/GXXS mediated signal peptide function can also be thought of. Importantly, the discovery of two sequential proteolytic events, YSIRK/GXXS motif cleavage and the signal peptidase-mediated cut provide experimental opportunities for the testing of predictive models. SpA precursors were also cut between Gly<sup>22</sup> and Thr<sup>23</sup>, a site that is located within the hydrophobic core of the signal peptide. Mass spectrometry analysis of the <italic>S. aureus</italic> COL secretome also identified signal peptide fragments that had been generated by cleavage in the hydrophobic core, including SpA signal peptides cleaved between Gly<sup>22</sup> and Thr<sup>23</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ravipaty and Reilly, 2010</xref>). The significance of signal peptide cleavage in the hydrophobic core is not known, as amino acid substitutions preventing such proteolysis have not be studied for their effect on protein secretion or membrane integrity. We presume that cleavage at Gly<sup>22</sup>/Thr<sup>23</sup> may not be related to septal secretion. Cleavage at the hydrophobic core may enable staphylococci to remove the products of processed signal peptides from the membrane. For example, products of degradative proteolysis have been observed during processing of SpA LPXTG motif sorting signal, which is cleaved between Thr (T) and Gly (G) and within the hydrophobic core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarre and Schneewind, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Precursors with amino acid substitutions or deletions in the YSIRK/GXXS motif are thought to accumulate in septal membranes, however these variants typically exhibit diminished secretion and cell wall anchoring in the cross wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">DeDent et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yu and Götz, 2012</xref>). Our observations corroborate these findings and suggest that not all features of the YSIRK/GXXS motif are required for precursor targeting to septal membranes. We took advantage of the SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursor and used affinity chromatography to purify crosslinked proteins. Several crosslinked proteins were already known to be located in septal membranes (PBP2, EzrA, LtaS), consistent with SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursor accumulation in this compartment. Among the crosslinked proteins are two components of the secretion machinery, SecA and SecDF, as well as LtaS, which catalyzes the synthesis of lipoteichoic acid in septal membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tsirigotaki et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Percy and Gründling, 2014</xref>). SecA appears to bind directly to the signal peptide of SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub>. The resulting complex may even engage SecYEG translocase as well as SecDF. However, due to the S18L substitution SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursors cannot efficiently enter the septal secretion pathway. It seems unlikely that LtaS may directly interact with SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub>. We think it is plausible that SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> complexed with SecA and SecYEG at septal membranes can be crosslinked to other septal proteins.</p><p>The subcellular localization of the Sec apparatus has been examined in streptococci, enterococci and in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>.

Nevertheless, <italic>secDF</italic> is not essential for septal targeting or secretion of SpA precursors. In contrast, cells depleted for SecA, accumulate SpA precursors that cannot traffic to septal membranes in the cytoplasm. Finally, LtaS-depleted staphylococci are unable to synthesize lipoteichoic acid and cannot direct precursors to the septal area. Instead, SpA is directed to polar membranes. We have incorporated these observations into a model whereby septal accumulation of LtaS and of lipoteichoic acids functions as a determinant for SecA-mediated targeting of SpA precursors. Following precursor cleavage at the YSIRK/GXXS motif, truncated SpA (SpA-2) is moved across the membrane, aided by the proton-motif force and by the chaperone activity of SecDF. Once translocated, SpA is cleaved by signal peptidase to generate SpA-4 and by sortase at the LPXTG motif of its C-terminal sorting signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navarre and Schneewind, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ton-That et al., 1999</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Richard Novick (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is very thorough and detailed analysis of the role of the YSIRK/GXXS motif in septal secretion in staphylococci and, by implication, in other /gram-positive bacteria. It will add substantively to our understanding of protein secretion in the organisms.</p><p>Two reviewers carefully read and commented on the manuscript. Revisions should be straightforward. Reviewer 3 has three major concerns, which I anticipate you will be able to address. The first of these concerns is a sort of organizational issue. Dr. Novick has posed two questions, which you might want to address in your revised manuscript. Normally, we would consolidate the reviews into one document indicating essential revisions, but everything seems to be very straightforward here and we are just including the two reviews in their entirety.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is very thorough and detailed analysis of the role of the YSIRK/GXXS motif in septal secretion in staphylococci and, by implication, in other /gram-positive bacteria. It will add substantively to our understanding of protein secretion in the organisms.</p><p>I have only a few suggestions for improvement of the paper, plus 2 major questions, of which the answers would add nicely to the presentation (but are not really required): why is SecA required for growth, and which proteases catalyze the cleavages within the signal peptide?</p><p>Abstract and the last paragraph of the Introduction – confusing and difficult to understand; does not really convey a clear message – should be rewritten.</p><p>Introduction, first paragraph – are all proteins with the YSIRK/GXXS motif trafficked to the septal membrane?</p><p>Introduction, second paragraph – &quot;relieved&quot;? Replace with &quot;cleaved&quot; or &quot;disrupted&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “SpA signal peptide variants defective for septal secretion”, first paragraph – is the nature of this faster-moving precursor known?</p><p>Subsection “SpA signal peptide variants defective for septal secretion”, last paragraph – delete &quot;encoding the&quot; and &quot;variants&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “SpA signal peptide variants defective for septal secretion”, last paragraph – explain &quot;SpASP-SasF&quot;.</p><p>Subsection “Processing of SpA signal peptide variants” – the hydrophobic portion of staphylococcal signal peptides have been observed to serve as sex pheromones promoting conjugation with enterococci. Could this be the role of the peptide produced by this cleavage? What protease is responsible for the YSIRK/GXXS cleavage?</p><p>Subsection “SecA depletion in <italic>S. aureus</italic>” – Figure 5B does not appear to show the patterns described in the text – e.g. there is no growth arrest of secA-depleted cells, and it is noted later that there is residual SecA is present. These points should be made consistent.</p><p>Subsection “SecA depletion blocks SpA secretion”, last paragraph – any idea why secA mutants are defective for growth? Could it be required for cell division as perhaps suggested by the observations described in the last paragraph of the subsection “Localization of SecA and SpA precursors in staphylococci”?.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The gap in knowledge that this study aims to address is: How are YSIRK/GXXS-containing proteins directed to the septal membrane for localized secretion? The authors identify YSIRK/GXXS signal peptide interacting partners and create a beautiful series of conditional mutant strains in order to query the role of a subset of those interacting partners in SpA septal targeting. Overall, the experimental design and execution was very nice and I especially appreciated the abundance of controls at every stage.</p><p>The major findings in this study are 1) SpA signal peptide variant interacts with SecA and LtaS, and 2) SecA or LtaS depletion results in SpA not at the septum but diffuse around the cell in the case of SecA – and polar in the case of LtaS (Figure 8 and 10).</p><p>Secondary findings in this study are 1) the identification of SpA signal sequence residues that are important for precursor processing and SpA secretion, 2) cleavage sites within the SpA signal sequence, and 3) the unsurprising report that depletion of SecA or deletion of SecDF result in reduced secretion of several secreted proteins.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>While the cumulative data in the paper support the title that SpA septal secretion requires SecA, there are numerous instances earlier in the paper, before the key data to support this are shown (in Figure 8) where statements to this effect are made. For example, the first section title indicates SpA signal peptide variants are defective for septal secretion when the data presented in this section only support a general secretion phenotype. There are other premature examples of this and I found it confusing and later misleading. I suggest this be modified throughout the manuscript.</p><p>The crosslinking and pulldown experiments used a mutant SpA precursor that appears to accumulate at higher levels than WT in general, and accumulates at the septum. While (I think) I understand the rationale for using this construct for pulldowns (they are enriched at the septum so interactions are more likely), I wonder if it could lead to 'forced' interactions and/or miss other interactions with wild type SpAED. Did the authors also try using SpAED? What happened? Can these interactions be validated in the absence of crosslinks (either for the mutant or WT signal sequence) by bacterial two hybrid or another method, to confirm if they are direct or indirect interactions? And why were SecA, SecDF, and LtaS singled out for further analysis?</p><p>I am puzzled by the data presented in Figure 7 and 8: on one hand, SecA is everywhere (Figure 7), but upon depletion (albeit the conditions used here are unclear) SpA becomes diffuse (presumably in the membrane?) (Figure 8). Since the cells don't look sick (as in Figure 6D), this must be a mild SecA depletion. So the residual SecA is presumably everywhere in the membrane, but is not interacting with SpA at the septum? Why not? What provides the specificity for this localized interaction? Why does YSIRK/GXXS interact with only a subset of SecA molecules at the septum when SecA is everywhere? This key question remains unclear to me.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34092.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have only a few suggestions for improvement of the paper, plus 2 major questions, of which the answers would add nicely to the presentation (but are not really required): why is SecA required for growth?</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>E. coli, secA</italic> is required for bacterial growth because the sum of all secreted proteins contributes to bacterial replication.

Could this be the role of the peptide produced by this cleavage? What protease is responsible for the YSIRK/GXXS cleavage?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer refers to beautiful work in <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic>, where Eep, a membrane zinc-metalloprotease, cleaves signal peptides of lipoprotein precursors into short hydrophobic peptides that are subsequently dislodged from the membrane by an ABC transporter and function as pheromones to induce the transfer of conjugative plasmids by specific donors. The corresponding zinc-metalloprotease in <italic>S. aureus</italic> is designated RseP. We already know that RseP is not involved in the cleavage of the YSIRK-GXXS signal peptides (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We believe this makes sense, as the signal peptides of lipoproteins do not share sequence similarity with the YSIRK-GXXS signal peptide. Earlier work demonstrated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> produces pheromone peptides for mating with <italic>E. faecalis</italic>, however the corresponding peptides are not derived from precursors with YSIRK-GXXS signal peptides. Thus, RseP/Eep is not involved in cleaving YSIRK-GXXS signal peptides and the cleavage products of YSIRK-GXXS signal peptides are not thought to function as pheromone signals for mating. We have introduced some of these arguments in the Discussion (last paragraph) to explain the seemingly parallel events between the two signal peptide cleavage systems.

For example, the first section title indicates SpA signal peptide variants are defective for septal secretion when the data presented in this section only support a general secretion phenotype. There are other premature examples of this and I found it confusing and later misleading. I suggest this be modified throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concerns and have modified the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The crosslinking and pulldown experiments used a mutant SpA precursor that appears to accumulate at higher levels than WT in general, and accumulates at the septum. While (I think) I understand the rationale for using this construct for pulldowns (they are enriched at the septum so interactions are more likely), I wonder if it could lead to 'forced' interactions and/or miss other interactions with wild type SpAED. Did the authors also try using SpAED? What happened? Can these interactions be validated in the absence of crosslinks (either for the mutant or WT signal sequence) by bacterial two hybrid or another method, to confirm if they are direct or indirect interactions? And why were SecA, SecDF, and LtaS singled out for further analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised two excellent points. First, is it possible to capture physiological interactions between a substrate (here the secretion substrate, i.e. YSIRK-GXXS signal peptide bearing precursor) and a catalyst (here the translocation machinery, minimally composed of SecA and SecYEG)? We presume most enzymologists would answer such query with “depends on the rate of catalysis”. Translocation, similar to translation, is thought to be fast: it takes seconds to translocate a precursor several hundred residues in length. One might therefore presume that the answer to such query is “no”. This did not prevent us from trying. Using affinity chromatography of wild-type SpA<sub>ED</sub> solubilized from membranes to enrich for precursors in cells with or without crosslinker and analyzing eluates by immunoblotting for the presence of SpA<sub>ED</sub> and SecA, identified the former but not the latter (see revised Figure 4).</p><p>Second, can one study a model substrate (precursor) that gets stuck in the membrane? Beckwith and colleagues studied MalE precursor fused β-galactosidase and demonstrated that the hybrid, once initiated into the Sec pathway, got stuck in the membrane, blocking the secretion of other precursors. The Beckwith lab used MalE-LacZ toxicity for genetic analyses of the secretory pathway; we suppose they could have also used a biochemical approach to isolate secretion machinery components alongside the arrested substrate. This was the experimental approach by Gottfried Schatz and colleagues, utilizing an impassable substrate (DHFR hybrids) to isolate components of the mitochondrial protein import machinery.</p><p>We elected for a different experimental path: isolating signal peptide mutants that are defective for precursor secretion. Emr and Silhavy used this approach to identify mutations in the coding sequence for the signal peptide of <italic>E. coli lamB</italic>; LamB is an outer membrane porin responsible for diffusion of maltodextrins into the bacterial periplasm. Similar to Silhavy and colleagues, we identified point mutants in the signal peptide of SpA<sub>ED</sub> that were arrested in secretion. As we cannot apply selection to isolate genetic suppressors in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, we used the biochemical approach of Schatz and colleagues to isolate secretion machinery components that co-purified with the SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursor. Of course, the reviewer is correct with his inquiry that interactions with the mutant signal peptide should be stable, i.e. they should not require a crosslinking reagent. To test this, we performed the affinity chromatography experiment with and without crosslinker. Following affinity chromatography of SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursor and analysis of eluates via immunoblotting, we observed in the revised Figure 4 that SecA co-purifies with SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> both in the presence and in the absence of the crosslinking agent.</p><p>Why were only SecA, SecDF and LtaS chosen for further analysis? We analyzed the mass spectrometry data for candidates that we presumed were likely to be involved in the secretion of SpA<sub>ED</sub> either because they are known components of the protein secretion pathway (SecA/YEG/DF) or because they are located within septal membranes. In addition to LtaS, we analyzed also EzrA, PBP2, ClpB, ClpC, SAOUHSC_01854 (unknown function), SAOUHSC_02423 (UDP-N-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase), SAOUHSC_01583 (conserved hypothetical phage protein), PurL, ClpB, PknB (serine/threonine protein kinase), RseB, and SAOUHSC_02406. However, in addition to <italic>secA</italic> and <italic>secDF</italic>, the <italic>ltaS</italic> depletion strain was the only mutant strain that exhibited a phenotype in septal secretion of SecA. We added a supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) and edited the text to illustrate our experimental plans and reasoning.</p><p>We did not use bacterial two hybrid studies to ask whether or not there are direct interactions between SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> precursor and SecA, SecDF or LtaS. SecA is known to bind to the signal peptides of precursor proteins; this will likely include the SpA precursor. SecDF acts on unfolded polypeptides emerging from the secretory pathway (SecYEG), not on folded proteins purified by affinity chromatography. Our mass spectrometry analysis detected small amounts of SecDF, likely because SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> associates not only with SecA but also with SecYEG/DF. We presume that LtaS does not directly interact with SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub>. SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub> complexed with SecA may associate with LtaS following DDM solubilization of septal membranes. We modified the manuscript to make these points clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am puzzled by the data presented in Figure 7 and 8: on one hand, SecA is everywhere (Figure 7), but upon depletion (albeit the conditions used here are unclear) SpA becomes diffuse (presumably in the membrane?) (Figure 8). Since the cells don't look sick (as in Figure 6D), this must be a mild SecA depletion. So the residual SecA is presumably everywhere in the membrane, but is not interacting with SpA at the septum? Why not? What provides the specificity for this localized interaction? Why does YSIRK/GXXS interact with only a subset of SecA molecules at the septum when SecA is everywhere? This key question remains unclear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>On the SecA observations, as is discussed in our first response to reviewer #2, SecA function is required for <italic>E. coli</italic> or <italic>S. aureus</italic> growth, but not SecA protein. Thus, after 3 hours of depletion, SecA is no longer detected yet SecA-depleted cells have not yet ceased growth. Nevertheless, SecA activity is diminished after 3 hours of depletion. After 6 hours of SecA-depletion, as secreted products are being degraded and cannot be replenished, <italic>S. aureus</italic> WY223 ceases growth, cells become bloated and eventually die. We show that in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, SecA associates with all membranes, i.e. SecA-GFP is not restricted to septal membranes, as microscopic localization studies reveal the presence of the protein in the vicinity of all membranes. However, Figure 8 shows that SpA, which requires SecA for secretion, can only be secreted at septal membranes by cells with active SecA. We infer from these data that SpA precursor (SpA<sub>ED/S18L</sub>) associates with SecA, however SecA-SpA complexes are only translocated at septal membranes, presumably because these membranes harbor a protease that removes the YSIRK-GXXS peptide, thereby allowing processed SpA to advance along the secretory pathway. What chemical feature defines septal membranes? We propose the production of lipoteichoic acid is the key chemical feature marking septal membranes for YSIRK/GXXS precursor translocation. In the absence of SecA, SpA precursors associate with all membranes, however they cannot traffic to septal membranes and be translocated at this site because they cannot enter the secretory pathway.</p></body></sub-article></article>
