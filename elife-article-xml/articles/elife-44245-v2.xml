We demonstrate that these distinct responses can be B-cell-intrinsic and essentially independent of B-cell receptor (BCR) isotypes. Furthermore, we find that the development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells in the primary immune response requires follicular helper T cells, a relatively strong CD40 signal and a high-affinity BCR on B cells, whereas the development of CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells does not. Quantitative differences in CD40 stimulation were enough to recapitulate the distinct B cell fate decisions in an in vitro culture system. The quantity of CD40 signaling appears to be translated into NF-κB activation, followed by BATF upregulation that promotes B<sub>mem</sub> cell differentiation from GC B cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>memory B cells</kwd><kwd>germinal center</kwd><kwd>plasma cells</kwd><kwd>immune response</kwd><kwd>recall response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16H05206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kitamura</surname><given-names>Daisuke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unveiling a mechanism for the fate decision of B-cell differentiation into two functionally distinct memory B cell subsets.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Memory B (B<sub>mem</sub>) cells are crucial for humoral immunity, preventing the spread of re-infecting viruses and bacteria by rapidly producing large amounts of class-switched antibodies (Abs) against these pathogens. B<sub>mem</sub> cells also regenerate themselves with improved affinity for their cognate antigen through the germinal center (GC) reaction upon each iterative infection. The rapid and exaggerated response of B<sub>mem</sub> cells has been attributed to their B-cell receptor (BCR) isotype, namely membrane-bound IgG (mIgG). The relatively long cytoplasmic tail of mIgG, as compared to that of membrane-bound IgM (mIgM) which consists of only three amino acids, contains specific motifs that recruit signaling molecules such as Grb2 and SAP97 after BCR cross-linking; these motifs and molecules are required for enhanced BCR signaling and plasma cell (PC) formation upon rechallenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Engels et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kaisho et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lutz et al., 2015</xref>). At odds with this model is the finding that naïve B cells expressing NP-specific mIgG1, which were derived from cloned mice generated from a single IgG1<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cell, expanded to a similar extent as NP-specific (IgH-knock-in) IgM<sup>+</sup> naïve B cells, and both B cell types predominantly differentiated into GC B cells rather than PCs upon primary immunization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>). These observations suggest that the heightened capacity of B<sub>mem</sub> cells to differentiate into PCs cannot be attributed solely to the expression of mIgG1, but also depends on some cell-intrinsic status, such as a reduced expression of Bach2, a transcription factor that suppresses PC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>). In support of this notion, human B<sub>mem</sub> cells differentiate into PCs better than do naïve B cells in antigen-free in vitro cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arpin et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>As a further refinement in our understanding of the functional properties of B<sub>mem</sub> cells, it has recently been proposed that the B<sub>mem</sub> cell pool can be divided into distinct subsets on the basis of their potential to generate PCs or GC B cells upon antigen encounter. Earlier reports indicated that B<sub>mem</sub> cells consist of mIgG<sup>+</sup> cells and mIgM<sup>+</sup> cells, with the former prone to becoming PCs and the latter GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dogan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pape et al., 2011</xref>), although a recent report suggests a more complex scenario (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McHeyzer-Williams et al., 2015</xref>). Another study proposed that functionally different subsets can be phenotypically defined using surface markers, CD80 and PD-L2: CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells are prone to differentiate into PCs, whereas CD80<sup>−</sup> PD-L2<sup>−</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells preferentially form GC upon secondary immunization, and CD80<sup>−</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells are intermediate between the two but functionally closer to the CD80<sup>−</sup> PD-L2<sup>−</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014</xref>). Consistent with the BCR-isotype-based classification, the majority of IgG1<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells had the CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> phenotype, whereas IgM<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells were dominated by CD80<sup>−</sup> PD-L2<sup>−</sup> cells. In addition, CD73 has been used to further dissect the PC-prone subpopulation as CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> CD73<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Circulating memory T cells have also been functionally divided into two subsets termed effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells. T<sub>EM</sub> cells, which lack the lymph node homing receptors CD62L and CCR7, produce abundant effector cytokines and cytotoxic granules, whereas T<sub>CM</sub> cells expressing both CD62L and CCR7 have a greater potential for proliferation and self-renewal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). The PC-prone B<sub>mem</sub> cells may resemble the T<sub>EM</sub> cells in terms of their effector function, whereas the GC-B cell-prone B<sub>mem</sub> cells are similar to the self-renewable T<sub>CM</sub> cells.</p><p>At present, it is not clear how these two subsets diverge during the primary immune response. It has been reported that CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells have the highest affinity for antigen, whereas the double negative cells have the lowest affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tomayko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, it is generally accepted that B cells expressing BCR of higher affinity are prone to differentiate into PCs and those of lower affinity into GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ochiai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sciammas et al., 2011</xref>). Together with the analysis of the frequency of BCR somatic mutations and the timing of B<sub>mem</sub> cell generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weisel et al., 2016</xref>), it has been suggested that PC-prone B<sub>mem</sub> cells, including IgG1<sup>+</sup> and CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, are mainly derived from the GC, whereas most of GC-B cell-prone B<sub>mem</sub> cells, including IgM<sup>+</sup> and CD80<sup>−</sup> PD-L2<sup>−</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, are generated before GC formation. It remains unclear, however, which signals determine the distinct B<sub>mem</sub> cell fates. Thus, we sought to define the signaling mechanism for the bifurcated generation of B<sub>mem</sub> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> memory B cells</title><p>On the basis of previous reports showing that IgG1<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells are mainly composed of CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> and CD80<sup>–</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells and that CD80<sup>–</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> and CD80<sup>–</sup> PD-L2<sup>–</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells are functionally similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014</xref>), we hypothesized that the proposed B<sub>mem</sub> cell subsets could be distinguished simply by the expression of CD80, as CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells.

However, these in vivo experiments cannot exclude the possibility that some other factors that are affected by the CD40/CD40L manipulation might contribute to the fate decision. In order to demonstrate a direct contribution of CD40 signaling quantity in B cells, we utilized our in vitro induced GC B (iGB) cell culture system, in which naïve B cells massively proliferate, efficiently switch to IgG1, and differentiate into GC-like B (iGB) cells after being cultured with IL-4 on a feeder layer of 40LB cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nojima et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, these iGB cells differentiate into memory-like B cells [termed induced memory B (iMB) cells] in vivo when transferred into irradiated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nojima et al., 2011</xref>). To stimulate B cells through CD40 at different levels in this in vitro system, we derived 40LB sublines that express CD40L at low, intermediate and high levels, termed 40LB-lo, 40LB-mid, and 40LB-hi, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As expected, B cells cultured on 40LB-hi (iGB-hi cells) expressed the highest level of CD80, whereas those on 40LB-mid (iGB-mid cells) or 40LB-lo (iGB-lo cells) exhibited intermediate or the lowest levels of CD80 expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). The iGB-hi, iGB-mid and iGB-lo cells underwent class switching to IgG1 or IgE to similar extents and were mostly CD138<sup>–</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). It is of note that the iGB-lo cells expressed Fas at a lower level than iGB-hi and iGB-mid cells, whereas they expressed CD38 and CD62L at higher levels than iGB-hi and iGB-mid cells, perhaps reflecting their relatively lower activation status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44245.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The quantity of CD40 signaling determines the differentiation of B cells into distinct B<sub>mem</sub> cell subsets.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Expression of CD40L on 3T3-BAFF cells and 40LB sublines (40LB-lo, 40LB-mid, and 40LB-hi) was analyzed by FCM.

The B cells derived from all of these iGB cells were mostly CD38<sup>+</sup> (iMB) cells and contained similar percentages of IgG1<sup>+</sup> cells. However, the iMB cells derived from iGB-hi cells (iMB-hi cells) contained almost exclusively CD80<sup>hi</sup> cells, whereas iMB cells from iGB-lo cells (iMB-lo cells) were dominated by CD80<sup>lo</sup> cells, irrespective of their BCR isotypes (IgG1<sup>+</sup> or IgG1<sup>–</sup>). iMB cells derived from iGB-mid cells exhibited an intermediate phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d,e</xref>). In addition, iMB-hi cells expressed PD-L2, CD73 and FAS at higher levels than iMB-lo cells, whereas both expressed equally low levels of GL7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). Thus, iMB-hi and iMB-lo cells phenotypically resembled CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, respectively, that are generated in a physiological immune response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>).</p><p>iGB-hi cells grow far more extensively than iGB-lo cells beyond two days of culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). As cell cycling may cause epigenetic and transcriptional changes, it is possible that different cell cycles caused by different CD40 signaling strength affected the bifurcated B<sub>mem</sub> cell development. To address this issue, iMB cells were generated by transferring iGB-lo and iGB-hi cells on day 2 of culturing, when these cells had expanded to similar levels. As a result, about 80% of iMB cells derived from the day 2 iGB-hi cells were CD80<sup>hi</sup>, whereas about 20% from iGB-lo cells were CD80<sup>hi</sup>. These results are reminiscent of those from iMB cells generated from the day 4 iGB cells, except that the iMB cells from day 2 iGB cells contained fewer IgG1<sup>+</sup> and fewer PD-L2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>). iGB-hi cells, rather than iGB-lo cells, tended to dominate the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells, even when we used day 1 iGB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1g</xref>). These data indicate that the bifurcated B<sub>mem</sub> cell fate was not determined by different levels of cell proliferation. However, they also demonstrated that the frequency of the CD80<sup>hi</sup> population in iMB-hi cells increased as the culture period of iGB-hi cells became longer (i.e. from 1 to 2 to 4 days), thus indicating that the duration of CD40 signaling may also affect the development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells. Although IL-21 is a hallmark T<sub>FH</sub> cytokine, which is known to support GC B cell proliferation, the addition of IL-21 to the iGB-hi and iGB-lo cell culture did not affect the frequencies of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells derived from each type of iGB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1h,i</xref>), suggesting that the contribution of IL-21 to the differential B<sub>mem</sub> cell fate decision in vivo is less likely.</p><p>In order to examine whether the iMB-hi and iMB-lo cells recapitulate the functional differences seen in CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, we analyzed their differentiation in culture on the 40LB feeder cells with IL-21. Regardless of their BCR isotype, iMB-lo cells preferentially differentiated toward GC B cells, as clearly seen on day 2, whereas iMB-hi cells preferentially differentiated into plasmablasts or PCs, becoming evident on day 3. The behavior of the iMB-mid cells was intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Next, we investigated the in vivo fate of these iMB cells in response to immunization with a cognate antigen. We sorted allotypically marked NP-binding iMB-lo and iMB-hi cells, derived from iGB-lo and iGB-hi cells of B1-8ki Igκ<sup>−/−</sup> mice, respectively, and co-transferred the iMB-lo and the iMB-hi cells at an equal ratio into B6 mice together with carrier (CGG)-primed T cells. The recipient mice were immunized with NP-CGG, and their spleen cells were analyzed 4 or 10 days later by FCM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,d</xref>). Four days after immunization, most donor-derived, NP-binding plasmablasts were derived from iMB-hi cells. By contrast, the vast majority of donor-derived, NP-binding GC B and B<sub>mem</sub> cells at day 10 were found to originate from iMB-lo cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e,f</xref>). These in vitro and in vivo data together indicate that iMB-hi and iMB-lo cells functionally represent CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, respectively.

Thus, we examined whether these transcription factors are involved in CD40 signaling in GC B cells. When ex-vivo GC B cells were cultured with anti-CD40 or anti-BCR Abs, of either high or low doses, or with various cytokines, IRF4 expression was found to be upregulated by a high dose of anti-CD40 or anti-BCR Abs, whereas BATF expression was selectively upregulated by a high dose of anti-CD40 Ab (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a,b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Then, we tested whether BATF and IRF4 are involved in the induction of CD80 by using tamoxifen-inducible ER<sup>T2</sup>-BATF or ER<sup>T2</sup>-IRF4 constructs. Induced activation of BATF selectively upregulated CD80 expression in iGB-lo cells, although IRF4 alone did not, and co-activation of BATF and IRF4 slightly enhanced CD80 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>).

These data together indicate that the BATF–IRF4 heterodimer that is induced by strong CD40 signaling enhances CD80 expression in activated B cells. As an IKKβ inhibitor suppressed CD40-induced expression of CD80 as well as of BATF and IRF4, the canonical NF-κB pathway appears to upregulate the expression of BATF and IRF4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44245.020</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>CD40-induced BATF may be involved in CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cell development.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) GC B cells (CD19<sup>+</sup> CD138<sup>−</sup> CD38<sup>−</sup> GL7<sup>+</sup>) were sorted from splenocytes of mice at 7 days after immunization with NP-CGG in alum and cultured without (−) or with the addition of the following reagents for 6 hr: anti-IgM plus anti-IgG Abs (αBCR, 10 μg/ml or 1 μg/ml), anti-CD40 Ab (αCD40, 10 μg/ml or 1 μg/ml), IL-4 (10 ng/ml), IL-21 (10 ng/ml) or BAFF (10 ng/ml).

Thus, cell status represented by, for example, transcriptomic or epigenetic profiles may largely define the function of each B<sub>mem</sub> subset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kometani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Previously it was reported that GC depletion by anti-CD40L mAb treatment reduced the frequency of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, and that the transcriptomic signature of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells more closely correlated with CD40-stimulated B cells than did that of CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weisel et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrated that the development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells was largely dependent on the presence of T<sub>FH</sub> cells, which express CD40L at a markedly higher level than naïve or effector T cells, and that partial blocking by anti-CD40L Ab or knock-down of CD40L on CD4 T cells during the primary response dominantly affected the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells rather than CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells. Conversely, in vivo stimulation with anti-CD40 Ab during the primary response increased the number of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells but not the numbers of CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells nor GC B cells. As CD40L in the recipient mice was essential for the generation of both types of B<sub>mem</sub> cells from transferred B cells, we hypothesized that the generation of either CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells is determined by a difference in the quantity of CD40 signaling.</p><p>This hypothesis was strongly supported by our simplified experimental system, which enables in vivo generation of memory-like B (iMB) cells without immunization from naive B cells cultured on feeder cells (40LB) and transferred into mice. Using 40LB cells expressing different levels of CD40L, we clearly showed that stronger in vitro stimulation via CD40 promoted the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells, whereas weaker stimulation facilitated the generation of CD80<sup>lo</sup> iMB cells from B cells with essentially the same BCR repertoire of specificity and isotype. The CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> iMB cells phenocopied the CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, respectively, in that CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells preferentially differentiate into plasmablasts/PCs and CD80<sup>lo</sup> iMB cells into GC B cells (and B<sub>mem</sub> cells in vivo) in ex-vivo culture and after antigen challenge in vivo. The commitment to differentiate into either CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> iMB cells, as determined by the different quantities of CD40 signaling in B cells, was made within two days of culture when the proliferation did not differ among the conditions, and partially made in just one day when CD80 expression was hardly detectable on B cells. Therefore, it seems that the quantity of CD40 signaling in B cells directs cellular programming, which determines the differentiation into distinct B<sub>mem</sub> cell subsets.</p><p>Although the B cells cultured on 40LB feeder cells (iGB cells) mimic some aspect of GC B cells, naturally they differ from genuine GC B cells in that iGB cells are uniformly proliferating, are CD80<sup>+</sup> (to distinct levels depending on the strength of CD40 stimulation), and do not mutate Ig genes. We consider that the iGB cells that were primarily cultured with IL-4 may represent a certain state of T-cell-activated B cells that are destined to become B<sub>mem</sub> cells, such as naïve B cells that are activated in the initial phase of primary response or GC B cells that have just undergone selection as what we call pre-B<sub>mem</sub> cells. Therefore, our data describing the in vivo differentiation of iGB cells into B<sub>mem</sub>-like iMB cells probably explain the mechanism for the induction of bidirectional B<sub>mem</sub> cell differentiation upon T-B interactions, during both the early phase and the GC phase of the primary immune response. Thus, in either phase, B cells receiving relatively stronger CD40 signaling are committed to CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, whereas those receiving weaker CD40 signaling are committed to CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells. Our additional data suggest that, in the early phase, B cells expressing BCR with higher affinity to antigen present more antigenic peptide to cognate T cells, thus inducing CD40L on these T cells more strongly so that they acquire stronger CD40 signaling than lower affinity B cells. Similarly, in the GC phase, higher-affinity GC B cells dominantly present antigenic peptide, and will acquire more frequent and more durable interactions with T<sub>FH</sub> cells that express a high level of CD40L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44245.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells.</title><p>(Top) In the pre-GC phase of the primary response, the BCR affinity to antigen or the amount of available antigen determine the quantity of antigen presentation to T cells, and the extent of the induction of CD40L on T cells. Thus, the strength of CD40 signaling in B cells is determined by the interacting T cells, which then directs the differentiation fate to distinct B<sub>mem</sub> subsets: relatively stronger CD40 signal commits B cells towards CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, whereas weaker CD40 signal commits B cells towards CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells. After GC formation, T<sub>FH</sub> cells, being able to express a high level of CD40L after TCR stimulation, strongly stimulate CD40 on relatively high-affinity B cells and facilitate their differentiation to CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells. (Bottom) Activation of NF-κB, and the downstream BATF–IRF4 heterodimer, may transmit the strong CD40 signaling into a mechanism that facilitates the differentiation towards CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44245-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Thus, stronger CD40 signaling in the GC may direct the development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, as supported by our data. Despite this supposition, it was reported that strong T cell help and CD40 signaling in vivo induce the differentiation of GC B cells into PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ise et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>), raising a question as to the mechanism for the differentiation of GC B cells into either CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells or PCs. The fact that CD40 stimulation suppresses PC generation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hawkins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Randall et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Satpathy et al., 2010</xref>) suggests that the strong CD40 signaling alone does not directly promote PC differentiation in the GC. It is possible that additive BCR signaling affects the differentiation of GC B cells into PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kräutler et al., 2017</xref>), although it has been reported that BCR signaling is inactive in most GC B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khalil et al., 2012</xref>). Supposing that T<sub>FH</sub> cells are heterogeneous in terms of cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weinstein et al., 2016</xref>), a cytokine produced from a particular T<sub>FH</sub> cell subset that interacts with the GC B cells may play a key role. Thus, a combination and integration of signaling pathways, one from the strong CD40 stimulation, the other from a particular cytokine, and maybe more, may ultimately determine the fate of GC B cells. IL-21 is known to induce B cell differentiation into PCs, while IL-21R-defficiency attenuated PC development and accelerated B<sub>mem</sub> cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zotos et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, we previously reported that iGB cells that were secondarily cultured with IL-21 preferentially develop into bone marrow PCs but not B<sub>mem</sub> cells in vivo after adoptive transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nojima et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, when GC B cells interact with IL-21-producing T<sub>FH</sub> cells, and receive a strong CD40 signal, they will differentiate into PCs. A T<sub>FH</sub> cell subset that induces the differentiation of GC B cells into CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells has yet to be defined. IL-4-producing T<sub>FH</sub> cells may be this subset, because iGB cells that are cultured with IL-4 on the CD40L<sup>high</sup> feeder preferentially differentiated into CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells in vivo. Considering a report showing that B<sub>mem</sub> cells develop from B cells in the earlier GC, whereas long-lived PCs are generated during the later GC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weisel et al., 2016</xref>), it is possible that distinct T<sub>FH</sub> subsets may work dominantly in B cell selection along the time course of the GC reaction.</p><p>Our data demonstrating that CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cell generation was little affected by the absence of GC resulting from T<sub>FH</sub> cell-deficiency is consistent with a report indicating that the majority of CD80<sup>lo</sup> PD-L2<sup>–</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cell cells were generated prior to GC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weisel et al., 2016</xref>). Given that low-affinity B cells do enter into the GC reaction and could maintain their low affinity even after mutation, why are only few CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells generated during the GC phase? It has been shown that half of GC B cells undergo apoptosis every 6 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>), and that this response can be avoided by CD40 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayer et al., 2017</xref>). These data suggest that weaker CD40 signaling in the GC phase may not be enough to prevent the apoptosis of B cells and therefore could fail to induce CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cell development. Alternatively, lower-affinity B cells may be excluded from the GC in a competitive situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schwickert et al., 2011</xref>), and therefore fail to receive a strong CD40 stimulation from T<sub>FH</sub> cells.</p><p>As mentioned earlier, CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells phenotypically and functionally resemble effector memory T (T<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory T (T<sub>CM</sub>) cells, respectively, in that T<sub>EM</sub> cells are CD62L<sup>–</sup> and produce abundant effector cytokines upon an antigen re-challenge, whereas T<sub>CM</sub> cells are CD62L<sup>+</sup> and have a greater potential for proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). Our finding that CD40 signal strength directs the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells also resembles mechanistic aspects of the current model for the generation of T<sub>EM</sub> and T<sub>CM</sub> cells: stronger TCR signaling favors T<sub>EM</sub> cells, whereas weaker TCR signaling favors the generation of T<sub>CM</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daniels and Teixeiro, 2015</xref>). It has been reported that the commitment to CD4<sup>+</sup> T<sub>EM</sub> or T<sub>CM</sub> cells is determined by the expression of T-bet and BCL6 transcription factors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pepper et al., 2011</xref>), and that low-affinity TCR signaled greater induction of BCL6 expression but less expression of T-bet compared to high-affinity TCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Knudson et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that TCR affinity/signal strength determines the direction of differentiation to distinct T<sub>mem</sub> subsets, through the induction of distinctive transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Daniels and Teixeiro, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies and our observations imply transcriptomic predisposition of CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells that may account for their preferential differentiation upon re-stimulation, and suggest that the transcriptomic statuses may be established during the primary response as proposed for the T cell memory. It has been demonstrated that the CD40-NF-κB-IRF4 pathway represses the transcription of <italic>Bcl6</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saito et al., 2007</xref>), and that <italic>Bcl6</italic> mRNA is more abundantly expressed in CD80<sup>−</sup> PD-L2<sup>−</sup> cells than in CD80<sup>+</sup> PD-L2<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014</xref>). Combined with our data suggesting that NF-κB and the downstream IRF4–BATF heterodimer play a role in generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, the development to CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells is determined by the balance of the expression levels of transcription factors such as IRF4, BATF and BCL6, which are regulated by CD40 signaling quantity.</p><p>Canonical NF-κB mainly consists of heterodimer p50/c-Rel or p50/RelA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jost and Ruland, 2017</xref>). It has recently been proposed that c-Rel and RelA have different roles in late B cell development: c-Rel promotes proliferation, whereas RelA upregulates Blimp1, a master regulator of PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heise et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roy et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicate that RelA is contributes more to the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells than does c-Rel, which may be involved in determining the nature of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells that are predisposed to PC development. Although RelA and c-Rel may function redundantly to some extent to generate CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, our data showing reduced generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells by c-Rel knockdown alone also suggests a unique role for c-Rel.</p><p>What would be the survival advantage for individuals of generating bifurcated B<sub>mem</sub> cell subsets upon infection? CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells express high-affinity BCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014</xref>) and therefore produce high-affinity Abs. On the other hand, CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells mainly express low-affinity BCRs, but have a greater proliferative potential and preferentially generate secondary GC upon reencounter with antigen, when they can further diversify their BCR repertoire. Therefore, CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, unlike high-affinity CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, can cope with a broader array of epitopes that may be generated by pathogens through mutations. Taken together, robust and rapid high-affinity Ab production by CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells eliminates the majority of reinfecting pathogens, whereas pathogens that escape destruction because of epitope changes resulting from mutations are eliminated by Abs derived from CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells that evolved in GCs. Thus, if we could dissect the CD40 signaling pathways that direct differentiation into CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells and those promote cell proliferation or survival, selective suppression of the former pathways during vaccination might convert the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells into CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells that would eventually produce broadly reactive Abs. Alternatively, additive stimulation of CD40 with proper timing would facilitate the generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells that rapidly produce highly specific Abs upon actual infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic <break/>reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B1-8ki</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lam et al., 1997</xref></td><td/><td>Dr. Rajewsky (Max Delbrück Center for Molecular Medicine)</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>B1-8<sup>hi</sup>ki</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shih et al., 2002</xref></td><td>IMSR Cat# JAX:007775;

To activate CD40 signaling, mice were injected i.p. with agonistic CD40 mAb (FGK4.5, Bio X Cell; 250 μg per mouse) or PBS at day 8 after immunization.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell lines, iGB cell culture and iMB cell generation</title><p>Production of cell lines, iGB cell culture and iMB cell generation were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nojima et al., 2011</xref>). 40LB-hi cells were generated by repeated transduction of a CD40L expression vector (pMXs-CD40L-IRES-GFP) into 40LB cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Takatsuka et al., 2018</xref>). 40LB-mid and 40LB-lo cells were subclones of 40LB cells made by cell sorting followed by limiting dilution. The CD40L expression level in 40LB-mid cells was equivalent to that of the parental 40LB cells. A parental cell line for 40LB, BALB/c 3T3 fibroblast (clone A31), was provided by RIKEN BRC, Japan. All the BALB/c 3T3-derived cell lines were checked routinely using the PCR Mycoplasma Detection Set (Takara) and proved to be mycoplasma-free.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Adoptive transfer of iMB cells for immunization</title><p>Splenocytes from mice that had been transfected with iGB cells 2 week earlier were analyzed by FCM to estimate the numbers of donor-derived (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>) iMB cells. To examine the response of the iMB cells to a NP antigen in vivo, spleen B cells, including a fixed number of iMB cells derived from B1-8 ki B cells, were co-transferred with CGG-primed spleen cells into WT B6 mice, which were immunized i.p. with NP-CGG in alum on the next day.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Plasmid constructions</title><p>BATF and IRF4 cDNAs were cloned by PCR using iGB cell mRNA. The ER<sup>T2</sup> segment was fused to the 5′-terminus of the BATF or IRF4 cDNAs by ligations using PCR-generated de novo restriction enzyme sites. The BATF-HKE mutant (H55Q, K63D, and E77K) was generated by PCR-based mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Iwata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tussiwand et al., 2012</xref>). Constructs encoding BATF or BATF-HKE, each fused with ER<sup>T2</sup>, were cloned into a pMXs-IRES-GFP vector. A construct encoding IRF4 fused with ER<sup>T2</sup> was cloned into a pMXs-IRES-CFP vector, derived from the pMXs-IRES-GFP, in which the GFP sequence was replaced with CFP.

Retroviral transduction of in-vivo-activated primary B cells and their transfer into mice were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inoue et al., 2017</xref>). In brief, B1-8<sup>hi</sup> ki mice were injected i.p. with NP-Ficoll (50 μg), and then B cells were purified from the spleens of these mice 6 hr later and stimulated in vitro with anti-CD40 Ab (2 μg/ml) for 18 hr. Cultured B cells were spin-infected with retroviral vectors and further cultured for 3 hr.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you might see from their reports, all three reviewers have found the manuscript interesting and worthy of inviting for a re-submission. Moreover, they have raised several points that if addressed will certainly increase the general impact. In particular, there was a general concern among reviewers about a strict definition of memory B cells as B central memory (B<sub>CM</sub>) and B effector memory (B<sub>EM</sub>) cells. The consensus was that there needs to be an effort to better characterize this population not only in terms of markers (such as surface markers or Bcl6 and Blimp) but also in terms of their time of generation in relation B cell division or after transfer. It will also be beneficial, if within the reach of the authors, to validate their observations in an infectious model and not only with model antigens. In parallel, the text also needs to be softened in several parts. The general view was that the data, as it stands, does not warrant a rigorous definition of B<sub>CM</sub> and B<sub>EM</sub> definition as in T cells. In line with this, the manuscript will also benefit from a robust discussion on how the in vitro system does not completely recapitulate the results observed in vivo. A final important point raised by reviewers is how the levels of CD40 stimulation might influence the outcome of B<sub>CM</sub> and B<sub>EM</sub>. This has to be addressed and discussed extensively. As the manuscript stands, the authors views on this point and the role of CD40 in B cell differentiation appears to contrast with some of the current literature, and this needs to be discussed thoroughly.</p><p>Please find below the full reviewers' comments so that you get an idea of their different views as well as experimental work that you might carry out to add to accommodate their concerns.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Koike et al. investigate the signals involved in the differentiation of distinct populations of memory B cells upon immunization: a CD80-high population that can rapidly differentiate into plasma cells and a CD80-low population that can re-enter germinal centers upon re-challenge. By performing in vivo experiments and taking advantage of an ex vivo germinal center system, authors found that the development of distinct populations of memory B cells is independent of BCR isotypes, but rather associated with the affinity of their BCR and the strength of CD40 signal received from T cells. Authors found that memory B cells with high affinity to antigen (CD80-high), receive strong CD40 signals and preferentially differentiate into effector plasma cells, while low affinity memory B cells (CD80-low) receive less CD40 signal and mostly differentiate into germinal centers. In addition, authors add some mechanistic clues to how CD40 might regulate B cell fate decision through NF-κB. Some of the results present in this study were already shown by the group of Mark Shlomchik (Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014). However, the present manuscript digs into the signals required for the generation of distinct memory B cell populations. Overall, experiments are well performed, they follow a logic and add sufficiently to our knowledge of memory B cell biology. I think it could be of potential interest for its publication in <italic>eLife</italic> after several changes and additional experiments.</p><p>- My main concern relies on the fact that authors try to define these two populations of memory B cells as B central memory (B<sub>CM</sub>) and B effector memory (B<sub>EM</sub>) cells, making a parallel to the memory T cell convention. However, in T cells, these two populations are clearly defined by specific surface markers (for instance, CD44 and CD62L in mice) and are also transcriptionally different. I am not convinced that we are in the presence of two functionally different populations of memory B cells. For instance, even though authors state that B<sub>CM</sub> are CD80<sup>-</sup> and B<sub>EM</sub> are CD80<sup>+</sup>, Figure 1A clearly shows that memory B cells display a gradient of CD80 expression rather than being separated into two distinct populations. In fact, authors arbitrary place a gate and decide which ones will be called CD80<sup>-</sup> and which ones CD80<sup>+</sup>. If authors wish to create this new nomenclature for memory B cell subsets, they should do a better characterization of these 2 populations, either by flow cytometry or transcriptionally. Authors may combine CD80 with other stainings, like CD62L or PDL2, on the same FACS plot to better separate/define these two populations.</p><p>- Authors show that interfering with CD40 signalling affects the balance between CD80-high and CD80-low memory B cells (Figure 2). Do these changes translate into different B cell effector programs (plasma vs germinal center) upon re-challenge?</p><p>- All experiments are performed with protein antigens, which raises the question of whether these &quot;two populations&quot; would appear in a real infection model. If that is the case, would they also have distinct CD40 signalling?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The work of Koike et al. starts by reprising work of Shlomchik in describing subsets of memory B cells using CD80 and PDL2. They do add that CD80<sup>hi</sup> memory B cells are predisposed on restimulation in vitro with CD40L fibroblasts to produce antibody secreting cells (ASC) while CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> are predisposed to produce germinal center (GC) cells. They show that GC and T<sub>FH</sub> are required to bias towards CD80<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> and that there is a relationship between the amount of CD40L stimulation and proportional representation of the B<sub>mem</sub> subsets. Diminished amounts of CD40L are associated with reduced CD80<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub>. Curiously, when one looks at the different time points when this was assessed, 10 days and 6 weeks, the effect of reduced CD40L becomes less the longer out from the immunisation one goes. This part of the work highlights CD80 as a marker for memory subsets, introduces the potentially confusing (but seductive) nomenclature of central and effector memory B cells and promotes the idea of amount of CD40L exposure as influencing memory subset representation.</p><p>The second part is a detailed analysis of the memory B cells that are generated in mice after transfer of B cells activated in vitro with CD40L, IL4, BAFF and fibroblasts, a system called in vitro GC B cells (iGC). This process has been described by this group and involves transferring 20x10^6 activated B cells into an irradiated recipient and waiting two weeks in this case when approximately 10^6 memory B cells are recovered. The authors make the interesting observation that these B<sub>mem</sub> can be partitioned according to Shlomchik's system and that there is a relationship between the proportion of CD80<sup>hi</sup> and in vitro exposure to high amounts of CD40L. They also show that these B<sub>mem</sub> populations show differentiation predispositions that mimic that of the in vivo generated subsets (CD80<sup>+</sup> to ASC and away from GC; CD80<sup>-</sup> to GC and away from ASC), although the in vivo test of this differentiation bias (Figure 3I-K) failed to reveal ASC from either subset.</p><p>The work then addresses the idea that amount of CD40L a B cell 'sees' in a GC will determine its memory subset outcome by showing, somewhat curiously, that high affinity precursor B cells produce proportionately more CD80<sup>+</sup> memory B cells at day 7 than low affinity precursor B cells when in competition and that among day 10 memory B cells, high affinity cells are more likely to be in the CD80<sup>+</sup> subset. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that others using this system (Nussenzweig) have shown that in competition, low affinity cells are excluded from the GC, so one wonders if this is what is being measured here (Figure 4E). Even so, these data are also more or less in agreement with Shlomchik in terms of mutational load and therefore possible affinity improvements. This part of the work also shows that there is a relationship between amount of CD80 upregulation on naïve B cells after their exposure to activated CD4 T cells that is dependent on the amount of peptide the B cells display, providing a link between degree of T cell help and CD80 expression. A major caveat of this conclusion is that this is an in vitro proliferating B cells and not a memory B cell subset.</p><p>Finally, the authors look to mechanism and things become a little murky in so far as the confusion between in vitro activated and proliferating B cells and memory subsets remains. The conclusions that NFkB is involved and that its effects are mediated by IRF4 and BATF are to me highly problematic in themselves and also emblematic of my major issue with the work itself. These biochemistry studies, which also ignore a body of work on the consequences of CD40 signalling on GC B cells, are on actively proliferating B cells. One has to seriously question what the relationship is between a B cell cycling in optimal and unchanging conditions in vitro, to that in GC where presumably conditions and stimuli are under constant flux. Indeed, the authors show quite clearly that GC B cells are in fact CD80 negative while all their cells are CD80<sup>+</sup>. It would therefore seem that in vivo, B<sub>mem</sub> formation is associated with acquisition of CD80 while in the in vitro transfer system, B<sub>mem</sub> formation is the retention of CD80. Even in this context it is hard to understand how if NFkB is so crucial that knockdown of Rela has such a modest effect (Figure 5F), although the degree of knockdown is not shown. The final figure showing increased expression of CD80 on what are labelled memory precursors, together with increased IRF4 and BATF, is somewhat unconvincing as it is not clear if this amount of CD80 is the baseline for memory B cells, let alone if the slightly increased amounts of IRF4 and BATF are biologically relevant.</p><p>My major concern is that this study represents two potentially independent and unrelated observations that are joined by the coincidence of CD80 expression. That is, why should I think that the processes occurring in the in vitro cultures reflect the processes in GC that give rise to memory? In vitro, the B cells are exposed to a constant and unlimited amounts of stimulus, whereas in GC they cycle between exposure to an unknown amount of CD40L, cytokines and cell-cell contact. Equally, IL21 is a crucial component of normal GC function and a defining characteristic of T<sub>FH</sub>, yet it is left out of these cultures. Previously this group reported that the B<sub>mem</sub> produced by in vivo transfer showed different differentiation potential based on IL21 presence in the first culture. That confuses the CD40L as major factor quite a bit. Similarly, what is the timing of CD80 upregulation in the cultures? Is it immediate and irrelevant to time or is it a timing event? What is the extent of proliferation in the different cultures? Is this phenomenon related to extent of division and would different results be achieved by transferring earlier? Last why are all the mice examined at such early time points? What kind of memory is present at days 7 or 10, and doesn't that change dramatically over the weeks that follow? As shown in this reports Figure 2?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Koike and colleagues investigate the role of CD40-CD40L interaction for the development of functional different memory B cell (MBC) subsets i.e. MBCs that upon re-activation are mostly prone to differentiate into plasma cells (CD80<sup>+</sup>) and those (CD80<sup>-</sup>) mostly prone to re-enter the germinal center (GC) reaction. In light of these functional properties, and in parallel with terms used for T cells, the authors respectively call these subsets effector memory B (B<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory B (B<sub>CM</sub>). Notably, a productive GC reaction is largely required for the formation of the so-called B<sub>EM</sub>, while a GC is largely dispensable for the formation of B<sub>CM</sub>. Overall the study demonstrates that CD40 is required for the formation of MBC cell subsets characterized by CD80<sup>+</sup> or CD80<sup>-</sup>. The authors also show that B<sub>EM</sub> formation requires increased CD40 signaling compared to B<sub>CM</sub> and this correlates to their GC and pre-GC formation, respectively. BCR affinity contributes to the ability of cells to present antigen and therefore receive increased help via CD40, as previously shown by others. The work also shows that once B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub> are formed their functional properties are per se largely independent on BCR receptor signal strength, suggesting a different transcriptomic or epigenetic profile. MBCs displaying IgG1 positivity can also be formed in the absence of a GC reaction, and the authors do not perform experiments where somatic mutation is determined. Does it remain to be shown whether in the GC context the choice of a B cell to differentiate into B<sub>EM</sub> or B<sub>CM</sub> exists and if that choice is dependent on CD40 signaling strength. There are additional conceptual and technical aspects of the work that need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Figure 1B (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) – The Flow Cytometry gating strategy in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B that pertains the results summarized in Figure 1B needs to be revisited. What is the justification for inclusion of GL7 within the plasma cell gating? Also, GL7 expression within the CD138<sup>-</sup> subset displays a broad range of intensities and the gating in this case includes GL7 low and likely also GL7 negative cells. How would the results in Figure 1B appear if the gating strategy is more conservative? Staining for Bcl6, as a GC marker, and for Blimp1, as a plasma cell marker, would clarify this issue.</p><p>2) Figure 2B – Transfer of B1-8 B cells into CD40lg<sup>-/-</sup> yields very few cells with an MBC phenotype demonstrating that CD40 engagement is largely required for MBC formation in general. How much or how little do the few formed MBC cells in CD40lg<sup>-/-</sup> express CD80?</p><p>3) Figure 2C, D – What is the impact in GC B cell frequency and numbers and how does that confound the results presented and interpretation? What is the authors interpretation for the cell number recovery of both B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub> by 6 weeks?</p><p>4) Figure 3 – How do the varied levels of CD40L expression (40LB-lo, mid, hi) in the 40LB culture system impact on the generation of iGB cells in vitro? What is the phenotype, beyond CD80 expression, of the cells to be transferred into mice? As mentioned previously the study would have increased credibility and interpretations could be made with higher confidence if throughout the study Bcl6, as a GC marker, and for Blimp1, as a plasma cell marker are used.</p><p>5) Figure 5E – Also in this experiment it is important to describe the phenotype of the transferred cells. Upon transfer what is the impact of RelA knockdown on B<sub>CM</sub>, the GC reaction, plasma cell formation?</p><p>6) Figure 6. What would be the outcome in the formation of either B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub> upon transfer of iGC-lo cells constitutively or conditionally expressing BATF, IRF4 or both?</p><p>7) The authors propose, in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion, that the reason why the so-called B<sub>CM</sub> cells are hardly generated during the GC reaction is because a) these cells fail to induce a high level of CD40L in the cognate T cells and hence would die by apoptosis. b) The authors also write that apoptosis can be avoided by c-Myc expression downstream of CD40 signaling. While the first point (a) is likely to be true given the survival properties of CD40 signaling, the suggestion that c-Myc curtails apoptosis downstream of CD40 (b) is an experimentally unsubstantiated assumption. Current data suggests that c-Myc positivity in the GC reaction represent positive selection downstream of BCR and CD40 signaling and that is most likely the reason why these cells display reduced apoptosis compared to c-Myc negative LZ B cells.</p><p>8) The authors go through great lengths to discredit a fundamental role for CD40 in plasma cell differentiation, suggesting that CD40 signaling merely enhances the effect of cytokine from particular T<sub>FH</sub> cells, likely IL21 expression ones. Clearly this is a gross misinterpretation, previous work has demonstrated that ablation of RelA is critical for GC derived plasma cell formation. Having said this, CD40 signaling may not be per se sufficient; as the authors themselves write IL21 has also been shown to be required for plasma cell formation to ensue. It is not contradictory that CD40 is involved in both MBC and plasma cell formation given that the cell fate is likely to be ultimately determined by a combination and integration of signaling pathways.</p><p>9) The authors propose that modulation of CD40 signaling could facilitate the generation of B<sub>CM</sub> in vaccination possibly beneficial against evolved viruses with epitope mutations. This proposal is however negated by the authors data in Figure 2: if CD40 signaling is impaired (Figure 2C) the formation of both B<sub>EM</sub> or B<sub>CM</sub> is impaired (cell numbers); if CD40 signaling is enhanced (Figure 2E) there is no impact on the production of B<sub>CM</sub> (cell numbers), but a boost occurs in the production of B<sub>EM</sub> (cell numbers). An avenue with respect to skewing the B<sub>EM</sub> GC fate to a B<sub>CM</sub> one may be possible, however as mentioned above, the authors do not perform experiments addressing whether in the GC context a B cell fate choice to B<sub>EM</sub> or B<sub>CM</sub> exists and if that choice is dependent on CD40 signaling strength.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44245.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Koike et al. investigate the signals involved in the differentiation of distinct populations of memory B cells upon immunization: a CD80-high population that can rapidly differentiate into plasma cells and a CD80-low population that can re-enter germinal centers upon re-challenge.

We did not intend to define a new B<sub>mem</sub> cell subsets. Therefore, agreeing to the reviewer’s comment, we have got rid of the nomenclature, B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub>. As the expression of CD80 on B<sub>mem</sub> cells was not so discrete, as the reviewer pointed out, we decided to call them as CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells throughout our revised manuscript.

Even if the primed mice were directly re-challenged, the markedly lower number of total B<sub>mem</sub> cells in the antibody-injected mice as compared to the control mice (Figure 2C) would make it difficult to properly compare the numbers of PCs or GC B cells after the secondary challenge. In any case, the in vivo CD40-blocking would inhibit proliferation and therefore affinity maturation of B cells in the GC, and thus reduce the affinity of B<sub>mem</sub> cells to an antigen as compared to the control, which would affect the outcome of the in vivo recall response. Another experiment using the memory-like iMB<sup>hi</sup> and iMB<sup>lo</sup> cells with uniform, unmutated BCRs to examine their recall (-like) response in the same individuals (the former Figure 3I-K; the new Figure 4C-F) clearly demonstrated that the primary CD40 signaling quantity determines the different effector programs of B<sub>mem</sub> cells that are independent of BCR affinity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- All experiments are performed with protein antigens, which raises the question of whether these &quot;two populations&quot; would appear in a real infection model.

This part of the work highlights CD80 as a marker for memory subsets, introduces the potentially confusing (but seductive) nomenclature of central and effector memory B cells and promotes the idea of amount of CD40L exposure as influencing memory subset representation.</p></disp-quote><p>Before responding to each comment, we note here that we have got rid of the nomenclature, B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub>, and called them as CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells throughout our revised manuscript, as mentioned in the response to the first reviewer.</p><p>In response to the comment <italic>“Curiously, when one looks at the different time points when this was assessed, 10 days and 6 weeks, the effect of reduced CD40L becomes less the longer out from the immunisation one goes.”</italic>:</p><p>As the reviewer commented, the effect of injection of anti-CD40L antibody on the B<sub>mem</sub> cell development was less impressive at 6 weeks after immunization (Figure 2D). We think this is because CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells may have been generated in later GC after the injected antibody had lapsed, as we have described in the Results section of the revised manuscript (subsection “Strong CD40 signaling induced by T<sub>FH</sub> cells is required for development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second part is a detailed analysis of the memory B cells that are generated in mice after transfer of B cells activated in vitro with CD40L, IL4, BAFF and fibroblasts, a system called in vitro GC B cells (iGC). This process has been described by this group and involves transferring 20x10^6 activated B cells into an irradiated recipient and waiting two weeks in this case when approximately 10^6 memory B cells are recovered. The authors make the interesting observation that these B<sub>mem</sub> can be partitioned according to Shlomchik's system and that there is a relationship between the proportion of CD80<sup>hi</sup> and in vitro exposure to high amounts of CD40L. They also show that these B<sub>mem</sub> populations show differentiation predispositions that mimic that of the in vivo generated subsets (CD80<sup>+</sup> to ASC and away from GC; CD80- to GC and away from ASC), although the in vivo test of this differentiation bias (Figure 3I-K) failed to reveal ASC from either subset.</p></disp-quote><p>In the experiment shown in the former Figure 3I-K, NP-specific plasmablasts could hardly be detected on day 10 or later in the spleen, but were readily detectable on day 4 after immunization. Thus, we have included the data of the plasmablast analysis on day 4, which shows that vast majority of the donor-derived plasmablasts was derived of iMB-hi cells, as shown in the new Figure 4E, F. We have described about this data in the Results section of the revised manuscript (subsection “CD40 signal strength in vitro affects differentiation into CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells in vivo”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The work then addresses the idea that amount of CD40L a B cell 'sees' in a GC will determine its memory subset outcome by showing, somewhat curiously, that high affinity precursor B cells produce proportionately more CD80<sup>+</sup> memory B cells at day 7 than low affinity precursor B cells when in competition and that among day 10 memory B cells, high affinity cells are more likely to be in the CD80<sup>+</sup> subset. This is somewhat complicated by the fact that others using this system (Nussenzweig) have shown that in competition, low affinity cells are excluded from the GC, so one wonders if this is what is being measured here (Figure 4E). Even so, these data are also more or less in agreement with Shlomchik in terms of mutational load and therefore possible affinity improvements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree to the possibility that low affinity cells are excluded from the GC and therefore fail to access to CD40L on T<sub>FH</sub> cells. This possibility does not contradict to our original idea that higher affinity B cells preferentially differentiate into CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells through getting stronger stimulation with CD40L on T<sub>FH</sub> cells. Thus, we have included the new possibility and described in the Results section (subsection “Higher BCR affinity for antigen favors development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells”, last paragraph) and the Discussion section (seventh paragraph) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This part of the work also shows that there is a relationship between amount of CD80 upregulation on naïve B cells after their exposure to activated CD4 T cells that is dependent on the amount of peptide the B cells display, providing a link between degree of T cell help and CD80 expression. A major caveat of this conclusion is that this is an in vitro proliferating B cells and not a memory B cell subset.</p></disp-quote><p>With the data in the former Figure 4A-D, we intended to show that CD40L expression was induced on activated T cells to the levels in proportion to the extent of antigen presentation on B cells, and that the induced levels of CD40L quantitatively correlated to its function to stimulate cognate B cells through CD40, as assessed by CD80 induction. These data indicate quantitative relationship among B-cell antigen presentation, CD40L expression on T cells and B cell activation, and would serve as an introduction for the following experiments. We did not mean that the CD80 expression levels on naïve B cells directly correlated to the development of B<sub>mem</sub> cells with distinct expression levels of CD80. However, it is possible that the levels of CD80 expression induced by the T-B interaction during the early primary response or during GC reaction may be maintained through the development to B<sub>mem</sub> cells. We have included a sentence mentioning this possibility for the logical sequence of the experiments shown in Figure 2, in the Results section of the revised manuscript (subsection “Strong CD40 signaling induced by T<sub>FH</sub> cells is required for development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors look to mechanism and things become a little murky in so far as the confusion between in vitro activated and proliferating B cells and memory subsets remains. The conclusions that NFkB is involved and that its effects are mediated by IRF4 and BATF are to me highly problematic in themselves and also emblematic of my major issue with the work itself. These biochemistry studies, which also ignore a body of work on the consequences of CD40 signalling on GC B cells, are on actively proliferating B cells. One has to seriously question what the relationship is between a B cell cycling in optimal and unchanging conditions in vitro, to that in GC where presumably conditions and stimuli are under constant flux. Indeed, the authors show quite clearly that GC B cells are in fact CD80 negative while all their cells are CD80<sup>+</sup>. It would therefore seem that in vivo, B<sub>mem</sub> formation is associated with acquisition of CD80 while in the in vitro transfer system, B<sub>mem</sub> formation is the retention of CD80. Even in this context it is hard to understand how if NFkB is so crucial that knockdown of Rela has such a modest effect (Figure 5F), although the degree of knockdown is not shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewer’s concern, but we were aware that the mechanisms of CD40 signaling to induce CD80 expression in in vitro cultured B cells are primarily irrelevant to those to promote development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells in vivo. However, we thought that the biochemical analyses in the former could provide a clue to elucidate the latter mechanisms that appeared to be difficult to directly tackle. Thus, after having found that RelA was involved in the strong CD40 signaling in cultured B cells (the former Figure 5A, B), we tested whether RelA was involved in the development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells (the former Figure 5E, F). The result showed that the RelA-knockdown in the in vivo activated B cells resulted in significant reduction of development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, although the difference was modest as the reviewer pointed out. However, the knockdown efficiency was unknown and could not be measured in this experiment because the ex vivo B cells transduced with the knockdown vector containing GFP marker had to be transferred back into mice 3 hours later, before the GFP expression became apparent (please see the new Figure 6G). Thus, we only tested the knockdown vector efficacy using iGB cells (the former Figure 5C). To convince the reviewer as well as the readers, in the revised manuscript, we have included the data of an experiment in which iGB cells were transduced with the knockdown vectors, now including that of c-Rel, and then transferred into mice to let them differentiate into memory-like iMB cells. As shown in the new Figure 6C-F and described in the Results section subsection “Possible mechanisms by which CD40 signaling facilitates GC B-cell differentiation into CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells”, first paragraph) of the revised manuscript, the knockdown of either RelA or c-Rel, which was now evaluated (Figure 6C), significantly attenuated in vivo generation of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells.</p><p>Although the reviewer seems to consider that a body of our work is on the consequences of CD40 signaling on GC B cells, we considered that the CD40 signaling affect B cells not only in the GC phase but also during the initial activation phase before the GC phase, for their differentiation into B<sub>mem</sub> cells. Indeed, stimulation of naïve B cells for only two day, or even one, on the feeder cells differentially expressing CD40L affected their development into CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> iMB cells (the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-G). Thus, we consider that the iGB culture system represents the both phases, although being quite artificial, and is useful to elucidate signals for B cells to differentiate into B<sub>mem</sub> cells (iMB cell in the experiments). Although majority of GC B cells are CD80<sup>–</sup>, unlike in vitro activated B cells, a minor fraction that has been selected for B<sub>mem</sub> cells (pre-B<sub>mem</sub> cells) expressed CD80 (the former Figure 6F, G; the revised Figure 7F, G). Therefore, the mechanism of CD40 signaling for the B<sub>mem</sub> cell development may be similar between naïve B cells in the early phase and GC B cells in the GC phase of the primary immune response, and they both induce CD80 expression upon the strong and durable CD40 signaling and may retain the CD80 expression until and after they become B<sub>mem</sub> cells. We have stated this view in the Discussion section of the new manuscript (fifth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The final figure showing increased expression of CD80 on what are labelled memory precursors, together with increased IRF4 and BATF, is somewhat unconvincing as it is not clear if this amount of CD80 is the baseline for memory B cells, let alone if the slightly increased amounts of IRF4 and BATF are biologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this comment, we have repeated the same experiment but now including B<sub>mem</sub> cells in the analysis. The expression levels of CD80 and BATF in pre-B<sub>mem</sub> cells were intermediate between those of GC B cells and B<sub>mem</sub> cells, although the increase of IRF4 expression in pre-B<sub>mem</sub> cells was not significant in this experiment (the new Figure 7F, G). The data were evaluated by control staining with isotype-matched antibodies (the new Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). Thus, we revised the Results section in the revised manuscript (subsection “Possible mechanisms by which CD40 signaling facilitates GC B-cell differentiation into CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My major concern is that this study represents two potentially independent and unrelated observations that are joined by the coincidence of CD80 expression. That is, why should I think that the processes occurring in the in vitro cultures reflect the processes in GC that give rise to memory? In vitro, the B cells are exposed to a constant and unlimited amounts of stimulus, whereas in GC they cycle between exposure to an unknown amount of CD40L, cytokines and cell-cell contact. Equally, IL21 is a crucial component of normal GC function and a defining characteristic of T<sub>FH</sub>, yet it is left out of these cultures. Previously this group reported that the B<sub>mem</sub> produced by in vivo transfer showed different differentiation potential based on IL21 presence in the first culture. That confuses the CD40L as major factor quite a bit.</p></disp-quote><p>As answered in the previous response, we think the iGB culture system, from which the cultured B cells differentiate into B<sub>mem</sub>-like iMB cells in vivo, represents a common aspect of T-cell-mediated stimulation, but not the whole process, of naïve B cells and GC B cells during the initial phase of the immune response and the GC phase, respectively. The resultant CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> iMB cells and genuine CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells do not just coincide with each other on the CD80 expression, but were similar in their secondary responses in vitro as well as in vivo (Figure 1B, the new Figure 4, and Zuccarino-Catania et al., 2014). As the reviewer pointed out, the condition of the iGB culture system is far simpler than that of genuine GC, but it is well known that a numerous number of such simplified experimental systems have greatly contributed to our understanding of the complex immune system.</p><p>As for the IL-21, we previously reported that the addition of IL-21 secondary to the IL-4 in the iGB culture suppresses the generation of the iMB cells but instead promotes the generation of bone-marrow PCs (Nojima et al., 2011). Although we used only the first culture with IL-4 that allows generation of iMB cells in the original manuscript, we have now tested the effect of additional IL-21 in the first culture. As shown in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1H, I (subsection “CD40 signal strength in vitro affects differentiation into CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells in vivo”, third paragraph) in the revised manuscript, the addition of IL-21 did not affect the frequency of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells generated from iGB cells cultured on either 40LB<sup>hi</sup> or 40LB<sup>lo</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Similarly, what is the timing of CD80 upregulation in the cultures? Is it immediate and irrelevant to time or is it a timing event? What is the extent of proliferation in the different cultures? Is this phenomenon related to extent of division and would different results be achieved by transferring earlier?</p></disp-quote><p>We showed that CD80 was upregulated later than one day after the start of the iGB culture, and increased by day 3, to different extents depending on CD40L expression levels on feeder cells (Figure 3B). In our revised manuscript, we have included the data showing that the proliferation of iGB cells was equally minimum on day 2 but markedly differed depending on the feeder cells, as evident on day 4 after the start of the culture (the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Transferring with the day 2 iGB cells, or even day 1, resulted in the similar result as with day 4 iGB cells, although the frequency of CD80<sup>hi</sup> iMB cells corresponded to the length of the culture period, as shown in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1E-G. This result indicates that the differential B<sub>mem</sub> cell development is not related to the extent of division of B cells in culture, but related to strength and duration of CD40 stimulation. These results and view are stated in the Results section of the revised manuscript (subsection “CD40 signal strength in vitro affects differentiation into CD80<sup>hi</sup> or CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells in vivo”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last why are all the mice examined at such early time points? What kind of memory is present at days 7 or 10, and doesn't that change dramatically over the weeks that follow?

This is because we focused on the generation of B<sub>mem</sub> cells and tried to avoid outcomes of possible alterations in the maintenance of B<sub>mem</sub> cells or in their late development from GC, which might be caused by the experimental interventions we performed. The previous reports indicated that class-switched B<sub>mem</sub> cells are readily detectable by day 7~9 in experiments where antigen-specific Ig-knockin B cells are transferred into mice, and most B<sub>mem</sub> cells are formed by day 11 after immunization (Wang et al., 2017; Suan et al., 2017; Weisel et al., 2016). We stated the above view in the Results section of the revised manuscript (subsection “Strong CD40 signaling induced by T<sub>FH</sub> cells is required for development of CD80<sup>hi</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells”, third paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Koike and colleagues investigate the role of CD40-CD40L interaction for the development of functional different memory B cell (MBC) subsets i.e. MBCs that upon re-activation are mostly prone to differentiate into plasma cells (CD80<sup>+</sup>) and those (CD80-) mostly prone to re-enter the germinal center (GC) reaction. In light of these functional properties, and in parallel with terms used for T cells, the authors respectively call these subsets effector memory B (B<sub>EM</sub>) and central memory B (B<sub>CM</sub>). Notably, a productive GC reaction is largely required for the formation of the so-called B<sub>EM</sub>, while a GC is largely dispensable for the formation of B<sub>CM</sub>. Overall the study demonstrates that CD40 is required for the formation of MBC cell subsets characterized by CD80<sup>+</sup> or CD80-. The authors also show that B<sub>EM</sub> formation requires increased CD40 signaling compared to B<sub>CM</sub> and this correlates to their GC and pre-GC formation, respectively. BCR affinity contributes to the ability of cells to present antigen and therefore receive increased help via CD40, as previously shown by others. The work also shows that once B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub> are formed their functional properties are per se largely independent on BCR receptor signal strength, suggesting a different transcriptomic or epigenetic profile. MBCs displaying IgG1 positivity can also be formed in the absence of a GC reaction, and the authors do not perform experiments where somatic mutation is determined. Does it remain to be shown whether in the GC context the choice of a B cell to differentiate into B<sub>EM</sub> or B<sub>CM</sub> exists and if that choice is dependent on CD40 signaling strength. There are additional conceptual and technical aspects of the work that need to be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>Before responding to each comment, we note here that we have got rid of the nomenclature, B<sub>EM</sub> and B<sub>CM</sub>, and instead called them as CD80<sup>hi</sup> and CD80<sup>lo</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells throughout our revised manuscript, in response to other reviewers’ and editors’ comments.</p><p>Our response to the sentence “<italic>Does it remain to be shown whether in the GC context the choice of a B cell to differentiate into B<sub>EM</sub> or B<sub>CM</sub> exists and if that choice is dependent on CD40 signaling strength.</italic>”:</p><p>Although we have not done such experiments, Shlomchik and colleagues showed in their paper that injection of blocking anti-CD40L antibody at the peak of GC reaction (day 12-14 after immunization) resulted in reduction of the frequency of CD80<sup>+</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells and increase of CD80<sup>–</sup> B<sub>mem</sub> cells, suggesting that the choice of a B cell to differentiate into either B<sub>mem</sub> cell type, depending on CD40 signaling strength, exists in the GC context (Weisel et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Figure 1B (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) – The Flow Cytometry gating strategy in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B that pertains the results summarized in Figure 1B needs to be revisited.

Expression levels of CD38 and CD62L were higher and those of Fas were lower in B cells cultured on 40LB-lo feeder cells, probably reflecting less activated state of the cells. Proliferation was correlated to the expression levels of CD40L on these feeder cells.

While the first point (a) is likely to be true given the survival properties of CD40 signaling, the suggestion that c-Myc curtails apoptosis downstream of CD40 (b) is an experimentally unsubstantiated assumption. Current data suggests that c-Myc positivity in the GC reaction represent positive selection downstream of BCR and CD40 signaling and that is most likely the reason why these cells display reduced apoptosis compared to c-Myc negative LZ B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In accordance with the reviewer’s comment, we have removed the statement of our assumption about c-Myc involvement from the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors go through great lengths to discredit a fundamental role for CD40 in plasma cell differentiation, suggesting that CD40 signaling merely enhances the effect of cytokine from particular T<sub>FH</sub> cells, likely IL21 expression ones. Clearly this is a gross misinterpretation, previous work has demonstrated that ablation of RelA is critical for GC derived plasma cell formation. Having said this, CD40 signaling may not be per se sufficient; as the authors themselves write IL21 has also been shown to be required for plasma cell formation to ensue. It is not contradictory that CD40 is involved in both MBC and plasma cell formation given that the cell fate is likely to be ultimately determined by a combination and integration of signaling pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree to this comment, and therefore we have removed the statement that the strong CD40 signaling merely enhance the interaction between GC B cells and T<sub>FH</sub> cells from our Discussion, and extensively revised this paragraph of the Discussion in the revised manuscript, adapting the reviewer’s view, namely, a combination and integration of CD40 signaling and cytokine signaling may determine the fate of GC B cells (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors propose that modulation of CD40 signaling could facilitate the generation of B<sub>CM</sub> in vaccination possibly beneficial against evolved viruses with epitope mutations.
