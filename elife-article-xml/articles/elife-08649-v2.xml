In this study, we identify <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> NOCA-1 as a protein with homology to vertebrate ninein. NOCA-1 contributes to the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in multiple tissues. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions redundantly with the minus end protection factor Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array essential for worm growth and morphogenesis. Controlled degradation of a γ-tubulin complex subunit in this tissue revealed that γ-tubulin acts with NOCA-1 in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1. In the germline, NOCA-1 and γ-tubulin co-localize at the cell surface, and inhibiting either leads to a microtubule assembly defect. γ-tubulin targets independently of NOCA-1, but NOCA-1 targeting requires γ-tubulin when a non-essential putatively palmitoylated cysteine is mutated. These results show that NOCA-1 acts with γ-tubulin to assemble non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin protein families.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08649.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08649.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08649.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microtubules are hollow, rigid filaments that are found in the cells of animals and other eukaryotes. These filaments are built from smaller building blocks called tubulin heterodimers; and in dividing animal cells, they mainly emerge from structures called centrosomes. When a cell is dividing, arrays of microtubules that originate from centrosomes help assemble the spindle-like structure that segregates the chromosomes.</p><p>Many non-dividing or specialized cells—including neurons, skin cells and muscle fibers—assemble other arrays of microtubules that do not emerge from centrosomes, but nevertheless perform a variety of structural, mechanical and transport-based roles. Compared to the centrosomal arrays, much less is known about how these non-centrosomal microtubules are assembled.</p><p>A vertebrate protein called ‘ninein’ had previously been shown to be involved in anchoring microtubules at centrosomes. Ninein can change its localization from centrosomes to the cell surface in mammalian skin cells, suggesting that it might also have a role in assembling the peripheral microtubule arrays that are found in these cells. Now, Wang et al. have identified a protein from worms called NOCA-1, which contains a region similar to the part of ninein that was previously shown to be needed to anchor microtubules at centrosomes.</p><p>The experiments show that NOCA-1 guides the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in multiple tissues in <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms. This includes in the outer layer of the worm's larvae, which is similar to mammalian skin. The results also highlight that NOCA-1 performs many of the same roles as a member of the Patronin family of proteins called PTRN-1, which interacts with the ‘minus’ end of a microtubule to prevent the microtubule from breaking apart.</p><p>Wang et al. also found that NOCA-1 works with another protein called γ-tubulin, which helps new microtubules to form and also interacts with microtubule minus ends. In contrast, PTRN-1 works independently of γ-tubulin. This suggests that NOCA-1 works together with γ-tubulin to protect new microtubule ends or promote their assembly, a role similar to what has been proposed for Patronin family proteins. Overall, Wang et al.'s results highlight the importance of ninein-related proteins in the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays and suggest overlapping roles for the ninein and Patronin families of proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08649.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08649.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>non-centrosomal microtubule array</kwd><kwd>NOCA-1</kwd><kwd>ninein</kwd><kwd>Patronin</kwd><kwd>PTRN-1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM074207</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oegema</surname><given-names>Karen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> ninein homolog NOCA-1 is important for the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays required for embryo production, nuclear positioning and larval development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Differentiated cells assemble non-centrosomal microtubule arrays to perform structural, mechanical, and transport-based functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keating and Borisy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolini and Gundersen, 2006</xref>). Examples include the neuronal microtubule arrays that structure axons and dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kuijpers and Hoogenraad, 2011</xref>), longitudinal arrays of parallel microtubules in syncytial myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Warren, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>), and non-centrosomal arrays in epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keating and Borisy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolini and Gundersen, 2006</xref>). In simple epithelia, cells build arrays of parallel microtubules that run along their apical–basal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Keating and Borisy, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bartolini and Gundersen, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman and Priess, 2012</xref>), whereas desmosomal cell–cell junctions organize microtubule arrays that form around the periphery of stratified epithelial cells in mouse skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sumigray et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The radial organization of centrosomal arrays arises from the fact that microtubules are nucleated, and their nascent minus ends capped and anchored, by centrosomally targeted protein complexes. Similarly, assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays is likely to involve targeting of microtubule nucleating, as well as minus-end protection and/or anchoring factors, to non-centrosomal sites. Important current goals include identifying the factors that control the assembly of non-centrosomal arrays and determining the extent of overlap between the mechanisms utilized at centrosomes and non-centrosomal sites in different tissues.</p><p>Complexes containing γ-tubulin, a specialized tubulin isoform implicated in microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oegema et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>), are thought to contribute to the assembly of both centrosomal and non-centrosomal arrays. During the differentiation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> tracheal epithelial cells, both γ-tubulin complexes, and the center of microtubule nucleation in regrowth experiments, transition from centrosomes to the apical cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodu et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, γ-tubulin is also targeted to the cell surface in the embryonic epidermis and germline, and the apical cell surface in the intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fridolfsson and Starr, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman and Priess, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Ninein is a large coiled-coil protein that localizes to the sub-distal appendages of mother centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>), where it is thought to anchor centrosomal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>). During the differentiation of mouse cochlear epithelial cells, ninein re-localizes from centrosomes to the apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moss et al., 2007</xref>); ninein re-localization also occurs during the differentiation of stratified epithelial cells in the mouse epidermis, where it targets to desmosomal junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>). Inhibition of the core desmosomal component, desmoplakin, disrupts ninein targeting and formation of the peripheral non-centrosomal microtubule array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>), but direct evidence that ninein is important for array formation is currently lacking.</p><p>The Patronin/CAMSAP/Nezha family of minus end-associated proteins, conserved among animals with differentiated tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baines et al., 2009</xref>), are also implicated in the formation of non-centrosomal arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>). Members of this protein family are thought to be involved in protecting microtubule minus ends from depolymerizing kinesins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hendershott and Vale, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> each have one family member (Patronin and PTRN-1, respectively), whereas vertebrates have three (calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein or CAMSAP1-3). Although initially identified in cultured epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), the main in vivo phenotypes associated with knockdown of Patronin/CAMSAP/Nezha family members have been in neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">King et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yau et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>As outlined above, γ-tubulin and Patronin respectively harbor minus-end nucleation and protection activities, and ninein is proposed to anchor microtubules. Mechanistic work has also raised the possibility of functional redundancies between minus end-associated factors. For example, in addition to being a microtubule nucleator, γ-tubulin complexes can cap microtubule minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Keating and Borisy, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wiese and Zheng, 2000</xref>). Similarly, CAMSAP-tubulin stretches may function as seeds that allow microtubule regrowth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>), and both ninein and Patronin family members localize to junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2008</xref>) where they could serve anchoring functions. Hence, another important open question is the extent to which minus end-associated factors function collaboratively or redundantly during microtubule array assembly in vivo.</p><p>Here, we characterize the <italic>C. elegans</italic> protein NOCA-1 (non-centrosomal array 1), a protein we identified in a prior high-content screen because its inhibition phenocopied the effect of γ-tubulin removal on germline morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2011</xref>). We show that NOCA-1 shares homology with vertebrate ninein and identify isoforms that are necessary and sufficient for NOCA-1 function in three different tissues. We explore the functional relationship between NOCA-1, γ-tubulin, and Patronin/PTRN-1 in the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays. In the larval epidermis, NOCA-1 functions with γ-tubulin in parallel to Patronin/PTRN-1 to assemble a circumferential microtubule array required for larval development. In the germline and embryonic epidermis, NOCA-1 functions independently of Patronin to promote assembly of microtubule arrays required for nuclear positioning. Cumulatively, our results suggest that NOCA-1 functions together with γ-tubulin to direct the assembly of non-centrosomal arrays in multiple tissues and highlight functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin families of microtubule cytoskeleton-controlling proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NOCA-1 has multiple isoforms with a shared C-terminal domain that is homologous to a region of vertebrate ninein</title><p>The <italic>noca-1</italic> locus is large (23 kb) and more complex than typical for <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes, encoding eight alternatively spliced isoforms that share a common 466 amino acid C-terminal domain with a predicted coiled-coil region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

The 40% that survived were small and uncoordinated (Small Unc; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We conclude that NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 are redundantly required for larval development and viability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Patronin and NOCA-1 co-sediment with microtubules from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts</title><p>Patronin family members bind to microtubule minus ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hendershott and Vale, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>).

Employing a kinesin gliding assay to define polarity at physiological ionic strength (100 mM KCl), we observed puncta of GFP::PTRN-1 and GFP::DmPatronin at the leading end of gliding microtubules, indicating binding to minus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, <italic>C. elegans</italic> PTRN-1 possesses the minus end recognition activity predicted based on its homology to Patronin family proteins.</p><p>Both NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 were detected in the pellet after microtubule sedimentation from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), indicating that NOCA-1 possesses either a direct or indirect microtubule-binding activity. To determine if purified NOCA-1 binds directly to microtubules, we purified GFP-tagged NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup> and NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> from insect cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Hydrodynamic analysis in 500 mM salt indicated that both NOCA-1 fusions were dimeric, whereas GFP-tagged PTRN-1 and DmPatronin were monomeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B–D</xref>). Unfortunately, lowering the ionic strength to physiological levels caused both NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> and NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup> to precipitate. Adding detergents or stabilizers, such as glycerol or sucrose, did not circumvent this problem; however, we were able to generate an MBP::NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>::GFP fusion that was soluble at physiological ionic strength. While the ability of this soluble fusion to co-sediment with microtubules was negligible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E,F</xref>), we did observe that aggregated forms of NOCA-1 fusion proteins associated with microtubules. When small aggregates of GFP::NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup> or GFP::NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> were analyzed in a coverslip-anchorage assay, analogous to that performed previously for Patronin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goodwin and Vale, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>), they anchored microtubules by binding to their ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Similarly, dilution of MBP::NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>::GFP into a classical microtubule assay buffer caused it to form small aggregates that bound along the lengths of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5B</xref>). These results hint that NOCA-1 may associate directly with microtubules, although significant additional work will be necessary to overcome the limitations imposed by the low solubility of purified NOCA-1 in order to rigorously assess microtubule interactions in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>NOCA-1 and Patronin/PTRN-1 control assembly of a circumferential microtubule array required for larval development</title><p>The failure of larval development in the <italic>noca-1∆; ptrn-1∆</italic> double mutant indicated that NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 function in parallel to promote larval growth and morphogenesis. Mitotic spindle assembly in the early embryo and embryonic viability were not affected by either single or double inhibitions of NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that their redundant function essential for larval development is likely in a differentiated tissue, and not in the formation of centrosomal microtubule arrays required for cell division. To identify this tissue, we expressed PTRN-1::GFP under different tissue-specific promoters. PTRN-1::GFP expressed from its endogenous promoter (P<italic>ptrn-1</italic>) rescued the synthetic lethality of the <italic>noca-1∆; ptrn-1∆</italic> double mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and localized in multiple tissues, including the larval/adult epidermis, neurons, intestine, and pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Consistent with this impression, the density of EB1 comets was substantially reduced when only PTRN-1 was present (<italic>noca-1∆</italic>) but was comparable to controls when only NOCA-1 was present (<italic>ptrn-1∆</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). EB1 signal was observed along the lattice of the bundles and only occasionally in comets when only PTRN-1 was present, possibly due to the reduced number of growing microtubule ends.

DLG-1::GFP outlines the junctions between the body epidermis and the seam cell syncytia that are embedded along the left and right sides of the worm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). In wild-type worms, parallel lines of DLG-1::GFP are observed running along the entire body length. In contrast, in <italic>noca-1∆; ptrn-1∆</italic> double mutants, seam cell syncytia were frequently branched/broken (71%; n = 17) as well as disconnected from the head epidermis (68%; n = 22; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This result suggests that the circumferential microtubule array in the body epidermis could have a role in positioning the seam cells prior to fusion. However, since the P<italic>dpy-7</italic> promoter also directs expression in the seam cells, we also cannot rule out that the fusion defect results from direct effects on the seam cells or their capacity to fuse. In addition to seam cell defects, the cuticles of <italic>noca-1∆; ptrn-1∆</italic> mutant worms became permeable to the normally excluded Hoechst dye, beginning ∼24 hr after the L1 larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).

Since γ-tubulin is essential for cell division, analyzing its role in the larval epidermis required eliminating γ-tubulin function after the tissue is already formed. To achieve this, we developed a method based on two previously described protein degradation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caussinus et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armenti et al., 2014</xref>) for tissue-specific degradation of a functional GFP-fused target protein. Since fluorescently tagged γ-tubulin fusions were not fully functional (<italic>not shown</italic>), we used a CRISPR/Cas9-mediated strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dickinson et al., 2013</xref>) to insert a C-terminal GFP tag in the endogenous locus of <italic>gip-2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), which encodes an essential component of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> γ-tubulin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hannak et al., 2002</xref>). Endogenously tagged GIP-2 fully supported the essential functions of the γ-tubulin complex, as indicated by the normal development of worms homozygous for the insertion. To specifically degrade GIP-2::GFP in the epidermis, we expressed a GFP nanobody::ZIF-1 fusion under an epidermal promoter (P<italic>dpy-7</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This fusion, which we call <italic>epiDEG</italic>, serves as a GFP-to-ligase adapter that recognizes GFP-fused target proteins and brings them to the ECS (Elongin-C, Cul2, SOCS-box family) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex for ubiquitination and proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeRenzo et al., 2003</xref>).

As full-length NOCA-1h and NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup>, which lack the h isoform-specific region, are both functional, we analyzed the localization of both in control and γ-tubulin-depleted germlines. Surprisingly, NOCA-1<sup>LICR+NHD</sup> required γ-tubulin to localize to compartment surfaces whereas full-length NOCA-1h did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). This result suggested that the non-essential isoform-specific region of NOCA-1h harbors a γ-tubulin-independent cell surface targeting activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Consistent with this idea, a GFP fusion with the h isoform specific region localized to compartment surfaces, and this localization was dependent on a predicted palmitoylation site (cysteine 10; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Mutation of this predicted palmitoylation site in the full-length protein (NOCA-1h<sup>C10A</sup>) did not compromise NOCA-1h function but rendered its localization γ-tubulin dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result explains why NOCA-1h localization at compartment surfaces was not eliminated by γ-tubulin depletion and implicates a potential lipid modification in providing a redundant means for NOCA-1 targeting to the membrane.</p><p>γ-tubulin could direct NOCA-1 localization to the cell surface either through a direct interaction or indirectly through nucleated microtubules. To distinguish these two possibilities, we disrupted microtubule assembly by using RNAi to deplete α-tubulin. While this disrupted germline structure to a comparable extent to inhibition of NOCA-1 or γ-tubulin, cell surface targeting of NOCA-1h<sup>C10A</sup> was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This result suggests that an interaction between NOCA-1<sup>NHD+LICR</sup> and the γ-tubulin complex may contribute to recruitment of NOCA-1 to the cell surface. However, we have not yet detected an interaction in immunoprecipitations from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts or yeast two-hybrid experiments with NOCA-1 and γ-tubulin complex components, indicating that additional work is needed to understand precisely how γ-tubulin promotes the cell surface recruitment of NOCA-1. Based on these results, we conclude that the γ-tubulin complex recruits NOCA-1 to the cell surface, where they are both required to generate functional non-centrosomal microtubule arrays that position nuclei within compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>NOCA-1, but not PTRN-1, is required for the function of a non-centrosomal microtubule array that positions nuclei in the embryonic epidermis</title><p>Our prior work suggested that NOCA-1 is also involved in assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays that position nuclei in the embryonic epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Green et al., 2011</xref>).

Like NOCA-1, ninein has been shown to re-localize to the cell surface during the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in simple and stratified epithelia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lechler and Fuchs, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moss et al., 2007</xref>), suggesting a role in the assembly of non-centrosomal microtubule arrays. Our results show that in the germline and embryonic epidermis NOCA-1 and γ-tubulin are required independently of Patronin/PTRN-1, whereas in the larval/adult epidermis, the NOCA-1/γ-tubulin pathway and the Patronin-dependent pathway redundantly support microtubule generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

We identified three NOCA-1 isoforms that are each necessary and sufficient to promote the assembly of different non-centrosomal microtubule arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This pattern suggests that the remaining five NOCA-1 isoforms will function with γ-tubulin in the assembly of microtubule arrays in tissues that we have not yet characterized; some of these may also act in parallel to PTRN-1. Importantly, the isoform-specific regions were not essential for NOCA-1 function in the three different contexts analyzed, suggesting that these regions primarily reflect use of alterative promoters/transcriptional start sites. In the germline, the tissue-specific isoform region directed non-essential, γ-tubulin-independent membrane localization, potentially via palmitoylation of a cysteine residue in the extreme N-terminus. Whether this residue is indeed palmitoylated will need to be addressed in future work.</p><p>In the tissues we analyzed, NOCA-1 co-localized with γ-tubulin (except at centrosomes) and NOCA-1 inhibition phenocopied inhibition of γ-tubulin, blocking the key functions of the arrays and leading to a similar reduction in the number of EB1-marked growing microtubule ends. In the germline, where we were able to analyze localization dependencies, γ-tubulin localized to the cell surface independently of NOCA-1. Understanding how γ-tubulin is recruited to non-centrosomal sites is an important question, as SPD-5, the major pericentriolar material matrix component that is thought to recruit γ-tubulin to centrosomes, is not recruited to non-centrosomal sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldman and Priess, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the NOCA-1-independent targeting of γ-tubulin complexes, a functional version of NOCA-1 lacking the putative palmitoylation site, required γ-tubulin for its cell surface targeting. Depleting α-tubulin, while having a comparable effect to γ-tubulin removal on germline structure, did not disrupt NOCA-1 targeting. This result suggests that NOCA-1 may be recruited to the surface via an interaction with γ-tubulin rather than the microtubules that it nucleates, although we cannot fully exclude a contribution from residual microtubules in the α-tubulin depletion.</p><p>Our functional analysis raises the important mechanistic question of how γ-tubulin and NOCA-1 act together. One model is that γ-tubulin complexes at non-centrosomal sites recruit NOCA-1, which in turn activates their nucleating activity, leading to generation of new microtubules. Structural work on γ-tubulin containing complexes has suggested that their activation may be coupled to interaction with factors that recruit them to specific sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>). Since <italic>C. elegans</italic>, like budding yeast, has components of the γTuSC (γ-tubulin small complex) but not the γTuRC (γ-tubulin ring complex), one possibility is that NOCA-1 would drive assembly of the γTuSC into larger γTuRC-like complexes as proposed for γTuSC-anchoring factors in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kollman et al., 2011</xref>). A second model is that NOCA-1 is recruited by γ-tubulin to generate a structure that stabilizes and/or anchors nascent microtubule minus ends generated by γ-tubulin's nucleating activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Discriminating between these and other possibilities will require solving the challenge of analyzing purified NOCA-1 at physiological ionic strengths, which would enable better reconstitution of the interaction between NOCA-1 and microtubules (whether direct or indirect) in vitro and also enable analysis under conditions that include γ-tubulin-mediated nucleation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relationship between NOCA-1 and Patronin/PTRN-1</title><p>NOCA-1 functions independently of PTRN-1 in some tissues, and in parallel to PTRN-1 in the larval/adult epidermis, where the NHD of NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 function redundantly to generate a circumferential array of microtubule bundles immediately juxtaposed to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa et al., 1997</xref>). Imaging the dynamics of these bundles revealed that, despite the functional redundancy in supporting growth and morphogenesis, the microtubule arrays formed in the presence of NOCA-1 or PTRN-1 alone were distinct. When PTRN-1 was removed and only NOCA-1 was present, the microtubule growth rate and the number of growing EB1-marked microtubule ends were similar to controls. In contrast, removal of NOCA-1 led to a dramatic effect, causing a threefold reduction in the number of growing EB1-marked microtubule ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). At the same time, the microtubules appeared to be less dynamic, and the appearance of the arrays combined with an ∼20% reduction in growth rate suggests that there may be a small shift in the monomer/polymer balance towards more polymer. One possibility is that these effects result from the differences in the persistence of NOCA-1/γ-tubulin vs Patronin-based structures at microtubule minus ends. For example, NOCA-1/γ-tubulin might release microtubule minus ends more readily, perhaps leading to minus end depolymerization and shorter microtubules, whereas Patronin stretches might be less likely to be released leading to longer microtubules. Differences in microtubule length and minus-end dynamics could, in turn, affect plus-end dynamics. Alternatively, as has previously been proposed for γ-tubulin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oakley et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that NOCA-1/γ-tubulin and Patronin-based structures affect plus-end dynamics by promoting the loading of different microtubule dynamicity factors. In this vein, the effect of NOCA-1 removal on EB1::GFP localization is particularly interesting. When NOCA-1 is removed, increased amounts of EB1::GFP are observed along the length of the microtubules and an increase is also observed in EB1 comet length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). It would be very interesting if NOCA-1/γ-tubulin vs Patronin-based structures at minus ends impacted the loading of factors that affect EB1 clearance from microtubules. The differences in the effects of NOCA-1 vs Patronin depletion raise the possibility that the choice between NOCA-1/ninein and/or PTRN-1/Patronin family members in different tissues may be related to the dynamicity (or lack thereof) required for the functions of different types of microtubule arrays. It will be particularly interesting to analyze NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 in the nervous system, where PTRN-1 has already been shown to support normal neuronal morphology and contribute to microtubule assembly and axon regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marcette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richardson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The field is still in the early stages of investigating the question of redundancy between microtubule minus end-associated factors with respect to nucleating, stabilizing, and anchoring nascent minus ends. In vertebrate epithelial cells, Patronin/CAMSAP-mediated microtubule assembly has been reported to be independent of γ-tubulin-mediated nucleation and to potentially even compete with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast, in rat hippocampal neurons, γ-tubulin has been proposed to nucleate microtubules that are subsequently stabilized by CAMSAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). Our results in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval epidermis where NOCA-1 and Patronin/PTRN-1 are in parallel pathways with respect to microtubule generation, suggest that γ-tubulin cooperates with NOCA-1 but not with Patronin/PTRN-1. Whether Patronin/PTRN-1 promotes the assembly microtubules on its own in this context or functions together with other factors such as severing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Roll-Mecak and Vale, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lindeboom et al., 2013</xref>) will be important to address in the future.</p><p>In summary, our work has shown that NOCA-1, a protein with homology to vertebrate ninein, functions together with γ-tubulin in the generation of microtubules in non-centrosomal microtubule arrays. Our results shed light on non-centrosomal microtubule array formation in diverse tissues in a whole organism and also reveal functional overlap between the ninein and Patronin families of microtubule cytoskeleton-regulating proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Worm strains</title><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

The images were then subjected to ‘Gaussian blur’ (Sigma = 1 pixel) and ‘Find Maxima...’ (noise = 2) to pinpoint all GFP puncta. GFP puncta were enclosed for signal measurements by expanding the selection by 3 pixels on all sides to generate 7-pixel diameter circular regions centered over the 1-pixel-sized selections; area [in] and mean intensity [in] were measured for these regions. Background measurements were generated for each region by expanding the 7-pixel diameter circles by 3 more pixels on each side to generate 13-pixel diameter circular regions centered over the same 1-pixel-sized selections and measuring Area [out] and Mean Intensity [out]. The average background intensity was calculated as Background Intensity = (Area [out] × Mean Intensity [out] − Area [in] × Mean Intensity [in])/(Area [out] − Area [in]). The total intensity of the signal was calculated as Total Intensity = Area [in] × (Mean Intensity [in] − Background Intensity). The normalized intensity is the Total Intensity divided by the Image Area. For measuring the membrane and centrosomal GIP-2::GFP intensity in the germline, the Image Area was obtained using exactly the same strategy as in the epidermis. The tiff images were subjected to ‘Gaussian blur’ (sigma = 1 pixel) and ‘setThreshold’ (lowThreshold = 0, highThreshold = 211) to narrow down the selection to membranes and centrosomes. To get all signals, the selection was expanded by adding 6 pixels on all sides and measuring Area [in] and Mean Intensity [in] in this region.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript identifies a putative <italic>C. elegans</italic> ortholog of ninein (called NOCA-1), characterizes its in vivo functional roles and its microtubule binding properties and demonstrates genetic interactions with the minus-end binding protein Ptrn-1/Patronin. NOCA-1 was previously shown by the Oegema group to be required for germline development and fertility. Here, they find that it genetically interacts with and is synthetic lethal with mutations in Ptrn-1 (a minus end binding protein). The essential function occurs in the <italic>epidermis</italic> where NOCA-1 and Ptrn-1 collaborate to generate bundled microtubule arrays. The authors perform detailed studies to determine the isoforms required for function of NOCA-1 in three distinct tissues. Furthermore, the authors purify NOCA-1 fragments to get at the underlying mechanism/biochemical properties of NOCA-1 and conclude that it can bind to microtubule ends, although, in contrast to in vivo data which point to microtubule minus-end related function, a bias for microtubule plus-end binding is observed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The conclusion about NOCA-1 binding to microtubule ends is mostly based on one experiment, which is not very convincing. First, the control experiment with kinesin does not provide a fair comparison, because the kinesin (K560-GFP) is abundantly absorbed on glass, while NOCA-1 and Patronin are present as very sparse dots. It also appears that Patronin and NOCA-1 are present in clusters, while the kinesin is not. It is possible that if larger kinesin clusters were sparsely attached to glass, binding to microtubule ends would be observed as well. The control thus needs to be made more comparable to the “difficult” NOCA-1 preparation. Second, since Patronin does not show preference for the minus ends in this assay, the specificity of the assay is uncertain. Therefore, the authors should strongly downplay their conclusions on NOCA-1 being a microtubule end-binding protein, especially in the title and Abstract. Alternatively, they should provide additional data supporting specific microtubule minus end binding. Since the possibilities to work with NOCA-1 in vitro are strongly limited by its poor solubility, perhaps the authors can perform some experiments with GFP-NOCA-1 in cells (such as mammalian cells or any other cellular model) to prove that NOCA-1 indeed binds to microtubule ends.</p><p>2) The data supporting the conclusion on NOCA-1 organizing non-centrosomal microtubule arrays are quite weak. There is a clear loss of non-centrosomal arrays in the <italic>epidermis</italic> upon loss of NOCA-1 and Ptrn-1, though the actual functions of each one are still unclear (and the arrays are fine upon loss of NOCA-1 alone). In the other tissues, no data was given to show that non-centrosomal microtubule arrays were in fact disrupted and that NOCA-1 wasn't required for the proper dynamics of these structures rather than their formation and or organization. Thus, this seems to be based largely on the way that others have thought about ninein function in mammalian cells. It is also unclear how the minus end binding activity results in the phenotypes seen in vivo (such as changes in microtubule growth rates. The conclusions, especially in the title and Abstract of the paper, must be formulated more cautiously, and a better discussion should be provided.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, the authors document distal gonad defects, with γ-tubulin and <italic>noca-1</italic> mutants being similar. While the authors quantify brood sizes, they do not indicate whether the distal gonad cellular defects are reproducible. Some quantification of these defects would improve the manuscript.</p><p>4) The homology with ninein seems to be rather weak. Is it more significant than similarity to any other coiled coil protein(s)? In the alignment in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, it would be helpful to indicate the positions of hydrophobic residues in the heptad repeat, so that it becomes more clear which additional residues are conserved. If the ninein homology is borderline, the point about NOCA-1 being a “ninein-related protein” would need to be downplayed, especially in the title and Abstract of the paper.</p><p>5) The authors suggest that cell surface targeting of NOCA-1h occurs through the palmitoylation site in NOCA-1h specific region; although not essential, testing this prediction by mutating the site would strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>6) In the subsection “NOCA-1 and Patronin/PTRN-1 control assembly of a circumferential microtubule array required for the integrity of the larval/adult <italic>epidermis</italic>”, the authors ask if the microtubule array in the <italic>epidermis</italic> is important for morphogenesis, but fail to reference the landmark work of Priess and Hirsh (1987, Dev Biol) that includes evidence in support of such a role for microtubules. Indeed, the authors never reference this key publication with respect to the morphogenesis defects, which is surprising.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08649.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Prior to describing the significant revisions made in response to the reviewers’ comments, we would like to briefly summarize an entirely new approach that we developed and employed that has significantly extended our conclusions and is included in the revised manuscript. Both the approach and the results we obtained are shown in an entirely new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. In brief, our work had revealed parallel roles for NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 in the formation of a functional circumferential microtubule array in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic> of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. An important question raised by this finding was whether the γ-tubulin complex acted together with one or both of these factors in non-centrosomal array formation. This experiment was not feasible because the essential role of the γ-tubulin complex in cell division had precluded our ability to analyze its function in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>. We were able to overcome this limitation by developing a strategy that enabled selective removal of an essential subunit of the γ-tubulin small complex, GIP-2, in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>. In this strategy, we first tagged the endogenous locus encoding GIP-2 with GFP and confirmed functionality of the GIP-2::GFP. Next we engineered a GFP degron that can act in a tissue-specific manner (our degron strategy was inspired by two prior approaches, as described in the manuscript text). We demonstrated that this approach specifically degraded GIP-2::GFP in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>, and thus allowed us to test γ-tubulin complex function in that tissue. By combining the GIP-2::GFP and the tissue-specific GFP degron with <italic>noca-1∆</italic> or <italic>ptrn-1∆</italic>, we obtained a very clear result – the γ-tubulin complex acts together with NOCA-1 (i.e. degradation of GIP-2 does not enhance <italic>noca-1∆)</italic> and in parallel to PTRN-1 (i.e. degradation of GIP-2 strongly enhances <italic>ptrn-1∆</italic>). We believe this is a very important result that significantly extends the conclusions presented in our study and should guide future analysis of various minus end-directed activities in other systems.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The conclusion about NOCA-1 binding to microtubule ends is mostly based on one experiment, which is not very convincing. First, the control experiment with kinesin does not provide a fair comparison, because the kinesin (K560-GFP) is abundantly absorbed on glass, while NOCA-1 and Patronin are present as very sparse dots. It also appears that Patronin and NOCA-1 are present in clusters, while the kinesin is not. It is possible that if larger kinesin clusters were sparsely attached to glass, binding to microtubule ends would be observed as well. The control thus needs to be made more comparable to the “difficult” NOCA-1 preparation. Second, since Patronin does not show preference for the minus ends in this assay, the specificity of the assay is uncertain. Therefore, the authors should strongly downplay their conclusions on NOCA-1 being a microtubule end-binding protein, especially in the title and Abstract. Alternatively, they should provide additional data supporting specific microtubule minus end binding. Since the possibilities to work with NOCA-1</italic> in vitro <italic>are strongly limited by its poor solubility, perhaps the authors</italic> can <italic>perform some experiments with GFP-NOCA-1 in cells (such as mammalian cells or any other cellular model) to prove that NOCA-1 indeed binds to microtubule ends</italic>.</p><p>Like PTRN-1, NOCA-1 co-sediments with microtubules from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts, suggesting that it binds, either directly or indirectly, to microtubules. As the reviewers highlight, the data supporting direct binding of NOCA-1 binding to microtubule ends has been limited by poor solubility of purified NOCA-1 fragments at physiological ionic strength. During the revision period, we did substantial additional work, outlined in detail below, aimed at clarifying the relationship between NOCA-1 clustering and microtubule binding. This effort revealed that we can only observe binding of purified NOCA-1 fusions to the microtubule lattice and/or microtubule ends when we induce the proteins to form small aggregates. As it is possible that this is an artifact that does not occur in vivo, we decided to <italic>move the end anchoring assay data (old</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C–E</italic></xref><italic>) to the supplement where we also now include the results of our new biochemical efforts</italic>. Despite the fact that we do not yet have clarity on this issue, we think it is important to document what we have tried, which represents over a year of work, to provide a foundation for future efforts (the biochemistry data is now presented in two new figure supplements, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref>). As suggested, we have removed the suggestion that NOCA-1 is a microtubule end-binding protein from the title and Abstract and have shifted the focus of the manuscript to the analysis of the relative roles of NOCA-1, PTRN-1 and γ-tubulin in the assembly of functional non-centrosomal microtubule arrays in three different <italic>C. elegans</italic> tissues. To facilitate this shift in focus, we added a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, in which we employ a tissue-specific protein degradation system that we developed to deplete the essentialγ–tubulin complex component GIP-2 from the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>. This approach allowed us to build on our prior finding that NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 function in parallel pathways for microtubule generation in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>, to show that theγ–tubulin complex promotes microtubule generation in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic> by acting with NOCA-1 and in parallel to the Patronin-dependent pathway. In accordance with these revisions the manuscript has been re-titled to: “NOCA-1 Functions withγ-tubulin and in Parallel to Patronin to Assemble Non-Centrosomal Microtubule Arrays in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”.</p><p>Summary of experiments to examine NOCA-1 microtubule binding:</p><p>In attempt to get more definitive data on the question of whether and how NOCA-1 binds to microtubules, we first attempted the approach suggested by the reviewers, and tried to use a polyclonal GFP antibody to cluster established microtubule side binding proteins (the kinesin K560-GFP) and the microtubule lattice binding protein (NDC80-GFP) to see if we could generate clusters that would anchor microtubule ends like we have seen for NOCA-1 and PTRN-1. This approach did not work, as we were not able to generate clusters of comparable size/morphology to those observed for NOCA-1 or Patronin. We also took the reviewers’ suggestion and tried to transiently expressed mRuby fused NOCA-1 in a U2OS cell line that stably expresses GFP labeled tubulin. However, the mRuby fusion of NOCA-1 formed large aggregates, preventing further analysis.</p><p>We were able to increase the solubility of the NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>-GFP fusion by addition of an MBP tag to its N-terminus. The resulting MBP-NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>-GFP was soluble in H100 buffer (25 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.6, 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and eluted following gel filtration in a single major peak (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4D</xref>) at a size that indicated that it was not aggregated. We performed microtubule co-sedimentation assays using 1.2 μM of the soluble MBP-NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>-GFP fusion and 3 μM of taxol-stabilized microtubules in H100 buffer, H50 buffer (25 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.6, 50 mM NaCl and 1 mM DTT) and HK75 buffer (50 mM Hepes-NaOH pH 7.6, 75 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA and 1 mM DTT), but did not observe microtubule co-pelleting (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4E</xref>). Consistent with the co-sedimentation results, the soluble MBP-NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>-GFP fusion showed no microtubule binding at 1 μM in H100 buffer in a flow-cell based microtubule-gliding assay (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5B</xref>). Interestingly, however, dilution of 6–60 nM MBP-NOCA-1<sup>NHD</sup>-GFP into the classic microtubule binding buffer BRB80 (80 mM Pipes-KOH pH 6.8, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) induced the formation of small, homogeneous clusters that exhibited robust microtubule lattice binding (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5C</xref>).</p><p>In summary, to date we have only observed binding of purified NOCA-1 proteins to microtubule lattice and/or ends when we induce the protein to form small aggregates. As it is possible that this is some type of artifact that does not occur in vivo, it remains unclear whether NOCA-1 can bind directly to microtubules. The biochemical analysis for purified NOCA-1 proteins is now summarized in two supplemental figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1–figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1–figure supplement 5</xref>) to guide future efforts.</p><p><italic>2) The data supporting the conclusion on NOCA-1 organizing non-centrosomal microtubule arrays are quite weak. There is a clear loss of non-centrosomal arrays in the epidermis upon loss of NOCA-1 and Ptrn-1, though the actual functions of each one are still unclear (and the arrays are fine upon loss of NOCA-1 alone). In the other tissues, no data was given to show that non-centrosomal microtubule arrays were in fact disrupted and that NOCA-1 wasn't required for the proper dynamics of these structures rather than their formation and or organization. Thus, this seems to be based largely on the way that others have thought about ninein function in mammalian cells. It is also unclear how the minus end binding activity results in the phenotypes seen</italic> in vivo <italic>(such as changes in microtubule growth rates. The conclusions, especially in the title and Abstract of the paper, must be formulated more cautiously, and a better discussion should be provided</italic>.</p><p>We addressed this issue by adding images of the microtubule cytoskeleton (GFP::β-tubulin) for the germline and embryonic <italic>epidermis</italic> to the main figures (new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), along with additional explanation to the text to clarify the changes in each array and what has been assayed in each tissue context (discussed in detail below). To accommodate the additional data (and the reviewers request to partition out the isoform analysis), we split our original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, which had the data for both tissues, into two figures with the data for the germline array in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (including new panels added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and for the embryonic epidermal array in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (including new panels added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). As discussed above, based on our re-assessment of whether NOCA-1 binds directly to microtubules and our new data analyzing the function of the γ-tubulin complex in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>, we have changed the focus of the paper, along with the title and the Abstract. As requested, we have also provided a better discussion with a new accompanying model figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Below we discuss the data from the different tissues and whether they suggest a role for NOCA-1 in microtubule organization vs microtubule assembly and/or dynamics. Note that in the previous version, we used “microtubule organization” in a general sense to imply that the microtubule arrays were functionally compromised when NOCA-1 was inhibited either alone (germline or embryonic <italic>epidermis</italic>) or in conjunction with PTRN-1 (larval <italic>epidermis</italic>). In the revised version we now use more specific language to describe the consequences of protein removal in each of the tissue contexts.</p><p>As the reviewers highlight, simultaneous inhibition of NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 leads to loss of microtubule bundles in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>, indicating that at some level both of these proteins contribute to generating the microtubules that make up this array. The microtubule array in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic> is particularly suitable for analysis of the effect of protein inhibition on array structure and microtubule dynamics, since the overall structure of the tissue remains relatively constant upon depletion of one or both proteins, and we have now also been able to build a system to specifically knockdown an essentialγ–tubulin complex component after differentiation in this tissue (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Due to these experimental advantages, the larval <italic>epidermis</italic> is our “flagship” array that we describe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1-3</xref>. In this array, inhibition of PTRN-1 alone does not appear to substantially alter microtubule dynamics, whereas NOCA-1 inhibition leads to a more stable microtubule array with substantially fewer growing microtubule ends that grow at a reduced rate (now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2 media3">Videos 2 and 3</xref>). Based on these results, we conclude that both NOCA-1 and PTRN-1 are involved in the generation of microtubules in the larval epidermal array and that the presence of NOCA-1 significantly alters the dynamics of microtubules within this array.</p><p>In the syncytial germline, we focused on the non-centrosomal arrays that form within the compartments in the pachytene region of the germline. For clarity, we have added schematics and immunofluorescence images of this array in control worms (new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). These arrays hold the meiotic nuclei in juxtaposition to the cell surface within the compartments, which are open on one side to a cytoplasmic channel called the rachis that runs down the center of the germline, to prevent them from falling into the rachis. Within the rachis there are also a large number of microtubules that flow with the streaming cytoplasm into the forming oocytes. How these microtubules are related to the arrays within the compartments is not entirely clear. When we delete NOCA-1 or deplete γ-tubulin, all of the nuclei fall out of their compartments and cluster in the rachis, indicating a dramatic failure in the function of the compartment microtubule arrays. This nuclear fallout is coupled to degeneration of compartment structure (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, unlike the situation in the larval <italic>epidermis</italic>, the fact that compartments with normal structure cease to exist as the microtubule arrays fail and the nuclei fall into the rachis, makes it impossible to do a proper “before and after” comparison to assess the impact of loss of NOCA-1 and γ-tubulin on the structure of the compartment arrays and the dynamics of their constituent microtubules. As a proxy, we examine the effect on the number of growing microtubule ends in the rachis (the only structure that exists before and after the inhibitions) and we observe that comet density is reduced ∼ 2-fold by NOCA-1 or γ-tubulin inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). From this, we can conclude that NOCA-1 and γ-tubulin are required to assemble/maintain functional microtubule arrays in the germline compartments. We now discuss the limitations of this tissue with respect to analyzing changes in microtubule organization and dynamics within the compartment arrays in the text.</p><p>In the embryonic <italic>epidermis</italic>, we have added new images to show the microtubule skeleton in control and <italic>noca-1Δ</italic> embryos (new panels added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These images revealed an apparent reduction in the intensity of the microtubule cytoskeleton in the absence of NOCA-1 – suggesting that there are fewer microtubules in these arrays. Consistent with this, we also observed a 2-fold reduction in the number of growing microtubule ends marked by EB1::GFP.</p><p>Cumulatively, these data suggest that NOCA-1 functions with γ-tubulin to promote microtubule assembly, which we now highlight in a model figure added to accompany the expanded discussion (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our thinking about the functions of NOCA-1 was not that heavily impacted by the microtubule anchoring function that has been subscribed to ninein, as we did not realize NOCA-1 was a potential ninein homolog until we began to write up the work. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that NOCA-1 could have a role in microtubule anchoring in addition to its role in promoting assembly.</p><p><italic>3) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>, the authors document distal gonad defects, with γ-tubulin and</italic> noca-1 <italic>mutants being similar. While the authors quantify brood sizes, they do not indicate whether the distal gonad cellular defects are reproducible. Some quantification of these defects would improve the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Thank you for picking up on this, which we overlooked in the original version due to the fact that the phenotypes are 100% penetrant and look the same in all worms. We now provide quantification of all of the phenotypes assessed by imaging. For clarity, the region of the gonad that we analyze is the region immediately prior to the turn, where nuclei in the pachytene stage of meiosis are held in their compartments by non-centrosomal arrays (rather than the distal region of the gonad where the nuclei undergo mitotic divisions). We show that <italic>noca-1</italic> deletion results in the same phenotype as depleting γ-tubulin by RNAi; nuclei fall out of their compartments and clump together in the rachis center. Deletion of <italic>ptrn-1</italic> does not cause this phenotype. We document this phenotype in two strains expressing either a GFP-tagged plasma membrane probe with mCherry::histone (now in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) or GFP::β-tubulin (moved from the supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We now include the number of germlines imaged and the penetrance of the nuclear fallout phenotype in the figure legend. Between the two strains we have imaged 36 control germlines (0% exhibit nuclear fallout), 17 <italic>γ-tubulin(RNAi)</italic> germlines (100% exhibit nuclear fallout), 25 <italic>noca-1Δ</italic> germlines (100% exhibit nuclear fallout) and 18 <italic>ptrn-1Δ</italic> germlines (0% exhibit nuclear fallout).</p><p><italic>4) The homology with ninein seems to be rather weak. Is it more significant than similarity to any other coiled coil protein(s)? In the alignment in the</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, it would be helpful to indicate the positions of hydrophobic residues in the heptad repeat, so that it becomes more clear which additional residues are conserved. If the ninein homology is borderline, the point about NOCA-1 being a “ninein-related protein” would need to be downplayed, especially in the title and Abstract of the paper</italic>.</p><p>The homology between NOCA-1 and ninein is more significant than the similarity of either protein to other coiled coiled proteins. We have now added two new panels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B, C</xref>) to make this point and highlight how the homology was identified. As we explain in the legend to this figure, the homology between nematode NOCA-1 homologs and vertebrate nineins was discovered in an NCBI blast using the conserved region of NOCA-1 from <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> as the query. In our experience, blasting using the <italic>Brugia</italic> sequence is one of the best ways to identify non-nematode homologs of <italic>C. elegans</italic> proteins, since <italic>Brugia</italic> sequences tend to be among the least divergent among nematode species. The blast using the <italic>Brugia</italic> sequence identified all of the nematode NOCA-1 homologs (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>, red, pink, and green text), along with the vertebrate <italic>Chinchilla lanigera</italic>, <italic>Heterocephalus glaber</italic> and <italic>Fukomys damrensis</italic> nineins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref>, black and blue text), with no other significant hits. Importantly, reverse blast of aa 1549–1801 of <italic>Chinchilla lanigera</italic> ninein isoform X4 against all nematode sequences (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1C</xref>) yielded <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> NOCA-1 as the top hit (E value = 2e-07) and Loa loa NOCA-1 as the second hit (E value = 2e-04). Other coiled-coil proteins were also detected, but with substantially less significant E values (i.e. <italic>Toxocara canis</italic> myosin II, E value = 3.3; <italic>C. Briggsae</italic> HCP-2, E value = 6.1). These data suggest that NOCA-1 is indeed more similar to ninein than to other coiled coiled proteins. To highlight this, we also marked the residues in the “a” and “d” positions of the coiled-coil heptad repeats on the alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1A</xref>, as requested.</p><p><italic>5) The authors suggest that cell surface targeting of NOCA-1h occurs through the palmitoylation site in NOCA-1h specific region; although not essential, testing this prediction by mutating the site would strengthen the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>This was a great suggestion. To address this, we made a new transgene expressing a GFP fusion with the full length germline NOCA-1h isoform with a point mutation in its predicted N-terminal palmitoylation site (NOCA-1h<sup>C10A</sup>::GFP). Like its wild-type counterpart, NOCA-1h<sup>C10A</sup>::GFP fully rescued the germline function of NOCA-1. Interestingly, however, unlike the wild-type protein, its localization to compartment surfaces depended on γ-tubulin. In addition, whereas depletion of γ-tubulin lead to failure of NOCA-1h<sup>C10A</sup>::GFP targeting, depletion of α-tubulin to an extent that phenocopied γ-tubulin or NOCA-1 inhibition did not. These experiments, now included as new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>, suggest that NOCA-1 is recruited to cell surfaces via a γ-tubulin-dependent mechanism and further highlights the close relationship between NOCA-1and γ-tubulin.</p><p><italic>6) In the subsection “NOCA-1 and Patronin/PTRN-1 control assembly of a circumferential microtubule array required for the integrity of the larval/adult epidermis”, the authors ask if the microtubule array in the epidermis is important for morphogenesis, but fail to reference the landmark work of Priess and Hirsh (1987, Dev Biol) that includes evidence in support of such a role for microtubules. Indeed, the authors never reference this key publication with respect to the morphogenesis defects, which is surprising</italic>.</p><p>Instead of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Priess and Hirsh, 1986</xref>, we had referenced another paper from the Priess lab that describes the epidermal microtubule arrays in the larval stages (Costa et al., Dev. Biol. 1997), which are the arrays that we show here are required for larval growth. The 1986 paper focuses on an epidermal microtubule array in the embryo that forms subsequent to the embryonic arrays we characterize that position nuclei. We didn’t cite this reference because we don’t analyze this array or elongation in this manuscript, although we have done some collaborative work with the Labousse lab on this topic that will be the topic of another publication. However, since the microtubule array described in the 1986 Preiss and Hirsh paper immediately precedes the arrays that form in larva, it is reasonable to cite it along with the later 1997 paper, and we have added this reference to the revision.</p></body></sub-article></article>
