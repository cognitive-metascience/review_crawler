principle neurons of associative learning regions receive combinatorial sensory inputs. Density of combinatorial innervation is theorized to determine the number of distinct stimuli that can be represented and distinguished from one another, with sparse innervation thought to optimize the complexity of representations in networks of limited size. How the convergence of combinatorial inputs to principle neurons of associative brain regions is established during development is unknown. Here, we explore the developmental patterning of sparse olfactory inputs to Kenyon cells of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> mushroom body. By manipulating the ratio between pre- and post-synaptic cells, we find that postsynaptic Kenyon cells set convergence ratio: Kenyon cells produce fixed distributions of dendritic claws while presynaptic processes are plastic. Moreover, we show that sparse odor responses are preserved in mushroom bodies with reduced cellular repertoires, suggesting that developmental specification of convergence ratio allows functional robustness.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Despite having a limited number of senses, animals can perceive a huge range of sensations. One possible explanation is that the brain combines several stimuli to make each specific sensation.</p><p>The olfactory learning system in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> is in a part of the brain called the mushroom body. It allows fruit flies to associate a specific smell with a reward (e.g. food) or a punishment (e.g. poison) and behave accordingly. Two groups of neurons process stimuli from sensory receptors in the mushroom body: olfactory projection neurons carry information from the receptors and pass it on to neurons called Kenyon cells. The system relies on Kenyon cells receiving the combined input of multiple olfactory projection neurons, and therefore information from multiple receptors. The number of inputs each Kenyon cell receives is thought to determine the number of sensations that can be told apart, and thus, the number of signals that can be used for learning.</p><p>While many mechanisms dictating the complexity of a neuron’s shape have been described, the logic behind how two populations of neurons become connected to combine several inputs into a single sensation has not been addressed. A better understanding of how these connections are established during development can help explain how the brain processes information, and the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> mushroom body is a good system to address these questions.</p><p>Elkahlah, Rogow et al. manipulated the number of olfactory projection neurons and Kenyon cells in the mushroom body of fruit flies during development. They found that despite there being a varying number of cells, the number of connections into a post-synaptic cell remained the same. This indicates that the logic behind the combinations of inputs required for a sensation depends on the Kenyon cell, while olfactory projection neurons can adapt during their development to suit these input demands. Thus, if there are fewer Kenyon cells, the olfactory projection neurons will each provide connections to fewer cells to compensate, and if there are fewer olfactory projection neurons, each of them will input into more Kenyon cells. To show that the developing mushroom body could indeed adapt to different numbers of olfactory projection neurons and Kenyon cells, the modified flies were tested for olfactory perception: their responses to odor were largely normal.</p><p>These results underline the robustness of neuronal circuits. During development, the mushroom body can compensate for missing or extra neurons by modifying the numbers of connections between two groups of neurons, thus allowing the olfactory system to work normally. This robustness may also predispose the system to evolutionary change, since it allows the system to continue working as it changes. These findings are relevant to any area of the brain where neurons rely on combined input from many sources.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>sparse coding</kwd><kwd>combinatorial</kwd><kwd>mushroom body</kwd><kwd>sensory perception</kwd><kwd>non-deterministic</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001447</institution-id><institution>Rita Allen Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Milton Cassel Scholar</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Clowney</surname><given-names>E Josie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Olfactory systems have evolved to cope with this diversity by maximizing the chemicals that can be detected, through the amplification of chemosensory receptor gene families, and through combinatorial coding, which expands representation capacity from the number of receptors in the genome to the number of combinations among them. The arthropod mushroom body is a cerebellum-like associative learning structure with a well-understood role in representing sensory stimuli and associating sensory and contextual cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Farris, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hige, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kennedy, 2015</xref>). While mushroom bodies of different insect species process information from a variety of sensory modalities, 90% of Kenyon cell inputs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> are olfactory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The mushroom body of each hemisphere has ~2000 Kenyon cells (KCs), which are two synapses from the sensory periphery. Each olfactory receptor neuron in the antennae of adult flies expresses one or two of 75 olfactory receptor genes encoded in the genome. The axons of neurons expressing the same receptor converge on one of 54 glomeruli in the antennal lobe. ~150 uniglomerular projection neurons (PNs) have dendrites in one of the 54 glomeruli and carry signals about distinct receptor channels to two regions of the protocerebrum, the lateral horn and the mushroom body calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). PN inputs to the lateral horn are thought to underlie innate behaviors, while inputs to the mushroom body allow flexible learned association of odor stimuli with behavioral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fişek and Wilson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reduction of Kenyon cells leads to reduced projection neuron innervation of the mushroom body calyx.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image (left) and models (right) of olfactory PNs and KCs in the adult fly brain.

Each PN makes 1–20 boutons, and each bouton is wrapped by claws of ~10 KCs, such that each PN sends output to between 10 and 200 of the 2000 KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leiss et al., 2009</xref>). KCs in turn have 3–10 (average of five) claws, which innervate boutons of various PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruntman and Turner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Each KC therefore receives innervation from only a minority of the 54 incoming sensory channels, and different individual KCs receive different and relatively unstructured combinations of inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). The sets of inputs to individual cells vary across hemispheres and likely across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>). Associative learning mechanisms operate at KC output synapses, in the mushroom body axonal lobes, to re-weight KC outputs depending on experience and shift animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Handler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hige et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Owald and Waddell, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The mushroom body is a simplified and experimentally tractable example of an expansion layer, in which a set of sensory inputs is mapped combinatorially onto a much larger set of postsynaptic cells, increasing the dimensionality of sensory representations. Like the diversification of antibodies by V(D)J recombination, the diversification of sensory input combinations across KCs is thought to allow them to represent arbitrary odors, regardless of evolutionary experience. Neurons of many other expansion layers receive similarly few, or sparse, sensory inputs. These include the cerebellum proper, the electric organ of mormyrid fish, the dorsal cochlear nucleus, and the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mugnaini et al., 1980</xref>). Cerebellar granule cells have an average of four large, claw-shaped dendrites that are innervated by clustered mossy fiber presynaptic sites in mossy fiber rosettes. The similar convergence ratios in the cerebellum and mushroom body (4 or 5 sensory inputs, respectively, per expansion layer cell) are thought to maximize dimensionality of sensory representations by optimizing the tradeoff between stimulus representation, which is maximized when expansion layer neurons receive large combinations of inputs, and stimulus separation, which is maximized when expansion layer neurons receive few inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albus, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cayco-Gajic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marr, 1969</xref>). The number of sensory inputs received by expansion layer neurons is thus a crucial parameter in sensory coding. How the density of inputs to expansion layer neurons is developmentally programmed is not understood in any system.</p><p>Innervation complexity more generally has been studied in the peripheral nervous system and in the developing mammalian cortex. In peripheral sensory neurons, most prominently those of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval body wall, cell-autonomous mechanisms profoundly influence dendritic complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Corty et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Ziegler et al., 2017</xref>). However, sensory neurons do not need to coordinate their innervation with presynaptic partners. In the vertebrate peripheral nervous system, including the rabbit ciliary ganglion and vertebrate neuromuscular junction, postsynaptic neurons or muscles are thought to dictate wiring complexity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gibbins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hume and Purves, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hume and Purves, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Purves and Hume, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Turney and Lichtman, 2012</xref>). In contrast, in the developing cortex, extracellular signals including BDNF play a strong role in influencing dendritic complexity, suggesting that presynaptic cells and glia also influence connectivity density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kohara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McAllister et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">McAllister et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Purves, 1986</xref>). Therefore, while mechanisms acting in both pre- and post-synaptic cells <italic>can</italic> influence innervation complexity, there is a need to directly compare how pre- and post-synaptic cells influence one another.</p><p>We sought to ask how convergence ratio is set in the mushroom body calyx. By bidirectionally varying the populations of pre- and post-synaptic cells, we were able to make many different mushroom body aberrations. Across these conditions, we found a consistent pattern of compensations: the number of claws per KC remained largely constant, while the number of presynaptic boutons per olfactory PN varied bidirectionally and in response to changes of both the PN and KC populations. We therefore conclude that in this circuit, connectivity density is set by aspects of KC specification and is accomplished by flexible innervation of the calyx by PNs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In order to ask whether presynaptic olfactory PNs or postsynaptic KCs (or both) dictate sparse wiring density in the mushroom body calyx, we used a variety of methods to manipulate the ratio between pre- and post-synaptic cells during embryonic or larval stages, well before adult connections form in the pupa. Through a combination of genetic and pharmacological interventions, we were able to vary both cell populations up and down. In these four conditions, we then examined gross calyx anatomy in adult animals and, when possible, the processes of individual PNs and KCs. These experiments allowed us to ask which population of neurons would adjust its production of processes in response to the perturbation. As we will describe, in all four cases, PNs adjusted their repertoire of presynaptic sites while KC claw number remained similar to that of unmanipulated animals.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Projection neurons reduce bouton number when Kenyon cell number is reduced</title><p>First, we sought to reduce the KC population, to ask whether remaining cells would increase their claw number to fully innervate incoming PN boutons, or whether PNs would scale down their boutons to the KC repertoire. To do this, we took advantage of existing pharmacological techniques for KC neuroblast ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>). In the fly, four KC neuroblasts in each hemisphere produce ~500 KCs each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ito et al., 1997</xref>). While most neuroblasts pause their divisions for the first 8 hr after larval hatching (ALH), the KC neuroblasts continue to divide; if larvae are fed the mitotic poison hydroxyurea (HU) during this time, KC neuroblasts can be specifically ablated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>). In these animals, lacking all KCs that receive olfactory inputs, olfactory learning is abrogated while innate olfactory behaviors are spared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>). The uniglomerular, excitatory olfactory PNs that innervate the MB calyx are produced by two neuroblasts, called lNB/BAlc and adNB/BAmv3 . Besides the KC neuroblasts, lNB/BAlc is the only other neuroblast in the fly central nervous system dividing from 0 to 8 hr ALH and is thus also susceptible to HU ablation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ito and Hotta, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lovick et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lovick and Hartenstein, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stocker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>While ablation of all eight KC neuroblasts (4/hemisphere) was used to demonstrate the role of KCs in olfactory learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Belle and Heisenberg, 1994</xref>), we sought to perform more subtle manipulations of the mushroom body cell populations. We generated animals in which PNs and KCs were fluorescently labeled to facilitate scoring, and reduced the concentration and duration of HU application, producing mushroom bodies with a variety of Kenyon cell complements, likely due to sporadic loss of different neuroblast complements in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Together, these neuroblast losses could potentially produce 1–2 PN neuroblasts and mushroom bodies derived from 0 to 4 KC neuroblasts. Using our reporters, we scored the presence or absence of PNs ventrolateral to the antennal lobe, derived from lNB/BAlc, and counted the number of KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In practice, some of the neuroblast states did not occur and some were overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hemispheres from the same brain did not generally show the same neuroblast state as one another, but were often similar in severity of neuroblast losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>KCs of different types are produced in a characteristic sequence in development: γ KCs are born in the embryo and early larva, α’β’ KCs are born in late larvae, and αβ KCs are born in pupae. We identified samples in which all 4 KC neuroblasts had been ablated by looking for samples lacking mushroom body vertical lobes, which are composed of axons of α’β’ and αβ KCs and thus do not form if all KC neuroblasts are killed by HU just after hatching. We confirmed previous findings that in animals with all four KC neuroblasts ablated, the PNs fail to target the calyx and project only to the lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stocker et al., 1997</xref>). In these animals, ~100 KCs remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These represent the KC population that is born prior to larval hatching, and which is thus unaffected by KC neuroblast ablation after hatching. Recently, these earliest-born cells, called γd KCs, have been shown to receive visual and not olfactory input in adult flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vogt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yagi et al., 2016</xref>). These observations suggest that γd KCs are molecularly distinct from later-born cells during pupal calyx wiring, such that even when all the olfactory KCs are absent, olfactory PNs cannot innervate visual KCs. Remarkably, these embryonic-born γd KCs receive olfactory inputs in the early larva and are sufficient for olfactory learning at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pauls et al., 2010</xref>); they must therefore switch their partner preferences across developmental stages.</p><p>We then examined calyx anatomy in animals with intermediate populations of KCs, likely derived from 1 to 3 remaining neuroblasts. We found a progressive decrease in the size of the mushroom body calyx in these animals as measured by the maximum cross-sectional area of the calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) or by calyx volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>). To ask if this corresponded to a decline in bouton number, we counted the number of PN boutons in each hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This revealed a linear relationship between KC number and PN bouton number, suggesting that PNs reduce their population of boutons to match the KC population. The lateral horn appeared normal in these animals and its size did not correlate with KC number, suggesting that PN projections to these two brain areas develop independent of one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>). The presence or absence of ventrolateral PNs did not obviously predict bouton number, suggesting individual PNs may be able both to tailor their bouton production to the number of KCs and to adjust to the number of other PNs. However, we were not able to obtain enough samples to draw firm conclusions about whether PN cell number affected PN bouton number in calyces derived from matched KC neuroblast complements. To test this, we developed alternative methods to ablate PNs, described below.</p><p>To score KC clones directly, we developed a strategy to label only the latest-born, ‘αβ core’ KCs. The somata and principle neurites of these late-born cells remain clustered in the adult, allowing us to count KC clones by counting groups of labeled soma or axon tracts as they leave the calyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). Again, we found that calyx size tracked KC clone number, and that the presence or absence of the PN progeny of lNB/BAlc did not predict calyx size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). KC loss could reduce PN bouton number because PNs die or fail to be born when lacking KC contacts or trophic support. We thus counted the number of anterodorsal PNs (derived from adNB/BAmv3) and ventrolateral PNs (derived from lNB/BAlc) in this cohort. The number of anterodorsal PNs was not reduced in animals with some or all KC neuroblasts ablated, and the number of ventrolateral PNs was binary rather than graded, suggesting that vlPN number is determined by whether lNB/BAlc succumbed to HU, rather than by the KC complement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). These results suggest that PN neurogenesis and survival do not require KC signals. Like γd KCs, a few PNs derived from lNB/BAlc remained in adults; these likely represent PNs born embryonically from lNB/BAlc.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Individual projection neurons scale their bouton repertoire to the Kenyon cell population.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Maximum intensity projections of confocal stacks of the anterior (left) and posterior (right) of HU and sham-treated animals.

To ask whether individual PNs alter their production of presynaptic boutons as the KC repertoire changes, we identified two methods to label single PNs. We focused on anterodorsal PNs, as these are not susceptible to ablation of lNB/BAlc. First, we used 71D09-Gal4 to label the anterodorsal VM6 PN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ward et al., 2015</xref>) and then subjected labeled animals to HU ablation. Because we found a linear relationship between KC number and calyx area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>), we used calyx area as a proxy for KC number. While VM6 usually produces ~10 boutons, we found only ~5 boutons in animals with reduced calyx size, and 0–1 bouton in animals with severe calyx reductions, likely lacking all olfactory KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). These results suggest that individual PNs do reduce their bouton production as the KC complement is reduced, and that this reduction is graded rather than binary (i.e. in animals with some but not all KC neuroblasts ablated, bouton number is in between 0 and the wild type number). To characterize additional PNs, we expressed photoactivatable GFP under control of R42D01-Gal4, which labels ~10 anterodorsal PNs innervating the VM3 and VM4 glomeruli. We photoconverted individual somata using two photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Though bouton counts were somewhat more variable than for VM6 as this strategy labels different types of PNs with different characteristic bouton numbers, we again found a correlation between KC loss and bouton reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The graded reductions in bouton number we observed for different PN types would preserve the relative representation of these odor channels in the calyx. We also note that the range of bouton numbers we observed are consistent with adjustments to compensate for the presence or absence of ventrolateral PNs. For example, most VM6 neurons innervating a calyx derived from 1 KC neuroblast produced between 3 and 7 boutons, as compared to the median of 10 in unperturbed animals. If KCs are reduced by ¾ without loss of lNB/BAlc, perfect compensation by PNs would reduce boutons from 10 to 2.5. If lNB/BAlc was also lost, perfect compensation would reduce boutons from 10 to 5. These predicted values are similar to the bouton range we observed experimentally.</p><p>Finally, we sought to ask if KC claw number changes as KC number changes. We used GFP photoactivation to label individual KCs in animals subjected to HU ablation. The different KC classes have different median claw numbers: γ KCs have ~7 claws, αβ cells have ~5 claws, and α’β’ KCs have ~3 claws (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caron et al., 2013</xref>); we therefore used two different strategies to label individual KCs in animals subjected to HU ablation, both of which allow us to assign KC type. First, we expressed PA-GFP broadly in Kenyon cells using MB247-Gal4, and assigned KC type by imaging the axonal lobe innervation of photoactivated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Second, we expressed PA-GFP only in αβ or γ KCs using 58F02-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and 89B01-Gal4, respectively. Combining data from these two methods, we found no change in claw number on individual αβ KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J–K</xref>) or γ KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) as the KC population was reduced. From these experiments, we conclude that PNs reduce their bouton production on a cell-by-cell basis as the KC population shrinks, while KC claw number is unaffected by the size of the KC population (model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Olfactory projection neurons increase bouton repertoire as Kenyon cell number increases</title><p>In order to assess whether PNs can vary their presynaptic bouton number bidirectionally, we next created a method to specifically amplify the KC population. Recent work has suggested that ectopic or supernumerary populations of neurons can integrate into a variety of fruit fly neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Meng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pop et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Prieto-Godino et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Seroka and Doe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shaw et al., 2018</xref>), and previous studies identified a mutant, called <italic>mushroom body defect</italic> (<italic>mud</italic>) in which the mushroom body and other brain areas are dramatically expanded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Prokop and Technau, 1994</xref>). Mud/NuMA is a spindle orientation protein that ensures neuroblasts divide asymmetrically to produce one neuroblast and one differentiating neuron or neural progenitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Siller et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>mud</italic> mutants, neuroblasts occasionally divide symmetrically to produce two neuroblasts, amplifying the progeny of that neuroblast. To restrict amplification to KCs, we drove UAS-<italic>mud</italic>-RNAi (BL 35044) using OK107-Gal4, which is expressed in KC neuroblasts as well as in KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, in our RNAseq data from 45 hr APF and adult animals, we observe no expression of <italic>mud</italic> in PNs, KCs, or other brain cells, suggesting <italic>mud</italic> is not expressed in differentiating neurons (EJ Clowney, unpublished).</p><p>As OK107 labels mature KCs as well as KC neuroblasts, we included UAS-CD8GFP in these animals to count KCs. We observed potent amplification of KCs that was variable across animals, sometimes more than doubling KC number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). We measured calyx size, which expanded dramatically, and used GH146-driven fluorescence to count PN bouton number, which doubled in mushroom bodies with the largest KC expansions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). These results suggest that just as PNs scale down their boutons if the KC population is reduced, PNs scale up their boutons when the KC population is expanded.</p><p>To test whether PNs increased boutons on a cell-by-cell basis in these animals, we labeled VM6 using 71D09-LexA, and PNs innervating DA1, VA1d, and DC3 using MZ19-QF. First, we observed no change in VM6 or MZ19<sup>+</sup> cell numbers in brains with KC expansions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,H</xref>), suggesting that PN numbers do not increase as KC number increases. We observed no change in VM6 bouton numbers, perhaps because the VM6 PN already has a relatively large number of boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In contrast, MZ19 cells increased their number of presynaptic boutons as the KC population expanded, from an average of 3.5 boutons per cells in the control genotype to an average of 4.75 boutons per cell in the KC-expansion genotype.

We scored the number of claws per labeled KC in each calyx. As above, calyx size predicted KC number in these animals, so we used calyx size as a proxy for KC number. Rather than a decrease in claw number per KC in animals with expanded KC complements, we found a slight increase in claw number, from a median of 5 to a median of 6 claws. As different types of KCs produce different characteristic numbers of claws, this could represent a change in claw production, a change in the distribution of KC types in these animals, or bias in which KC types we labeled in expanded versus control brains. While we were unable to identify LexA lines to specifically label αβ or γ KCs in OK107&gt;mudRNAi brains, we found a LexA line, R41C07, that labeled α’β’ KCs, and targeted these specifically for photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). In these KCs of matched type, we found no change in KC claw number per cell, though we cannot rule out subtle differences. Together, these experiments suggest that in animals with an amplified KC complement, PNs dramatically increase their bouton production to match the KC population, while KCs may moderately increase, and do not reduce, their individual claw production.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Individual projection neurons decrease bouton number as the projection neuron population expands</title><p>We have shown that olfactory PNs bidirectionally vary their presynaptic boutons to suit populations of KCs derived from 0 to 8 KC neuroblasts. To ask whether PNs can also vary their bouton production in response to changes in their own numbers, or in response to changes in the ratio between PNs and KCs that do not affect KC clone number, we identified methods to vary the PN population. We found that just as we could expand the KC population by knocking down <italic>mud</italic> in KC neuroblasts, we could expand the PN population by knocking down <italic>mud</italic> in PN neuroblasts. This strategy produced GH146-labeled PN complements of up to 600 cells, as compared to ~120 GH146-labeled PNs we counted in controls.

Like MZ19 PNs, the VM6 PN also maintained a stable number of total boutons as the PN population expanded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). This was possible because the VM6 cell(s) had similar numbers of total boutons as the VM6 population expanded.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Projection neuron bouton expansion partially compensates for severe reductions in the projection neuron population</title><p>In order to reduce the PN repertoire independent of KC number, we identified two Gal4 lines, VT033006 and VT033008, that label large complements of uniglomerular PNs in the adult (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

As different KC types produce different numbers of claws in wild type, we sought to simplify the analysis by labeling only a single KC type.

It is possible that thermal or gustatory neurons projecting to the calyx could have also expanded their production of boutons to make up for the losses of olfactory PNs. We cannot yet determine whether the excess KC claws observed in this condition get inputs from PN boutons, from APL, or from some other source.

This finding suggests that developmental mechanisms prioritize the sparseness of olfactory inputs to KCs, and might therefore preserve sparse odor coding and high-dimensional odor representations despite stark changes to the underlying circuit constituents.

Together, these findings suggest that the developmental plasticity mechanisms operating to set the density of olfactory inputs to KCs preserve qualitatively sparse KC odor responses when the KC population is experimentally reduced.

Yet the developmental production of sparseness, a key wiring feature allowing high-dimensional sensory representations, is not understood. Here, we have begun to investigate the development of sparse connectivity in the cerebellum-like associative learning center of insects, the mushroom body. By varying the ratio between presynaptic olfactory PNs and postsynaptic KCs, we find that connectivity density is set by KCs: KC claw number changes little across a wide range of PN::KC ratios, KC number predicts PN bouton number, and PNs exhibit wide variety in bouton number to satisfy KC demands. As described below, we expect that this strategy for generating connectivity density would preserve sparseness in KC inputs across developmental time and upon evolutionary changes in cell repertoires and thus maintain the olfactory coding function of the mushroom body over a range of conditions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Implications for development: Different projection neuron to Kenyon cell ratios across developmental stages</title><p>For many animals, brain development continues while juveniles are already living freely--searching for food, navigating, and learning about the environment. Developmental transitions in brain structure are particularly stark in holometabolous insects, who build the brain twice. In <italic>D. mel</italic>, neurons generated during embryonic and early larval stages wire the larval nervous system. These circuits support larval behaviors, while neural stem cells continue to generate additional neurons that will be used to build the adult circuit. In keeping with this, the ratio between PNs and KCs in the larval olfactory circuit is starkly different from the adult: 21 embryonically-born PNs wire to early-born KCs to construct the larval mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Ramaekers et al., 2005</xref>).

(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Eichler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). We found that unlike cells in many other systems, including the vertebrate cerebellum, PNs and KCs did not rely on each other for survival signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fan et al., 2001</xref>). This may be due to the constantly changing ratio between these cell types across developmental time. Instead, setting connectivity density cell-autonomously in KCs could allow KCs to obtain the appropriate number of inputs at the different life stages of the animal, when cellular constituents are very different from one another. Similarly, while PN neurogenesis ceases well before PNs and KCs begin to contact one another in the pupa, we estimate that ~10% of KCs are born after PN:KC synapsis has already initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Muthukumar et al., 2014</xref>). Strict, cell-autonomous dendrite structuring and flexible PN bouton production could together ensure that late-born KCs obtain the inputs appropriate to support coding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Implications for coding: Balancing projection neuron representations across the calyx</title><p>Olfactory PNs of different types are specified in a predictable temporal order, have characteristic numbers of boutons, and overlap in their innervation of the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>). Differences in bouton number across different PNs allow different odor channels to be differentially represented in the calyx and in KC odor responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caron et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Honegger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>). Several classes of PNs also differ in number between the sexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grabe et al., 2016</xref>). While PNs changed their individual bouton repertoires in response to changes in cell repertoires, we found that to some extent, the representation level of different PNs in the calyx was preserved. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, we show the effect of reducing KC number on bouton production by the VM6 PN and 42D01 PNs. While each population of PNs reduced individual bouton number in this condition, they retained their typical relative representation. The VM6 PN reduced its boutons from 10 to 5, while the 42D01 PNs decreased their boutons from 4 to 2. Similarly, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, we expanded the PN population by inducing ectopic PN neuroblast duplication. In these experiments, we mainly observed amplification of the ventrolateral clone. We found that individual anterodorsal VM6 cells did not scale down their boutons when the ventrolateral PN clone expanded, but only when VM6 itself was duplicated. Again, this could maintain the relative wild type representations of different odor channels in the calyx. A recent analysis suggests that the spontaneous activity of different ORs correlates with number of boutons representing that odor channel in the calyx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kennedy, 2019</xref>). One possible model for how PNs scale to KC numbers while maintaining their relative representations in the calyx is thus that KC number limits total bouton number across all PNs, while allocation of these boutons to individual PNs is determined by activity-based competition among PN types.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Implications for coding: Maximizing dimensionality of odor representations</title><p>Qualitative aspects of sparse coding in the mushroom body appear robust to severe perturbations to the circuit. Alternative developmental compensatory mechanisms would be much less likely to preserve sparse coding. For example, we increased the ratio of PNs to KCs in two ways, by increasing the number of PNs and by decreasing the number of KCs. In both cases, PNs dialed down their bouton number, making 25–50% of the boutons they make in wild type. This allowed the KCs to receive their typical number of inputs. If in contrast bouton number was rigid and claw number flexible, in these cases KCs would have expanded their claw production 2–4 fold to innervate all the incoming PN boutons. Individual KCs with for example 20 instead of 5 claws would receive input from ~40% of glomeruli, increasing the overlap in tuning across different KCs and degrading the ability of the network to distinguish different stimuli from one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In two other cases, we increased the ratio of KCs to PNs, by increasing the number of KCs and by decreasing the number of PNs. Again, KCs retained their typical claw number. If instead PNs had maintained a static production of boutons while KCs had adjusted their claw production, KCs would receive very few inputs. While increasing the number of inputs per KC is theorized to reduce dimensionality of odor responses by making different KCs more similar to one another, decreasing the number of inputs per KC is theorized to reduce dimensionality by reducing the number of different possible KC input combinations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). That this sweet spot maximizing dimensionality, ~5 inputs per cell, is programmed into KC identity testifies to the evolutionary importance of maintaining connectivity density in associative brain centers that rely on combinatorial coding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications for evolution: The potential for mushroom body function despite perturbations</title><p>The olfactory receptors are the largest insect gene family and have been subject to frequent and extreme gains and losses in many clades. Similarly, brain centers devoted to learning are radically different across species, as exemplified by the diversity in KC repertoire across arthropods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Strausfeld et al., 2009</xref>). In order to acquire a novel olfactory circuit, many different evolutionary changes are required: A new receptor must evolve, an OSN type that uniquely expresses the receptor needs to arise, that OSN needs to synapse onto PNs, and a new PN type and new glomerulus must arise. For these events to accrue over time, each individual change must be compatible with continued circuit function and olfactory behavior. While development of a dedicated circuit that assigns an innate meaning to a newly-detectable odor would require many further changes, the signal could add to fitness immediately through representation in the mushroom body.</p><p>We have described two mechanisms of developmental robustness that maintain coherent mushroom body wiring in the face of a broad range of phenotypic alterations. First, we observe that olfactory PNs can adjust to gain and loss of PNs while maintaining the balance of odor channel representations in the calyx. Plastic development of PN presynaptic sites that makes room for additional players in the repertoire would allow immediate access of evolutionarily expanded PNs to the calyx and the use of their signals for olfactory learning, thus making time for the evolution of hardwired circuits for innate interpretations. Second, we show here that developmental programs wiring the calyx can accommodate variation in KC number from at least ¼ to 2-fold the endogenous complement. Again, this flexibility could support continued MB function on the path to the evolution of mushroom body innovations. Future experiments will ask how KC claw number is developmentally programmed, and what mechanisms operate in olfactory PNs to allow them to tailor bouton production to the KC repertoire.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

ablation</title><p>Protocol was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sweeney et al. (2012)</xref>. Briefly, we set up large populations of flies in cages two days prior to ablation and placed a 35 or 60 mm grape juice agar plate (Lab Express, Ann Arbor, MI) in the cage with a dollop of goopy yeast. One day prior to the ablation, we replaced the grape juice/yeast plate with a new grape juice/yeast plate. On the morning of the ablation, we removed the plate from the cage and discarded the yeast puck and any hatched larvae on the agar. We then monitored the plate for up to four hours, until many larvae had hatched. Larvae were washed off the plate using a sucrose solution, and eggs were discarded. Larvae were then strained in coffee filters, and submerged in hydroxyurea (Sigma, H8627) in a yeast:AHL mixture, or sham mixture without HU. Ablation conditions were as follows:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: 10 mg/mL or 5 mg/mL, 4 hr</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A-E</xref> 10 mg/mL, 1 hr</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">3</xref>: 10 mg/mL, 1 hr; 3 or 5 mg/mL, 4 hr</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>: 10 mg/mL, 1 hr</p></list-item></list><p>Larvae were then strained through coffee filters again, rinsed, and placed in a vial or bottle of R food until eclosion. We opened a new container of hydroxyurea each month as it degrades in contact with moisture and we found its potency gradually declined. We typically analyzed 5–10 animals (10–20 hemispheres) of each condition per batch, except in in vivo imaging experiments, where we analyzed 1–5 animals per condition per batch.</p><p>Applying HU for four hours produced a somewhat U-shaped distribution, with many samples unaffected and many with all four KC neuroblasts lost. Shifting from 3, to 5, to 10 mg over this long time scale shifted how many brains were completely ablated versus unaffected, but did little to increase the proportion of brains with intermediate phenotypes. Applying the stronger concentration, 10 mg, for a shorter time produced more sporadic effects, with more brains showing 1, 2, or 3 KC neuroblasts remaining. lNB/BAlc was more affected by HU concentration than time of application, with stronger effects seen applying 10 mg/mL for one hour than applying 3 or 5 mg/mL for four hours. Overall, combining these different protocols allowed us to observe a broad range of mushroom body states.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunostainings</title><p>Brains were dissected for up to 20 min in external saline (108 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl2, 8.2 mM MgCl2, 4 mM NaHCO3, 1 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM trehalose, 10 mM sucrose, 5 mM HEPES pH7.5, osmolarity adjusted to 265 mOsm), before being transferred to 1% paraformaldehyde in PBS, on ice. All steps were performed in cell strainer baskets (caps of FACS tubes) in 24 well plates, with the brains in the baskets lifted from well to well to change solutions. Brains were fixed overnight at 4C in 1% PFA in PBS. On day 2, brains were washed 3 × 10’ in PBS supplemented with 0.1% triton-x-100 on a shaker at room temperature, blocked 1 hr in PBS, 0.1% triton, 4% Normal Goat Serum, and then incubated for at least two overnights in primary antibody solution, diluted in PBS, 0.1% triton, 4% Normal Goat Serum. Primary antibody was washed 3 × 10’ in PBS supplemented with 0.1% triton-x-100 on a shaker at room temperature, then brains were incubated in secondary antibodies for at least two overnights, diluted in PBS, 0.1% triton, 4% Normal Goat Serum. When used, Alexa 568-conjugated phalloidin (1:80) and/or DAPI (one microgram/mL) were included in secondary antibody mixes. Primary antibodies used were mouse anti-ChAT 9E10 (DSHB, 1:200), Rabbit anti-dsRed (Clontech, 1:500-1:1000), Sheep anti-GFP (Bio-Rad, 4745–1051, 1:250-1:1000), Chicken anti-GFP (1:5000, gift from Dawen Cai). Secondary antibodies were Alexa 488, 568, and 647 conjugates (1:500, Invitrogen).</p><p>Brains were mounted in 1x PBS, 90% glycerol supplemented with propyl gallate in binder reinforcement stickers sandwiched between two coverslips. Samples were stored at 4C in the dark prior to imaging. The coverslip sandwiches were taped to slides, allowing us to perform confocal imaging on one side of the brain and then flip over the sandwich to allow a clear view of the other side of the brain. This allowed us to score features on the anterior and posterior sides of each sample. Scanning confocal stacks were collected along the anterior-posterior axis on a Zeiss 880 or Leica SP8 with one micrometer spacing in Z and ~200 nm axial resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical considerations</title><p>Determination of sample size: Brains were prepared for imaging in batches of 5–10. In initial batches, we assessed the variability of the manipulation, for example if we were trying to change Kenyon cell number, we looked at how variable the size of the Kenyon cell population was following the manipulation. We used this variability to determine how many batches to analyze so as to obtain enough informative samples. To avoid introducing statistical bias, we did not analyze the effect of the manipulation on the other cell type until after completing all batches; for example if the manipulation was intended to alter Kenyon cell numbers, we did not assess projection neuron bouton phenotypes until completing all samples. Genotypes or conditions being compared with one another were always prepared for staining together and imaged interspersed with one another to equalize batch effects, and we used at least two batches for each type of experiment.</p><p>Criteria for exclusion, treatment of outliers: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, we only excluded from analysis samples with overt physical damage to the cells or structures being measured. In figures and analyses we treated outliers the same way as other data points. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, full criteria for inclusion and exclusion of each sample are shown under <italic>Analysis of KC somatic odor responses</italic>, below.</p><p>Recent discussions among experts have suggested that biological studies over-rely on statistical tests, report p values when statistical differences are self-evident, and emphasize statistical significance rather than effect size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goedhart, 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goedhart, 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ho et al., 2019</xref>). These choices can cloud findings instead of clarifying them. In order to communicate our findings in the simplest and most complete way, we have displayed each data point for each sample to allow readers to assess effect size and significance directly.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image analysis</title><p>In general, we analyzed mixed-sex populations, where sex ratios were carefully balanced across experimental conditions. Because MZ19 labels the sexually dimorphic DA1 PNs, in MZ19 experiments we analyzed the two sexes independently in pilot experiments. As we observed no correlation with sex (not shown), in subsequent MZ19 experiments we used mixed sexes.</p><p>Researchers performing quantification could not generally be blinded to experimental condition due to the overt changes in neuron numbers and brain structures induced by our manipulations. However, analysis was performed blind to the goals of the experiment when possible, and quantitation of features on the anterior and posterior sides of the brain were recorded independent of one another and merged after all quantifications were completed. Moreover, many of our analyses make use of variation within an experimental condition or genotype, providing an additional bulwark against observational bias.</p><p>To measure neuropil structures such as the mushroom body calyx, lateral horn, or antennal lobe, we used markers such as ChAT and phalloidin to visualize the structure, identified its largest extent in Z (i.e. along the A-P axis), outlined it in FIJI (as in white outlines in Figure 1B) and then calculated the cross-sectional area using the ‘Measure’ command.</p><p>To analyze calyx volumes we used ImageJ. Briefly, we drew Regions of Interest (ROIs) around the MB247 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or OK107 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) calyx signal for each slice. Other imaging channels displaying projection neurons and nc82 staining were used as a reference. The drawn ROIs for each slice were saved using the ROI manager plugin and the area of each ROI in a stack was measured using the Measure tool. The measured areas were added together and then multiplied by the Z-spacing between slices (one micron) to get the volume of the combined ROI through the stack. The 3D viewer plugin was used to make movies of the kenyon cell and calyx volumes. To produce 3D Movies of the calyx volumes without somata, areas outside the selected ROIs were cleared and then the 3D viewer plugin was used to display only the 3D ROI volume that was measured for the volume analysis. To facilitate comparison in 3D movies, stacks in a set were all given the same depth in Z by adding blank slices at the end of the stack when necessary.</p><p>To count aggregate boutons, we used ChAT signal with reference to phalloidin (which stains actin-rich structures, including KC dendrites), except in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, where we counted GH146-positive boutons. We counted as separate structures ChAT signals that were compact and appeared discontinuous with one another and that were 2+ micrometers in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When phalloidin signal or KC fluorescence was available, two boutons would be counted separately if ChAT signals were separated by phalloidin signal or KC signal. In initial analyses, we found that boutons in slice 0 often appeared in slices −1 and +1 as well, but never in slices −2 or +2. In order to avoid counting the same boutons more than once, we therefore began counting at the most superficial slice in the stack where boutons were visible, and counted every other slice, i.e. every second micron. To count boutons of small groups of PNs, we drove fluorescent reporters under control of 42D01, 71D09, or MZ19 and counted coherent and compact fluorescent signals, with reference to ChAT signals and to phalloidin, when available. As GH146 labels ~2/3 of PNs, our counts of 450–650 total GH146+ boutons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, which would correspond to 675–975 total boutons per calyx, correspond with estimates established by EM (578 boutons) and light microscopy (768 total boutons, or five boutons per PN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Leiss et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Turner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>To count cell populations, we used genetically-encoded fluorescence as indicated. We counted labeled somata in every third slice in the stack (every third micron along the A-P axis), with reference to DAPI to distinguish individual cells from one another. As we did for boutons, in analyzing somata we initially determined that somata in slice 0 could also be seen in slices −2, –1, +1, and +2 but not in slice −3 or +3. To avoid double-counting, we therefore counted every third micron.</p><p>To count KC claws, we scanned image stacks for cup-shaped terminal structures of the appropriate size (1–2 μm in diameter). We sometimes labeled small groups of KCs. We scored independently any single KC or small group of KCs that could be visually separated from one another (like the 3 cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, we did not score any cells which we could not separate from one another because we did not want to mix counts for KCs of different types. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, where we did not attempt to separate KCs of different types, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>, where our dye labeling strategy was specific to αβ KCs, we present an average claw/KC data point for small groups of 2–4 cells whose dendritic structures were interwoven. Finally, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>, we found that in calyces with expanded KC populations, KC axons sometimes could not enter the pedunculus and instead wandered around at the base of the calyx. As CNS neurons in <italic>D. mel</italic> are unipolar, these wandering axons could be difficult to distinguish from dendritic claws. To determine whether these wandering axons should be counted as claws, we stained a subset of photoactivated brains with anti-ChAT (not shown), to determine which labeled KC neurites were in the bouton region of the calyx, and should thus be scored for claws, and which were ‘lost’ axons. Though photoactivated GFP signals were only poorly preserved following staining, relating ChAT-stained images to images of the same brain by two photon allowed us to learn to identify the bouton region of the calyx in subsequent experiments due to its ‘swiss cheese’ appearance, where the presence of PN boutons produces holes in KC fluorescence.</p><p>To determine KC and PN neuroblast state--PN lNB/BAlc: Whenever possible, we included GH146 or 60A10 driving a fluorescent report in our animals and scored the presence or absence of a group of somata lateral to the antennal lobe on the anterior side of the brain for each analyzed hemisphere. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>, we examined ChAT+ somata ventrolateral of the antennal lobe to determine the presence or absence of lNB/BAlc progeny. KC neuroblasts: In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>, we used 58F02 to fluorescently label late-born KCs and counted clumps of labeled somata surrounding the calyx as well as groups of labeled neurites leaving the calyx and entering the pedunculus. These estimates usually matched; in the few cases where they did not, we used the number of axon clumps, as somata are closer to the surface of the brain and more susceptible to mechanical disruption during dissection. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, 58F02 labels additional neurons; these were easy to discriminate from KCs as they did not enter the calyx or pedunculus.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>, we combined data from two different types of experiments. In some experiments, we expressed PA-GFP in all KCs using MB247. We traced the axons of labeled KCs into the lobes to assign KC type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In a second group of experiments, we used 58F02-Gal4 to express PA-GFP exclusively in αβ core KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), or 89B01 Gal4 to express PA-GFP only in γ KCs and thus knew KC type a priori. 89B01 also labels γd KCs, which can be distinguished from olfactory γ KCs as they do not innervate the main calyx. We do not include γd KCs in our analysis.</p><p>GFP photoactivation and Texas red dextran dye labeling were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clowney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>), using a Bruker Investigator microscope and Spectra-Physics MaiTai laser with DeepSee module. Dye filling electrodes were pulled using a Brown/Flaming puller (Sutter Instruments) and were guided to the mushroom body α lobes using visible light illumination and/or two photon autofluorescence.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Identification of driver lines for relevant cell populations</title><p>To identify Gal4 and/or LexA lines labeling PN populations, we screened the Janelia FlyLight collection online database and then crossed lines with potential to fluorescent reporters. While 42D01 (~10 PNs) and 60A10 (60 PNs) were the most useful PN lines for us here, we also identified other lines, 33C10 and 37H08, that each label small groups of PNs and may be of use to others. To identify Gal4 lines labeling individual KC types, we screened expression of ‘regular’ FlyLight Gal4 constructs made using the same regulatory fragments incorporated in KC-type-specific split Gal4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014</xref>). We found 58F02 useful for labeling α/β core KCs, 89B01 for γ KCs (labels both γmain and γd), and 41C07 for α’/β’ KCs. 89B01 and 58F02 LexA did not recapitulate Gal4 expression patterns driven by the same fragments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow Cytometry</title><p>Brains were dissected in Schneider’s medium (Sigma S0146) supplemented with 1% BSA and placed on ice. After all dissections were completed, collagenase (Sigma C0130) was added to a final concentration of 2 mg/mL and samples were incubated at 37C for 20 min. Samples were dissociated by trituration and spun down at 300g, 4C, for 5 min. Collagenase solution was removed and replaced with PBS+0.1% BSA supplemented with 1:1000 DyeCycle Violet. Cells were incubated with dye for 30 min on ice and passed through a cell strainer cap, before being subjected to flow cytometry on an Attune Flow Cytometer. Forward scatter and side scatter measurements were used to gate single cells, and DyeCycle Violet signal was used to gate cell bodies from membrane debris.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vivo functional imaging</title><p>We prepared 2–7 day old adult flies subjected to HU or sham treatment just after larval hatching for in vivo two photon calcium imaging on a Bruker Investigator essentially as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>), affixing the fly to packaging tape (Duck EZ Start) with human hair and UV glue (Loctite 3106). The fly was tilted to allow optical access to KC somata, at the dorsal posterior surface of the brain. In some experiments, we waxed the proboscis in an extended position to reduce motion. Imaging was performed in external saline. For odor delivery, half of a 1200 mL/min airstream, or 600 mL/min, was directed toward the antennae through a Pasteur pipette mounted on a micromanipulator. At a trigger, 25% of the total air stream was re-directed from a 10 mL glass vial containing mineral oil to a vial containing odorants diluted 1:10 in mineral oil, or a second vial of mineral oil (mechanosensory control). Final odor dilution was therefore 1:40. Filter paper ‘wicks’ were inserted into each vial to allow odor to saturate the vial headspace. Odors were delivered for two seconds, with 30–60 s in between stimulations. We used a simplified olfactometer capable of delivering five different odorants in which overall airflow was metered by analogue flowmeters (Brooks Instruments) and valve switching controlled by an Arduino. Odor delivery was initially optimized using a mini-PID placed in the half of the air stream not directed at the fly (Aurora Biosciences). Images were collected at 1.5–5 Hertz, and we imaged a single plane for each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of KC somatic odor responses</title><p>We collected data from a total of 14 sham-treated animals (28 hemispheres imaged) and 24 HU-treated animals (46 hemispheres imaged). The two hemispheres were imaged separately. Occasionally, only one hemisphere was imaged due to the preparation and a few hemispheres were excluded from analysis because of poor image quality. Mineral oil was delivered first, and then each of four odors was delivered twice, in sequence. Following mineral oil, odor order varied. Because experiments in locust found that the first presentation of certain odors can cause distinct KC responses to all subsequent presentations of that same odor, we analyzed the second presentation of each odor, according to convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stopfer and Laurent, 1999</xref>). We also observed that in some animals, enduring increases in fluorescence followed the first presentation of isobutyl acetate.</p><p>Following functional imaging, we either collected a Z-stack of the mushroom body on the two-photon, or dissected out the brain and subjected it to immunostatining and confocal imaging. We used these images to categorize the extent of KC reduction. All samples are accounted for here:</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable2" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top"/><th valign="top">Total <break/>hem</th><th valign="top">Poor <break/>image</th><th valign="top">Damaged/<break/>not responsive</th><th valign="top">Unknown</th><th valign="top">Full <break/>ablation</th><th valign="top">Can’t tell <break/>if ablated</th><th valign="top">Doesn’t <break/>look ablated</th><th valign="top">Too much <break/>motion</th><th valign="top">Analyzed</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Sham</td><td valign="top">28</td><td valign="top">2</td><td valign="top">8</td><td valign="top">1</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">7: four fem, three male</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">HU</td><td valign="top">46</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">4</td><td valign="top">0</td><td valign="top">13</td><td valign="top">5</td><td valign="top">10</td><td valign="top">7</td><td valign="top">7: four male, <break/>three fem</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We excluded 11 hemispheres from the control dataset due to damage or poor image quality. We also excluded 34 hemispheres from the ablation dataset because of any of the following: the samples were fully ablated, unaffected by ablation, ablation status was ambiguous, or the mushroom body calyx appeared damaged. The remaining samples were motion-corrected using Suite2p (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pachitariu et al., 2017</xref>). Using FIJI, we blinded ourselves to the remaining datasets and excluded datasets if there was too much motion to be able to follow the same cell over time. After this gate, there were seven sham and seven reduced-KC hemispheres for the analysis. ROIs were chosen in each of the fourteen samples and we measured Δf/f (i.e. (f-f<sub>0</sub>)/f<sub>0</sub>), comparing stimulus frames with pre-stimulus frames. ROIs were manually chosen and we were careful about ensuring that the cell remained within its ROI for all frames. For two of the ablated samples, we had to choose different ROIs for two of the odor deliveries due to motion. These samples were only used to calculate the proportion of cells that were responsive to each odor, and not in calculating the number of odors each cell responded to. The baseline was determined for each odor delivery by taking the average of the frames within the three seconds before the trigger. The stimulus frame was determined by taking the peak response between 0–4.5 s after stimulus onset, to account for the valve opening and the two second odor delivery. To define ‘responsive’ cells, we chose to use the same cutoff, Δf/f &gt; 0.2 (20% increase in fluorescence over baseline) across samples. This was in order to avoid obscuring overall differences in responsiveness across ablated and sham-treated calyces.

transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>Your paper uses the olfactory circuit of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to test developmental plasticity and robustness in a stochastic sparse wiring circuit between olfactory projection neurons and Kenyon cells in the mushroom body. This sparse wiring encodes olfactory perception. Your simple, well designed and elegant experiments revealed that there is significant presynaptic developmental plasticity explaining the robustness of sparse wiring. By manipulating cell divisions of either Kenyon cells or projection neurons to increase or decrease their population size and measuring &quot;claws&quot; (their connections), you realized that the number of post-synaptic sites of Kenyon cells is invariant while the number of presynaptic sites of projection neurons changes accordingly.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Presynaptic developmental plasticity allows robust sparse wiring of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Bassem A Hassan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The three reviewers agree about the importance of the work and find the problem and the way it is addressed to be highly significant: The principle of developmental plasticity in presynaptic neurons in this circuit is fascinating and the way you manipulate it is very good!</p><p>However, as you will see from the comments, two of the three reviewers have some serious issues with the counting of buttons that are presented in Figure 7. They agree that this is not a trivial task (although others have done so very well, see Leiss, 2009) but they are not convinced by the experimental data that you show and they found it difficult to verify the accuracy of the counting, which is critical to the paper.</p><p>Therefore, we would like you to provide more information on how you did the counting and to show precise images with markers indicating what is counted as a bouton, and what is not. In particular, you need to elaborate about how you avoided counting errors across optical sections. Furthermore, the n number is too low to allow statistics and might need to be improved.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors examine the rules for wiring the input connections in the mushroom body, what sets the degree of synaptic convergence of PN inputs onto KCs. They address this by manipulating cell divisions of either KC or PN progenitors to increase or decrease population size. Based on measurements of KC claws and calyx cross-section, the number of KC post-synaptic sites appears invariant across conditions, while the number of PN presynapses changes.</p><p>There are some important technical points that are not adequately described and may not be adequate to justify the conclusions. Figure 7 is based on a seriously insufficient data set. Without resolving these issues, I am not confident in their results:</p><p>1) They quantify the size of the calyx as the maximum cross-sectional area. They should quantify calyx volume instead. There could be large change in calyx volume without changes in max cross-sectional area.</p><p>The Materials and methods section description of this should also be clarified. It says: '…identified its [calyx's] largest extent in z, outline it in FIJI…'. Do they mean they found the confocal plane with the widest cross section and calculated the area there? They should use brain-based coordinates (i.e. dorso-ventral/A-P) rather than Z since I don't know how they're scanning the brain. Also, it sounds like they simply measure a diameter and assume the calyx is a circle. If so, that is too crude a measure. They should make a more precise measurement of the 3D boundary of the calyx and calculate volume.</p><p>2) It's unclear how they actually counted PN boutons/cell bodies/claws. Again, the Materials and methods section description should be more accurate. It says ' counted every other slice' and 'counted every third slice' How do we know whether there is or isn't overlap between slices? We'd need to know the axial resolution, as well as the distance between slices but these are not reported. As written, it sounds like they made an arbitrary decision to skip counting some slices. It's impossible to tell if they could be double counting or missing many counts.</p><p>In Figure 1E the number of PN boutons a little less than 500, which is low compared to published results, Leiss et al., 2009 counted between 780 and 1600 depending on markers used, and Turner et al., 2008 estimated 1165 based on PN labeling. Also, the numbers in Figure 1E don't match their statement of '1000/calyx' on in the Materials and methods section. Can the authors please clarify?</p><p>Figure 2B shows examples of how they count the number of KC neuroblasts using the 58F02 driver. However, there are sometimes clusters of green cells that are apparently not counted e.g. left panel shows one big cluster and two smaller ones, second from left shows one cluster at 6'oclock and one at 9o'clock but this is assessed to be only one KC Nb. This needs more explanation. Is the driver not completely KC specific? How did they know that a cluster is made of up KCs and not other cells, especially with the 9 o'clock cluster.</p><p>3) The authors must take more measurements of KC odor responses in ablated animals, n=3 is not sufficient for any conclusions. In fact, there are no statistical tests in Figure 7 to support any conclusion.</p><p>What does the df/f value shown in e.g. Figure 7C represent? Is it peak df/f during the odor, or area under the curve or what?</p><p>It would be far better to show some example plots of df/f versus time (as a simple line plot rather than heatmap). This is a better way for the reader to evaluate the data, in particular to assess movement artefacts. Presenting essentially a single point, as in Figure 7C, can mask experimental issues.</p><p>The authors also use an arbitrary threshold to define a response: 20% df/f. This is not particularly well-justified and not standard in the field. In any case, there's no need for a response threshold to analyze these data. A better analysis would be to measure df/f values across the entire set of KCs and plot those distributions for ablated and sham animals. Viewing those two distributions is far more informative than a% response, which apparently ranges from 5-40% by the current criterion, so it's not a very robust measurement anyway. (In fact, in Figure 7D I see a number around 0.5, very high!)</p><p>The authors should be more forthcoming in their description of these results. Subsection “Developmental plasticity preserves sparse odor coding despite perturbations to cell populations” says 'variation is similar to previous reports' but the Materials and methods section says that more responses were observed in this study than previous, both referring to Honegger, 2011. The authors should be straightforward about the differences between the observations in both Main Text and Materials and methods section. The analysis suggested above should be adequate support for their claims (with enough n), since they are comparing sham and ablated.</p><p>Related to overall quality of these experiments: in Figure 7C are there instances of negative df/f values in the responses? It is hard to tell with the colormap the authors use, but I see it ranges down to -0.5. If so, that should be commented on, since inhibition is rarely seen with GCaMP. The concern is that movement artefacts are likely to give negative df/f values, so that should be ruled out.</p><p>Additionally, the high level of responsiveness the authors observe relative to previous work could also be due to movement artefacts giving artificially large df/f values. The authors should analyze some non-odor period of their calcium signals to see if similar response frequencies are observed. And do the same for inhibitory responses (if those are in fact negative values).</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Presynaptic developmental plasticity allows robust sparse wiring of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body&quot; by Elkahlah et al., uses various alteration in the ratios of neurons that contribute to the calyx of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body to address how the convergence of combinatorial inputs is established during development.

At the outset of this project, we tested a number of different methods for measuring calyx size in order to find an analysis approach that was both accurate and feasible given the large number of samples to be quantified. We found that for KC ablation experiments (Figures1, Figure 2), the maximum cross-sectional area of the calyx served as an accurate proxy for the number of Kenyon cells. As we now clarify in the methods, this area is determined by drawing a precise outline around the calyx at its maximum extent along the A-P axis and measuring the area inside this shape. Ovals such as shown in Figure 1 were not used for quantification. To give a better sense of calyx dimensions following ablation, we now show volume contours for the images in Figure 1B (Figure 1—video 1), and measure the volumes of these five samples (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). As calyx max cross-sectional area is correlated with both KC number and with calyx volume (Figure 1—figure supplement 1), we are confident that it serves as a relevant metric.</p><p>We also quantified the number of total boutons in our images. Except in Figure 5 and Figure 6, where we ablate olfactory projection neurons, we did not observe alterations in bouton size or shape, or empty areas of the calyx. Bouton number therefore provides a functionally meaningful measure of alterations across the whole volume of the calyx. In Figure 5 and Figure 6, we indeed describe that calyx area is no longer a good proxy for calyx contents.</p><p>Please note: In Figure 1—video 1, we have not been able to force the rendered mushroom bodies to be displayed at the same scale, though a standard-sized bounding box (red) is displayed on each sample. This is due to the time frame of the revision and the software available to us. So as not to delay the submission of the revision, we are including the video as is. We will include it or exclude it from the published paper as advised.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It's unclear how they actually counted PN boutons/cell bodies/claws.

Also, the numbers in Figure 1E don't match their statement of '1000/calyx' on in the Materials and methods section. Can the authors please clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers for calling attention to discrepancies in bouton counts and in the number of boutons reported in the literature. We will summarize all comments related to bouton counts here.</p><p>a) How many boutons are there actually in the calyx?</p><p>We have reviewed the prior literature about bouton number and think that 600-800 is likely to be the correct number, with 1600 an overestimate. First, recent EM data reports 578 boutons/calyx, less than the estimates from Leiss et al., 2009 or Turner et al., 2008. Second, the estimate in Turner of 1115 boutons is made by extrapolating from the number of boutons on individual PNs to an estimated population of 216 PNs. More recent estimates suggest there are 150 or fewer PNs (Frechter et al., 2019; Zheng et al., 2018), which would reduce the estimate from Turner to ~800 total boutons. Third, in Leiss, the average number of boutons identified by manual counting is 768. When the authors overexpress a LimK-GFP fusion protein, they are able to count boutons “semiautomatically” but obtain more than double the number, ~1600. LimK is an actin binding protein, and Kenyon cell dendrites are actin-rich structures, suggesting that bouton number and morphology may not be wild type in these animals. Indeed, the authors suggest that the high number of boutons in this condition may be due to changes in bouton morphology caused by overexpression of LimK. Together with the three other quantifications (Turner, Zheng, and our analysis here), as well as the uncertainty about the effects of LimK overexpression, it is likely that 1600 is the outlier, and the true bouton number is closer to 600-800. Together, these results suggest that while the rule of thumb in the field is that there are ~1000 boutons/calyx, the great majority of calyces likely have less than this number. Indeed, we did not observe 1000 boutons/calyx in our own data; our statement on line 859 was incorrect.</p><p>a) What did we count?</p><p>In Figure 1 and Figure 3, we counted not total boutons (stained with ChAT), but GH146-positive boutons. GH146 labels ~2/3 of total PNs. We stated this in the legend of Figure 1 but were in error in describing Figure 3 as counting ChAT-positive boutons. We have now fixed Figure 3 and made more clear that in Figure 1 we count GH146-positive boutons. Given that we count 450-700 GH146+ boutons, the total number in the calyx would be ~1.5-fold higher, or 675-1050. This is a reasonable number of total boutons given the prior literature.</p><p>a) How did we count the boutons?</p><p>Reviewer 1 suggests that our bouton counts were arbitrary. This is far from the case! We collected confocal stacks from anterior to posterior with ~200nm axial resolution (depending on the wavelength) and 1μm slices in Z. We have moved this information from the Materials and methods section closer to our description of bouton counting to allow more clarity. We then counted all boutons in every second image (a census every two microns), as described in the original manuscript. When we counted <italic>somata</italic>, we counted every third micron.</p><p>In initiating our analysis, we scanned through our confocal stacks to define how far boutons extended across images. We found that boutons visible in slice 0 were often visible in slices -1 and +1, but never in slices -2 and +2. Specifically, to avoid overcounting, we therefore counted all boutons every second micron. While this may undersample the boutons, undersampling is not statistically problematic a priori. Moreover, we definitely did not double-count boutons, which would be statistically problematic. Most important of all for our purposes is that the control and experimental datasets are sampled equivalently, which our methods ensured. We now include a supplemental methods image showing what we count as boutons from a particular confocal slice (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><p>We tried, both previously and in response to the reviewer comments, to count as is described in Leiss, “…constantly moving through the Z-stack.” We found that making this assessment of when to count and when not to count a bouton allowed too much room for experimenter interpretation and bias and was therefore less consistent than counting every second micron. However, for 71D09 experiments, where we count boutons of just a single PN, we were able to confirm that scanning up and down gave the same results as counting every second micron.</p><p>Importantly, we were not able to measure boutons in any automated way, though we tried various software packages, and the authors in Leiss were only able to use automated methods to count boutons when bouton morphology became more orderly, through LimK overexpression in Kenyon cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2B shows examples of how they count the number of KC neuroblasts using the 58F02 driver.

This needs more explanation. Is the driver not completely KC specific? How did they know that a cluster is made of up KCs and not other cells, especially with the 9 o'clock cluster.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the reviewer is correct to point out that the driver does not label Kenyon cells exclusively, and that the green clumps not highlighted are not Kenyon cells.

We have now clarified this in the legend of Figure 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors must take more measurements of KC odor responses in ablated animals, n=3 is not sufficient for any conclusions. In fact, there are no statistical tests in Figure 7 to support any conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 7, we have now more than doubled our dataset, so that we present 7 sham and 7 reduced-KC samples. We include statistical tests and additional analyses in Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1. We note that to our knowledge, this is the first analysis that attempts to define effects on neural function of developmental perturbations of this circuit, and that the number of sham-treated animals we present is consistent with the number of animals used in previous studies to draw conclusions about Kenyon cell function in unmanipulated animals.</p><p>In this context, our analyses have not been exhaustive. While many aspects of odor representation appear preserved in reduced-KC calyces, we also observe statistically significant differences in responses to some odors when cells are pooled across animals for analysis. It is difficult to decide whether each cell should “count” as a biological replicate, or each animal, and of course our statistical power to detect changes is very different depending on that choice. There may also be additional quantitative differences between conditions that we cannot capture even with our increased sample size, due to the high variability across control animals (which is expected given that Kenyon cells are randomly innervated, and corresponds with prior literature). We hope we have been appropriately circumspect in our language about what we can and cannot learn given our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What does the df/f value shown in e.g. Figure 7C represent?

Viewing those two distributions is far more informative than a% response, which apparently ranges from 5-40% by the current criterion, so it's not a very robust measurement anyway. (In fact, in Figure 7D I see a number around 0.5, very high!)</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. In Figure 7D of the revised manuscript, we now show such an analysis. We also now present df/f values for all our analyzed cells and samples (Figure 7—source data 1) such that others can perform their own analyses.</p><p>We were also surprised that so many Kenyon cells responded to isobutyl acetate and ethyl acetate, given rules of thumb in the field that ~10% of KCs respond to a given odor. We are using a more sensitive GCaMP than prior imaging studies (GCaMP6s versus GCaMP3 and GCaMP1.3), so we may detect more responses than in previous work. There is also variation across studies in the odor concentrations used (from 1:10 to 1:1000; we used 1:40), and variation in composition of the bath saline, which will also affect neuronal responsiveness. It is therefore reasonable that the proportion of cells responding to odor would be different across studies.</p><p>We performed a systematic review of studies that report the responses of individual Kenyon cells to a variety of odors. Responsiveness reported in electrophysiological datasets varies depending on the spiking criteria used to define “responsive,” as discussed in Murthy, Fiete and Laurent, 2008, from a maximum of 18% of KCs called as “responding” to a given odor in Turner, 2008, versus up to 75% in Murthy. Moreover, proportion of Kenyon cells responding to odors increases along with the sensitivity of the GCaMP variant used, from a maximum of 2% of cells responding to a particular odor with GCaMP1 (Wang, 2004), to a maximum of 20% of cells with GCaMP3 (Honegger 2013, Campbell 2013), and up to 80% responding with GCaMP6s (our results). Our results with GCaMP6s correspond well with the spiking criteria defined in Murthy, and are also consistent with the expectation that GCaMP1 and GCaMP3 will underrepresent neuronal activity compared to GCaMP6s.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable5" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Study</td><td valign="top">Method</td><td valign="top">Saline</td><td valign="top">Odor Concentration</td><td valign="top">KCs responding</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Wang 2004</td><td valign="top">GCaMP1.3 in OK107</td><td valign="top">“adult fly saline”</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td><td valign="top">.1% to 2%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Murthy 2008</td><td valign="top">Whole cell patch clamp</td><td valign="top">Murthy</td><td valign="top">1:10</td><td valign="top">25%-75%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Murthy 2008</td><td valign="top">Whole cell patch clamp</td><td valign="top">Murthy</td><td valign="top">1:100</td><td valign="top">17%-37%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Murthy 2008</td><td valign="top">Whole cell patch clamp</td><td valign="top">Murthy</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td><td valign="top">0%-50%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Turner 2008</td><td valign="top">Whole cell patch clamp</td><td valign="top">Wilson</td><td valign="top">1:1000</td><td valign="top">0%-18%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Campbell 2013</td><td valign="top">GCaMP3 in OK107</td><td valign="top">Wilson</td><td valign="top">1:100</td><td valign="top">3%-17%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Honegger 2013</td><td valign="top">GCaMP3 in OK107</td><td valign="top">Wilson</td><td valign="top">1:100</td><td valign="top">1%-20%</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Elkahlah 2019</td><td valign="top">GCaMP6s in OK107</td><td valign="top">External saline</td><td valign="top">1:40</td><td valign="top">0%-80%</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Wilson saline (in mM): NaCl 103, KCl 3, TES 5, trehalose 10, glucose 10, sucrose 7, NaHCO3 26, NaH2PO4 1, CaCl2 1.5, MgCl2 4 (adjusted to 280 mOsm).

Second, we started to collect data at a higher frame rate (5 Hz), and to collect images continuously during the rest periods between odors trials. These two changes improve Suite2p motion correction. Third, for both the new samples presented here and the samples presented in the original submission, we have now included only ROIs in analysis for which the cell does not leave the ROI during the odor trial. As can be seen in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 1, our cell-wise traces over time look stable and responses are time-locked to odor stimulus.

I especially like that the authors took their analysis all the way to circuit function. However, much of the primary anatomical data is not always convincing. And there are experimental oversights that are either problematic or it is not fully explained why they are not problematic.</p><p>Figure 1. The authors variably reduce the number of Kenyon Cell neuroblasts and Projection Neuron neuroblasts using chemical ablation approaches. They show this leads to reduction of Kenyon Cell number and reductions in projection neuron bouton numbers.</p><p>Can the authors show projection neuron boutons at higher resolution? I have no idea how they counted the boutons from these images. Much of their argument hinges on their ability to count these structures, so showing this in a convincing way in Figure 1 is important.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out, we now show higher resolution images in Figure 1B, as well as a supplemental figure, Figure 1—figure supplement 2, showing what counts as a bouton during quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2. In the same manipulation as Figure 1, the authors score for additional phenotypes-In panel F, how do these images allow one to count boutons? The images are too low-resolution to tell, could they be displayed bigger, or without the overlay? I can't tell how the drawings are the right correspond to the images that are shown. Similarly, but more dramatically, for the claws in Figure 2F, especially the bottom panel, I cannot understand how the raw image data gives the authors the schematic that they show at the right.

(While these are enhancer traps, not antibodies, they are both integrated into loci, eyeless and oaz, that are important for patterning these cell types.) The fact that these neurons still contact each other is itself a reflection of their proper specification. Moreover, these neurons innervate other appropriate targets-supernumerary PNs innervate the antennal lobe and lateral horn, in addition to the calyx, and KCs innervate the mushroom body axonal lobes except in the most extreme expansions.</p><p>We have RNAseq data for wild type PNs and KCs at 45h APF and in adults. We show here that there is <italic>no</italic> endogenous expression of <italic>mud</italic> in either cell type at either time point, which makes us comfortable using an RNAi that is not restricted to neuroblasts. We think it is overkill to add these 9 RNAseq datasets to the publication, but are open to doing so if desired. To generate this data, we labeled KCs with MB247, and PNs with GH146. We dissociated neurons as already described in our FACs-analysis methods, and FAC-sorted them, retaining PNs, KCs, and unlabeled cells (“Double Negative” or “DN”). We prepared RNA using SmartSeq V2, and subjected libraries to deep sequencing. We include below <italic>Oaz</italic> and <italic>ey</italic>, markers of PNs and KCs, respectively. Adult data is an average of two replicates; 45h APF data is from a single library for each cell type. Numbers here are FPKM generated by Cufflinks/Cuffdiff.</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable6" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom"/><td valign="bottom">DN45h</td><td valign="bottom">PN45h</td><td valign="bottom">KC45h</td><td valign="bottom">DNadult (Avg)</td><td valign="bottom">PNadult (Avg)</td><td valign="bottom">KCadult (Avg)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">mud</td><td valign="bottom">0.0223468</td><td valign="bottom">0.0394137</td><td valign="bottom">0</td><td valign="bottom">0.00588349</td><td valign="bottom">0.0108654</td><td valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom"><italic>nsyb</italic></td><td valign="bottom">337.596</td><td valign="bottom">230.206</td><td valign="bottom">155.922</td><td valign="bottom">740.204</td><td valign="bottom">2628.74</td><td valign="bottom">787.3</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Oaz</td><td valign="bottom">0.167649</td><td valign="bottom">66.0146</td><td valign="bottom">0.128423</td><td valign="bottom">0.25497</td><td valign="bottom">171.622</td><td valign="bottom">0</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ey</td><td valign="bottom">5.42195</td><td valign="bottom">1.21215</td><td valign="bottom">227.788</td><td valign="bottom">7.57751</td><td valign="bottom">0.143108</td><td valign="bottom">275.23</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">l(2)gl</td><td valign="bottom">1.04542</td><td valign="bottom">2.15384</td><td valign="bottom">0</td><td valign="bottom">0.376796</td><td valign="bottom">0.527345</td><td valign="bottom">0.301086</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">aPKC</td><td valign="bottom">37.2453</td><td valign="bottom">7.67176</td><td valign="bottom">43.2128</td><td valign="bottom">81.0263</td><td valign="bottom">185.601</td><td valign="bottom">93.7232</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">pros</td><td valign="bottom">19.9572</td><td valign="bottom">12.4061</td><td valign="bottom">8.53237</td><td valign="bottom">48.9148</td><td valign="bottom">152.84</td><td valign="bottom">60.9881</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>We cannot completely rule out a role for <italic>mud</italic> in neuronal identity/specification, but we are more comfortable using <italic>mud</italic> than other neuroblast factors which continue to be expressed in differentiating neurons, e.g. aPKC, l(2)gl, and pros shown above.

As shown in Figure 3F, calyces with maximum cross-sectional area greater than 2000µM have an average of ~100 MZ19+ boutons, versus ~55 in controls.
