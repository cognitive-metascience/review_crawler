Here, we characterized global epigenomic changes during the direct reprogramming of mouse fibroblasts to neurons using whole-genome base-resolution DNA methylation (mC) sequencing. We found that the pioneer transcription factor Ascl1 alone is sufficient for inducing the uniquely neuronal feature of non-CG methylation (mCH), but co-expression of Brn2 and Mytl1 was required to establish a global mCH pattern reminiscent of mature cortical neurons. Ascl1 alone induced promoter CG methylation (mCG) of fibroblast specific genes, while BAM overexpression additionally targets a competing myogenic program and directs a more faithful conversion to neuronal cells. Ascl1 induces local demethylation at its binding sites. Surprisingly, co-expression with Brn2 and Mytl1 inhibited the ability of Ascl1 to induce demethylation, suggesting a contextual regulation of transcription factor - epigenome interaction. Finally, we found that de novo methylation by DNMT3A is required for efficient neuronal reprogramming.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>epigenomics</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>transdifferentiation</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goodell</surname><given-names>Margaret</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ecker</surname><given-names>Joseph R</given-names></name><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Howard Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Wernig</surname><given-names>Marius</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Induced neuronal cells acquire epigenomic signatures specific to matured neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mesoderm originated fibroblast cells can be reprogrammed to ectodermal induced neuronal (iN) cells by the overexpression of proneural transcription factor (TF) Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chanda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>). Co-expression of Brn2 and Mytl1 with Ascl1 (BAM), enhances reprogramming efficiency by suppressing a competing myogenic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chanda et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>). During reprogramming, Ascl1 acts as a pioneer factor by binding to and opening closed chromatin regions, as well as modulating the binding of Brn2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>), while Myt1l serves as multi-lineage repressor that maintains neuronal identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mall et al., 2017</xref>). The accumulation of abundant mCH is an epigenomic hallmark unique for mature neurons of mammalian brains, which could not be experimentally induced so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lister et al., 2013</xref>). mCH is recognized by MECP2 and serves critical gene regulatory functions in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>). The reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons using Ascl1 alone or in combination with Brn2 and Myt1l is a powerful way to interrogate the biochemical function of these TFs and given their prominent role during neural differentiation will also help dissecting their potential regulation of mC remodeling during neuron differentiation. Moreover, the role of DNA methylation in experimental induction of the neuronal lineage by TF reprogramming is not known yet and we currently lack a deep characterization of mC landscape of iN cells. Here we analyzed mC reconfiguration during iN cell reprogramming using whole-genome base-resolution methylome sequencing (MethylC-seq) and functionally perturbed methylation dynamics by genetic inhibition of Dnmt3a.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fully reprogrammed iN cells accumulate abundant non-CG methylation</title><p>Base-resolution methylomes were generated for iN cells induced by either Ascl1 alone or all three TFs (BAM) in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We analyzed the methylomes of control MEFs, cells at initial (Ascl1 2d) and intermediate stages of reprogramming (Ascl1 5d and BAM 5d) and fully reprogrammed iN cells (Ascl1 22d and BAM 22d). 5d and 22d cells were isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) using a neuronal TauEGFP reporter. We further generated methylomes for in vitro differentiation of neural progenitor cells (NPC, NPC 7d, NPC 14d and NPC 21d) under comparable culturing conditions. Remarkably, Ascl1 or BAM induced significant global accumulation of the neuronal-enriched non-conventional mCH methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). mCH level reached an average of 0.28% in Ascl1 22d iN cells and a much greater level (0.57%) in BAM 22d iN cells, which is comparable to the frontal cortex tissue of 2 week old mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lister et al., 2013</xref>). In mature mouse cortical neurons (NeuN+), mCH is strongly enriched in the CAC context and mCAC accounted for approximately 34% of all mCH in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, we found neuronal reprogramming from fibroblasts was associated with a progressive establishment of mCAC predominance. In fully reprogrammed Ascl1 or BAM 22d iN cells, mCAC became the most abundant form (26% to 27%) of mCH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). mCH is inversely correlated with gene expression in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lister et al., 2013</xref>). mCH was very weakly correlated to gene expression in MEFs or in intermediate reprogramming stages (BAM 5d) but became strongly inversely correlated with gene expression in BAM 22d cells suggesting a similar role of mCH in the brain and iN cells (Spearman r = −0.479, p-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>−308</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The accumulation of mCH in iN cells was correlated with a significant elevation of genome-wide mCG level from 72.7% in MEF to 79.5% in Ascl1 22d cells, and 82.5% in BAM 22d cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40197.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The Ascl1, Brn2 and Myt1l reprogramming factors induce an authentic, neuron-specific CH methylation pattern in fibroblasts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Global mCG (top panel) and mCH (bottom panel) levels of iN cells and NPC-derived cells. mCG and mCH accumulates in both maturing iN cells and differentiating NPCs.

Using hierarchical clustering of gene body mCH levels, we found that gene body mCH in mature cortical neurons (Exc, NeuN +and Cortex samples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was more strongly correlated with BAM 22d cells (box 1) than with Ascl1 22d cells (box 2) reflecting the more mature state of BAM iN cells compared to Ascl1-iN cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, Ascl1 22d cells correlated more strongly to early reprogramming stages (Ascl1 5d and BAM 5d) and non-neural tissues (box 3,4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, as observed for gene expression patterns, BAM iN cells displayed a mCH landscape that is more similar to mature cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We identified genes showing similar or distinct mCH patterns between iN cells and mature neurons using K-means clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We identified a large number (2,098, Cluster 15 and 16) of genes that were strongly depleted of mCH in BAM 22d iN cells but showed medium levels of mCH in immature iN cells and Ascl1 22d iN cells (box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably, BAM 22d iN cells and matured cortical neurons showed similar hypo mCH for genes in Cluster 15 and 16. Through correlating with transcriptome analysis of iN cell reprogramming, we found that genes in Cluster 15 and 16 were actively expressed in successfully reprogrammed iN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>). Cluster 15 was enriched in gene functions such as synapse and metal ion binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). For example, <italic>Nrxn1</italic> and <italic>Syt1</italic> were depleted of mCH in BAM 22d cells but were enriched of mCH in Ascl1 22d cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We also found myocyte marker genes <italic>Tpm2</italic> and <italic>Acta1</italic> in Cluster 20, which shows greater level of mCH in BAM 22d iN than Ascl1 22d iN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This is consistent with our previous finding that Brn2 and Myt1l can suppress the cryptic myogenic program in iN cell reprogramming induced by Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>). In summary, we found direct reprogramming using BAM factors produces a global mCH pattern more similar to cortical neurons, compared to using Ascl1 alone. mCH pattern in BAM iN cells is more permissive for the expression of neuronal and synaptic genes, and more repressive for the expression of the competing myogenic program.</p><p>Lastly, we examined the pattern of mCH at long genes in iN cells. It was recently found that long genes are associated with greater levels of mCH in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>). Comparing fully programmed iN cells to mouse cortex we found a less pronounced increase in mCH level associated with gene length in iN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Non-CG methylation is enriched in dynamically regulated genes during reprogramming and development</title><p>To explore the role of mCH in regulating dynamic gene expression during reprogramming, we ranked genes by gene body mCH levels at an early stage of reprogramming (BAM 5d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). Genes showing early mCH accumulation were strongly enriched in downregulated genes (compared to MEF) in BAM 22d iN cells, and to a less extent enriched in both upregulated and downregulated genes in BAM 13d iN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). Thus early mCH accumulation is correlated with genes showing dynamic expression during reprogramming, and most strikingly with genes repressed in matured iN cells (BAM 22d).

In all expression levels and reprogramming stages examined, downregulated genes accumulated greater levels of mCH than genes with static or increased expression during reprogramming.

Nes-cre;Dnmt3a fl/fl was shown to erase almost all mCH and significantly reduce mCG level in mouse cerebellum, suggesting DNMT3A is the main DNA methyltransferase responsible for developmental de novo methylation in both CH and CG contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>). Consistent with our observation in direct reprogramming, mCH level of genes downregulated during cerebellum development (postnatal day 60 vs. day 7) was significantly greater than that of static (Wilcoxon rank sum test, p=1.2×10<sup>−81</sup>) or upregulated genes (p=0.0123, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Notably, the removal of mCH and reduction of mCG in the Dnmt3a mutant brain did not affect the expression of developmentally static genes, but resulted in an upregulation of developmentally downregulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, p=1.3×10<sup>−12</sup>), which is consistent with the proposed gene repressive role of mCH. Unexpectedly, Dnmt3a ablation also led to a downregulation of developmentally upregulated genes (p=6×10<sup>−15</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), suggesting that mC support gene expression at these loci. To understand this observation, we first hypothesize that mC antagonizes polycomb repression at developmentally upregulated genes and indirectly promotes gene expression. However, using H3K27me3 peaks (combined from adult cerebellum and P0 hindbrain) as a marker for polycomb regulation, a comparable fraction (17%, p-value=0.87, fisher-exact test) of developmentally up- and down- regulated genes were regulated by polycomb complex. In addition, for either up- or down- regulated genes, genes overlapping with H3K27me3 peak were not affected differently by Dnmt3a ablation from genes without H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Therefore, these results do not support the model that mC indirectly promote gene expression by antagonizing polycomb repression.</p><p>We considered a second hypothesis that Dnmt3a indirectly supports developmental gene activation by providing the substrate for hydroxymethylcytosine in a CG dinucleotide context (hmCG). hmCG is associated with actively expressed genes in mouse brain cortex or cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mellén et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this speculation, in adult mouse cerebellum, developmentally upregulated genes showed significantly higher level of gene body hmCG than developmentally downregulated genes (p=1.3×10<sup>−6</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and static genes (p=2.4×10<sup>−55</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Developmentally upregulated and downregulated genes show comparable levels of other cytosine modifications (mCG, mCH or hmCH). The result suggests that the activation of developmentally upregulated genes is associated with hmCG accumulation, which may indirectly require DNMT3A for contributing the substrate (mCG) for TET methylcytosine dioxygenases to produce hmCG.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Promoter CG methylation targets non-neural transcriptional programs during reprogramming</title><p>Next, we wanted to determine the role of mCG dynamics in reprogramming.

To compare promoter mCG between direct reprogrammed iN cells, in vitro and in vivo grown cells, we identified 4496 promoters that became significantly hyper CG methylated in BAM 22d iN cells compared to MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

During reprogramming, mCG at promoters showed a strong inverse correlation with gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). This negative correlation between promoter mCG and gene expression in iN cells attenuates rapidly within 2 kb of the TSS, which is strikingly different from primary human or mouse tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Pairwise comparisons of brain cortex to kidney, cerebellum, heart and lung supported the previous analysis of human tissues that the peak negative correlation between mCG and gene expression was found at 2–3 kb downstream of TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>).

This subset of genes were also more actively expressed in MEF than in adult mouse cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Therefore the downregulation of genes with hyper CG methylated promoter during direct programming is consistent with their repressed expression in in vivo grown neurons.

Only a subset of myocytic marker genes (<italic>Myl1</italic>, <italic>Tnni1</italic> and <italic>Acta1</italic>) were also hyper CG methylated in cortical neurons, suggesting the promoter hyper-methylation at myocytic genes is in part an epigenetic program specific for in vitro grown neurons. We further grouped promoters into three types based on their methylation states in Ascl1 22d or BAM 22d iN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Type two promoters that were specifically hyper CG methylated in BAM 22d cells but not Ascl1 22d, and were enriched in skeletal muscle related function such as sarcomere, contractile fiber part and myofibril (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).

Promoter hyper CG methylation of fibroblast and myocyte specific genes may reflect an alternative repressive mechanism (DNA methylation vs. PRC) being utilized during direct reprogramming or cell culture. Taken together, the suppression of fibroblast and myogenic programs during reprogramming was associated with promoter hyper CG methylation, which indicates the potential role of DNA methylation in mediating the suppression of historical and competing programs during reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Reprogramming using Ascl1-alone or BAM factors induce distinct local DNA methylation remodeling</title><p>Discrete regions with low levels of DNA methylation have previously been found to indicate TF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Schultz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stadler et al., 2011</xref>). To explore the interaction between CG methylation and TF binding, in particular the binding of ASCL1, BRN2 and MYT1L, we identified 10,075 and 15,093 differentially methylated sites (DMSs) showing reduced mCG during Ascl1-only and BAM induced reprogramming, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). 96% of Ascl1-only DMSs and 95.7% of BAM DMSs were located more than 2.5 kb away from the closest TSS. Thus the vastly majority of DMSs are likely to be associated with distal gene regulatory activities. DMSs were grouped based upon their demethylation kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). To understand the relationship between DMSs and the binding of TFs that drive the reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons, we overlapped DMSs and ChIP-seq peaks of ASCL1, BRN2 and MYTL1 requiring a minimum of one base overlap. We compared DMSs with ChIP-seq peaks of ASCL1 following 2 days of overexpression of Ascl1 alone (Ascl1 MEF peaks) or with Brn2 and Myt1l (Ascl1 BAM peaks) in MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Similarly, DMSs were compared to BRN2 peaks following 2 days of overexpression of Brn2 alone (Brn2 MEF peaks), or with Ascl1 and Myt1l (Brn2 BAM peaks) in MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). The reduction of local mCG during the reprogramming of fibroblasts to iN cells is likely mediated by direct demethylation instead of passive dilution, since we have previously shown that cells exit cell cycle within 2 days of Ascl1 induction based on significant reduction in Ki67 positive cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davila et al., 2013</xref>) and homogenous downregulation of cell cycle genes from single cell RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Treutlein et al., 2016</xref>). Among the sites that become demethylated in Ascl1-only reprogramming we found a striking co-enrichment of ASCL1 binding, in particular at early demethylating sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that ASCL1 can recruit a DNA demethylation machinery to its target sites. This fits well with Ascl1’s known function as a strong transcriptional activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castro et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raposo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>).

DMSs demethylated in early stage of BAM induced reprogramming (BAM DMS group 3) are enriched in BRN2 binding sites in MEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). BAM DMSs demethylated in fully reprogrammed BAM 22d iN cells showed a moderate overlap with BRN2 binding sites in neural stem cells (NSC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). BRN2 binding is known to be dependent on existing open chromatin and pioneer factors such as ASCL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). This result suggests BRN2 is able to at least partially access its physiological binding sites in fully reprogrammed BAM 22d iN cells.

In contrast, most DMSs found in Ascl1 5d (89.2%) were also found in Ascl1 22d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>), suggesting the little overlap between DMSs demethylated during Ascl1-only and BAM induced reprogramming reflects true biological differences. To further illuminate the nature of the demethylated regions we performed motif enrichment analysis for the surrounding 500 bp (±250 bp) regions of each group of DMSs shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>. As expected, the Ascl1 binding motif was strongly enriched in Ascl1-only DMSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). The DMSs found in the two types of iN cell reprogramming were enriched in completely different TF binding motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Accordingly, the Ascl1 motif was only partly enriched in BAM DMSs demethylated in early reprogramming (BAM DMS group 3), but was depleted in BAM DMSs emerged in later stages of reprogramming (BAM DMS group 1). As expected, the Brn2 (Pou3f2) motif along with several other Pou-Homeodomain motifs were enriched in BAM DMSs but not in any Ascl1-only DMSs. Moreover, we found enrichment of additional motifs of TFs many of which with prominent neuronal function such as Lhx2, Emx2, Nfib and Mef2 in BAM DMSs. These findings indicate that the dynamic DMSs during iN cell reprogramming are enriched in DNA regulatory elements and their proper activation involves DNA demethylation as part of the chromatin remodeling of a fibroblast to a neuronal configuration.</p><p>Given the striking enrichment of ASCL1 binding at Ascl1-only DMSs, we next analyzed the mCG dynamics of just the Ascl1 binding sites during reprogramming. Although only a moderate 28.4% (935/3296) of Ascl1 binding sites (not already showing lowly methylation in MEF) were overlapped with Ascl1-only DMSs, our quantitative analysis found that Ascl1 expression in fibroblasts induced a substantial reduction of DNA methylation at the vast majority of Ascl1 binding sites in early reprogramming Ascl1 5d with persistence of reduced mCG levels to 22 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). During BAM-induced reprogramming, the ASCL1-bound sites behaved completely differently. Early in the reprogramming process Ascl1 did induce demethylation at many of its target sites, but to a much more moderate degree (BAM 5d, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). Surprisingly, these changes were only transient, as the demethylation of Ascl1 binding sites was reversed in the mature stage of BAM iN reprogramming (BAM 22d). The results suggest that Brn2 and Myt1l functionally interfere with Ascl1-mediated local demethylation. Since ASCL1 chromatin binding is unaffected by other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>), this observation indicates that addition of Brn2 and Myt1l modifies ASCL1’s ability to induce DNA demethylation at its chromatin binding sites and that the two reprogramming strategies are associated with drastically different DNA methylation remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J and K</xref>).

To initiate reprogramming we co-infected the cells with a doxycycline (dox)-inducible TetO-Ascl1 lentivirus. Dox was added 2–4 days post-infection to allow for degradation of Dnmt3a mRNA and protein before inducing Ascl1 expression for direct conversion of MEFs to neurons.

To our knowledge, high level (e.g. mCH/CH &gt; 0.1%) has not been previously reported in any in vitro neuronal differentiation or direct reprogramming models. Robust mCH accumulation suggests that iN cells recapitulates a major epigenomic signature that starts to emerge during the second postnatal week of mouse brain development and supports the notion that fully reprogrammed iN cells resemble differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>). The observation that BAM induced iN cells further acquired a global mCH landscape reminiscent to mature neurons is consistent with previous findings that BRN2 and MYTL1 can enhance neuronal maturation during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chanda et al., 2014</xref>). The reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons and induction of mCH by overexpressing merely 1 or 3 TFs provides a tractable system to study the dynamic regulation of genome-wide DNA methylation. For example, mCH accumulation during reprogramming is associated with the upregulation of Dnmt3a and may be regulated by the direct binding of ASCL1 to Dnmt3a promoter. In addition, inducible expression of Ascl1 allowed us to conclude that ASCL1 induces local demethylation at most of its binding sites. mCH is inversely correlated with gene expression in the brain and has been shown to mediate gene repression through MECP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lister et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stroud et al., 2017</xref>). Although the timing of mCH accumulation parallels neuron maturation both in vivo during in vitro reprogramming, little is known whether mCH plays any role in regulating brain development. Our integrative analysis of transcriptomic and DNA methylome datasets for neuronal reprogramming and published work on cerebellar development shows that mCH is enriched in genes that are downregulated during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Frank et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that mCH plays a role in gene repression during brain development. Reanalysis of the Dnmt3a conditional knock-out transcriptome data supported our model - developmental downregulated genes become activated in the absence of mCH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gabel et al., 2015</xref>). In both mouse and human, mCH accumulation start around birth and plateaus at early adolescence. Our results collectively suggest that mCH facilitates neuronal maturation during development through gene repression.</p><p>Direct conversion from fibroblasts to neurons is associated with distinct promoter hypermethylation, which is unique to iN cells and NPC differentiated cells and is not observed during in vivo neuron differentiation. We thus found iN cells exhibit both consistent (e.g. mCH) and different (e.g. promoter methylation) epigenomic features compared to mature cortical neurons. Our study suggests that de novo DNA methylation contributes to cellular reprogramming by suppressing the donor fibroblast and the competing myogenic programs. The promoters targeted by hyper methylation is an independent set from ones bound by multi-lineage suppressor Mylt1l. In summary, our genomic analysis suggests both types of DNA methylation - mCH and mCG serve repressive functions during cellular reprogramming and primarily target gene bodies and promoters, respectively. This hypothesis is supported by our functional experiment showing that fibroblast cells with ablated Dnmt3a locus have reduced reprogramming potential, which supports hypothesis that de novo DNA methylation is necessary for efficient reprogramming.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-TUBB3 (Tuj1)</td><td valign="top">Covance</td><td valign="top">MMS-435P;

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers felt that the work was exciting and important. The major contribution of this work is a detailed description of the DNA methylation status upon reprogramming fibroblasts to neurons as well as a convincing demonstration of how DNA methylation levels in reprogrammed cells mostly reflect the methylation status of mature neurons in a mouse brain, and they discern the critical transcription factors involved. There are no major outstanding concerns regarding the experiments or the conclusions of the work. There are a few minor concerns that could be addressed:</p><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>1) Figure 2G demonstrates a down-regulation of developmentally up-regulated genes in Dnmt3a KO cerebellum. Can the authors speculate on why the ablation of a de novo DNA methylase leads to down-regulation of normally up-regulated genes – i.e. indirect effect?</p><p>2) In regards to Figure 4 the authors speculate that ASCL1 can recruit demethylation machinery as it is frequently found at DMSs that lose methylation early in Ascl1-only reprogramming. Could the authors indicate whether this loss may also occur through passive dilution/lack of recruitment of the maintenance methylase?</p><p>3) Figure 5B shows Ascl1 at the promoter of Dnmt3a by ChIP – is there any data that Ascl1 binding induces Dnmt3a expression? Knockdown/knockout of Ascl1 affecting Dnmt3a expression levels for example?</p><p>4) In Figure 5C the large population of Dnmt3a positive cells that remain despite Dox treatment seems to suggest these cells may be selected for in the process of reprogramming. The Cre recombinase strategy is certainly not 100% efficient, but seems to work very well in this system according to Figure 5D. Could the authors provide some explanation for why this population is &quot;a large fraction&quot;?</p><p>5) The authors state &quot;We identified a large number (2,098, Cluster 15 and 16) of genes that were clearly hypermethylated in MEFs, and immature iN cells but were strongly depleted of mCH in BAM 22d iN cells (box in Figure 1C)&quot;. I suggest a revision of the statement here because, according to the key for normalized mCH values, hypermethylation corresponds to red and genes in cluster 15 and 16 in MEFs show instead medium levels of methylation (pale blue).</p><p>In the text: &quot;Through correlating with transcriptome analysis of iN cell reprogramming, we found that genes in Cluster 15 and 16 were actively expressed in successfully reprogrammed iN cells (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) (Treutlein et al., 2016)&quot; Figure —figure supplement 1E is missing.</p><p>6) The authors ranked genes by gene body mCH levels in BAM 5d. The authors state &quot;Notably, genes with early mCH accumulation showed strongly reduced expression in the late stage of neuronal reprogramming (BAM 22d, Figure 2B-C).&quot; I suggest a careful consideration with this statement since, looking at Figure 2A-C, one could also say that early accumulation of mCH can predict later transcriptional expression/up-regulation. For example, looking at BAM 13d, early mCH accumulation (BAM 5d) would correlate first with gene activation at BAM 13d, then with strongly reduced expression at BAM 22d. This type of correlative analysis would be more appropriate having gene expression data from BAM 5d and BAM 22d and even better by performing RNA/DNA parallel purification from the same sample and then generating the data sets. Same for where the authors state in the figure legend to Figure 2 &quot;Early mCH accumulation is strongly correlated to later gene repression&quot;.</p><p>7) The authors state &quot;Surprisingly, we found different patterns depending on the fold-change of gene expression: Mildly up-regulated genes accumulated intermediate mCH levels between down-regulated and static genes whereas strongly up-regulated genes and static genes were close to the MEF baseline of mCH levels (Figure 2D, E). These results suggest a model that mCH is preferentially targeted to mildly dynamic genes and modulates their expression during reprogramming, for strongly differentially regulated genes, however, mCH is mostly accumulating at down-regulated genes.&quot; I suggest to clarify with more information the reference points used to determine differential gene expression to create the categories Down, Up, Static. It is not clear if the differential gene expression is between BAM 2d and BAM22d. Considering the data from Gabel et al., 2015 normalizing to gene size in the analysis of Figure 2D, E may be relevant since a longer gene could accumulate more mCH in association with gene repression.</p><p>8) In the sentence &quot;To explore the interaction between CG methylation and TF binding, in particular the binding of ASCL1, BRN2 and MYT1L, we identified 10,075 and 15,093 differentially methylated sites (DMSs) showing reduced mCG during Ascl1-only and BAM induced reprogramming, respectively (Figure 4A, C and Supplementary file 3).&quot; 1) The numbers of DMSs 10,075 and 15,093, don't match the numbers that are summed up from the groups in the Figure 4A, C. 2) In the figure legend the information about which pair of iN cells were compared in the determination of DMSs is missing. For Ascl1-only, is it 22d vs. 2d? And for BAM-only, 22d vs. 5d? Finally, for those exact locations, were mCG estimations for 5d and MEF plotted? 3) &quot;only 0.6% (99/15,093) BAM DMSs were overlapped with ASCL1 peaks (Figure 4D)&quot;. I suggest to verify if the percentage indicated here is correct.</p><p>9) In the sentence &quot;Among the sites that become demethylated in Ascl1-only reprogramming we found a striking co-enrichment of ASCL1 binding, in particular at early demethylating sites (Figure 4B and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C)&quot;. The ChIP-seq data for Ascl1 in MEFs show Ascl1 binding in MEFs preceding direct reprogramming, which is surprising. Same as the ChIP-seq data for BRN2 that show binding in MEFs preceding direct reprogramming. I suggest to add a brief sentence to justify this observation based on prior data, so to clarify the result.</p><p>10) &quot;we found only 0.3% (38/15,093) BAM DMSs overlapped with MYT1L binding sites&quot; I suggest to verify if the percentage indicated here is correct. The DMSs reported in the Supplementary file 3A, B are specific CG sites 1bp. It would help to understand the data if the authors could elaborate on how the overlapping analysis was done: given the information provided, it seems that between the genomic coordinates of ChIP-seq peaks and the genomic coordinates of a specific CG site differentially methylated. Same for the motif enrichment analysis: I would add a brief sentence explaining how it was done because in the text the authors mention regions &quot;To further illuminate the nature of the demethylating regions&quot; Are these UMR/LMRs?</p><p>11) The authors state &quot;Our results collectively suggest that mCH facilitates neuronal maturation during development through gene expression&quot;. Is it through gene expression or gene repression here?</p><p>12) Optional: In Figure 1B it would be good to include the cortex MethylC-seq data from Hon et al., 2013 in order to examine if BAM 22d iN cells also cluster closely to cortex tissue.</p><p>The full reviews are given here for your interest:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work seeks to identify the genome-wide changes in DNA methylation that occur during the process of direct reprogramming of fibroblasts to induced neurons. In doing so the group examines two reprogramming strategies that are composed of either expressing a neuron-inducing transcription factor (Ascl1) or expressing the inducing transcription factor in combination with two other transcription factors that repress a myogenic state. They compare the DNA methylation status of these two strategies not only to each other but also to mature in vivo neurons in order to demonstrate the capacity of reprogramming to faithfully exhibit molecular markers of the intended cell types. These comparisons allow for an in vitro examination of the role that these transcription factors may also have in vivo neuronal development. Additionally, on a mechanistic level the authors indicate that the progressive increase in DNA methylation is due in large part to the increased expression of one of the de novo methylases – Dnmt3a.</p><p>The major contribution of this work is a detailed description of the DNA methylation status in induced neurons as well as a convincing demonstration of how DNA methylation levels in reprogrammed cells mostly reflect the methylation status of mature neurons in a mouse brain. This has not been sufficiently demonstrated previously. The authors demonstrate how a cellular reprogramming system may indicate which epigenetic marks are important to in vivo development and differentiation such as mCH DNA methylation in neuronal development in this case. Furthermore, the authors show that reprogramming with the three transcription factors (BAM) more accurately recapitulates the gene expression and methylation levels of mature neurons as opposed to reprogramming with Ascl1 alone indicating that reprogramming is aided by the repression of alternative states via epigenetic regulation.</p><p>There are no major outstanding concerns regarding the experiments or the conclusions of the work. There are a few minor concerns that could be addressed:</p><p>1) Figure 2G demonstrates a down-regulation of developmentally up-regulated genes in Dnmt3a KO cerebellum.

They show that the two reprograming strategies led to considerably different DNA methylation remodelling, with BAM factors producing a pattern that is more comparable to mature cortical neurons than Ascl1 alone. These factors are required, yet not sufficient, to acquire the DNA methylome of mature cortical neurons observed during in vivo neuron differentiation, acknowledging consistencies and differences between iN cells and mature neurons.</p><p>The authors have strong expertise in the fields of trans differentiation, particularly with the induction of fibroblasts to neurons by employing a defined set of transcription factors, such as Ascl1, Brn2 and Mytl1, whose ectopic expression in fibroblasts has been previously shown to induce a functional neuronal phenotype by these and other groups.</p><p>An exciting part of the work is the interrogation of the contribution of these TF to the reconfiguration of the DNA methylome. The authors show the accumulation of mCH in iN cells, an epigenomic signature of neuronal differentiation and of mature cortical neurons, in association with gene down-regulation and also examine mCG dynamics during conversion, an aspect not examined until this work on iN cells.</p><p>Interestingly, the acquisition of mCG associates with the suppression of fibroblast and myogenic programs and conditional ablation of Dnmt3a reduces the efficiency of iN cells generation from fibroblast, indicating that de novo methylation is required for efficient direct conversion to iN cells.</p><p>The paper is well-written, the methods fit with the aims of the study with a clearly described approach, the results are well-articulated and the conclusions are appropriate, given the results. I am overall enthusiastic about the work presented by the authors as no pre-existing study has been published addressing the reprograming of the DNA methylome upon direct conversion of fibroblasts to neurons. There are minor concerns and details missing about the data analysis not entirely clear that the authors ought to address. Despite these concerns, I believe that this manuscript meets the publication criteria for <italic>ELife</italic>.</p><p>The authors state &quot;We identified a large number (2,098, Cluster 15 and 16) of genes that were clearly hypermethylated in MEFs, and immature iN cells but were strongly depleted of mCH in BAM 22d iN cells (box in Figure 1C)&quot;.

Can the authors speculate on why the ablation of a</italic> de novo <italic>DNA methylase leads to down-regulation of normally up-regulated genes – i.e. indirect effect?</italic> </p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is intriguing that the ablation of Dnmt3a leads to downregulation of developmentally upregulated genes. Given the role of mC as a repressive epigenetic mark, it seems to be paradoxical that the major de novo DNA methyltransferase DNMT3A is required for supporting gene expression. We considered two hypotheses that may explain why mC mediated by DNMT3A can contribute positively to transcription.</p><p>1) DNMT3A mediated mC antagonizes polycomb repression at certain loci and is associated with active gene expression.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we first asked whether developmentally upregulated genes are more likely to be targeted by polycomb repressive complex, using H3K27me3 as a marker for polycomb regulation. However, we found that a comparable fraction (17%, p-value = 0.87, fisher-exact test) of developmentally up- and down- regulated genes were regulated by polycomb complex.</p><p>Secondly, we asked whether developmentally upregulated genes associated with H3K27me3 peaks are more strongly down-regulated upon the ablation of Dnmt3a, compared to genes that do not overlap with H3K27me3. However, for either developmentally up- or down- regulated genes, genes enriched in H3K27me3 do not show significantly different mis-regulation compared to genes without H3K27me3 enrichment.</p><p>Together, our results suggest that the observed positive correlation between mC and gene expression was not majorly contributed by the antagonism between mC and polycomb repression. This analysis is included in the revised manuscript as Figure 2—figure supplement 1C.</p><p>This analysis have been incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><p>“Unexpectedly, Dnmt3a ablation also led to a downregulation of developmentally upregulated genes (p = 6x10<sup>-15</sup>, Figure 2G), suggesting that mC support gene expression at these loci. […] Therefore, these results do not support the model that mC indirectly promote gene expression by antagonizing polycomb repression.”</p><p>2) DNMT3A indirectly support gene expression by contributing to the accumulation of hydroxymethylcytosine in CG dinucleotide context (hmCG).</p><p>Cerebellar neurons accumulate a high level of hmCG, which is associated with active gene expression. It was recently shown that hmCG cannot interact with MECP2 (Gabel et al., 2015; Mellén et al., 2017). Thus the oxidation of mCG abolishes its repressive function. We speculate that DNMT3A, through catalyzing de novo mCG, provides the necessary substrate for TET methylcytosine dioxygenase to produce hmCG. To ask whether the accumulation of hmCG is involved in gene activation during development, we compared different cytosine modifications between developmentally up- and down- genes using an oxBS-seq dataset generated from cerebellar granule cells (Mellén et al., 2017). Interestingly, developmentally up-regulated genes showed significantly higher level of gene body hmCG, but not other types of cytosine methylation, than developmentally down-regulated genes (p = 1.3 x 10<sup>-6</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and static genes (p = 2.4 x 10<sup>-55</sup>, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Thus, DNMT3A could indirectly support gene expression by mechanistically contribute to gene body hmCG.</p><p>This analysis have been incorporated into the revised manuscript.</p><p>“We considered a second hypothesis that Dnmt3a indirectly supports developmental gene activation by providing the substrate for hydroxymethylcytosine in a CG dinucleotide context (hmCG). […] The result suggests that the activation of developmentally upregulated genes is associated with hmCG accumulation, which may indirectly require DNMT3A for contributing the substrate (mCG) for TET methylcytosine dioxygenases to produce hmCG.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In regards to Figure 4 the authors speculate that ASCL1 can recruit demethylation machinery as it is frequently found at DMSs that lose methylation early in Ascl1-only reprogramming. Could the authors indicate whether this loss may also occur through passive dilution/lack of recruitment of the maintenance methylase?</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously shown that cells exit the cell cycle within 2 days of Ascl1 induction based on significant reduction in Ki67 positive cells (Davila et al., 2013) and homogenous downregulation of cell cycle genes from single cell RNA-seq data (Treutlein et al., 2016). Thus, the observed reduction of mCG at ASCL1 binding site is likely mediated by direct demethylation instead of passive dilution. We have included this discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><p>“The reduction of local mCG during the reprogramming of fibroblasts to iN cells is likely mediated by direct demethylation instead of passive dilution, since we have previously shown that cells exit cell cycle within 2 days of Ascl1 induction based on significant reduction in Ki67 positive cells (Davila et al., 2013) and homogenous downregulation of cell cycle genes from single cell RNA-seq data (Treutlein et al., 2016).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5B shows Ascl1 at the promoter of Dnmt3a by ChIP – is there any data that Ascl1 binding induces Dnmt3a expression? Knockdown/knockout of Ascl1 affecting Dnmt3a expression levels for example?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the original manuscript did not present evidence to support the functional regulation of Dnmt3a by ASCL1 binding. After examining published data from both mouse and human that are obtained from knock-down or over-expression of Ascl1, we cannot conclusively determine whether Ascl1 functionally regulates Dnmt3a expression.</p><p>1) Dnmt3a expression is not significantly different between MEF and MEF cells over-expressing Ascl1 for 2 days (fold change = 1.38, p-value = 0.28, t-test).</p><p>2) ASCL1 down regulation in human U87MG glioma cell line does not induce Dnmt3a mis-regulation (fold change = 1.07, p-value = 0.25, t-test, GSE76652) (Donakonda et al., 2017).</p><p>3) Ascl1 knock-out in human glioblastoma stem cells does not alter Dnmt3a expression (fold change = 1.13, p-value = 0.1, t-test, GSE87615) (Park et al., 2017).</p><p>4) Ascl1 over-expression in Ascl1 knock-out human glioblastoma stem cell line leads to down-regulation of Dnmt3a (fold change = 0.81, p-value = 0.006, GSE87617) (Park et al., 2017).</p><p>We have revised the manuscript to clearly indicate that this remains an open question.</p><p>“However, Ascl1 over-expression is insufficient to activate Dnmt3a expression since Dnmt3a was not significantly upregulated 2 days after Ascl1 induction. It remains unclear whether the binding of ASCL1 to the Dnmt3a promoter functionally contribute to Dnmt3a activation during reprogramming.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In Figure 5C the large population of Dnmt3a positive cells that remain despite Dox treatment seems to suggest these cells may be selected for in the process of reprogramming. The Cre recombinase strategy is certainly not 100% efficient, but seems to work very well in this system according to Figure 5D. Could the authors provide some explanation for why this population is &quot;a large fraction&quot;?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Figures 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E show that in the Cre infected population, we obtained a 75% efficiency in knocking out Dnmt3a, even though based on Cre staining, we see that infection efficiency is over 90% (data not shown). We also showed in Figure 5—figure supplement 1B that many of the cells expressing Cre also express Dnmt3a, suggesting either incomplete degradation of Dnmt3a or escape from Cre recombination. However, we agree that saying this population is “a large fraction” is inaccurate, and we have modified the manuscript as below:</p><p>“Despite efficient Dnmt3a depletion in the total fibroblast population (Figure 5D, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C) we observed a number of Dnmt3a-positive iN cells in the Cre-infected group, presumably due to incomplete degradation of Dnmt3a or escape from Cre recombination (Figure 5C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors state &quot;We identified a large number (2,098, Cluster 15 and 16) of genes that were clearly hypermethylated in MEFs, and immature iN cells but were strongly depleted of mCH in BAM 22d iN cells (box in Figure 1C)&quot;. I suggest a revision of the statement here because, according to the key for normalized mCH values, hypermethylation corresponds to red and genes in cluster 15 and 16 in MEFs show instead medium levels of methylation (pale blue).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that in immature iN cells and Ascl1 22d iN cells, the mCH level of clusters 15 and 16 can be more appropriately described as medium. The manuscript has been revised as below:</p><p>“We identified a large number (2,098, Cluster 15 and 16) of genes that were strongly depleted of mCH in BAM 22d iN cells but show medium levels of mCH in immature iN cells and Ascl1 22d iN cells (box in Figure 1C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the text: &quot;Through correlating with transcriptome analysis of iN cell reprogramming, we found that genes in Cluster 15 and 16 were actively expressed in successfully reprogrammed iN cells (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1E) (Treutlein et al., 2016)&quot; Figure —figure supplement 1E is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for noticing this oversight. Figure 1—figure supplement 1D instead of Figure 1—figure supplement 1E should be referenced here. This error has been corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors ranked genes by gene body mCH levels in BAM 5d. The authors state &quot;Notably, genes with early mCH accumulation showed strongly reduced expression in the late stage of neuronal reprogramming (BAM 22d, Figure 2B-C).&quot; I suggest a careful consideration with this statement since, looking at Figure 2A-C, one could also say that early accumulation of mCH can predict later transcriptional expression/up-regulation. For example, looking at BAM 13d, early mCH accumulation (BAM 5d) would correlate first with gene activation at BAM 13d, then with strongly reduced expression at BAM 22d. This type of correlative analysis would be more appropriate having gene expression data from BAM 5d and BAM 22d and even better by performing RNA/DNA parallel purification from the same sample and then generating the data sets. Same for where the authors state in the figure legend to Figure 2 &quot;Early mCH accumulation is strongly correlated to later gene repression&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we performed statistical analyses to ask whether genes showing early mCH accumulation are enriched in genes upregulated at BAM 13d time point. Indeed, comparing to MEF, both up-regulated and down-regulated gene in BAM 13d are moderately enriched in genes showing early mCH accumulation (Figure 2C). We thus concluded that early mCH accumulation is correlated with genes showing dynamic expression during reprogramming, and most strikingly repressed genes in matured iN cells (BAM 22d). The manuscript has been revised as below:</p><p>“Genes showing early mCH accumulation were strongly enriched in downregulated genes (compared to MEF) in BAM 22d iN cells, and to a less extent enriched in both upregulated and downregulated genes in BAM 13d iN cells (Figure 2B and C). Thus early mCH accumulation is correlated with genes showing dynamic expression during reprogramming, and most strikingly with genes repressed in matured iN cells (BAM 22d).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors state &quot;Surprisingly, we found different patterns depending on the fold-change of gene expression: Mildly up-regulated genes accumulated intermediate mCH levels between down-regulated and static genes whereas strongly up-regulated genes and static genes were close to the MEF baseline of mCH levels (Figure 2D, E). These results suggest a model that mCH is preferentially targeted to mildly dynamic genes and modulates their expression during reprogramming, for strongly differentially regulated genes, however, mCH is mostly accumulating at down-regulated genes.&quot; I suggest to clarify with more information the reference points used to determine differential gene expression to create the categories Down, Up, Static. It is not clear if the differential gene expression is between BAM 2d and BAM22d.</p></disp-quote><p>It appears that due to an error during the assembly of manuscript that Figure 2D-E were misinterpreted in the original manuscript. In Figure 2D-E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1, genes were stratified by average expression level across all time points of reprogramming, instead of dynamic expression patterns. We apologize for this error and we have revised the text related to this result:</p><p>“Surprisingly, we found different patterns depending on gene expression levels: lowly expressed genes accumulated high levels of mCH regardless of their developmental dynamics (Figure 2D; Figure 2—figure supplement 1A), whereas for actively expressed genes, gain of mCH is specific to developmentally downregulated genes; the mCH levels of upregulated and static genes were close to the MEF baseline (Figure 2E and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). These results suggest a model that mCH is preferentially targeted to two main gene groups – constitutively repressed genes and actively expressed genes showing developmental downregulation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Considering the data from Gabel et al., 2015 normalizing to gene size in the analysis of Figure 2D, E may be relevant since a longer gene could accumulate more mCH in association with gene repression.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has raised an interesting point that gene body mCH accumulation may be related to gene length as described in Gabel et al., 2015. In the revised manuscript, we have compared the relation between gene length and gene body mCH level in both mouse cortex and iN cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F). Compared to mouse cortex, fully reprogrammed iN cells (BAM 22d) show a less pronounced mCH accumulation in long genes.</p><p>“Lastly, we examined the pattern of mCH at long genes in iN cells. It was recently found that long genes are associated with greater levels of mCH in the mouse brain (Gabel et al. 2015). Comparing fully programmed iN cells to mouse cortex we found a less pronounced increase in mCH level associated with gene length in iN cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E and F).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the sentence &quot;To explore the interaction between CG methylation and TF binding, in particular the binding of ASCL1, BRN2 and MYT1L, we identified 10,075 and 15,093 differentially methylated sites (DMSs) showing reduced mCG during Ascl1-only and BAM induced reprogramming, respectively (Figure 4A, C and Supplementary file 3).&quot; 1) The numbers of DMSs 10,075 and 15,093, don't match the numbers that are summed up from the groups in the Figure 4A, C. 2) In the figure legend the information about which pair of iN cells were compared in the determination of DMSs is missing. For Ascl1-only, is it 22d vs. 2d? And for BAM-only, 22d vs. 5d? Finally, for those exact locations, were mCG estimations for 5d and MEF plotted? 3) &quot;only 0.6% (99/15,093) BAM DMSs were overlapped with ASCL1 peaks (Figure 4D)&quot;. I suggest to verify if the percentage indicated here is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion caused by the inconsistent DMS numbers in the text and figure. We excluded small DMS clusters including those less than 100 DMS, which likely reflect noise generated by setting of statistical thresholds.

The ChIP-seq data for Ascl1 in MEFs show Ascl1 binding in MEFs preceding direct reprogramming, which is surprising. Same as the ChIP-seq data for BRN2 that show binding in MEFs preceding direct reprogramming. I suggest to add a brief sentence to justify this observation based on prior data, so to clarify the result.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that adding more details of our previous study (Wapinski et al., 2013) would improve the clarity of the results.

The DMSs reported in the Supplementary file 3A, B are specific CG sites 1bp. It would help to understand the data if the authors could elaborate on how the overlapping analysis was done: given the information provided, it seems that between the genomic coordinates of ChIP-seq peaks and the genomic coordinates of a specific CG site differentially methylated.
