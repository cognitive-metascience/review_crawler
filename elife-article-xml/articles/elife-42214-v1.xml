Yet, how glucose activates PKA is unknown. We hypothesized that a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor is an upstream activator of PKA mediating LTCC potentiation during diabetic hyperglycemia. Experiments in apyrase-treated cells suggested involvement of a P2Y receptor underlying the glucose effects on LTTCs. Using human tissue, expression for P2Y<sub>11</sub>, the only G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor, was detected in nanometer proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA. FRET-based experiments revealed that the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 and elevated glucose stimulate cAMP production resulting in enhanced PKA-dependent LTCC activity. These changes were blocked by the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340. Comparable results were observed in mouse tissue, suggesting that a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor is mediating the glucose response in these cells. These findings established a key role for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in regulating PKA-dependent LTCC function and vascular reactivity during diabetic hyperglycemia.</p></abstract><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diabetes is a major risk factor contributing to cardiovascular complications, including hypertension, increased risk of stroke, coronary disease, and organ failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Whelton et al., 2018</xref>). These complications are often linked to the effects of elevated extracellular glucose (e.g. hyperglycemia - the hallmark metabolic abnormality in diabetes) on vascular function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cooper et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tousoulis et al., 2013</xref>). In addition to endothelium-dependent alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lagaud et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sena et al., 2013</xref>), endothelium-independent modifications, including enhanced contractility of arterial myocytes, are emerging as critical contributing factors to these complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aronson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">DeFronzo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fleischhacker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Montero et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nieves-Cintrón et al., 2018</xref>). Consistent with this notion, we and others recently demonstrated augmented vasoconstriction in response to acute and chronic elevations in extracellular glucose that were independent of endothelial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fleischhacker et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jackson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). We linked these glucose-mediated effects on vascular reactivity to an increase in L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (LTCC) activity in human and murine arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Navedo et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). This is critical, as Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via LTCCs is the main Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry pathway in these cells and determines muscle contractility and arterial diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knot and Nelson, 1998</xref>). Unexpectedly, we found that glucose-mediated potentiation of LTCCs involves phosphorylation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 at serine 1928 (Ser<sup>1928</sup>) by protein kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Navedo et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, how glucose leads to PKA activation is unknown.</p><p>Elevations in cellular glucose have been shown to trigger autocrine release of nucleotides (e.g. ATP, UTP) into the extracellular space of many cells, including arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hazama et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nilsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parodi et al., 2002</xref>). These extracellular nucleotides can then act on G protein-coupled P2Y receptors to induce a plethora of cellular responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>). Previous studies demonstrated that elevations in extracellular glucose led to increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) in isolated arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nilsson et al., 2006</xref>). Indeed, this glucose-mediated response was associated with enhanced autocrine release of nucleotides engaging P2Y receptors, but the contributing mechanisms as well as the identity of the P2Y receptor involved are unclear.</p><p>Eight functionally diverse G protein-coupled P2Y receptors have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>). Most of these P2Y receptors are coupled to G<sub>q/i</sub> proteins. Conversely, P2Y<sub>11</sub> is the only P2Y receptor that is coupled to G<sub>s</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Communi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuchardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>). Activation of this receptor could then activate adenylyl cyclase (AC) and PKA to underlie the glucose-induced effects on LTCC activity, but its role in arterial myocytes is unclear. P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors were first cloned from human tissue and subsequently identified in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>). Although the P2Y<sub>11</sub> gene has not been found at the expected position in the mouse genome, recent rodent annotations related to this gene (e.g. XM_008766009.2 and XM_0130655917.2), as well as studies defining a functional role based on pharmacological data obtained from rat and mouse tissue hinted at the presence of at least a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2017</xref>). We, therefore, undertook a comprehensive approach to investigate whether upstream engagement of this G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor is implicated in PKA activation leading to increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation of vascular Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 that results in potentiation of LTCC activity during diabetic hyperglycemia. Accordingly, Western blot analysis, immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, Ground State Depletion (GSD) super-resolution nanoscopy, FRET-based cAMP imaging and voltage-clamp electrophysiology confirmed functional expression of P2Y<sub>11</sub> in human arterial myocytes. We found that elevated glucose stimulates cAMP synthesis with the same magnitude as that observed upon application of the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 or when both stimuli were given simultaneously, thus suggesting that glucose and NF546 signaling proceed through the same pathway. Nanometer proximity was observed between P2Y<sub>11</sub> and PKA and P2Y<sub>11</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 at the sarcolemma of arterial myocytes, which facilitates a structural arrangement that may be essential for glucose effects on LTCC activity. Indeed, the NF546/glucose-induced cAMP signal resulted in enhanced Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and LTCC activity in human arterial myocytes, and these changes were prevented by the selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340. Intriguingly, comparable functional data were observed in mouse arterial myocytes, suggesting that a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor could be mediating the glucose response in these cells that results in vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2017</xref>). Thus, our data in human and murine tissue indicate a key role for a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor, which fits the distribution, pharmacological, and signaling profile of a P2Y<sub>11</sub> or P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor, respectively, as an upstream player in the regulation of LTCCs and vascular reactivity during diabetic hyperglycemia.

We, thus, examined whether nucleotide degradation with apyrase prevents glucose-mediated increases in LTCC activity and Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation. To assess this, we used ﻿patch-clamp electrophysiology in the whole-cell perforated configuration with barium (Ba<sup>2+</sup>) as the charge carrier, before and after application of nifedipine to determine the nifedipine-sensitive Ba<sup>2+</sup> current (I<sub>Ba</sub>) associated with LTCC activity in control and apyrase-treated cerebral arterial myocytes. We found that 20 mM D-glucose significantly enhanced I<sub>Ba</sub> in wild type (wt) control arterial myocytes, but not in apyrase-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The glucose effect on LTCC activity was not due to changes in osmolarity as 20 mM mannitol had no impact on I<sub>Ba</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>We next performed Western blot analysis with a specific phospho-antibody against Ser<sup>1928</sup> at Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and a FP1 antibody for total Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 detection that have been extensively validated by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buonarati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Davare et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, we have previously shown that the immunoreactivity at 250 kDa of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with the phospho-specific antibody for Ser<sup>1928</sup> (but not a phospho-specific antibody for Ser<sup>1700</sup>) and FP1 are completely eliminated in tissue from S1928A knockin mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref>) and conditional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buonarati et al., 2017</xref>), respectively. Data revealed increased phosphorylation of this residue in response to 20 mM D-glucose in control arterial lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, this response was completely absent in arterial lysates exposed to 20 mM mannitol, thus ruling out any osmolarity effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, glucose-induced Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation was hindered in lysates from apyrase-treated arteries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These results suggest that elevated glucose increases Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation to potentiate LTCC activity through an autocrine mechanism involving secreted nucleotides.</p><p>To further test this possibility, LTCC activity was recorded in response to elevated glucose during continuous perfusion or static bath conditions (as above). The rationale for these experiments was to determine whether the wash out of nucleotides with flow can impact the glucose-induced potentiation of LTCCs. We found statistically similar I<sub>Ba</sub> in cells exposed to 10 mM and 20 mM D-glucose under continuous bath perfusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Conversely, I<sub>Ba</sub> was significantly elevated in arterial myocytes exposed to 20 mM D-glucose when the bath perfusion was stopped (e.g. static bath conditions). These results suggest that secreted nucleotides could diffuse away under continuous flow, whereas under static bath conditions, they could accumulate in or around the area of release at the surface membrane of arterial myocytes to induce the optimal activation of the signaling pathway underlying increased LTCC activity in response to elevations in extracellular glucose.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes</title><p>Extracellular nucleotides are well-known activators of G-coupled P2Y receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>).

Using Western blot analysis, we first validated the P2Y<sub>11</sub> antibody in tsA-201 cells, which endogenously express P2Y<sub>11</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dreisig and Kornum, 2016</xref>), by over-expressing human GFP-tagged P2Y<sub>11</sub> and by knocking down the endogenous and over-expressed receptor with specific P2Y<sub>11</sub> antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>).

Confocal imaging and line profile analysis of P2Y<sub>11</sub>-associated fluorescence and the plasma membrane marker wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) suggest a prominent distribution of the receptor on the surface membrane of freshly dissociated human arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). This was not observed when the antibody for P2Y<sub>11</sub> was omitted from the preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

To test this possibility, we examined the spatial relationship of P2Y<sub>11</sub> with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in freshly dissociated human arterial myocytes using GSD super-resolution nanoscopy in the Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence (TIRF) configuration. This approach achieves a lateral resolution of ~20 nm with selective illumination of the (sub)sarcolemmal region. Note that the FP1 antibody against Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 has been extensively validated by our group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buonarati et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Patriarchi et al., 2016</xref>). The PKA<sub>cat</sub> antibody was validated in arterial myocytes by pre-absorption with a blocking peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The GSD super-resolution localization maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <italic>bottom panels</italic>) for P2Y<sub>11</sub>, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, and PKA<sub>cat</sub> obtained from conventional TIRF images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <italic>top panels</italic>) showed that these proteins form clusters of various sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) at the sarcolemma of human arterial myocytes. Whereas clusters were broadly expressed throughout the sarcolemma, merged spatial maps of P2Y<sub>11</sub> with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 or PKA<sub>cat</sub> suggested a close association between a subset of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Indeed, histograms of the P2Y<sub>11</sub>-to-nearest Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 or PKA<sub>cat</sub> distances revealed that the closest centroids for P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>- PKA<sub>cat</sub> were at 59 nm and 58 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G and H</xref>). Similar results were observed using freshly dissociated mouse cerebral arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Clusters of P2Y<sub>11</sub>, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, or PKA<sub>cat</sub> were never observed when primary antibodies were omitted from the human or mouse preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A and B</xref>). To determine whether the interaction between a subpopulation of P2Y<sub>11</sub> with a pool of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA in arterial myocytes is the result of specific organization between two proteins, we compared the percentage of P2Y<sub>11</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2/PKA<sub>cat</sub> overlap between experimental super-resolution localization maps and images containing randomized distribution of P2Y<sub>11</sub>, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub>. Randomized images for P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA<sub>cat</sub> were generated based on data derived from the experimental super-resolution localization maps for these pairs of proteins using the Coste’s randomization algorithm included in the JACoP plug-in in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). Our analysis found that the percentage of overlap between P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA<sub>cat</sub> obtained from the experimental localization maps was significantly higher than that observed for a simulated random distribution between P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA<sub>cat</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

Increasing D-glucose concentration from 5 mM to 15 mM, which are glucose concentrations comparable to those observed in nondiabetic and diabetic patients respectively, induced a small yet significant increase in cAMP synthesis in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). The glucose effects are not due to osmotic changes as equimolar concentrations of the non-permeable mannitol did not induce any cAMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, the synthesis of cAMP was further amplified by the broad AC activator forskolin (1 μM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) even in the presence of 20 mM mannitol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Simultaneous application of 15 mM D-glucose +NF546 resulted in cAMP synthesis of a similar magnitude to that induced by independent treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). This suggests that the effects of elevated glucose and the NF546 compound may be acting through a similar pathway that requires activation of P2Y<sub>11</sub>.

Intriguingly, cAMP synthesis in response to elevated glucose and the P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 was significantly larger in human myocytes compared to mouse cells (glucose: 0.077 ± 0.003 in human vs 0.045 ± 0.002 in mouse; NF546: 0.083 ± 0.005 in human vs 0.045 ± 0.004 in mouse; p&lt;0.05). The reasons for this are currently unclear but may include intrinsic differences associated with species (human vs mouse), blood vessels (human adipose arteries vs mouse aortae) and expression patterns of the biosensor in human vs mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reddy et al., 2018</xref>), as well as variations in protein expression and receptor/enzyme activity (e.g. P2Y<sub>11</sub>, AC and PDE expression/activity) in human vs mouse arterial myocytes. Whether either or all of these factors contribute to distinctive cAMP responses in human vs mouse arterial myocytes as well as their physiological implications remain to be determined. Nevertheless, our findings suggest a role for human P2Y<sub>11</sub> and mouse P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptors in glucose-induced cAMP synthesis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42214.034</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Glucose and the P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 increase sarcolemmal cAMP synthesis in arterial myocytes, and these effects are prevented by the P2Y<sub>11</sub> antagonist NF340.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of YFP/CFP (donor/acceptor) FRET ratios (normalized to resting levels before treatment) in human arterial myocytes expressing the ICUE3-PM biosensor in response to 15 mM D-glucose (black; n = 19 cells from two humans), 500 nM NF546 (green; n = 18 cells from two humans) and 15 mM D-glucose +500 nM NF546 (red; n = 14 cells from two humans) before and after application of broad adenylyl cyclase agonist forskolin (1 µM).

Our group has additionally established, in human and mouse arterial tissue, PKA-mediated potentiation of LTCC activity via increased phosphorylation of the pore-forming Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunit at Ser<sup>1928</sup> as a key event that contributes to vascular complications during diabetic hyperglycemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Navedo et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). The classic molecular machinery stimulating PKA activity implicates activation of upstream effector enzymes (e.g. AC) and G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). In the present study, using native human arteries and arterial myocytes, we identified a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y receptor with the molecular, pharmacological, and signaling properties of P2Y<sub>11</sub> as the GPCR underlying the glucose triggering cascade that results in PKA-dependent potentiation of LTCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Indeed, P2Y<sub>11</sub> is known to associate with ACs to stimulate cAMP/PKA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Communi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pucéat et al., 1998</xref>).

The implications of these observations are profound, as they may shed light on unique mechanisms of diabetic vascular complications.</p><p>Elevations in extracellular glucose have been shown to promote autocrine release of nucleotides in a number of cells, including arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Costa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hazama et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nilsson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Parodi et al., 2002</xref>). This glucose-induced release of nucleotides has been associated with increased global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> in arterial myocytes, but the mechanisms and functional implications were not clearly established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nilsson et al., 2006</xref>). This prompted us to examine whether extracellular nucleotides could be mediating glucose effects on LTCC activity and vascular reactivity. Our first major finding was that hydrolysis of extracellular nucleotides by the ectonucleotidase apyrase prevented the increases in Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, LTCC activity and vasoconstriction in response to elevations in extracellular glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Outcomes from LTCC recordings under continuous flow or static bath conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) further support the involvement of extracellular nucleotide signaling in mediating the glucose effects. Given the well-established function of extracellular nucleotides in activating P2Y receptors (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>)), our studies also pointed to the potential contribution of at least one of the eight known P2Y receptors in this process. In line with this concept, our multidisciplinary approach using human tissue suggested involvement of a P2Y receptor fitting the profile for the P2Y<sub>11</sub> subtype. Intriguingly, similar results were observed using mouse tissue/cells, suggesting a role for a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor. To date, this is the only G<sub>s</sub>-coupled P2Y, which could activate AC, leading to increased cAMP synthesis and thereby PKA activation. Considering the essential actions of PKA on LTCC activity and vasoconstriction in response to elevated glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morotti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Navedo et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>), we submit that such changes may proceed through activation of this purinergic signaling pathway.</p><p>Few studies have examined the role of P2Y<sub>11</sub> in the cardiovascular system. Current knowledge suggests that this receptor is associated with positive inotropic effects of ATP on cardiomyocytes and its activity seems to be impaired during cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balogh et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, a polymorphism (Ala-87-Thr) in P2Y<sub>11</sub> has been linked to increased risk of acute myocardial infarction and C-reactive protein blood levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amisten et al., 2007</xref>). These results indicate a role for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in cardiac (dys)function. However, the functional significance of P2Y<sub>11</sub> in the vasculature, and particularly in arterial myocytes, is virtually unknown. In the present study, Western blot analysis detected an immunoreactive band of the expected molecular weight for P2Y<sub>11</sub> (e.g. ~40 ± 10 kDa) in human arterial lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We confirmed robust distribution of the receptor at the expected plasma membrane location in isolated human arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In line with the expected function for this GPCR, we corroborated localized subplasmalemmal cAMP synthesis upon receptor stimulation with a highly selective P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist (NF546 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meis et al., 2010</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, 20 mM D-glucose triggered cAMP synthesis of the same magnitude as the NF546 compound, and simultaneous application of NF546 and 20 mM D-glucose did not have any additional effect when compared with individual treatment exposure, suggesting that both stimuli proceed through the same signaling pathway. In support of this possibility, the specific P2Y<sub>11</sub> antagonist NF340 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meis et al., 2010</xref>) blocked the NF546 and NF546 + 20 mM D-glucose effects on cAMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The P2Y<sub>11</sub> antagonist also prevented increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and LTCC activity in response to acute elevations in extracellular glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), while the P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 recapitulated all the glucose-induced, PKA-dependent effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Moreover, the NF340 compound hampered glucose-induced changes in Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation levels and LTCC activity during chronic hyperglycemic conditions resembling those observed during diabetes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Altogether, these results revealed a role for human P2Y<sub>11</sub> or mouse P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor in arterial myocytes, particularly during glucose signaling, and suggest that this GPCR may be involved in the initiation and/or progression of arterial myocyte dysfunction leading to vascular complications during diabetic hyperglycemia. Our results may also have profound clinical implications as they add to a growing body of evidence implicating a role for altered P2Y<sub>11</sub> function in a number of pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nishimura et al., 2017</xref>), which could make them a potential therapeutic target.</p><p>Our findings indicating that elevated extracellular glucose triggers PKA-dependent potentiation of LTCC activity to induce vasoconstriction were unexpected, as PKA activity has been traditionally associated with vasodilation due, in part, to increased K<sup>+</sup> channel activity. A reasonable prediction was that glucose could influence LTCCs via a cAMP/PKA signaling pathway that is distinct from that governing K<sup>+</sup> channels as occurs upon β adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Moore et al., 2014</xref>). Such separation in cAMP would require precise subsarcolemmal compartmentalization of key proteins and signaling molecules (including GPCR, signaling enzyme, second messenger, effector protein and substrate). In the case of PKA-dependent effects on LTCC function in response to elevated glucose, this separation would include seclusion of a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptor, AC, PKA and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. Indeed, <italic>Tajada et al</italic> recently showed that optimal ion channel regulation by effector proteins is constrained by their nanometer distance between each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tajada et al., 2017</xref>). In support of this possibility, our recent work revealed nanometer proximity of a subpopulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (~10% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters) to pools of PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we found a close association (≤40–90 nm) between pools of P2Y<sub>11</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 as well as P2Y<sub>11</sub> and PKA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, given the cAMP biosensor data demonstrating that both glucose and the P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 induce localized subsarcolemmal cAMP synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), it is also likely that P2Y<sub>11</sub> may be in close proximity to a specific AC isoform in arterial myocytes - the identity of which remains to be established. Nevertheless, this implicates the formation of a distinctive nanomolecular domain likely containing P2Y<sub>11</sub>, AC, PKA and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 in arterial myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>), although its confirmation is beyond the scope of this study. This nanodomain may ensure the necessary signaling compartmentalization required for PKA-mediated effects on LTCC activity and vascular reactivity in response to elevated glucose.</p><p>The spatial organization of the P2Y<sub>11</sub>/AC/PKA/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 nanodomain could be facilitated by scaffold proteins, such as A kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). These AKAPs fine tune signal transduction by localizing GPCRs, signaling enzymes and effector proteins in close proximity to their substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnstone et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>). The A kinase anchoring protein 150 (AKAP150; murine ortholog of human AKAP79) is of particular interest as it has been shown to interact with AC, PKA and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bauman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Efendiev et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Murphy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Navedo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, although AKAP79/150 can associate with multiple GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fraser et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), no report to date has linked it to any purinergic receptor. Localization of P2Y<sub>11</sub> within the same AKAP79/150-driven complex may be critical as this scaffold protein is necessary for increased L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel activity in response to elevated glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). Two possibilities that do not exclude a fundamental role for AKAP79/150 are 1) direct interaction of P2Y<sub>11</sub> with the scaffold protein and/or 2) association of the receptor with a pool of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 within the AKAP79/150 complex. Future studies should examine these exciting alternatives as they may provide further insight into mechanisms regulating LTCCs and vascular reactivity during diabetic hyperglycemia.</p><p>A lingering question is how nucleotides, such as ATP, are released in response to glucose to modulate arterial myocyte excitability. Although our data do not identify the specific nucleotide, ATP release is particularly interesting as this nucleotide is an effective vasoactive agent and the endogenous P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Communi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuchardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>). Indeed, ATP can activate P2Y<sub>11</sub> with an EC<sub>50</sub> that ranges from 1.8 to 17 μM, depending on the readout and the cell type used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Communi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haas et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Qi et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, P2Y<sub>11</sub> can be activated by ATP/ATP-derived nucleotides with the following potency order: ATPγS &gt; dATP &gt; ATP&gt;&gt;&gt;ADP, with other nucleotides such as UTP and UDP having minimal or no influence on receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kennedy, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schuchardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Kügelgen and Harden, 2011</xref>). Our recent study suggested that glucose effects on LTCC activity and vascular reactivity require glucose transport into the cell and subsequent metabolism that can generate ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nystoriak et al., 2017</xref>). ATP can then be transported out of the cell through ATP-binding cassettes, vesicular exocytosis, plasma membrane F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATPase, connexin hemichannels and pannexin channels to induce activation of P2Y<sub>11</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lohman et al., 2012</xref>). We thus speculate that one of these ATP transporters could form part of the AKAP/P2Y<sub>11</sub>/AC/PKA/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 nanocomplex to provide another layer of compartmentalization that facilitates PKA-dependent regulation of LTCC function and vascular reactivity in response to elevations in extracellular glucose.</p><p>In summary, our data in human and murine tissue provide evidence of a G<sub>s</sub>-coupled purinergic receptor that fits the profile of P2Y<sub>11</sub> or a P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor, respectively, as a key upstream component in the signaling cascade regulating LTCC activity and vascular reactivity during diabetic hyperglycemia. Data start to define a unique nanomolecular complex likely formed by AKAP/P2Y<sub>11</sub>/AC/PKA/Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. This nanocomplex can organize glucose signaling and help explain the intriguing consequences of glucose-induced PKA activation on LTCC function and vascular reactivity, which may have significant pathological implications, and therapeutic potential to treat vascular complications during diabetic hyperglycemia.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent <break/>type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional<break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>), <break/>C57BL/6J</td><td>wild-type</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>stock # 000664</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>S1928A</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lemke et al., 2008</xref>)</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line <break/>(human <break/>embryonal <break/>kidney)</td><td>tsA-201</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>96121229</td><td>SV40 transformed</td></tr><tr><td>Oligodeoxynucleotide, sense</td><td>P2Y<sub>11</sub> SNS ODN</td><td>Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td>human P2Y<sub>11</sub> sequence <break/>(NC_000019.10): 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAACGTCTCGG</named-content><named-content content-type="sequence">GTAAGGAGAA</named-content>-3’ and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">ATGAGGAAGG</named-content><named-content content-type="sequence">AAACGTGGGT</named-content>-3’</td><td>last three bases on the 3’ end were phosphoro-thioated</td></tr><tr><td>Oligodeoxynucleotide, antisense</td><td>P2Y<sub>11</sub> ANS ODN</td><td>Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td>human P2Y<sub>11</sub> sequence <break/>(NC_000019.10): 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CAAGGCCACCCTAACCACTG</named-content>-3’ <break/>and 5’-<named-content content-type="sequence">CTCTCCCTTCCCTGCGTTA</named-content>-3’</td><td>last three bases on the 3’ end were phosphoro-thioated</td></tr><tr><td>DNA construct</td><td>human P2Y<sub>11</sub></td><td>UMR cDNA <break/>Resource Center</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cDNA.org">www.cDNA.org</ext-link>;

Both whole-cell and single-channel data were acquired using an Axopatch 200B amplifier and Digidata 1440 digitizer (Molecular Devices). Recording electrodes were pulled from borosilicate capillary glass using a micropipette puller (model P-97, Sutter Instruments) and subsequently polished to achieve resistances that ranged from 3.5 to 6.5 MΩ. L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel currents were assessed in freshly dissociated arterial myocytes using the perforated whole-cell mode of the patch-clamp technique with Ba<sup>2+</sup> as a charge carrier (I<sub>Ba</sub>) after myocytes were allowed to attach (10 min) to a glass coverslip in a recording chamber. Borosilicate glass pipettes were filled with a solution containing (in mM): 120 CsCl, 20 tetraethylammonium chloride (TEA-Cl), 1 EGTA, and 20 HEPES with amphotericin B (250 µg/mL; pH adjusted to 7.2 with CsOH). The bath solution consisted of (in mM): 115 NaCl, 10 TEA-Cl, 0.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 D-glucose, 5 CsCl, 20 BaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 HEPES, pH adjusted to 7.4 with CsOH. I<sub>Ba</sub> were elicited by 200 ms depolarizing pulses from a holding potential of −70 mV to +10 mV. I<sub>Ba</sub> were first recorded in the presence of 10 mM D-glucose under static flow conditions. This solution was then exchanged for a solution containing either 20 mM D-glucose, 20 mM mannitol or NF546 at a rate of 2.1 mL/min. Flow was stopped after 3 min, and I<sub>Ba</sub> were recorded again under static flow conditions at least 5 min after the indicated treatment was initiated. In some experiments, arterial myocytes were pretreated for 10–15 min with indicated inhibitors prior to I<sub>Ba</sub> recordings. For experiments comparing I<sub>Ba</sub> before and after elevated glucose under continuous flow and static bath conditions, cells were patched in a bath solution containing 10 mM D-glucose at a perfusion rate of 2.1 mL/min. After establishment of a stable gigaseal for at least 5 min, I<sub>Ba</sub> were recorded in the presence of 10 mM D-glucose under continuous flow. Those cells that showed robust I<sub>Ba</sub> in 10 mM D-glucose were then perfused with a bath solution containing 20 mM D-glucose under continuous flow for at least 5 min before recording of I<sub>Ba</sub> again. Subsequently, I<sub>Ba</sub> were recorded one more time on the same cell, 5 min after stopping the bath perfusion (e.g. static bath conditions).

The Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 blocker nifedipine (1 μM) was applied at the end of each experiment to determine the nifedipine-sensitive component. The I-V relationship of nifedipine-sensitive I<sub>Ba</sub> was determined by 200 ms depolarizing steps from −70 mV to voltages ranging from −60 to +60 mV in increments of +10 mV.

Single L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents were elicited by a 2 s depolarizing step from a holding of −70 mV to −30 mV. Single-channel currents were sampled at 10 kHz and low pass filtered at 2 kHz, followed by a Gaussian filter (500 Hz) during analysis.

Arteries were then lysed and used for Western blot (see Immunoblotting section).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Adenovirus infection of unpassaged arterial myocytes and Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET)</title><p>Laminin (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY) diluted 100x in sterile-filtered PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH = 7.4) was used to coat #0 glass coverslips (Karl Hecht, Sondheim, Germany). After adding diluted laminin (100 µL per coverslip), coverslips were placed in a 37° C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for a minimum of 2 hr, then moved to 24-well plate wells (Falcon, Tewksbury, MA), and washed 3x with sterile-filtered PBS. Freshly dissociated human adipose arterial myocytes and mouse aortic cells were plated on the laminin-coated coverslips with 500 μL of serum-containing media for 48 hr in a 37° C incubator with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>. Media was then replaced with 500 μL of serum-free media-containing virus coding for the membrane-targeted Epac1-camps-based FRET sensor (ICUE3-PM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2011</xref>) and placed at 37° C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for another 36 hr. Viruses were produced using the AdEasy system (Qbiogene, Carlsbad, CA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Luo et al., 2007</xref>). After infection, media was changed to serum-free media without virus. Glass coverslips were transferred to glass bottom culture dishes (MatTek, Ashland, MA) containing 3 mL PBS at room temperature.</p><p>A Zeiss AXIO Observer A1 inverted fluorescence microscope (San Diego, CA) equipped with a Hamamatsu Orca-Flash 4.0 digital camera (Bridgewater, NJ) and controlled by Metaflor software (Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) acquired phase contrast, CFP480, and FRET images. Phase contrast and CFP480 images were collected with 20x and 40x oil immersion objective lenses, while FRET images were collected using only the 40x oil immersion objective lens. Images for FRET analysis were recorded by exciting the donor fluorophore at 430–455 nm and measuring emission fluorescence with two filters (475DF40 for cyan and 535DF25 for yellow). Images were subjected to background subtraction and acquired every 30 s with exposure time of 200 ms for each channel. The donor/acceptor FRET ratio was calculated and normalized to the ratio value of baseline. CFP480 images were acquired by exciting the donor fluorophore at 430–455 nm and measuring emission fluorescence with the 475DF40 filter for 25 ms. Averages of normalized curves and maximal response to stimulation were graphed based on FRET ratio changes. Binding of cAMP to ICUE3-PM led to decreases in the YFP/CFP ratio, indicating increases in cAMP levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Chemicals and statistics</title><p>All chemical reagents were from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO) unless otherwise stated.

In this manuscript, Navedo and colleagues demonstrate a pivotal role for the Gs- coupled metabotropic purinergic receptor, P2Y<sub>11</sub>, in mediating the vasoconstrictor response to glucose in mouse and human vascular smooth muscle myocytes. Using molecular, pharmacological/functional and FRET-based approaches, the authors provide evidence that P2Y<sub>11</sub> is expressed in mouse and human vascular smooth muscle cells, and that glucose causes vasoconstriction through a cascade involving ATP release, P2Y<sub>11</sub> activation, cAMP synthesis, and PKA-dependent phosphorylation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. In support of the PKA-dependent activation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and subsequent vasoconstriction, they show using proximity analyses that a subpopulation of P2Y<sub>11</sub> is in close proximity to PKA and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. The signaling specificity afforded by such microdomains may explain the paradoxical vasoconstriction-promoting effect of PKA, which is generally associated with vasodilatory responses through effects on K<sup>+</sup> channels. The role of P2Y<sub>11</sub> is convincing and is a major new insight. Also significant is the identification of smooth muscle P2Y<sub>11</sub> as a potential target in the management of diabetic vasculopathy.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were concerns about whether the glucose responses are affected by possible changes in osmolarity. From the Materials and methods, it does not appear that changes in osmolarity were controlled for, and the effect of glucose may be different in hypertonic and isotonic conditions. A series of controls for all experiments should be included in the manuscript rather than referencing an abstract (Syed et al., 2018).</p><p>2) Antibodies need to be validated and quantification described in more detail.a) For assessing Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, showing full-length blots with only a single molecular weight does not demonstrate specificity. The method of quantifying band densities should be described in more detail (more than just saying ImageJ was used). Were band densities integrated, and how were doublets quantified (e.g., Figures 1, 6, and especially Figure 7C)? In Figure 7C, MW markers are needed; is the upper Cav band of the doublet phosphorylated, and could this be used to estimate the proportion of channels that are phosphorylated? It is difficult to assess the linearity of the antibody without showing on the same blot dephosphorylated channels and fully phosphorylated channels. Does a 30% increase mean 30% of the channels are phosphorylated?</p><p>b) Primary antibodies to P2Y<sub>11</sub> and PKA<sub>cat</sub> need to be validated. It appears that P2Y<sub>11</sub> ab is not specific for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in mouse (extra bands in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). This is important because the only evidence that P2Y<sub>11</sub> is expressed in arterial myocytes comes from cell staining (Figure 2); the Westerns are from lysates also containing endothelial cells which are known to express P2Y<sub>11</sub>.</p><p>3) While ATP might be expected to accumulate in restricted spaces in tissue to activate P2Y<sub>11</sub>, there is some doubt about whether ATP release could be responsible for the increased Ba2+ currents in patch-clamp experiments where ATP would be free to diffuse. More evidence should be provided to support the role of ATP. For example, does continuous bath perfusion reduce or eliminate the increase in Ba2+ current in response to glucose? Can ATP release be detected by luciferase in the bath (e.g., see Ospichuk and Cahalan, Nature 359:241, 1992)? Finally, please discuss possible mechanisms of ATP secretion and what is known about the affinity of P2Y11 for ATP.</p><p>4) To show that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>1928</sup> is essential for the regulation of contractility by P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonists (and not merely correlated), vasoconstriction measurements (Figure 7) should be repeated with a S1928A knockin mouse. Similarly, the single-channel Po (Figure 8) should also be measured in the knockin animals to counter the possibility that prolonged incubation in glucose may have increased Po by affecting other signaling pathways and gene expression.</p><p>5) The specificity of LTCC modulation by glucose is an important issue, and the GSD data as they stand are rather descriptive and do not establish whether P2Y<sub>11</sub> exists in complexes with AC, PKA, and LTCC. While it is beyond the scope of this paper to establish the composition of a P2Y<sub>11</sub> signaling complex, the existence of such a complex would make the distribution of P2Y<sub>11</sub>, PKA, and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 non-random. To address this point, experimentally observed results should be compared with those of a simulated random distribution of the proteins at the same overall density, and the results shown in a supplementary figure.</p><p>6) Figures 4 and 5: The FRET response (cAMP production) is about twice as large in human myocytes than in mouse myocytes (normalized FRET ratio change, ~0.1 vs. ~0.05), despite the fact that the density of P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters in human myocytes is about 20% that in mouse myocytes (~0.03/µm2 vs. &gt;0.15/µm2) and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA cluster density is about the same in both humans and mice (~0.06/µm2). Why is cAMP production noticeably higher in humans than in mice, and is this difference significant? Please provide comment in the text.</p><p>7) A microdomain containing P2Y<sub>11</sub>, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, PKA and AC5 is discussed in the Discussion, but no data are shown for a role of AC5, only a citation of a FASEB meeting abstract (Discussion, first paragraph; Syed et al., 2018). Ideally, these data should be included in the current manuscript.</p><p>8) In the last paragraph of the subsection “The P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340 prevents glucose-induced Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, the NF546 experiment does not rule out involvement of P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor, it merely shows it is not necessary for the vasoconstriction. To show it does not contribute, the authors should add the inhibitor after glucose to see if it inhibits (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;A G<sub>s</sub>-coupled purinergic receptor boosts Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and vascular excitability during diabetic hyperglycemia&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Briefly describe how was randomization done and how many times it was repeated. The explanation in the second paragraph of the subsection “P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes” does not adequately explain how the simulation was done, and what we are looking at in the images in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.42214.074</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There were concerns about whether the glucose responses are affected by possible changes in osmolarity.

Our new data show that elevated mannitol failed to induce vasoconstriction as well as to potentiate L-type Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel (LTCC) activity, increase phosphorylation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 at serine 1928 (Ser<sup>1928</sup>) or stimulate cAMP production in arterial myocytes. These results suggest that effects observed in cAMP synthesis, Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, LTCC activity and vascular reactivity in response to an increase in extracellular glucose (e.g. 20 mM D-glu) are not due to osmolarity effects but are rather a direct consequence of elevated glucose. These data are consistent with previous studies from our group and others (Jackson et al., 2016; Navedo et al., 2010; Nystoriak et al., 2014; Nystoriak et al., 2017; Rainbow et al., 2006). Moreover, the new data are in line with our recent observations indicating that the elevated glucose effects on LTCC activity and vascular reactivity require glucose internalization and metabolic utilization (Nystoriak et al., 2017). These new data and discussion are now included as Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, 1C and 1E (subsection “Glucose-induced extracellular nucleotide release mediates Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, increased LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, first, second and third paragraphs), Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and 1C (subsection “Increased sarcolemmal cAMP synthesis in arterial myocytes in response to a P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist recapitulates glucose effects”, last paragraph) and Figure 8A and 8B (subsection “Increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and LTCC activity during chronic diabetic hyperglycemia are prevented by a P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Antibodies need to be validated and quantification described in more detail.a) For assessing Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, showing full-length blots with only a single molecular weight does not demonstrate specificity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and apologize for not addressing the specificity of the antibodies clearly in our original manuscript. The specificity of the phospho-specific antibody for Ser<sup>1928</sup> as well as the FP1 antibody for total Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 measurement has been extensively and thoroughly validated in multiple published studies by our group, including for use in arterial myocytes (Buonarati et al., 2017; Hall et al., 2013; Nystoriak et al., 2017; Patriarchi et al., 2016). Importantly, immunoreactivity at 250 kDa of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with the phospho-specific antibody for Ser<sup>1928</sup> (but not a phospho-specific antibody for Ser<sup>1700</sup>) and FP1 are completely eliminated in tissue from S1928A KI mice (Figure 3 in Patriarchi et al., 2016) and conditional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 KO mice (Figure 2 in Buonarati et al., 2017), respectively. Full blots are shown in Buonarati et al., 2017, although the 100 kDa marker had been run to the bottom of the gel for better resolution of the high molecular mass Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2. Blotted membranes were trimmed to save on the use of these antibodies, which are generated in-house and only available in limited quantity. We have modified the original text to clarify this issue (subsection “Glucose-induced extracellular nucleotide release mediates Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, increased LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, third paragraph; subsection “P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes”, second paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The method of quantifying band densities should be described in more detail (more than just saying ImageJ was used).

The lower band represents a shorter Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 form that is truncated around residue 1800 and thus does not contain Ser<sup>1928</sup>. Accordingly, only the upper band can be phosphorylated on Ser<sup>1928</sup>. The shorter channel form still has the proteolytically cleaved C-terminal domain attached to it, but this C-terminal fragment is difficult to detect with the small amounts of material from our arterial samples.</p><p>To define basal Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation levels, we previously used Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 isolated from rat forebrain where we obtain much more material than from our arterial samples. There, we estimated that ~16.7% of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 long form is phosphorylated on Ser<sup>1928</sup> under basal conditions in healthy adult rats (Davare and Hell, 2003). However, this is only an upper limit. With our arterial preparation (freshly isolated small resistance arteries from cerebral and mesenteric vessels) and the small amount of working material obtained from it, it could be less than that because the only way we can obtain such an estimate is by comparing the immunoblot signal from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 from untreated samples with those where Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 had been incubated after the immunoprecipitation with purified PKA and Mg-ATP. The estimate assumes that all full-length Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 is phosphorylated on Ser<sup>1928</sup> under these stimulatory conditions, but unfortunately, we cannot be completely certain about this. Hence, we will not be able to determine with high confidence the percentage of total Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 that is phosphorylated at Ser<sup>1928</sup> under basal conditions in our preparation. Such a number would also not necessarily be too helpful because a substantial fraction of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 resides inside the cells (Conrad et al., 2018; Ghosh et al., 2018) when only channels at the plasma membrane are relevant for potentiation by Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation. For instance, if we would find that ~16% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 is phosphorylated in arterial lysates under basal conditions, it could quite well reflect that 50% of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 at the surface membrane are Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylated if the intracellular pool constitutes 70% of total Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and is largely not phosphorylated. We will be working in future studies to address this interesting point in a rigorous manner but would like to respectfully note that these data will not change the conclusions of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is difficult to assess the linearity of the antibody without showing on the same blot dephosphorylated channels and fully phosphorylated channels.</p></disp-quote><p>We show dephosphorylated and phosphorylated channels on the same blot – e.g. total Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 reprobed after Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation probe. Moreover, our blots are analyzed after films are exposed for increasing time periods (1 min, 2 min, 4 min) to ensure that the signals are in the linear range, as detailed in our previous work (Davare and Hell, 2003; Hall et al., 2006).

It appears that P2Y<sub>11</sub> ab is not specific for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in mouse (extra bands in Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). This is important because the only evidence that P2Y<sub>11</sub> is expressed in arterial myocytes comes from cell staining (Figure 2); the Westerns are from lysates also containing endothelial cells which are known to express P2Y<sub>11</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed additional experiments. The PKA<sub>cat</sub> Ab was validated using a blocking peptide provided by the vendor (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). Briefly, immunofluorescent labeling of PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes was performed using a mouse anti-PKA<sub>cat</sub> Ab (Santa Cruz Biotechnology) incubated with or without a PKA<sub>cat</sub> blocking peptide (A-2; Santa Cruz Biotechnology) before applying to cells on coverslips. Consistent with a previous study from our group (Nystoriak et al., 2017), arterial myocytes showed broad intracellular PKA<sub>cat</sub>-associated fluorescence, which was completely lost when the PKA<sub>cat</sub> Ab was preabsorbed with the PKA<sub>cat</sub> blocking peptide. These data are now presented in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 (subsection “P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes”, second paragraph) of the revised manuscript.</p><p>As for the P2Y<sub>11</sub> Ab validation, we performed multiple tests. First, we detected single protein bands of expected molecular weight in lysates from untransfected and vehicle treated tsA-201 cells, which are known to endogenously express P2Y<sub>11</sub> (Dreisig and Kornum, 2016). When tsA-201cells were transfected with a vector encoding a P2Y<sub>11</sub> tagged with GFP (P2Y<sub>11</sub>-GFP), two bands were detected. The small molecular weight band corresponds to the endogenous P2Y<sub>11</sub> and the other band is consistent with the addition of GFP to P2Y<sub>11</sub> (see Figure 2A). Treatment of tsA-201 cells over-expressing P2Y<sub>11</sub>-GFP with specific P2Y<sub>11</sub> antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) resulted in a reduction in the intensity of both bands (Figure 2B). In native arterial tissue, we detected an immunoreactive band of the expected molecular weight for P2Y<sub>11</sub> (~40 kDa) with the same P2Y<sub>11</sub> Ab (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A). Importantly, the abundance of this ~40 kDa band was reduced to about ~50% of the basal P2Y<sub>11</sub> protein abundance in arteries treated with specific P2Y<sub>11</sub> antisense ODNs (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). A band of ~110-120 kDa was observed in mouse arterial lysates, perhaps reflecting the formation of heterodimers between the P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptor itself or other purinergic/ G protein-coupled receptors, as previously reported (Barragan-Iglesias et al., 2015; Barragan-Iglesias et al., 2014; Ecke et al., 2008; Nishimura et al., 2016). This discussion is included in the first paragraph of the subsection “P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes” We also observed a band of expected molecular weight for P2Y<sub>11</sub> in lysates from <underline>isolated mouse arterial myocytes</underline> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D), and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-associated fluorescence was not detected in isolated mouse arterial myocytes exposed to a boiled P2Y<sub>11</sub> Ab (Figure 2—figure supplement 1E). In addition, note that the functional expression of human P2Y<sub>11</sub> and mouse P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptors in arterial myocytes is further supported by multiple well-controlled functional studies described throughout the manuscript (please see Figures 5-8). Finally, we reached out to several commercial companies that sell P2Y<sub>11</sub> Ab to obtain antigenic peptides for P2Y<sub>11</sub>. They do not have available antigenic peptides for P2Y<sub>11</sub> Ab nor were able to provide us with the amino acid sequence used to raise the antibody, thus prohibiting that additional approach to antibody validation. Regardless, we consider that our multiple biochemical and functional approaches provide strong support for validation of the P2Y<sub>11</sub> Ab and the presence of human P2Y<sub>11</sub> and mouse P2Y<sub>11</sub>-like receptor in arterial myocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) While ATP might be expected to accumulate in restricted spaces in tissue to activate P2Y<sub>11</sub>, there is some doubt about whether ATP release could be responsible for the increased Ba2+ currents in patch-clamp experiments where ATP would be free to diffuse. More evidence should be provided to support the role of ATP. For example, does continuous bath perfusion reduce or eliminate the increase in Ba2+ current in response to glucose? Can ATP release be detected by luciferase in the bath (e.g., see Ospichuk and Cahalan, Nature 359:241, 1992)? Finally, please discuss possible mechanisms of ATP secretion and what is known about the affinity of P2Y11 for ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>We recognize that our original cartoon identifying extracellular ATP as a primary mediator of glucose-induced activation of P2Y<sub>11</sub> was premature. Although we are now including additional data showing that the well-known non-hydrolyzed ATP analog and P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist ATPγS (von Kugelgen and Harden, 2011) stimulates Ba<sup>2+</sup> currents in arterial myocytes (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B; subsection “The P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 stimulates Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, PKA-dependent LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, first paragraph), we have modified the illustration to avoid data overinterpretation.</p><p>Note, however, that increased glucose (20 mM D-glucose) has been shown to trigger the release of NUC into the extracellular space of many cells, including arterial myocytes (Costa et al., 2009; Hazama et al., 1998; Nilsson et al., 2006; Parodi et al., 2002). Our results with apyrase support this conclusion (Figure 1). In addition, we now provide additional data to support the concept that glucose-induced extracellular nucleotide release mediates the changes in Ba<sup>2+</sup> current in isolated voltage clamped arterial myocytes by performing the proposed experiments with continuous bath perfusion. Accordingly, we were able to record robust Ba<sup>2+</sup> current in isolated voltage clamped arterial myocytes under static and flow conditions. However, as predicted by the reviewers, whereas I<sub>Ba</sub> recorded in a static bath was significantly elevated upon increasing external D-glucose from 10 mM to 20 mM, this response was not observed under continuous flow conditions. These results suggest that nucleotides (NUC) could indeed diffuse away under continuous flow conditions, whereas they could accumulate in or around the area of release at the surface membrane of arterial myocytes to induce the optimal activation of the signaling pathway underlying the increased Ba<sup>2+</sup> current density in response to 20 mM D-glucose. We did attempt to detect glucose-induced NUC release (e.g. ATP) using a commercially available luciferin-luciferase kit. Unfortunately, we could not detect any signal. After consulting with the manufacturer, this was attributed to a need for optimizing the preparation to detect NUC release from native arterial myocytes. This is not a trivial task and may take more time than that allotted for resubmission of the manuscript. We are currently working to optimize our preparation/assay and rigorously address this point in a comprehensive follow up study. However, new data provide further support to our hypothesis that elevated glucose evokes LTCC activity and vasoconstriction through an autocrine mechanism involving secreted nucleotides, which are well-known activators of G-coupled P2Y receptors (von Kugelgen and Harden, 2011). These new data and discussion are now included as Figure 1—figure supplement 3 (subsection “Glucose-induced extracellular nucleotide release mediates Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, increased LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”).</p><p>As suggested, we provide a discussion of possible mechanisms of NUC (including ATP) secretion and P2Y<sub>11</sub> pharmacological profile (see Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) To show that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>1928</sup> is essential for the regulation of contractility by P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonists (and not merely correlated), vasoconstriction measurements (Figure 7) should be repeated with a S1928A knockin mouse. Similarly, the single-channel Po (Figure 8) should also be measured in the knockin animals to counter the possibility that prolonged incubation in glucose may have increased Po by affecting other signaling pathways and gene expression.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed additional experiments. First, we found that arteries from S1928A mice failed to constrict in response to the P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546. These results are in stark contrast to those observed for wild type arteries (see Figure 7E and 7F), and further support the conclusion that phosphorylation of Ser<sup>1928</sup> is essential for the regulation of vascular reactivity in response to a P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist. These new data and discussion are now included as Figure 7F in the revised manuscript (subsection “The P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 stimulates Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, PKA-dependent LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, last paragraph).</p><p>Second, we performed the suggested single-channel experiments in arterial myocytes from S1928A mice under chronically elevated glucose stimulation (48 hours). Results indicate that S1928A cells isolated from either 10 mM and 20 mM D-glucose groups had similar LTCC open probability (nP<sub>o</sub>), which are comparable to that observed for LTCCs in wild type cells isolated from the group treated with 10 mM D-glucose. These results counter the possibility that prolonged incubation in elevated glucose may have increased LTCC nP<sub>o</sub> by affecting other signaling pathways and gene expression, and further support a key role for Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation in regulation of LTCC activity during diabetic hyperglycemia. These new data and discussion are now included as Figure 8—figure supplement 1B (subsection “Increased Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation and LTCC activity during chronic diabetic hyperglycemia are prevented by a P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor”) in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The specificity of LTCC modulation by glucose is an important issue, and the GSD data as they stand are rather descriptive and do not establish whether P2Y<sub>11</sub> exists in complexes with AC, PKA, and LTCC.

The analysis revealed a higher level of overlap between P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA in the experimental data than that observed for a simulated random distribution. These results suggest a selective and distinctive interaction between a subpopulation of P2Y<sub>11</sub> and a pool of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA, which complements our super-resolution data in the first submission.

Please provide comment in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>To answer this question, we first respectfully submit that it would not be appropriate at this time to correlate PLA data with the FRET responses as many factors may independently influence each measurement. The PLA data indicate relative abundance of the protein complex whereas the FRET data indicate relative signaling intensity after stimulation. There is not a necessary correlation between these two results. Accordingly, the goal of our PLA experiments is to define close association between P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA, whereas the goal of the FRET experiments is to determine whether glucose could modulate cAMP signaling as well as define potential mechanisms such as the involvement of the P2Y<sub>11</sub>.

The reasons for this are currently unclear but may include intrinsic differences associated with species (human vs. mouse), blood vessels (human adipose arteries vs mouse aortae) and expression patterns of the biosensor in human vs. mouse cells, as well as variations in protein expression and receptor/enzyme activity (e.g. P2Y<sub>11</sub>, AC and PDE expression/activity) in human vs. mouse arterial myocytes. Whether either or all of the factors described above contribute to distinctive cAMP responses in human vs mouse arterial myocytes as well as their physiological implications, remain to be explored.

We are working to rigorously and comprehensively examine the role of AC5 in a follow up manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In the last paragraph of the subsection “The P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340 prevents glucose-induced Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, the NF546 experiment does not rule out involvement of P2Y<sub>1</sub> receptor, it merely shows it is not necessary for the vasoconstriction. To show it does not contribute, the authors should add the inhibitor after glucose to see if it inhibits (Figure 6—figure supplement 1D).</p></disp-quote><p>To address this question, we performed additional experiments. We now show that glucose-mediated vasoconstriction is not affected by adding the P2Y<sub>1</sub> inhibitor MRS2179 either before or after 20 mM D-glucose. These new data and discussion are now included as Figure 6—figure supplement 1E (subsection “The P2Y<sub>11</sub> inhibitor NF340 prevents glucose-induced Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, last paragraph) in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved and the reviewers' comments have been addressed well with new experimental data and additions to the text. However, several points need to be explained more clearly before the manuscript can be accepted, as outlined below:</p><p>Point 1. Please show a bar graph quantifying the pSer Western in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E (like that shown in Figure 1C) to make the point.</p></disp-quote><p>A bar plot quantifying pSer<sup>1928</sup> in the presence of 10 mM D-glucose and 20 mM mannitol is now included in the revised version of the manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 2b. Please show two MW markers (55, 35) for the P2Y<sub>11</sub> blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D since the band is well below 55 kD. This is needed to show expression at the expected MW of 40 kD.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we now show two MW marker for the WB blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 3. Please describe the perfusion experiment in more detail – in particular, the speed of perfusion (ml/min), and the time interval between changes in perfusion rate and collection of data. Please state the EC<sub>50</sub> for stimulating P2Y<sub>11</sub> with ATP in the text, with a reference.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our description of the perfusion experiments and have provided additional information about time intervals between perfusion rate and collection of data in the Materials and methods section and in the figure legend of the revised manuscript (subsection “Electrophysiology”, first paragraph and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 legend). We also stated the EC<sub>50</sub> for stimulating P2Y<sub>11</sub> with ATP and have provided citations for this in the revised manuscript (subsection “The P2Y<sub>11</sub> agonist NF546 stimulates Ser<sup>1928</sup> phosphorylation, PKA-dependent LTCC activity and vasoconstriction”, first paragraph, and Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Point 5. The simulations and analysis need to be explained in the Materials and methods section. How is &quot;overlap&quot; quantified in Figure 3I? It is surprising that almost no overlap is visible in the experimental data in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C (&quot;overlap&quot; panel). Briefly describe how was randomization done and how many times it was repeated. The explanation in the second paragraph of the subsection “P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes” does not adequately explain how the simulation was done, and what we are looking at in the images in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>To address these points, we have expanded the description of the generation of simulation/randomization data as well as the overall analysis in the revised manuscript. Randomization of P2Y<sub>11</sub>-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and P2Y<sub>11</sub>-PKA<sub>cat</sub> was repeated six times and then compared against experimental data obtained from the super-resolution localization maps. The percentage of P2Y<sub>11</sub> overlap was determined by multiplying thresholded, binary localization maps (experimental and simulated data) of P2Y<sub>11</sub>by those from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 or PKA<sub>cat</sub>. We apologize and acknowledge that the quality of original images in Figure 3—figure supplement 3C was not adequate, thus preventing proper evaluation of the data. We have modified the presentation of these images by changing the LUT to an inverted grayscale LUT that makes the overlapping signals more apparent and therefore, better reflects the results from the amalgamated data. Changes are found in subsection “P2Y<sub>11</sub> receptors are in close proximity to Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 and PKA<sub>cat</sub> in arterial myocytes”, second paragraph, subsection “Immunolabeling and Ground State Depletion (GSD) microscopy”, last paragraph, and in the Figure 3—figure supplement 3 legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
