How well such data translate to the human CNS remains largely to be determined. Human brain slice cultures derived from neurosurgical resections may offer novel avenues to approach this translational gap. We now demonstrate robust preservation of the complex neuronal cytoarchitecture and electrophysiological properties of human pyramidal neurons in long-term brain slice cultures. Further experiments delineate the optimal conditions for efficient viral transduction of cultures, enabling ‘high throughput’ fluorescence-mediated 3D reconstruction of genetically targeted neurons at comparable quality to state-of-the-art biocytin fillings, and demonstrate feasibility of long term live cell imaging of human cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. This model system has implications toward a broad spectrum of translational studies, regarding the validation of data obtained in non-human model systems, for therapeutic screening and genetic dissection of human CNS circuitry.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adult human neurons</kwd><kwd>morphology</kwd><kwd>human brain slice cultures</kwd><kwd>spines</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002345</institution-id><institution>Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fortüne 2381-0-0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schwarz</surname><given-names>Niklas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KO-4877/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koch</surname><given-names>Henner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE4896/3-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Yvonne G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002345</institution-id><institution>Eberhard Karls Universität Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinician Scientist fellowship 419-0-0</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wuttke</surname><given-names>Thomas V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FOR 2715</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hedrich</surname><given-names>Ulrike BS</given-names></name><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Albert J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>German Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WE4896/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weber</surname><given-names>Yvonne G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Viral transduction and gene manipulation of adult human brain slices will be of great value allowing investigations including therapeutic screening, electrophysiological and structural studies of properties of human CNS circuitry.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human brain is composed of an intricate network of diverse cell types with complex interactions and connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeFelipe et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Somogyi et al., 1998</xref>). The microstructure within the brain was already appreciated in the early pioneering work by Santiago Ramón y Cajal and has been further investigated in the last decades in post mortem human brain samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elston and DeFelipe, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elston et al., 2001</xref>) and in numerous animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Branco and Häusser, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Somogyi et al., 1998</xref>). Neurons function as a core component of the microstructure of CNS circuits. The computation and integration of signals by these cells and the output is believed to underlie higher brain functions such as cognition and learning. Two broad classes of neurons, glutamatergic neurons (pyramidal neurons, 80%) and GABAergic interneurons (20%), populate the human neocortex. Cortical pyramidal neurons can be further categorized into four classes according to their output connectivity. Intratelencephalic pyramidal neurons are distributed throughout cortical layers 2–6 and build associative connections with other cortical areas (within one hemisphere or across the corpus callosum) or with the striatum. Pyramidal tract neurons reside in layer five and project their axons to the brain stem and spinal cord. Corticothalamic neurons establish axonal output connectivity from layer six to area related thalamic nuclei. The fourth category comprises layer four short-axon intratelencephalic neurons, which locally relay thalamic input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shepherd and Rowe, 2017</xref>). With the exception of layer four intratelencephalic neurons in sensory areas (spiny stellate cells) pyramidal neurons typically show a long apical dendrite. Overall morphology and complexity of apical and basal dendrites can substantially differ between pyramidal neurons and throughout layers. Furthermore, work by colleagues in the field provides direct evidence that there also exist marked species-specific differences of structural features and functional properties of pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>) as well as regarding basic cortical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eyal et al., 2016</xref>), cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boldog et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elston et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>), functional divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Napoli and Obeid, 2016</xref>) and plasticity mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>). Such differences underscore the challenges of modeling human disease by cellular and animal models and call for the development of new translational approaches based on human nervous tissue. Spare human CNS tissue obtained from neurosurgical procedures has proven valuable throughout the years, for example for electrophysiological studies in acute slice preparations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bernard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalmbach et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kerkhofs et al., 2017</xref>). Unlike with rodent CNS tissue, past attempts by different groups to establish organotypic slice cultures of human CNS tissue had yet repeatedly faced pronounced limitations regarding viability and integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Connor et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verwer et al., 2002</xref>). However, recent efforts challenged these limitations and provided promising proof-of-concept data on electrophysiological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eugène et al., 2014</xref>) and optogenetic targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2016</xref>) in human brain slice cultures. Subsequent studies established successful neuronal labeling, optical manipulation and calcium imaging by virus-driven rapid expression of respective probes in short term cultures of several days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting et al., 2018</xref>). Recent parallel work by us in contrast focused on optimization of culture conditions and demonstrated that neuronal viability and network activity of human brain slice cultures can be significantly extended to up to three weeks under specified conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). Proper function of complex CNS networks, however, critically depends on morphological and functional integrity of neurons structurally underlying circuitry. Neurons need to extend their dendritic processes to correct locations in order to receive appropriate synaptic inputs and relay them to adequate target structures. Specific functional properties are required to compute and integrate information in a meaningful way. Whether this level of morphological complexity along with inherent electrophysiological characteristics is maintained in human brain slice cultures over a period of two to three weeks or whether dendritic arbors rarefy and functional features dissipate is not known and will be investigated in this work.</p><p>In the last decades, important molecular genetic achievements and subsequent combined application of tools such as the Cre-lox system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Song and Palmiter, 2018</xref>), optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Madisen et al., 2012</xref>) and virus-mediated gene targeting/knockout/delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrie and Russell, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Howard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rao and Craig, 1997</xref>) enabled an increasingly better understanding of how distinct cell types assemble and form functional circuitry in the rodent brain. Adapting such strategies to human brain slice cultures reflecting an environment as close as possible to the actual human brain will open new roads toward dissection of human CNS circuitry and could potentially provide an increasingly more accurate understanding of how human CNS disease develops.</p><p>Toward these aims, we now performed detailed cellular analyses of the somatodendritic and synaptic spine compartments and of characteristic electrophysiological properties of single neurons throughout the course of culturing. These features form the basis of intact network function but whether they are maintained in cortical slice cultures remained still elusive. Further experiments established the conditions for efficient viral transduction with a focus on glutamatergic pyramidal neurons within human brain slice cultures.</p><p>We find robust structural and electrophysiological stability of human pyramidal neurons and amenability of human brain slice cultures to efficient genetic manipulation, as revealed by successful transduction by GFP-encoding adeno-associated viral vectors (AAV-vectors). GFP fluorescence levels were sufficient for both post-hoc confocal microscopy- and two-photon live cell imaging-based assessment of neuronal morphology including spines emanating from the dendritic arbors. We demonstrate GFP-based cellular 3D morphological analysis with increased efficiency and compatible quality in comparison to classic intracellular biocytin fillings.</p><p>The presented data indicate feasibility of utilizing human brain slice cultures as a model system as close as possible to the actual human brain and apply them toward studies of human CNS circuitry, disease and therapeutic screening, thereby having the potential to close the translational gap to non-human model systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons in human brain slice cultures versus acute slices</title><p>Besides morphological and structural features intact physiology of neurons constitutes one of the hallmarks of healthy neural tissue. In a first set of experiments we determined the stability of the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons performing whole cell patch clamp recordings (n = 45) from cells in acute (n = 17) or cultured (n = 28) slices (2–14 DIV). The cells recorded from cultured slices were further subdivided into early (2-3 DIV, n = 8) and late in culture (7–14 DIV, n = 20) for statistical group analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Thus, questions are raised whether basic anatomic and physiological knowledge as well as disease related pathophysiological data obtained in animal models can be directly translated to the human CNS. For a long time, the ability to study bona fide human cortical neurons and investigate physiologically and pathologically relevant questions was confined to post mortem studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anton-Sanchez et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elston and Fujita, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huttenlocher et al., 1982</xref>) and to acute/fresh post-surgery tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beck et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marcuccilli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Verhoog et al., 2013</xref>). With standard procedures, limited viability of resected tissue restricted electrophysiological recordings to a time window of 12–72 hr following surgery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wickham et al., 2018</xref>). However, in recent years several methods have been incrementally established by us and other groups to keep human CNS tissue functionally intact for extended periods of days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting et al., 2018</xref>) to weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eugène et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). Initial studies based on development of special culturing strategies and complex artificial media revealed feasibility and prompted further investigation and optimization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eugène et al., 2014</xref>). We recently demonstrated that hCSF significantly promotes neuronal viability and long-term survival of human brain slice cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>), allowing robust recordings of neuronal network activity for up to 21 DIV. These results indicated that after additional thorough characterization and further optimization such a system could potentially serve as a translational tool with broad application toward studies of human disease and development of novel therapeutic strategies. The success of such a model system would be predicted to not only critically depend on the viability of neurons but also on the maintenance of their distinct morphological characteristics. While we had demonstrated general neuronal survival within cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>) it remained elusive whether overall neuronal morphology, specifically dendritic complexity, spine distribution and designated structural features of spines, are preserved throughout the course of culturing. In the present study we now provide a systematic analysis of pyramidal neurons and interneurons across all cortical layers supporting overall electrophysiological and structural stability throughout the time window up to two weeks in culture. Specifically, we found that most parameters quantified in this study did not differ between neurons recorded in acute (0 DIV), early (2–3 DIV) or late stage cultures (7-14 DIV). One exception was the resting membrane potential of pyramidal neurons which was found to be slightly, but significantly lower for pyramidal neurons recorded in slices at 0 DIV. This might be interpreted as a small initial adaptation of pyramidal neurons to the new conditions in culture, particularly since we did not find continued depolarization of resting membrane potential in late stage cultures compared to early stage ones. Interestingly, interneurons did not seem to show this effect. Moreover, we measured and compared the properties of GFP positive neurons after viral transduction and found no major impairment of neuronal function in our analyzed samples of pyramidal neurons (n = 7) and interneurons (n = 6), which is in line with a previous study investigating virus transduction in human neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting et al., 2018</xref>). Although our data indicate no major interference of viral transduction with neuronal function we cannot rule out subtler alterations, particularly given the immense diversity of cortical neurons, which certainly cannot be represented in its entirety in our samples. This question needs to be further approached in future large-scale studies and respective investigations will benefit from community-based efforts. It has been reported before that pyramidal neurons of the human temporal cortex show a layer specific dendritic pattern with a gradual increase of the total dendritic length (both of the apical and basal compartment) of layers 2/3 pyramidal neurons correlating with the distance of the soma to the pia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohan et al., 2015</xref>). We confirmed this finding in our acute/fresh tissue samples and further demonstrate its robustness throughout the culturing period. Furthermore, we confirmed a decline in total apical dendritic length in our cultures at the intersection of layers 3 and 4, as demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mohan et al. (2015)</xref>, corresponding to the presence and survival of spiny stellate neurons which are lacking an extended apical dendrite. While the gross morphology of the apical and basal dendritic arbors of pyramidal neurons are considered fairly stable over time <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> in acute slices, there is strong evidence that the dendritic fine structure undergoes a constant plastic remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yuste and Bonhoeffer, 2004</xref>). Especially the spines have been proven to be plastic and to appear and disappear on time scales of days in the developing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holtmaat and Svoboda, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lendvai et al., 2000</xref>) and adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>). On the other hand, despite this sustained turnover overall spine density has been shown to remain generally stable in adult cortex of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trachtenberg et al., 2002</xref>). To investigate whether anatomic features of spines change over time in human slice cultures we performed high-resolution confocal imaging of dendritic compartments and assessed spine density, spine length and spine head diameter in correlation to the DIV. We detected only small alterations of the morphological spine parameters of neurons in cultured slices compared to neurons in acute slices along with only a moderate reduction of spine density. Although this is in line with the <italic>in vivo</italic> data by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trachtenberg et al. (2002)</xref>, this result may still seem surprising since cultured cortical tissue, disconnected from their surrounding circuitry and thus deprived from outside input, would rather be expected to significantly lose spines. However, these data are in line with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Trachtenberg et al. (2002)</xref>, showing plastic remodeling in mouse pyramidal neurons with an increased spine turnover rate and number of transient spines but overall stability of spine density in response to activity deprivation. Such a homeostatic mechanism could explain the relative stability of spine density in adult human brain slice cultures reported here. Future experiments directly determining spine turnover by two-photon live cell imaging will be needed to corroborate this hypothesis and to investigate whether alternative or additional mechanisms could have a role in maintenance of spine density in human pyramidal neurons (in slice cultures). Such studies are indeed conceivable and we provide first proof-of-concept data regarding feasibility of live cell imaging for extended time periods (up to 24 hr) of human brain slice cultures by taking advantage of virally mediated neuronal GFP expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate genetic labeling as an efficient approach toward 3D reconstruction and detailed morphological analysis of relatively large quantities of adult human neurons per tissue sample, providing a valid alternative to laborious single cell biocytin fillings. Post processing of the tissue for GFP signal amplification by standard immunocytochemistry or in combination with tyramide boosting will likely provide structural information even surpassing the one available from classic biocytin fillings. Depending on the degree of cell type specificity of the promoters used to drive the expression of fluorescent proteins this strategy may also enable screening for rare human CNS cell types or targeting of certain subpopulations like interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dimidschstein et al., 2016</xref>). It seems very intriguing to adopt the same set of tools to study cell autonomous and (in light of substantial viral transduction rates) potentially even cell non-autonomous effects of disease related mutated proteins on human CNS cell types of interest. Adapting state-of-the-art molecular genetic tools (such as optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches or homologous recombination-driven genetic targeting), currently available in model organisms, for application in human CNS tissue appears increasingly practical and would open completely new opportunities to study both physiological properties of human CNS circuitry and pathological conditions underlying neurological disease.</p><p>In summary, we found a remarkable stability of morphological and electrophysiological parameters of human pyramidal neurons as cortical network components of slice cultures over a time course of 14 DIV. Furthermore, we demonstrate widespread viral transduction of human brain slice cultures, enabling genetic manipulation of adult human neurons under very controlled conditions. We propose that this model system will be of great value for many investigations in viable human neuronal networks such as therapeutic screening, investigation of electrophysiological and structural properties of human CNS circuitry and direct exploration of mechanisms underlying neurological disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Human neocortical brain slice cultures were prepared from access tissue (cortical tissue outside the epileptic focus, resected in order to gain access to the pathology) obtained from patients undergoing epilepsy surgery.

This system can be used to register neurons according to the distance of their soma position from the pial surface, thereby assigning neurons to cortical layers 2/3, 4 or 5/6. To confirm comparability to our acute (0 DIV) tissue and in order to assess whether this system can be also directly applied to our tissue cultures, we compared the thickness of cortical gray matter between tissue slices originating from independent surgeries and between different time points in culture. Following DAPI staining of slices (0 DIV - 15 DIV) layer four was clearly visible as delineated band (as has previously been demonstrated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ting et al., 2018</xref>)~1200 µm below the pial surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

Primary and secondary antibodies were used at the following dilutions: mouse anti-Satb2 for excitatory neurons (1:100, Abcam, ab51502, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_882455">AB_882455</ext-link>), chicken anti-MAP2 for the somatodendritic compartment of neurons (1:500, Abcam, ab5392, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2138153">AB_2138153</ext-link>); chicken anti-Calretinin (1:500, Merck, AB1550, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_90764">AB_90764</ext-link>); goat anti-mouse IgG Alexa 568 (1:500, Thermo Fisher, A-11004, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534072">AB_2534072</ext-link>); goat anti-chicken Alexa 488 (1:500, Thermo Fisher, A-11039, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_142924">AB_142924</ext-link>) and donkey anti-goat Alexa 568 (1:500, Thermo Fisher, A-11057, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_142581">AB_142581</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Cell counts and quantification</title><p>Images for Satb2 and Map2 quantification were taken with a Leica TCS SP8 confocal laser-scanning microscope (Bensheim, Germany) using a 40x/1.3NA oil-immersion objective. We obtained images of four to six areas in layers 2/3 (each area290 µm x 290 µm in size) per slice and analyzed maximum projections of 2.1 µm stacks. The absolute number of cells per area was normalized to 100 µm X 100 µm (10000 µm<sup>2</sup>) and plotted. The quantification was performed for the same dataset in a blinded manner by three independent researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Two-photon live cell imaging and sholl analysis</title><p>Slice cultures with GFP-positive neurons were imaged on an upright Zeiss LSM 880 NLO microscope, using an IR-optimized water-immersion x20 Objective (W Plan-Apochromat x20/1.0, Carl Zeiss, Jena). A MaiTai eHP (Spectra Physics) laser was used for two-photon excitation, tuned at 920 nm for exciting the GFP fluorescence. Emission was collected using the Non-Descanned GaAsP detection path, with a 520/50 emission filter. A 3D tile scan of a larger area of the culture was setup in the ZEN black software (Carl Zeiss, Jena), collecting images at a resolution of 0.415 × 0.415×1.2 µm per voxel. The above configuration was optimized for highest light throughput, ensuring the minimum possible laser intensity, in order to avoid thermal damage to the neurons. For 24 hr time-lapse imaging stacks of images were acquired every 30 min at a resolution of 0.208 × 0.208×0.640 µm per voxel. Five areas were marked in the experiment designer of the Zen black software so that the system could navigate to all positions and image predefined areas in an automated manner. The experiment designer was setup to repeat this chain of acquisitions every 30 min.</p><p>To guarantee a stable environment while imaging, the culture inserts were placed in a custom-made chamber, designed to securely hold the insert at the same orientation and position, submerged in aCSF. Prewarmed, carbogenated aCSF constantly perfused the chamber. The customized stage-top incubator which housed the customized culture insert holder was kept at 37°C and was filled with humidified carbogen.</p><p>All movies acquired with two-photon live-cell imaging were deconvolved with Huygens Essential (Scientific Volume Imaging B.V., Hilversum) before further processing. After deconvolution, images and movies were analyzed using Imaris (Bitplane, Belfast, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007370">SCR_007370</ext-link>). The filaments tool of the Imaris software was used to semi-automatically trace the dendrites and spines of the neurons. The total length of the filaments was automatically calculated in Imaris. For the sholl analysis of the traced dendrites in Imaris, the sholl radius was set to 2 µm. The maximum radius of the sholl analysis was defined as the maximum radius in the field of view at which an intersection of the filament with one of the sholl circles could still be detected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Analysis and statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed with Graph Pad Prism seven using paired or unpaired Mann Whitney test to compare two groups and Kruskal-Wallis test with Dunn’s Multiple comparisons test for three groups. Mean values ± standard error of the mean (SEM) are presented in text and Figures, unless specified differently. Linear regressions were analyzed for the correlations between properties and the days <italic>in vitro</italic> and the distance to the pia (DTP).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank all patients for participating in this study.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Huibert D Mansvelder (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript describes physiological and anatomical comparisons between acute human cortical slices and those kept in culture for up to 2 weeks. The authors use AAV-mediated expression of GFP to show no substantial changes in basic whole cell current clamp properties, large-scale dendritic anatomy, or fine scale synapse morphology in samples of neurons from the acute and cultured conditions. This article is a welcome contribution to an exciting field and validates the use of human resected tissue for functional long-term translational studies, as well as for basic scientific questions on how human neuronal networks are organized. While the reviewers appreciate the advance of being able to culture human slices for weeks, particularly when combined with AAV mediated transfection, they suggest to perform additional experiments to convincingly and rigorously demonstrate that long term culture does not substantially alter the physiology or morphology of the neurons over the long timescale. The results for the 14 DIV time-point came from very low cell number rather than appropriate and comprehensive population and statistical comparisons.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Much of the data seems phenomenological, rather than systematic and quantitative. For example, the authors state: &quot;To investigate whether AAV-transduction and GFP expression affected the electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of GFP positive neurons. All recorded neurons displayed normal AP firing upon supra-threshold current injections with either regular spiking pattern (Figure 8B, n=3) or fast spiking pattern (n=3). In addition, synaptic inputs (spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs)) were present in voltage clamp mode in all GFP positive neurons (n=6) (Figure 8B). Taking together these results, virus transduction did not interfere with neuronal functionality.&quot; N = 3 neurons is an extremely low number, and the authors do not say how many slices or patients these 3 neurons came from. I also don't see any statistics for these comparisons, and no real population data in the figures. I do not think this is a rigorous test of the authors' contention that virus transduction does not interfere with neuronal functionality.</p><p>2) The spine analysis is confusing. It's not clear what is being analyzed – is each data point in Figure 7 an averaged value of spine measurements per neuron? Where were the spine measurements sampled from in the neurons? The authors need to improve the clarity regarding how these experiments were conducted.</p><p>3) The Materials and methods are incomplete and would not allow a reader to repeat the experiment. For example, there is no mention of what media the slices were cultured in. Or how the slices were kept sterile, which seems like a key point.</p><p>How were the slices treated after sectioning?</p><p>Were they recovered in a warm incubation system as is convention? If so, what temperatures and times were used?</p><p>Were the cultured slices sent directly to culture after slicing? After recovery? How were they treated? This are crucial points for this methods-oriented paper and the authors are extremely light on the details.</p><p>When were electrophysiological recordings (and biocytin filling) of acute slices done after cutting? From experience of both human and rodent slice recordings, slices have to rest after slicing to recover due to processes like spine retraction and glycogen depletion (e.g. Kirov et al., 2004, Neuroscience), usually an hour for rodents and 3 hours for human hippocampal and cortical tissue. This should be described in Materials and methods.</p><p>4) The authors refer to the choline chloride solution they use to transport and slice the human tissue as aCSF, but they also refer to their patch clamp recording solution (which they do not define) as aCSF. It's highly unlikely they performed physiology experiments in the choline solution. Describing the constituency of the recording solution is necessary.</p><p>5) Variation in patient material needs more attention.</p><p>Patient material can be quite variable depending on various factors, such as the level of pathophysiology of the tissue, patient age and handling during surgery. In this manuscript there are 3 different cortical areas measured, the age range is from 10 to 56 and 2 patients presented with gangliogliomas. This can be a problem when samples sizes are low if the slices are all from the same patients and not representing the majority. The patient material underlying the analyses should be stated (with patients numbered) when describing groups and figures.</p><p>6) The comparison between DIV 0 and DIV 2-14 for electrophysiology is a bit strange. If the goal is to investigate effect of time in culture should the comparison be between DIV 0/2 and DIV 14? The numbers of cells are not enough for this comparison. On the same note the time-point for MAP2/Satb2-stainings were 9 DIV vs 14 DIV. If changes in neuronal number have occurred before 9 DIV this will not be detected and MAP2/Satb2 data would not support the statement of a robust survival of neurons throughout the culturing time.</p><p>7) The study mainly focusses on pyramidal neurons. Although the Satb2/Map2 comparisons in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 do hint at stable presence of inhibitory cells in the culture, it would be a very valuable addition to include analysis on properties of inhibitory interneurons to the study. In the description of Figure 8, recordings from fast spiking neurons are mentioned, but not shown. Are morphological and/or physiological properties of interneurons equally well-maintained across the culturing period? Perhaps this can be addressed in the data the authors already have collected?</p><p>8) It is stated that patched neurons were filled with the intracellular solution for a minimum of 10 minutes &quot;allowing for full morphological reconstruction&quot;. My question is if 10 minutes is sufficient for diffusion of biocytin to reach distal dendrites? What would be the diffusion rate of biocytin in your setup? This could be estimated using the recording temperature, which is missing in Materials and methods.</p><p>9) Related to Figure 1G: If brain slice properties alter over culture time, for instance connectivity or cellular morphology, this could show up in input resistance or membrane time constant. Were these parameters affected by days in culture?

For example, the authors state: &quot;To investigate whether AAV-transduction and GFP expression affected the electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of GFP positive neurons. All recorded neurons displayed normal AP firing upon supra-threshold current injections with either regular spiking pattern (Figure 8B, n=3) or fast spiking pattern (n=3). In addition, synaptic inputs (spontaneous postsynaptic currents (sPSCs)) were present in voltage clamp mode in all GFP positive neurons (n=6) (Figure 8B). Taking together these results, virus transduction did not interfere with neuronal functionality.&quot; N = 3 neurons is an extremely low number, and the authors do not say how many slices or patients these 3 neurons came from. I also don't see any statistics for these comparisons, and no real population data in the figures. I do not think this is a rigorous test of the authors' contention that virus transduction does not interfere with neuronal functionality.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and increased the sample sizes. We doubled the number of analyzed pyramidal neurons after virus transduction from n=3 to n=7. Non-transduced GFP negative (n=13) pyramidal neurons served as control group. All analyzed pyramidal neurons were in culture for at least 7 days. The corresponding data and statistics are presented in Figure 8 and revealed no significant differences for the analyzed parameters (resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP half width and sag potential).</p><p>In addition, we added an entirely new comparative analysis of GFP positive (n=6) and negative interneurons (n=9), that also did not show significant differences in most parameters, with the exception of the hyperpolarization induced sag potential, which was found to be reduced in GFP positive interneurons (corresponding data and statistics are presented in Figure 8).</p><p>Table 1 now provides additional information on all analyzed neurons regarding the surgery/patient they were derived from.</p><p>Although we increased the numbers of analyzed neurons and while we feel that our data clearly indicate no major interference of viral transduction with neuronal function, we understand that we are still dealing with limited sample sizes. Therefore, we added the following statements to the Discussion:</p><p>“Moreover, we measured and compared the properties of GFP positive neurons after viral transduction and found no major impairment of neuronal function in our analyzed samples of pyramidal cells (n=7) and interneurons (n=6), which is in line with a previous study investigating virus transduction in human neurons (Ting et al., 2018).”</p><p>“Although our data indicate no major interference of viral transduction with neuronal function we cannot rule out more subtle alterations, particularly given the immense diversity of cortical neurons, which certainly cannot be represented in its entirety in our samples. This question needs to be further approached in future large-scale studies and respective investigations will benefit from community-based efforts.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The spine analysis is confusing. It's not clear what is being analyzed – is each data point in Figure 7 an averaged value of spine measurements per neuron? Where were the spine measurements sampled from in the neurons? The authors need to improve the clarity regarding how these experiments were conducted.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the spines of biocytin filled and GFP labeled neurons as follows: For each pyramidal neuron we analyzed 5 areas of the dendritic tree (3 of the apical dendritic (red boxes) and 2 of the basal dendritic compartment (blue boxes), each 72 x 36 µm in size, please also see Figure 7). Spine density, spine length and spine head diameter were measured for each area. Values of all 5 areas per neuron were averaged and plotted against the “DIV” or against the “distance to pia” such that every data point in Figure 7E and F corresponds to the average of the 5 areas per neuron. We have chosen this method to minimize potential measuring errors for each analyzed neuron. For clarification we have merged former Figure 7 and Figure 8 to new Figure 7. The group data (former Figure 7E) were transferred to new Figure 7—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Materials and methods are incomplete and would not allow a reader to repeat the experiment. For example, there is no mention of what media the slices were cultured in. Or how the slices were kept sterile, which seems like a key point.</p><p>How were the slices treated after sectioning?</p><p>Were they recovered in a warm incubation system as is convention? If so, what temperatures and times were used?</p><p>Were the cultured slices sent directly to culture after slicing? After recovery? How were they treated? This are crucial points for this methods-oriented paper and the authors are extremely light on the details.</p><p>When were electrophysiological recordings (and biocytin filling) of acute slices done after cutting? From experience of both human and rodent slice recordings, slices have to rest after slicing to recover due to processes like spine retraction and glycogen depletion (e.g. Kirov et al., 2004, Neuroscience), usually an hour for rodents and 3 hours for human hippocampal and cortical tissue. This should be described in Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the incomplete description of our methods. We added the missing information to the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“Preparation of slices from resected tissue: “Afterwards the slices were kept in aCSF equilibrated with carbogen for 0.5 h at room temperature before they were transferred either to patch setups for acute electrophysiological recordings and biocytin fillings or onto culture membranes for cultivation.”</p><p>Human brain slice cultures: “For the first hour following the slicing procedure the slices were cultured in 1.5 ml NSC media (48% DMEM/F-12 (Life Technologies), 48% Neurobasal (Life Technologies), 1x N-2 (Capricorn Scientific), 1x B-27 (Capricorn Scientific), 1x Glutamax (Life Technologies), 1x NEAA (Life Technologies) + 20 mM HEPES) before changing to 1.5 ml hCSF per well without any supplements. No antibiotics or antimycotics were used during cultivation.”</p><p>Whole-cell patch clamp recordings: “[…] continuously superfused with 32.0 +/- 1.5 °C aCSF (in mM: 118 NaCl, 25 NaHCO3, 30 D-glucose, 1 MgCl2, 3 KCl, 1 NaH2PO4, und 1.5 CaCl2) and visualized with a BX61WI Microscope (Olympus) or a Leica stereomicroscope. After 1 h of equilibration in the patch setup recordings were performed using recording electrodes with a resistance of 3-5 MΩ and filled with an intracellular whole-cell patch-clamp pipette solution containing”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors refer to the choline chloride solution they use to transport and slice the human tissue as aCSF, but they also refer to their patch clamp recording solution (which they do not define) as aCSF. It's highly unlikely they performed physiology experiments in the choline solution. Describing the constituency of the recording solution is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the incomplete description of our aCSF solutions. We changed the respective passages as follows:</p><p>“[…] continuously superfused with 32.0 +/- 1.5 °C recording aCSF (in mM: 118 NaCl, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 30 D-glucose, 1 MgCl2, 3 KCl, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, und 1.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>)”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Variation in patient material needs more attention.</p><p>Patient material can be quite variable depending on various factors, such as the level of pathophysiology of the tissue, patient age and handling during surgery. In this manuscript there are 3 different cortical areas measured, the age range is from 10 to 56 and 2 patients presented with gangliogliomas. This can be a problem when samples sizes are low if the slices are all from the same patients and not representing the majority. The patient material underlying the analyses should be stated (with patients numbered) when describing groups and figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Table 1 now provides additional information on all analyzed neurons regarding the surgery/patient they were derived from.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The comparison between DIV 0 and DIV 2-14 for electrophysiology is a bit strange. If the goal is to investigate effect of time in culture should the comparison be between DIV 0/2 and DIV 14? The numbers of cells are not enough for this comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the comments. We have added more neurons to the analysis and regrouped the data (Figure 1E) according to the reviewer’s suggestion as follows:</p><p>a) 0 DIV (n=17)</p><p>b) 2-3 DIV (n=8)</p><p>c) 7-14 DIV (n=20).</p><p>For these groups we performed Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn's multiple comparisons test to test for statistically significant differences.</p><p>Additionally we provide graphs plotting AP half width, resting membrane potential, sag potential and input resistance for each of the 45 analyzed pyramidal neurons as individual data points versus the DIV (Figure 1D).</p><p>We changed the Results section and Figure 1 accordingly:</p><p>“In a first set of experiments we determined the stability of the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons performing whole cell patch clamp recordings (n=45) from cells in acute (n=17) or cultured (n=28) slices (2-14 DIV). […] In summary, increasing time in culture does not impact the majority of analyzed intrinsic electrophysiological characteristics of pyramidal neurons, except for the membrane resting potential which slightly changed to more depolarized values within the first 2-3 days in culture and then stayed stable over the remaining time.”</p><p>Additionally, we inserted the following paragraph in the Discussion:</p><p>“In the present study we now provide a systematic analysis of pyramidal neurons and interneurons across all cortical layers supporting overall electrophysiological and structural stability throughout the time window up to two weeks in culture. […] This might be interpreted as a small initial adaptation of pyramidal neurons to the new conditions in culture, particularly since we did not find continued depolarization of resting membrane potential in late stage cultures compared to early stage ones. Interestingly, interneurons did not seem to show this effect.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>On the same note the time-point for MAP2/Satb2-stainings were 9 DIV vs 14 DIV. If changes in neuronal number have occurred before 9 DIV this will not be detected and MAP2/Satb2 data would not support the statement of a robust survival of neurons throughout the culturing time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added the additional time-point “0 DIV”. Corresponding data are presented in the Results section and in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. There were no significant differences between the 3 time points (0 DIV, 9 DIV and 14 DIV).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The study mainly focusses on pyramidal neurons. Although the Satb2/Map2 comparisons in Figure 1—figure supplement 2 do hint at stable presence of inhibitory cells in the culture, it would be a very valuable addition to include analysis on properties of inhibitory interneurons to the study. In the description of Figure 8, recordings from fast spiking neurons are mentioned, but not shown. Are morphological and/or physiological properties of interneurons equally well-maintained across the culturing period? Perhaps this can be addressed in the data the authors already have collected?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that – although our focus was on pyramidal neurons – our study would benefit from an addition of interneuron data. Indeed, we had already started to collect preliminary data before the initial submission. Meanwhile, we were able to acquire additional data after the submission and during the current revisions so that we feel confident to include these data now as a new data figure (Figure 6). Interneurons are an even more diverse population than pyramidal neurons. While morphology and firing behavior are known to substantially differ between various subclasses of interneurons, there are some intrinsic properties (such as resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP half width and sag potential; Figure 6F, G) which can be considered comparatively more uniform and which therefore were found suitable for an assessment over time in culture. We recorded 22 interneurons, 7 in acute (0 DIV) and 15 in cultured slices (7-14 DIV). We found no significant differences in the properties measured between the groups (0 DIV) and cultured slices (7-14 DIV) (Figure 6G). Additionally, we provide graphs for the different intrinsic properties in relation to the DIV with each interneuron being represented as an individual data point (Figure 6F).</p><p>We amended the Results section accordingly:</p><p>“Electrophysiological properties of interneurons in human brain slice cultures versus acute slices</p><p>To further investigate beyond our earlier indirect assessment based on the ratio of NeuN and Satb2 double-positive neurons to all NeuN positive neurons, whether also interneurons survive in human brain slice cultures we first performed immunocytochemical stainings for calretinin. Unlike for other interneuron subtype identifiers, we were able to obtain reliable stainings for calretinin in acute and cultured human brain slice tissue. […] The firing behavior of the recorded interneurons showed distinct firing behaviors as described before for rodents and humans and ranged from fast spiking (Figure 6D) to none fast spiking firing patterns (Ascoli et al., 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is stated that patched neurons were filled with the intracellular solution for a minimum of 10 minutes &quot;allowing for full morphological reconstruction&quot;. My question is if 10 minutes is sufficient for diffusion of biocytin to reach distal dendrites? What would be the diffusion rate of biocytin in your setup? This could be estimated using the recording temperature, which is missing in Materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not having mentioned the recording temperature. Slices were continuously superfused with recording aCSF at 32.0 +/- 1.5 °C (we added this information in the Materials and methods subsection “Whole-cell patch clamp recordings”). For recording temperatures on the order of the one we used a minimum recording/filling time of 10 minutes is in agreement with the literature (Karadottir and Attwell, Nature Protocols, 2006; Swietek et al., J Vis Exp., 2016). Though we stated that we filled the neurons for a minimum of 10 minutes, on average electrophysiological recordings took longer (20 – 30 minutes).</p><p>References: Káradóttir, R., and Attwell, D.

Were these parameters affected by days in culture? Please also test for potential correlations between input resistance and membrane time constant change with amount of time in culture.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that additionally to the intrinsic parameters already analyzed by us (AP half width, resting membrane potential and sag potential) changes of the neuronal morphology and viability could also be reflected by changes of passive membrane properties such as input resistance and membrane time constant. As suggested we added an analysis of the input resistance of neurons recorded at different time points in culture. No significant differences between neurons within acute slices or within slices cultured for 2-3 days or 7-14 days were found. Furthermore, data did not reveal a positive or negative correlation of input resistance with the number of days in vitro. As demonstrated by Isokawa et al., Brain Res Brain Res Protoc., 1997 membrane time constant can be applied to indirectly estimate dendritic degeneration of electrotonically compact hippocampal dentate granule cells. However, such an indirect assessment is unable to provide detailed insight in the actual morphology of dendritic arbors and emanating spines, as required in our study. We therefore performed direct morphological analyses based on biocytin fillings and virus mediated labeling with GFP. Figure 1 was rearranged and data for AP half width, resting membrane potential, sag potential and input resistance are now presented in Figure 1D as individual data points per neuron versus the DIV and as group analysis (Figure 1E) with each neuron having been assigned to one of three culture time periods: acute (0 DIV), early (2-3 DIV) or late (7-14 DIV). We changed the Results section accordingly: “In a first set of experiments we determined the stability of the electrophysiological properties of pyramidal neurons performing whole cell patch clamp recordings (n=45) from cells in acute (n=17) or cultured (n=28) slices (2-14 DIV).

For a validation of stability of layer dimensions throughout the culturing time slices were analyzed for different time points in culture based on DAPI staining.

The authors mention that 'very distal dendritic ramifications being captured less reliably'. It is not clear to me what would be the cause of this reduced reliability. Please explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that overlapping GFP positive processes from neighboring neurons make a reconstruction more challenging then single biocytin filled neuron reconstructions. This is what we meant by the statement “very distal dendritic ramifications being captured less reliably”. Since tracing and reconstruction of dendritic processes is not performed in 2D maximum projection images but in 3D rotatable z-stack volumes, we are convinced that the reconstructions we are providing based on GFP are accurate, with the minor exception of some uncertainties when approaching dendritic terminal endpoints. We modified the corresponding paragraph in the Results section:”Comparing combined total dendritic length of all biocytin and GFP labeled neurons independent of the DIV revealed a slight underestimation of values by GFP (Figure 5C, right panel, p&lt;0.01, n=24 (biocytin), n=23 (GFP), unpaired Mann Whitney test) – likely because very distal dendritic ramifications are being captured somewhat less reliably (due to intermingling GFP positive processes from neighboring neurons and some arising uncertainty when judging whether to assign GFP positive processes in the periphery of the neuron being reconstructed to the filament of this neuron or whether to discard them by deeming them as originating from neighboring neurons) – but overall successful reconstruction of the major parts of dendritic arbors (Figure 2 and Figure 4).”</p><p>For illustration we uploaded all reconstructed neurons to the Dryad server in 3D rotatable format.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) In Figure 8: please provide quantitative support of the statements that physiological properties and AP firing of GFP positive neurons was 'normal'.</p></disp-quote><p>Please also refer to the response to reviewer comment 1. We now provide quantitative data along with statistical analysis and present the corresponding data in Figure 8. The number of analyzed pyramidal neurons after virus transduction was doubled from n=3 to n=7. Non-transduced GFP negative (n=13) pyramidal neurons served as control group. All analyzed pyramidal neurons were in culture for at least 7 days. The corresponding data and statistics are presented in Figure 8 and revealed no significant differences for the analyzed parameters (resting membrane potential, input resistance, AP half width and sag potential).</p><p>In addition, we added an entirely new comparative analysis of GFP positive (n=6) and negative interneurons (n=9), that also did not show significant differences in most parameters, with the exception of the hyperpolarization induced sag potential, which was found to be reduced in GFP positive interneurons (corresponding data and statistics are presented in Figure 8).</p><p>The Results section was modified accordingly: “To investigate whether AAV-transduction and GFP expression affected the electrophysiological properties of cortical neurons, we performed whole-cell patch clamp recordings of GFP positive neurons (n=7) and GFP negative neurons (n=13) recorded at matching time points in culture (7-16 DIV) and assessed AP half width, resting membrane potential, sag potential and input resistance.

We measured occasionally the synaptic currents in voltage clamp, but focused in this study on intrinsic firing properties of the neurons and morphology. We feel that a thorough analysis of synaptic transmission would exceed the scope of this study and should be carefully performed in future studies. We removed the example traces of the GFP positive and negative neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16) In the final paragraph of the Results section, the authors hint at possibility to follow spine morphology changes in time, possibly across days.

We therefore performed a first set of experiments imaging several areas of a slice culture over the time period of 24 hours (Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1). We analyzed the stability of the dendritic length and maximum sholl radius over this time period and showed only minimal changes of these parameters. The following section was added to the Results section:</p><p>“In a second step we asked whether our system would be stable enough to enable time-lapse tracing of dendrites and spines of human pyramidal neurons over a time window of several hours.
