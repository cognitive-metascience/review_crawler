intellectual disability (ID) and schizophrenia (SCZ) – a heterogeneous collection of neurodevelopmental disorders with unclear pathophysiology. MEF2C is highly expressed in developing cortical excitatory neurons, but its role in their development remains unclear. We show here that conditional embryonic deletion of <italic>Mef2c</italic> in cortical and hippocampal excitatory neurons (Emx1-lineage) produces a dramatic reduction in cortical network activity in vivo, due in part to a dramatic increase in inhibitory and a decrease in excitatory synaptic transmission. In addition, we find that MEF2C regulates E/I synapse density predominantly as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor. Analysis of differential gene expression in <italic>Mef2c</italic> mutant cortex identified a significant overlap with numerous synapse- and autism-linked genes, and the <italic>Mef2c</italic> mutant mice displayed numerous behaviors reminiscent of autism, ID and SCZ, suggesting that perturbing MEF2C function in neocortex can produce autistic- and ID-like behaviors in mice.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20059.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20059.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20059.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Abnormal development of the brain contributes to intellectual disability, as well as to a number of psychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia and autism. As the brain develops, neurons establish connections with one another called synapses, which are either excitatory or inhibitory. At excitatory synapses, an electrical signal in the first cell increases the likelihood that the second cell will also produce an electrical signal. At inhibitory synapses, electrical activity in the first cell reduces the chances of the second cell producing an electrical signal. An imbalance between excitatory and inhibitory activity is one of the factors thought to give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>Many individuals with schizophrenia, autism or intellectual disability possess mutations in, or near, a gene called <italic>MEF2C</italic>. This gene, which is active in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons, encodes a protein that regulates the activity of many other genes during brain development. Harrington, Raissi et al. therefore hypothesized that alterations in <italic>MEF2C</italic> might predispose individuals to neurodevelopmental disorders by disrupting the balance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the developing brain.</p><p>To test this idea, Harrington, Raissi et al. generated mice that lack the <italic>Mef2c</italic> gene in a large proportion of their neurons throughout development. As predicted, the animals showed an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses in the brain’s outer layer, the cortex. They also displayed changes in behavior like those seen in autism. These included a loss of interest in social interaction and a reduction in vocalizations, suggesting impaired communication. Other behavioral changes included hyperactivity, repetitive movements and severe learning impairments: all features commonly observed in human neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>The next challenge is to understand when, where and how MEF2C acts in the cortex to shape the balance of excitatory and inhibitory connections. Once this is known, further studies can test whether disrupting these processes leads directly to behaviors characteristic of autism, schizophrenia and intellectual disability. This may lead to the development of new drugs that can reverse or improve the symptoms of these conditions in affected individuals.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20059.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20059.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurodevelopmental disorder</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 HD078050</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrington</surname><given-names>Adam J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFARI #206919</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Kimberly M</given-names></name><name><surname>Cowan</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD052731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Kimberly M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OD010737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huber</surname><given-names>Kimberly M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DA027664</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cowan</surname><given-names>Christopher W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mice that lack the autism- and schizophrenia-linked gene <italic>MEF2C</italic> in cortical neurons have an imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synapses, and impaired social and cognitive abilities.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>An imbalance of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission in the brain is an emerging theory of the pathophysiology of multiple neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garber, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zoghbi, 2003</xref>), including autism and SCZ.

However, the functional role(s) of MEF2C in early neuronal development, particularly in the neocortex, remains unclear. In the central nervous system, MEF2C is highly expressed very early in brain development (~E11.5), and its expression is enriched in differentiated forebrain neurons within the neocortex and dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lyons et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leifer et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">1997</xref>). Here, we sought to evaluate the role of MEF2C in differentiated cortical excitatory neurons, and to determine whether loss of MEF2C function in these neuronal populations might produce behavioral and synaptic phenotypes with potential relevance to its associated neurodevelopmental disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of <italic>Mef2c</italic> conditional kno<italic>cko</italic>ut (<italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO) mice</title><p><italic>Mef2c</italic> mRNA is enriched in the developing cortical plate, mature cortex and dentate gyrus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Leifer et al., 1993</xref>).

Therefore, we sought to test whether loss of <italic>Mef2c</italic> in the cortex alters cortical synaptic transmission in vivo. To achieve this, we measured cortical UP states, which are spontaneous, synchronous oscillations of neocortical networks that are driven by recurrent excitatory and inhibitory synaptic circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hays et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gibson et al., 2008</xref>), to assess overall synaptic function and excitability of the neocortical circuit within the somatosensory cortex (SSC) of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice. Surprisingly, we observed large reductions (~90%) in the frequency of spontaneous UP states in acute slices from the SSC of <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, the UP states in the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice were shorter in duration (~50%) and smaller in amplitude (~50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further explore this decrease in neocortical circuit activity, we performed patch-clamp recordings of layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from the SSC acute slices. In the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO slices, we detected small decreases in both the frequency and amplitude of miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), although the decrease in frequency did not quite reach statistical significance (p=0.07). We also observed large increases in both the frequency and amplitude of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that the embryonic loss of MEF2C in cortical excitatory neurons results in a small decrease in glutamatergic synaptic transmission and a large increase in inhibitory synaptic transmission – the combination of which likely contributes to the dramatic reduction in cortical network activity as detected by spontaneous UP states.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20059.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Increased cortical inhibition in <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UP states in 3-week old <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice. <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice have fewer spontaneous UP states than control mice.

In this way, &gt;99% of the presynaptic inputs onto the transfected neurons are wild-type, so noted changes in the synapse density onto Cre-expressing neurons are likely postsynaptic cell-dependent functions for MEF2C. Using this approach, we observe that Cre-expressing cortical pyramidal neurons displayed a significant increase in GABAergic synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and a significant decrease in dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), similar to the direction and magnitude of E/I synapse changes observed in the global <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>).

As such, we considered the possibility that MEF2C-VP16 and MEF2C loss-of-function could both produce excitatory synapse reductions if endogenous MEF2C is functioning as a transcriptional repressor on key target genes that regulate synapse density. Consistent with this basic idea, we found that overexpression of MEF2C-VP16, a constitutively-active form of MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), in wild-type cortical pyramidal neurons significantly reduced dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>), whereas a dominant-repressor form of MEF2C (MEF2C-EN) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>) failed to alter dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). However, cell-autonomous expression of MEF2C-EN in <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO neurons rescued the decrease in dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), strongly suggesting that endogenous MEF2C functions as a transcriptional repressor to regulate dendritic spine density. In wild-type cortical pyramidal neurons, MEF2C-VP16 also significantly increased GABAergic synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), whereas MEF2C-EN had no effect on GABAergic synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H,I</xref>). Similar to the dendritic spine density findings, cell-autonomous expression of MEF2C-EN rescued the increase in GABAergic synapse density observed in the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO cortical pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These results suggest that endogenous MEF2C functions predominantly as a transcriptional repressor to inhibit target genes that promote excitatory synapse elimination and inhibitory synapse formation and/or stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Differential gene expression in <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO cortex</title><p>Since MEF2C is a nuclear transcription factor, we sought to identify differential gene expression that results from early embryonic deletion of <italic>Mef2c</italic>.

Consistent with these ex vivo acute slice recordings, cultured <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO cortical neurons displayed a significant decrease in dendritic spine density and an increase in GABAergic synapse density. Our functional rescue findings suggest that MEF2C in cortical pyramidal neurons regulates E/I synapse densities in early development by acting in the postsynaptic neuron as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor on key target genes. Loss of MEF2C alters the gene expression, directly or indirectly, of numerous autism- and synapse-linked genes and RNAs known to associate with FMRP, the leading genetic cause of ID and autism. These findings position MEF2C as a critical transcriptional regulator functioning at the nexus of numerous synapse- and neurodevelopmental disorder-linked genes. Finally, the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice display multiple behavioral phenotypes that are reminiscent of core autism symptoms in humans, including abnormal social behaviors, reduced USVs in multiple ages and contexts, and an increased frequency of some repetitive motor behaviors. We also observed learning and memory deficits and motor hyperactivity, which are common associated symptoms of ASDs and observed in patients with <italic>MEF2C</italic> mutations. Taken together, our findings suggest that the loss of MEF2C’s repressor function in cortical excitatory neurons produces an E/I synapse imbalance and that this synaptic phenotype might contribute to the numerous, neurodevelopmental disorder-related behavioral phenotypes observed in the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated an important role for MEF2A and MEF2D in the process of activity-dependent excitatory synapse elimination in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flavell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). However, similar to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2008</xref>), we found that loss of MEF2C produced a <italic>decrease</italic> in cortical excitatory synaptic transmission, suggesting that MEF2C is a positive regulator of excitatory synapses in cortical neurons. However, overexpression of MEF2C-VP16, a strong, constitutive transcriptional activator form of MEF2C, in wild-type cortical neurons also decreased dendritic spine density and increased inhibitory synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,H</xref>) – essentially phenocopying the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO neurons. In contrast, overexpression of MEF2C-EN, a dominant repressor form of MEF2C, in WT neurons had no effect on dendritic spines or GABAergic synapse densities; whereas, expression of MEF2C-EN in <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO cortical pyramidal neurons normalized excitatory and inhibitory synapse densities to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,I</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that endogenous MEF2C functions as a cell-autonomous, transcriptional repressor at one or more key target genes involved in excitatory synapse elimination and GABAergic synapse formation/stability. These observations are consistent with previous reports demonstrating that MEF2A can also function as a transcriptional repressor to promote cerebellar excitatory synapse maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shalizi et al., 2006</xref>), highlighting a critical role for diverse mechanisms of transcriptional regulation by MEF2 family members to regulate synapse development in the brain. It’s interesting to note that membrane depolarization of <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO cortical neurons stimulated MEF2 reporter gene activity levels that are comparable to responses in WT littermates, suggesting that the activity-dependent induction of MEF2-sensitive target genes can be fully compensated for by endogenous MEF2A and MEF2D. In the future, it will be important to study the overlapping and potentially distinct functions of the various MEF2 family members, and their activity-dependent regulation, in cortical neuron function and development.</p><p>Loss of MEF2C in forebrain excitatory neurons produces an <italic>increase</italic> in structural and functional excitatory synapses formed onto hippocampal dentate granule neurons (DG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barbosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that MEF2C might have cell-type specific functions and/or that the increase in DG excitatory synaptic transmission is an indirect, homeostatic effect of decreased cortical stimulation of DG neurons. In the future, cell autonomous manipulations of the DG neurons will be important to resolve this question. Also, postnatal <italic>Mef2c</italic> deletion in forebrain excitatory neurons did not produce social or repetitive behavioral phenotypes, despite the increase in DG dendritic spine density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adachi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a dissociation of hippocampal DG spine density and postnatal MEF2C deletion from several ASD-related behaviors. As such, the role(s) for MEF2C in embryonic and/or early postnatal cortical development might be more critical for producing the behavioral phenotypes observed in our <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice. Finally, while we observe significant synaptic and gene expression differences in the SSC of the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice, Emx1-Cre expression is also detected in other brain regions and cell types, including the olfactory bulb and some glia, and as such, it is not possible to attribute the behavioral phenotypes observed in the <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO mice to the synaptic changes in the SSC, and future studies that further dissect the Emx1-lineage populations will be necessary to link specific <italic>Mef2c</italic> cKO behavioral phenotypes with a specific brain region(s).</p><p>Imbalances in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission are proposed to underlie many neuropsychiatric disorders, including ASDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rubenstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cellot and Cherubini, 2014</xref>) and SCZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coyle et al., 2016</xref>).

Our finding here show that MEF2C in postsynaptic cortical neurons function to cell-autonomously modulate the density of GABAergic synapses formed on the dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. In contrast, loss of MEF2C on cortical interneurons did not alter GABAergic synapse density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting a specific role in cortical pyramidal neurons.

It is possible that in humans there are other factors that influence disease penetrance and severity, including unique or sensitized functions for MEF2C through human evolution, human-specific genetic modifiers and/or environmental influences that increase symptom penetrance or additional cell populations where reduction in MEF2C is required. Nevertheless, our findings here indicate that MEF2C plays an essential role in early cortical synaptic development, and that reduction in MEF2C function in forebrain excitatory neurons can produce behaviors potentially relevant to multiple intellectual and developmental disorders.</p><p>Schizophrenia is a debilitating mental illness with neurodevelopmental origins that affects nearly 1% of the world’s population, and there is significant overlap in risk genes for ASDs and SCZ.

For each neuron, the threshold for GFP, GAD65 and GABARγ2 was determined from the sum of the average pixel intensity and standard deviation for each independent neuron. This thresholding method was then consistently applied across all images within the experiment. A binary mask including all pixels above the threshold was created for all channels for each image and the 'Analyze particles' function was used to determine regions of triple co-localization at least one pixel in size. To calculate synapse density, this number was divided by the area of the neuron as measured using the GFP mask minus the cell body (for dendritic synapse density) or using the GFP mask of only the cell body (for soma synapse density). Approximately 5–20 images from 2–3 separate coverslips were acquired and analyzed for each condition within an experiment for a total of at least two experiments. Synapse density values within each experiment were normalized to account for the variation in antibody staining and neuronal density from experiment to experiment. Within an experiment, the average synapse density value was obtained for the control and for experimental conditions. The normalized value of each experiment is the average experimental value divided by the average control value. For experiments involving quantification of inhibitory synapse density onto interneurons specifically, the observation of GAD65 expression in the cell body was used to identify and distinguish these interneurons from other excitatory cell types.

Five consecutive trials were conducted with each pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-5"><title>Ultrasonic vocalization recordings</title><p>Social ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) were recorded from adult mice as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ey et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, ovariectomized female mice (C57BL/6; Jackson Labs) were injected with 15-µg estradiol 48 hr prior to testing and 1-mg progesterone 4 hr before testing to induce estrous. Test mice (8–12 week old male mice) were acclimated to a clean home-cage in a sound attenuated chamber for 5 min. After acclimation, an estrous female is introduced into the holding chamber with the male test mouse, and USVs were recorded for 5 min using Avisoft UltraSoundGate equipment (UltraSoundGate 116Hb with Condenser Microphone CM16; Avisoft Bioacoustics, Germany). USVs were analyzed using Avisoft SASLab Pro (Avisoft Bioacoustics) using a 20 kHz cutoff. USVs were categorized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ey et al., 2013</xref>) by a trained experimenter blinded to genotypes to prevent bias. <italic><underline>Distress USVs</underline></italic> were recorded from juvenile mice (pups) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ey et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Scattoni et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, individual pups of both sexes were identified with long-lasting subcutaneous tattoos (green tattoo paste; Ketchum) on the paws on post-natal day 3 (P3). Pups of both sexes were recorded in a random order in a small, sound-attenuated chamber following separation from dam and littermates. USVs were recorded for 3 min on post-natal days 4, 6, and 10. USVs were analyzed and characterized as previously described for the adult USVs using Avisoft SASLab Pro (Avisoft Bioacoustics, German).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-6"><title>Sucrose preference</title><p>Test mice were singly housed and provided 2 identical ball-bearing sipper-style bottles to drink from. Mice were acclimated to the 2 bottles for 4 days, where both bottles contained water on days 1 and 3 or sucrose (or quinine) solution on days 2 and 4. On days 5–8, mice were presented with 2 bottles, one with water and one with sucrose (1% (w/v) or 4% (w/v)) or quinine (0.04% (w/v)). Daily, the consumption of water and sucrose/quinine was measured, and the bottle position was altered to avoid potential side bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Renthal et al., 2007</xref>). Data is presented as (solution consumption – water consumption) / total consumption = Preference Index.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-7"><title>Repetitive behaviors</title><p>Test mice were introduced into an activity test chamber within a photobeam activity system (MedAssociates), where 2 rows of photobeams measure the mouse’s horizontal and vertical activity. Activity was monitored for 1 hr using MedAssociates Activity Monitor (V.5) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014296">SCR_014296</ext-link>), and data is presented as time spent jumping and time spent in fine motor movements (stereotypy), as defined by non-ambulatory motor movements (thoroughly described in Activity Monitor V.5 handbook). To assess grooming and digging, mice were placed in a clean home cage with bedding, and activity was recorded for 30 min using video cameras. Time spent grooming and digging were recorded by an experimenter that was blinded to the genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-8"><title>Locomotor activity</title><p>Test mice were placed in a clean home cage with minimal bedding inside the Photobeam Activity System (San Diego Instruments), where 5 photobeams measure the mouse’s locomotor activity in 5-minute bins. Activity was monitored over the course of an hour, and data is presented as number of beam breaks/5 min during the hour of recording and total number of beam breaks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-9"><title>Rotarod test</title><p>Mice are placed on the roller in a Rotarod apparatus (Stoelting; Ugo Basile Apparatus) for a 5-minute training session with a rotation of 4 rpm, and replaced if test mouse falls during training session. After the training session, test mice are returned to the roller, where the speed steadily increases from 5–40 rpm, and the latency for the mouse to fall off the roller is recorded. Each animal receives two testing sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-10"><title>Fear conditioning test</title><p>Fear conditioning was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wehner and Radcliffe, 2004</xref>). Briefly, test mice are placed in a fear conditioning chamber (MedAssociates) and allowed to explore the arena for 2 min, after which a loud auditory stimulus (30 s; 90 dB) that co-terminates with a 2 s mild footshock (0.5 mA) is presented to the animal. This is repeated twice more, with a 1 min interval separating the tones/shocks. After 24 hr, animals are returned to the chamber, and its behavior in the context, in a new context, and with the audible tone played in a new context is recorded by a videotracking system (Video Freeze V2.6; MedAssociates) (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014574">SCR_014574</ext-link>). Data are presented as percent of time the mouse is immobile.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17-11"><title>Shock response</title><p>Shock sensitivity was measured using MedAssociates Inc Startle Reflex System and Advanced Startle software program. Mice were placed in Plexiglas and wire grid animal holders (ENV-246C) attached to a load cell platform (PHM-250) contained within a sound-attenuated chamber. Footshocks (0.1 – 0.5 mA) were delivered by Stand Alone Stimulators/Scramblers (ENV-414) connected to the wire grid floors of the animal holder. Displacements of the load cell stabilimeter were converted into arbitrary units by an analog-to-digital converter (ANL-925C Amplifier) interfaced to a personal computer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Behavior data analysis</title><p>All data are presented as mean ± SEM.

eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;MEF2C regulates cortical inhibitory and excitatory synapses and behaviors relevant to neurodevelopmental disorders&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior Editor and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript by Harrington et al., the authors analyzing the impact of loss of <italic>Mef2c</italic> on synaptic connectivity, cortical function and behavior. Using a large set of genetic, molecular, electrophysiological and behavioral experiments the authors convincingly demonstrate a quite specific function of this transcription factor in regulating neuronal network function and behavior. They found much less cortical spontaneous UP states, small decreases in excitatory drive and large increases in inhibitory drive. Those effects were in a cell autonomous fashion.</p><p>Interestingly, glutamatergic pyramidal cells (that lack MEF2C) show up to twofold increases in GABA synapse numbers, clearly arguing for a postsynaptic effect, Furthermore the effect was specific for glutamatergic neurons. MEF2C can act as repressor or activator, and the authors analysed using MEF2C mutants that its role in suppression is most relevant for the morphological phenotype seen.</p><p>Subsequent RNA seq analysis to identify potential targets of MEF2C that may mediate synapse regulation show an overrepresentation of ASD and synapse linked genes being dysregulated, and the list of genes with altered expression provide some further hints which genes may be responsible for the differential role of Glu/GABA synapse regulation, which should yield in a set of interesting follow-up experiments.</p><p>Finally, the authors perform an extensive set of behavioral experiments that round this work up to demonstrate the putative mechanistic participation of MEF2C in ASD disorders.</p><p>Overall the work is well done, and the manuscript is well written. The extension of MEF2 family functions to inhibitory synapses is novel as is the observation that it mediates these synaptic developmental effects via its repressor functions. Also the findings that MEF2C and in conclusion also the other isoforms of MEF2 have unique phenotypes is clearly interesting for the field of development and associated disorders. The effect on GABA synapse number regulation in a cell type specific manner highlights new biology provided by this study.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Related to the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, were these experiments done in culture? Please state how the input neuron was determined to be a pyramidal cell or a GABAergic interneuron, an unambiguous definition of cell type is quite critical for the conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20059.020</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Related to the experiments of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, were these experiments done in culture? Please state how the input neuron was determined to be a pyramidal cell or a GABAergic interneuron, an unambiguous definition of cell type is quite critical for the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>Yes, the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> were done in cultured primary cortical neurons generated from <italic>Mef2c</italic> WT or floxed mutant mice. The input neuron was characterized based on cellular morphology and GAD-65 immunostaining patterns (GABAergic interneurons show high GAD-65 staining on neuronal cell bodies (somas)). We have now included descriptions on how these neurons were determined in the manuscript (Results, subsection “MEF2C regulates both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a cell-autonomous manner”, second paragraph; Methods section).</p><p>Additional manuscript edit request: In our original submission, we excluded supporting data demonstrating that the MEF2C-EN and MEF2C-VP16 repressed or enhanced, respectively, MEF2-dependent transcription in the cultured cortical neurons (although this basic finding has been published by many others in various cell types). While not requested by reviewers, we request that this data and sub-figure be included in the final published manuscript. We have added the new data plots in Figure 3—figure supplement 3F, and now refer to it in the Results section (subsection “MEF2C regulates both excitatory and inhibitory synapses in a cell-autonomous manner”, last paragraph) and in the Methods section). We feel that this data strengthens the findings by confirming the functions of these MEF2 fusion proteins under our experimental conditions.</p><p>In addition, we have now uploaded our RNA-Seq data files from control and <italic>Mef2c cKO</italic> mice into the NCBI public functional genomics data repository GEO (NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus). We have added the reference to the Materials and Methods section “RNA-Seq”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
