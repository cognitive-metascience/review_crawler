In organisms with a nervous system, sensory neuronal circuits initiate many of the animals’ responses to environmental stressors, modifying behavior and physiology to adapt to the altered circumstance. However, whether and how sensory information used by the organism to predict impending danger is coupled to the protection of its future offspring is largely unknown. One conserved signaling molecule that is released in most organisms, including <italic>C. elegans</italic>, early in response to real or perceived threats is the neuromodulator serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chaouloff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaouloff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deakin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Faulkner and Deakin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>). 5-HT is a bioamine secreted by specific neurons, and in some cases by peripheral cells, to modify learning and memory, behavior, development and physiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chaouloff, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaouloff et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Deakin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Faulkner and Deakin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>), facilitating the animals’ future response to the stressor. For instance, in <italic>Aplysia</italic>, 5-HT increase mediates the encoding of memory required for habituation to a specific stressor and non-associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kandel and Schwartz, 1982</xref>). In mammals, increased 5-HT plays a dominant role in learning following social stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bauer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chaouloff et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we and others have shown that enhanced 5-HT mediates learned avoidance and activates defense responses. For example, pathogen odors increase 5-HT levels in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through the activity of chemosensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bayer and Hobert, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Song et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhang et al., 2005</xref>), and this increase in 5-HT is required for both the animal’s subsequent avoidance of pathogens, and its protection from infection. Similarly, exposure to increasing temperatures enhances 5-HT release from the serotonergic neurons (called NSM and ADF neurons) through the activity of the animal’s thermosensory neurons (called AFD neurons) and this release of 5-HT cell non-autonomously protects the animal from proteotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Gracida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iwanir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shao et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>). However, whether 5-HT released by the parent upon the detection of stress protects germ cells and future progeny from stress is not known. In fact, mammalian studies are suggestive of the opposite role for elevated levels of 5-HT that accompany chronic stress in the parent, and increased 5-HT is thought to contribute to behavioral and psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and autism in progeny through as yet poorly understood mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonnin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dowell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McKay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shah et al., 2018</xref>)—an unexpected effect given that stress-induced release of 5-HT by neurons and other 5-HT synthesizing cells is a highly conserved phenomenon.</p><p>Here, we asked whether the stress-induced release of 5-HT by maternal neurons provides any benefits to germ cells and the development of future progeny. We used <italic>C. elegans</italic> to address this question in an <italic>in vivo</italic> setting, and cultured mammalian cells to dissect the molecular pathways by which 5-HT might act and to examine the extent to which 5-HT-mediated effects are conserved. We show that in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, 5-HT released by maternal neurons upon stress allows the transcription factor heat shock factor 1 (HSF1) to shorten the time to onset of mRNA production in soon-to-be fertilized germ cells. Specifically, 5-HT promotes the post-translational modification of HSF1 by protein kinase A (PKA) allowing HSF1 to recruit the histone chaperone FACT (<underline>FA</underline>cilitates <underline>C</underline>hromatin <underline>T</underline>ranscription) and alter histone dynamics to initiate transcription. This timely activation of HSF1 in germ cells ensures their viability and future stress tolerance: embryos that arise from heat-shocked mothers contain an excess of protective mRNA and are more resilient to subsequent temperature insults as larvae. In the absence of maternal 5-HT, HSF1 activation in the germline is delayed, occurs without the recruitment of FACT, and a large fraction of embryos derived from these germ cells do not complete development, nor do they exhibit transgenerational thermotolerance. Remarkably, the intracellular signal transduction pathway by which 5-HT enables HSF1 to recruit FACT is conserved between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mammalian cells. These results provide a novel mechanism by which 5-HT signaling protects germ cells, and developmental integrity. In addition, they elucidate a molecular mechanism by which transcription response times of specific cells in a metazoan are tuned to stimulus intensity and onset.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Maternal serotonin protects the germline from the detrimental effects of temperature stress</title><p>In <italic>C. elegans</italic> the only source of 5-HT is neuronal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sze et al., 2000</xref>). Tryptophan hydroxylase, TPH-1, the rate-limiting enzyme for 5-HT synthesis, is expressed only in serotonergic neurons of hermaphrodites, and 5-HT synthesized and released by these neurons not only modifies neural circuit activity but is also distributed throughout the animal <italic>via</italic> the coelomic fluid to act on 5-HT receptors expressed by peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Curran and Chalasani, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tierney, 2001</xref>). A deletion mutant in <italic>tph-1</italic> is viable and grossly wild-type, although completely devoid of 5-HT, and therefore deficient in all responses that require 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sze et al., 2000</xref>). Therefore, to examine whether 5-HT released by maternal neurons upon the sensing of stress affected germ cells, we exposed wild-type animals and <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals to a transient and brief temperature-stress that we had previously shown enhances 5-HT release (5 min exposure to 34°C; a temperature gradient of 1°C ± 0.2°C increase per minute; see Materials and methods), and then, evaluated the survival and development of their embryos laid post-heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Examining the numbers of already-fertilized embryos, the partially cellularized oocytes in adult animals that were soon-to-be fertilized, and the numbers of embryos laid during, and following heat exposure allowed us to extrapolate that embryos laid 0–2 hr following heat treatment were the already-fertilized embryos present <italic>in utero</italic> when the mothers were subjected to heat shock, and those generated between 2 and 4 hr following maternal heat-shock would be generated from partially cellularized germ cell nuclei (oocytes) present in the syncytial germline during the transient heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–D</xref>). This was true for both wild-type and <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals, although consistent with previously published data, 5-HT is required to modulate egg laying rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>) and control <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants laid variable numbers of eggs during a given 2 hr interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of stress, all the embryos laid by wild-type as well as <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals hatched and developed into gravid adults indicating that 5-HT is not required for the survival of embryos under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Wild-type and <italic>tph-</italic>1 gravid adults themselves also survived the 5-min heat exposure with no visible signs of damage (n = 46 experiments, 4–5 animals/experiment; % survival wild-type and <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals = 100), consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kourtis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kumsta and Hansen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) that exposure to high temperatures (35–37°C) for longer durations (hours) is required to impact the survival of adult <italic>C. elegans</italic>. However, the brief exposure to temperatures of 34°C was enough to disrupt embryonic development and ~50% of embryos failed to hatch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). This was the case for embryos from wild-type or <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant mothers, irrespective of whether they were present <italic>in utero</italic> when the parents were subjected to the 5-min heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>), or whether the embryos were first laid and then subjected to a 5 min heat-shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

These embryos survived and developed into adults—but only if they were derived from wild-type animals, and not from <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, while almost all the embryos (94 ± 2%; n = 28 experiments, embryos from 4 to 5 animals/experiment) generated from germ cells resident in wild-type animals during heat shock, but fertilized subsequently, hatched to develop into gravid adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), only approximately 50% of the embryos generated similarly by germ cells in <italic>tph-1</italic> animals hatched (53 ± 2%; n = 28 experiments, embryos from 4 to 5 animals/experiment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This was surprising given the transient nature of the heat exposure and the fact that the germ cells were being fertilized and laid 2 hr following heat shock of the parents, at normal growth temperatures. Exposure of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to exogenous 5-HT causes 5-HT to be taken up into the serotonergic neurons and subsequently released, mimicking endogenous 5-HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cruz-Corchado et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jafari et al., 2011</xref>), although the kinetics of uptake and amounts released are not known. We tested whether such a treatment could rescue lethality in the <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant embryos fertilized post-heat shock. Indeed, exposure of <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant mothers to exogenous 5-HT for even only 2 hr (during the 5 min heat-shock treatment and the 2 hr until egg laying) rescued, in a significant manner, the lethality caused by the 5 min heat-shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These data suggested that the presence of 5-HT protected the soon-to-be-fertilized germ cells from transient temperature fluctuations.</p><p>To investigate how 5-HT protected germ cells we asked whether the source of 5-HT that rescued embryonic lethality was maternal or embryonic, and whether it acted through the sperm or the female germline. To distinguish between a maternal and potentially embryonic sources, we examined the fate of embryos that were heterozygous for the <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant allele and therefore capable of synthesizing 5-HT, when laid by stressed <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant mothers devoid of 5-HT. If maternal 5-HT was responsible for the protective effects, these heterozygous embryos should remain equally susceptible to heat stress, despite being able to synthesize 5-HT. This was the case and embryos heterozygous for the <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant allele, generated by mating wild-type males with <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant hermaphrodites, were equally susceptible to the 5 min heat-shock as <italic>tph-1</italic> homozygous embryos laid by stressed <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, it appeared that 5-HT required for the viability of the germ cells was of maternal origin.</p><p>Since embryos of wild-type animals were susceptible to heat if they were fertilized prior to the heat-shock, but were resistant if they were fertilized following heat-shock, we asked whether survival was conferred by some sperm-derived factors generated by the 5-min heat exposure. To answer this, we assessed whether the embryos derived from oocytes fertilized by sperm from heat-shocked males survived the 5-min heat shock. We verified that the embryos being assessed were indeed cross-fertilized with the heat-shocked sperm, and not self-fertilized by non-heat shocked sperm, by determining the sex ratios of the embryos laid by these mated mothers (see Materials and methods). Irrespective of whether the embryos were generated by oocytes fertilized by heat-shocked sperm or by oocytes fertilized by non-heat shocked sperm, ~50% of the embryos did not hatch if they were present <italic>in utero</italic> in mothers subjected to the 5-min heat-shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>These data, together, showed that embryonic development was easily disrupted by temperature fluctuations, and maternal 5-HT protected the soon-to-be fertilized germ cells from stress-induced disruption, ensuring their survival. Furthermore, these data indicated that the effects of maternal 5-HT occurred, directly or indirectly, on the partially cellularized female germ cells of the parent hermaphrodite.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Activation of HSF-1 in the germline is required to protect soon-to-be fertilized germ cells from heat stress</title><p>In all cells and organisms, a conserved and essential transcriptional response, the so-called ‘heat shock response’ counteracts the detrimental effects of heat or other stressors through the activation of the stress-inducible transcription factor, ‘heat shock factor 1’ (HSF1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anckar and Sistonen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gomez-Pastor et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vihervaara et al., 2018</xref>). This transcriptional response of HSF-1 (the sole <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSF1) was essential for the protection of germ cells upon heat exposure as, similar to <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals, nearly half the embryos (43 ± 4% n = 15 experiments, embryos from 4 to 5 animals/experiment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) generated from germ cells resident in mothers subjected to RNA interference (RNAi)-induced knock-down of HSF-1 did not hatch when the mothers were subjected to 5 min of temperature stress.

The adults with downregulated <italic>hsf-1</italic> themselves survived the 5 min heat-shock with no visible defects (n = 15 experiments, 4–5 animals/experiment). In addition, downregulation of <italic>hsf-1</italic> did not further exacerbate the effects of the loss of 5-HT on progeny survival, and 54.9 ± 2.3% of embryos laid by <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals subjected to <italic>hsf-1</italic> RNAi also did not hatch, suggesting that the two acted in the same pathway (n = 9 experiments; embryos from 4 to 5 animals/experiment; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><p>In agreement with the requirement for HSF-1 in stress-induced protection of embryos, a 5 min exposure to heat was sufficient to activate HSF-1 and increase the expression of 408 genes, enriched in Biological Processes that handle misfolded proteins, at 0.01 FDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All these genes were, either directly or indirectly, dependent on HSF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hajdu-Cronin et al., 2004</xref>) as a mutant that lacked the trans-activation domain of HSF1, previously shown to be viable but incapable of eliciting heat-induced transcriptional changes, showed no changes in gene expression upon heat shock (0.01 FDR; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Importantly, it is not known whether germline cells express protective HSF-1 targets to account for their protection. Therefore, to examine whether HSF-1 was indeed activated in the germline upon the 5 min of heat-shock, we localized <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA in the whole animals following a 5 min heat-shock using small molecule fluorescent <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (smFISH). A 5 min exposure to heat stress induced <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA predominantly in germline cells in late meiotic prophase and in very few other cells of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). These data suggested that HSF-1 targets were indeed activated in germline cells following a 5 min heat-shock. Moreover, the germline was also amongst the first tissues to induce <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA, and mRNA was visible in germ cells after 5 min of heat-shock by smFISH, whereas continued exposure to heat was required to detect <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA in other cells of the animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that <italic>hsp</italic> genes were indeed expressed in the germline upon 5 min of heat-shock, we utilized two additional methods. First, we knocked-down <italic>hsf-1</italic> in germline tissue using two different strains known to largely restrict all feeding-induced RNAi-mediated gene knock-down to germline tissue: (<italic>mkcSi13</italic> [<italic>sun-1p::rde-1::sun-1 3′UTR + unc-119</italic>(+)] <italic>II; rde-1</italic>(<italic>mkc36</italic>) <italic>V</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Zou et al., 2019</xref>) and <italic>rrf-1 (pk1417)</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sijen et al., 2001</xref>) mutants. We then examined the levels of <italic>hsp70 (F44E5.4/.5)</italic> induced following a 5 min heat shock. We used two independent mutant backgrounds because tissue-specific RNAi in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, especially in the <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutants, has been shown to be leaky and can also occur in intestinal and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kumsta and Hansen, 2012</xref>). Second, we used a strain that harbors a temperature sensitive mutation in <italic>glp-4</italic> and fails to develop a germline at the restrictive temperature of 25°C (but has a fully functional germline at 15°C) and examined its transcriptional response to a 5 min exposure to heat. This allowed us to assess the contribution of the germline to the total amount of <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA produced. Decreasing the levels of HSF-1 in the germline using the tissue-specific RNAi strains led to a marked decrease in the levels of <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA following a 5 min heat-shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In contrast, the knock-down of <italic>hsf-1</italic> in intestinal cells, using a related tissue-specific RNAi strain (<italic>rde-1(ne219) V; kbIs7</italic>) did not significantly change the levels of <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) mRNA induced upon the 5 min heat stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Similarly, abolishing the presence of germline cells using <italic>glp-4</italic> mutant animals grown at the restrictive temperature of 25°C dramatically decreased <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic>) levels following a 5 min heat-shock when compared to <italic>glp-4</italic> mutant animals that possessed functional germlines grown at permissive temperatures (15°C) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In contrast to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adelman and Lis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Spencer and Groudine, 1990</xref>), in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, RNAP pausing is rare in the absence of stress such as starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Kruesi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Maxwell et al., 2014</xref>), and that was evident in the even distribution of RNAP across three distinct regions (‘Region A/Promoter, Region B and Region C) of the <italic>hsp70</italic> genes under basal, non-heat shock conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In wild-type animals, consistent with the rapid induction of mRNA, RNAP was recruited to <italic>hsp70 (F44E5.4/.5</italic>) and <italic>hsp70</italic> (<italic>C12C8.1</italic>), peaking within 5 min of exposure to heat and remains significantly enriched at these genes upon continued heat exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). The exact pattern of enrichment differed between the two <italic>hsp70</italic> genes, for reasons that are unclear. Notwithstanding these differences, in <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants, RNAP occupancy was significantly lower than that in wild-type animals upon 5 min of heat shock (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>), but accumulated to similar or even higher levels as in wild-type animals upon continued heat exposure (15 min exposure to 34°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). Similarly, in wild-type animals HSF-1 was enriched at the promoter regions of <italic>hsp</italic> genes by 5 min of exposure of animals to heat, and remained enriched, although to lesser amounts by 15 min. In <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals HSF-1 was not recruited to these <italic>hsp</italic> gene promoters by 5 min, and HSF-1 levels at <italic>hsp</italic> promoters of <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants exposed to a 5 min heat-shock did not significantly differ from that in control non-heat shocked <italic>tph-1</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). However, by 15 min following heat-shock, HSF-1 enrichment at <italic>hsp</italic> promoters in <italic>tph-1</italic> mutant animals was similar to that in wild-type animals after a 5 min heat shock, suggesting that the binding of HSF-1 to its promoter was delayed in the absence of 5-HT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). The latter was evaluated by ChIP-qPCR using animals that expressed endogenous HSF-1 tagged at the C-terminus with 3X FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

This occurs by the PKA-dependent phosphorylation of HSF-1 which enables it to recruit FACT, displace nucleosomes and promote RNAP transcription though chromatin. The activation of HSF-1 by PKA signaling occurs in the germline, as knocking down <italic>kin-1</italic> only in germ cells is enough to compromise <italic>hsp</italic> mRNA expression upon the 5 min heat-shock. Although we do not show it, we hypothesize that 5-HT likely acts directly on the germline cells upon release from neurons due to its ability to diffuse through the coelomic fluid and bind 5-HT receptors in the germline. However, it is also possible that 5-HT binds to receptor on other tissues, which in turn secrete signals to activate PKA in the germline and accelerate HSF1-dependent transcription. In either case, this leads to enhanced thermotolerance of the progeny of heat-shocked mothers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>One of the more recent developments in the regulation of stress responses has been the demonstration that in <italic>C. elegans</italic> the activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ooi and Prahlad, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Prahlad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tatum et al., 2015</xref>), endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Taylor and Dillin, 2013</xref>) and mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Berendzen et al., 2016</xref>) are controlled cell non-autonomously by the nervous system. However, the mechanism by which this occurs was not known; neither was it clear whether such regulatory control was conserved. Here, we show that 5-HT released from maternal neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> upon stress allows the information of the stress stimulus to be linked to the onset of protective HSF1-dependent transcription in germ cells, ensuring their survival upon fertilization and enhanced stress tolerance as larvae. 5-HT-mediates these effects by enabling HSF-1 to modify chromatin through the activity of the histone chaperone FACT and accelerate the onset of transcription by displacing histones. Thus, 5-HT release by neurons, in effect, sets the level of the physiological stimulus required to activate a transcriptional response amongst the germline nuclei. Remarkably, maternal 5-HT release upon stress causes an increase in <italic>hsp70</italic> mRNA levels in embryos and transgenerational stress tolerance in progeny. Given the role of neuronal 5-HT in modulating memory and learning these studies have wide-ranging implications for the effects on maternal experience on progeny physiology.</p><p>The exact mechanism by which embryos have more <italic>hsp</italic> mRNA was not explored; however, this is consistent with published observations that even if oocytes are not transcriptionally competent, pachytene nuclei can act as nurse cells to provide material to uncellularized oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wolke et al., 2007</xref>) to be subsequently utilized by embryos. It is possible that besides <italic>hsps,</italic> 5-HT also stimulates the packaging of other mRNAs into soon-to be fertilized embryos to promote their survival. This remains to be determined. In mammalian cells, 5-HT activates HSF1 through the 5-HT4 receptor. <italic>C. elegans</italic> do not possess a direct ortholog of 5-HT4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Curran and Chalasani, 2012</xref>) and the receptor required to activate PKA in the germline upon heat shock remains to be identified. One possible receptor is the SER-7, which although has not been localized to the germline, controls numerous aspects of egg-laying and oocyte maturation, acting through a Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled signaling pathways to promote PKA-dependent phosphorylation of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Cheng et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Curran and Chalasani, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our data also show that for unknown reasons, fertilized <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos are exquisitely vulnerable to even transient temperature fluctuations. Lowering the threshold of transcription onset in the germline by 5-HT is therefore critical to protect development, and indeed the germline is amongst the first tissues to express protective <italic>hsp70s</italic>. Across tissues and during development, transcriptional responses display characteristic dynamics and thresholds of activation that are linked to their biological function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batulan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kotas and Medzhitov, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Vihervaara et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In addition transcriptional responses change, dynamically and swiftly, with the continued presence of the stressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>). Here, we provide a molecular mechanism by which thresholds for activation of transcription upon stress can be set to different levels in different tissues <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>The essential aspects of the 5-HT signaling pathway are conserved in mammalian neurons. The involvement of PKA in 5-HT dependent HSF1 activation is intriguing given the role of both 5-HT and PKA in cellular plasticity. It is therefore tempting to speculate that the ability to modulate transcriptional dynamics through modifying chromatin accessibility may be a more general function of 5-HT in neurodevelopment and as a neuromodulator, allowing it to steer developmental timing and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonnin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Dowell et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Iwanir et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">McKay, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Puscheck et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, this ability to functionally activate HSF1 in mammalian neurons and human cells, in the absence of proteotoxicity, through activation of 5HT4 receptors could have implications for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases where HSF1 is protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lee et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Westerheide and Morimoto, 2005</xref>).</p><p>Why might 5-HT, an abundant neuromodulator and signaling molecule that portends growth, also modulate stress responsiveness of germ cells? The answer to this question may be limited by our understanding of what precisely constitutes ‘stress’ for different cells. Germ cells typically consist of ‘poised’ chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Choate and Danko, 2016</xref>) bearing both activation and repressive histone marks, which potentially can resolve into growth-related and ‘active’, or stress-related and ‘repressed’ antagonistic gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">López-Maury et al., 2008</xref>). Across the animal kingdom, 5-HT release can signal stress or growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Berger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chaouloff, 2002</xref>). We postulate that the ability of 5-HT to modulate chromatin accessibility in response to environmental input may allow it to function as a switch at the nexus of these essential programs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Stacks were collapsed to generate a composite image, split to the respective single channel images using the Split Channels command under ‘Image/Color/Split Channels’. The image was thresholded using ‘Image/Adjust/Threshold’ Plugin using the MaxEntropy feature which is an automatic thresholding method that uses the entropy of the histogram of the image to generate the threshold. The number of puncta were counted manually using the multi-point tool. This method worked optimally for counting the number of smFISH signals which remained discrete. However, because puncta in nuclei in the head and intestine began to merge with each other in projected confocal slices by 15 min of heat shock, we counted them in separate planes. Separately the background fluorescence in control animals and in the intestine were measured in a segmented region of the image using the Analyze/Measure in ImageJ, to ensure that we were not missing diffuse increases in signal between the different conditions. These methods do not resolve individual RNA molecules, but can be used to quantify the number of discrete point-signals from the hybridization and compare relative differences. Subsequently a program in Windows C++ was written and is currently used to streamline the counting. This has confirmed our manually curated data, and the source code of this program is available upon request.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Immunofluorescence staining of dissected gonads</title><p>Immunostaining of dissected gonads of <italic>C. elegans</italic> was performed to visualize HSF-1::FLAG in the germline.

RNA extraction was conducted according to previously published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chikka et al., 2016</xref>). Briefly, RNA samples were harvested in 50 µl of Trizol (catalog no. 400753, Life Technologies) and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen. For RNA extraction from embryos, the embryos were subjected to freeze-thaw cycles five times. The following steps were carried out immediately after snap-freezing or samples were stored at −80°C. Samples were thawed on ice and 200 µl of Trizol was added, followed by brief vortexing at room temperature. Samples were then vortexed at 4°C for at least 45 min to lyse the worms completely or lysed using a Precellys 24 homogenizer (Bertin Corp.) according to manufacturer’s protocol. RNA was then purified as detailed in the manufacturer’s protocol with appropriate volumes of reagents modified to 250 µl of Trizol. For RNA extraction from cultured cells and mouse cortical neurons, cells/neurons were washed with 1X PBS and then harvested in 800 µl of Trizol and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. RNA was extracted according to manufacturer’s protocol with appropriate volumes of reagents modified to 800 µl of Trizol. The RNA pellet was dissolved in 17 µl of RNase-free water. The purified RNA was then treated with deoxyribonuclease using the TURBO DNA-free kit (catalog no. AM1907, Life Technologies) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. In case of cultured cells and cortical neurons, 1 µg of total RNA was used for complementary DNA (cDNA) synthesis. cDNA was generated by using the iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit (catalog no. 170–8891, Bio-Rad). qRT-PCR was performed using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green I Master Mix (catalog no. 04887352001, Roche) in LightCycler 480 (Roche) or QuantStudio 3 Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a 10 µl sample volume, in a 96-well white plate (catalog no. 04729692001, Roche).

Four hundred 1-day-old animals per condition (control or heat shock at 34°C for 5 or 15 min) were obtained by washing off two plates of bleach hatched animals, washed with 1X PBS (pH 7.4), and cross-linked with freshly prepared 2% formaldehyde (catalog no. 252549, Sigma Aldrich) at room temperature for 10 min.

The primers used for ChIP experiments, and the expected amplicon sizes are as follows:</p><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable5" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Gene name</th><th valign="top">Position</th><th valign="top">Forward primer (5’−3’)</th><th valign="top">Reverse primer (5’−3’)</th><th valign="top">Amplicon size</th><th valign="top">Antibody used</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><italic>C12C8.1</italic></td><td valign="top">Promoter</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CTCAGGCAGTGGAAGAACTAAA</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTATACGTTCCTCTGGCATCTTC</named-content></td><td valign="top">88 bp</td><td valign="top">FLAG (HSF1-FLAG), H3, HA (HMG-3-HA)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic></td><td valign="top">Promoter</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ATACTACCCGAATCCCAGCC</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCAACAGAGACGCAGATTGT</named-content></td><td valign="top">150 bp</td><td valign="top">FLAG (HSF1-FLAG), H3, HA (HMG-3-HA), <break/>RNA polymerase II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>C12C8.1</italic></td><td valign="top">Region A</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ATCGACTTGGGTACTACGTACTC</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CTTGTTCCCTTCGGAGTTCG</named-content></td><td valign="top">161 bp</td><td valign="top">RNA polymerase II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>syp-1</italic></td><td valign="top">Promoter</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CAACAAAACGCGCTCCATT</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GGAGGCCGCAAACACC</named-content></td><td valign="top">80 bp</td><td valign="top">FLAG (HSF1-FLAG)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>C12C8.1</italic></td><td valign="top">Region B</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TGTACTTGGGCATTCTGTACGG</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCATTGAGTCCAGCAATAGTAGC</named-content></td><td valign="top">108 bp</td><td valign="top">RNA polymerase II, H3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>C12C8.1</italic></td><td valign="top">Region C</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ACAATTCGCAATGAGAAGGGACG</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GCATCTTCTGCTGATAACAGTGATC</named-content></td><td valign="top">191 bp</td><td valign="top">RNA polymerase II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic></td><td valign="top">Region B</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TGATCTTCGATCTCGGAGGAGG</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCACAAGCAGTTCGGAGACG</named-content></td><td valign="top">220 bp</td><td valign="top">RNA polymerase II, H3</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic></td><td valign="top">Region C</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TTGATGAAACACTTCGTTGGTTGG</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCCAGCAGTTCCAGGATTTC</named-content></td><td valign="top">170 bp</td><td valign="top">RNA polymerase II</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>C12C8.1</italic></td><td valign="top">TSS</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ACGTACTCATGTGTCGGTAT</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCTTCTTCCAGTTTACATAATCCT</named-content></td><td valign="top">92 bp</td><td valign="top">H3, HA (HMG-3-HA)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic></td><td valign="top">TSS</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">TAAAAGGGCTGGGATTCGGG</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">ACCGAGGTCGATACCAATAGC</named-content></td><td valign="top">118 bp</td><td valign="top">H3, HA (HMG-3-HA)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>C12C8.1</italic></td><td valign="top">TSS-50</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">AACTCAAATCTTATGCAGAAT</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CGTAGTACCCAAGTCGATTCCA</named-content></td><td valign="top">119 bp</td><td valign="top">HA (HMG-3-HA)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>F44E5.4/.5</italic></td><td valign="top">TSS-50</td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">GTCGGCCGTCTCTTTCTCTT</named-content></td><td valign="top"><named-content content-type="sequence">CCCGAATCCCAGCCCTTTT</named-content></td><td valign="top">157 bp</td><td valign="top">HA (HMG-3-HA)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Each ‘experiment’ refers to a biological repeat. No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size. The experiments were not randomized. A minimum of three independent experiments (starting from independent parent populations of <italic>C. elegans</italic>) were conducted for all data points. However, many experiments were repeated in multiple contexts and n numbers, and mean values reflect all repeats. All qPCR experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic> were conducted on 30–200 animals per experiment. All ChIP-qPCR experiments were conducted on 400 animals per sample per experiment. For pairwise comparisons such as for qRT-PCR data and progeny hatching, significance was tested using Paired Student’s t tests (assumptions of parametric distributions were first tested and were fulfilled). For all ChIP-qPCR experiments where multiple comparisons were made, significance was tested using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison correction. Data are indicated as mean ± standard error. p values are indicated as follows: <sup>∗</sup>p&lt;0.05, <sup>∗∗</sup>p&lt;0.01, <sup>∗∗∗</sup>p&lt;0.001. FDR calculations for the RNAseq data set are described in the RNA-seq section of the Methods.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the members of VP laboratory, Dr. Sarit Smolikove, Dr. Bin He, Dr. Chris Stipp and Dr. Tali Gidalevitz for their helpful comments, Kat Dvorak, Matthew Wheat, Dr. Rachel Reichman and Gery Hehman for technical help, and Dr. Smolikove for advice with CRISPR/Cas9.

The authors have made the interesting observation that a 5 min heat shock of <italic>C. elegans</italic> mothers promotes progeny survival in the next generation. This effect occurs via serotonin signaling from the mothers, which activates HSF1 in the germline. They show that the histone chaperone FACT is involved in this process, and that in cultured mammalian cells, serotonin phosphorylates PKA which in turn recruits HSF1. Some aspects of the work are rigorous, however the following points would need to be addressed to justify the claim that the authors have &quot;elucidated a molecular mechanism by which transcriptional response times of specific cells are tuned to stimulus intensity and onset&quot;. Additionally there are some open questions regarding the mechanism of serotonin action in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that must be addressed.</p><p>1) One of the arguments made in the paper is that serotonin is a stress signal. That is partially true. There is an entire body of evidence, from many different labs, that it is also an indicator of food availability. The different serotonergic neurons (ADF, NSM, HSM) play different roles in sensing stress, food availability, coordinating reproduction to the availability of food, and actual food entering the pharynx. For their phenotypes, the authors would need to conduct necessity and sufficiency experiments (selective <italic>tph-1</italic> depletion and rescue) to identify which serotonergic neurons drive their germline phenotype. The answer to this question is critical, without which the relevance of the 5 min 34 degree heat shock remains unclear (more on this below), and is experimentally feasible, and is a standard in the field.</p><p>2) What is the epistasis between <italic>tph-1</italic> and <italic>hsf-1</italic>? That is, what happens to viability upon heat shock when they are removed in combination? Figure 1.</p><p>3) It is also somewhat puzzling that loss of either <italic>tph-1</italic> or <italic>hsf-1</italic> still retains 50% viability (Figure 1). What does this mean? That this pathway is one factor amongst others in every germline cell that play an equally relevant role, or that half the embryos don't require either <italic>tph-1</italic> or <italic>hsf-1</italic>? It would be good to resolve these alternative hypotheses experimentally. Perhaps ChIP seq (rather than ChIP qPCR) would address this question, but other approaches would also be valid as long as they are experimental.</p><p>4) What does it mean for this particular type of heat shock response to be present at 5 minutes, but gone at 15 minutes? While potentially interesting, the significance of this is totally unclear. Without addressing this point, the relevance of the experimental manipulation comes into question.</p><p>5) In the worm, which serotonin receptor/s is involved? The authors imply (the heterozygote experiment is clever) that a cell-non-autonomous mechanism is at play. Maternal serotonin neurons control an HSF1 mediated germline protective response. There are 2 possibilities: direct (i.e. there is a serotonin receptor on the germline cells that detects neuronally released serotonin), and indirect (serotonin works on a receptor somewhere else, which triggers a systemic or germline-specific response). This fundamental question can be experimentally addressed in a variety of tractable ways using tools and resources that are available. Without a deeper investigation into how serotonin is working, the relevance and significance are again thrown into question.</p><p>6) There are a few typographical errors throughout.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Das and colleagues describe a new, evolutionary conserved role of serotonin signaling in which neuronal signals act to protect future offspring from heat stress. They show that serotonin signals elicited by stress control transcription in germ cells by activating HSF-1, which in turn recruits the histone chaperone FACT. This cascade induces transcription of protective genes that increase embryo survival but only if it was exposed to maternal serotonin to activate the protective response. This is a very interesting story and rigorously done. I enjoyed reading it.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work identifies a mechanism by which short term heat shock influences germline transcription, resulting in increased embryonic viability and transgenerational increase in thermotolerance. This mechanism seems to operate through the release of serotonin, leading to activation of PKA and HSF-1 in the germline, and the recruitment of a component of the histone chaperone FACT complex, which results in histone displacement. The study also demonstrates the conservation of some of these findings, showing that in mammalian neurons serotonin can also induce transcriptional up regulation of chaperone genes.</p><p>Overall, the range of techniques and approaches used is impressive, and the story presented is complex and extensive. The idea of a mechanism that acts so swiftly to protect the germline upon heat stress is very interesting – and, in fact, very surprising, given the transient (5 minute) nature of the stress, and the fact that animals in such a short duration of elevated temperature are likely to undergo only a relatively small increase in temperature themselves. However, the authors provide a large amount of experimental evidence to support this idea.</p><p>Given the large amount of data provided I don't think it is appropriate to suggest many extra experiments. There were a few more substantial issues, however, that are worth raising here.</p><p>1) The experiments that use qPCR to measure chaperone levels appear to rely on only one internal control gene, <italic>pmp-3</italic>. Using just one gene, rather than a geometric mean of multiple genes, can create misleading results if the expression levels of that gene are altered under the conditions used (heat stress, for example). If they are going to use this single control gene, do the authors have evidence that <italic>pmp-3</italic> expression levels do not substantially change upon heat stress, <italic>hsf-1</italic> knockdown, etc?</p><p>2) The mammalian cell data relies upon the use of inhibitors to suppress the activity of serotonin receptors, and PKA. Given that inhibitors frequently have non-specific effects, this data would be more convincing if confirmed using siRNA against the 5-HT4 receptor and PKA.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55246.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers in general are pleased with the conceptual advances of the findings and the high quality of the data.

The optogenetics experiments, and our previous publication (Tatum et al., 2015) address, in part, the question of which neurons are involved in stress regulation: ChR2 is expressed under a modified <italic>tph-1</italic> promoter only in the ADF and NSM neurons and optogenetically exciting these neurons is sufficient to activate HSF-1 in a manner dependent on FACT (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). However, these are the same neurons involved in feeding and foraging, implying that the separation of the two functions may be more complex and not simply a function of which neurons are active. The question is part of our ongoing research, but we feel answering this is beyond the scope of the current studies. We have included a sentence in the manuscript to clarify which neurons are excited in the optogenetics experiment (subsection “Serotonin-dependent recruitment of FACT to displace histones hastens the onset of transcription”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) What is the epistasis between tph-1 and hsf-1? That is, what happens to viability upon heat shock when they are removed in combination? Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included experiments to address this important question, and show that <italic>hsf-1</italic> knock-down does not exacerbate/change the effects of loss of 5-HT, suggesting that the two are part of the same genetic pathway (Figure 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is also somewhat puzzling that loss of either tph-1 or hsf-1 still retains 50% viability (Figure 1). What does this mean? That this pathway is one factor amongst others in every germline cell that play an equally relevant role, or that half the embryos don't require either tph-1 or hsf-1? It would be good to resolve these alternative hypotheses experimentally. Perhaps ChIP seq (rather than ChIP qPCR) would address this question, but other approaches would also be valid as long as they are experimental.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point and it is possible that serotonin release is one amongst other redundant pathways that protect progeny. We are currently investigating why and when embryos die, but the inclusion of more details, we think, is beyond the scope of this study. Our data also show that it isn’t that 50% of the <italic>tph-1</italic> embryos require 5-HT or HSF-1: more die with lengthier heat exposure. In addition, germ cells in wild-type animals are also susceptible to heat stress, if the heat-exposure extends to 15 minutes. The difference is that in wild-type animal, a longer exposure of mothers to heat stress is required to cause embryonic death at numbers comparable to that in <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants. Upon 5 min of heat shock of parents, viability of post-HS fertilized wild-type embryos=94 ± 2 % while that of <italic>tph-1</italic>=53 ± 2%. Upon 15 min of heat shock of parents: N2 viability=33 ± 5 % and <italic>tph-1</italic> viability=9 ± 1.5 %.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What does it mean for this particular type of heat shock response to be present at 5 minutes, but gone at 15 minutes? While potentially interesting, the significance of this is totally unclear. Without addressing this point, the relevance of the experimental manipulation comes into question.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for an opportunity to clarify this point. We have now included a sentence in the Discussion explicitly highlighting the existence of kinetic changes during the course of a heat exposure of cells and animals (which these data as well as other published studies in the field support). Our interpretation of our data is that during 5 minutes, 5-HT accelerates the onset of HSF-1 dependent transcription. We detect this as a difference in expression levels of HSF-1 transcription, the recruitment of a subunit of the FACT complex to the transcribed genes, germ cell protection and an intergenerational increase in resilience to heat stress. This ‘quick-start’, so to speak, that is mediated by perception of the environment allows the animal to better protect its progeny from the detrimental effects of heat. Without serotonin the animal still is able to activate HSF-1 (by 15 minutes), but because this activation occurs later it is unable to mitigate the detrimental effects of heat stress that, likely, have already begun to occur.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the worm, which serotonin receptor/s is involved? The authors imply (the heterozygote experiment is clever) that a cell-non-autonomous mechanism is at play. Maternal serotonin neurons control an HSF1 mediated germline protective response. There are 2 possibilities: direct (i.e. there is a serotonin receptor on the germline cells that detects neuronally released serotonin), and indirect (serotonin works on a receptor somewhere else, which triggers a systemic or germline-specific response). This fundamental question can be experimentally addressed in a variety of tractable ways using tools and resources that are available. Without a deeper investigation into how serotonin is working, the relevance and significance are again thrown into question.</p></disp-quote><p>Our experiments do not distinguish between the two possibilities. We have now added a sentence explicitly stating that (subsection “Serotonin-induced PKA-activation is a conserved signaling pathway that enables HSF1 to recruit FACT”). We had shown (Tatum et al., 2015 ) that some of the effects of serotonin on HSF1 in the gonad occur through 5-HT2 and we have unpublished RNA smFISH data to show that 5-HT2 mRNA is present in gonadal sheath cells. However, 5HT2 does not act through cAMP/ PKA. Therefore more needs to be done to understand the distribution and activity of 5-HT receptors in <italic>C. elegans</italic> somatic tissues. We think the best way to do this is by tagging endogenous receptors, for obvious functional reasons, but also because using different promoter lengths to express reporters has shown different expression patterns in vivo. We intend to pursue this question in a rigorous manner in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) There are a few typographical errors throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We believe we have corrected them.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Das and colleagues describe a new, evolutionary conserved role of serotonin signaling in which neuronal signals act to protect future offspring from heat stress. They show that serotonin signals elicited by stress control transcription in germ cells by activating HSF-1, which in turn recruits the histone chaperone FACT. This cascade induces transcription of protective genes that increase embryo survival but only if it was exposed to maternal serotonin to activate the protective response. This is a very interesting story and rigorously done. I enjoyed reading.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This work identifies a mechanism by which short term heat shock influences germline transcription, resulting in increased embryonic viability and transgenerational increase in thermotolerance. This mechanism seems to operate through the release of serotonin, leading to activation of PKA and HSF-1 in the germline, and the recruitment of a component of the histone chaperone FACT complex, which results in histone displacement. The study also demonstrates the conservation of some of these findings, showing that in mammalian neurons serotonin can also induce transcriptional up regulation of chaperone genes.</p><p>Overall, the range of techniques and approaches used is impressive, and the story presented is complex and extensive. The idea of a mechanism that acts so swiftly to protect the germline upon heat stress is very interesting – and, in fact, very surprising, given the transient (5 minute) nature of the stress, and the fact that animals in such a short duration of elevated temperature are likely to undergo only a relatively small increase in temperature themselves. However, the authors provide a large amount of experimental evidence to support this idea.</p><p>Given the large amount of data provided I don't think it is appropriate to suggest many extra experiments. There were a few more substantial issues, however, that are worth raising here.</p><p>1) The experiments that use qPCR to measure chaperone levels appear to rely on only one internal control gene, pmp-3. Using just one gene, rather than a geometric mean of multiple genes, can create misleading results if the expression levels of that gene are altered under the conditions used (heat stress, for example). If they are going to use this single control gene, do the authors have evidence that pmp-3 expression levels do not substantially change upon heat stress, hsf-1 knockdown, etc?</p></disp-quote><p>Prior to these studies our lab had confronted this problem because (a) we wanted to ensure that the expression levels of the internal control does not change with heat shock, (b) we were worried that the numbers of embryos in utero would vary stochastically (especially upon heat shock), and knowing that hsps and other inducible genes are not expressed during early embryogenesis, but an internal control such as actin would be detectable, we were worried that the choice of the internal control could aberrantly report on relative changes and (c) we wanted to match the efficiency of PCR amplification between hsps (which, despite being highly expressed upon stress, amplify with Ct values lower than many of the commonly used internal controls such as actin). This led to our choice of four different internal controls, <italic>pmp-3</italic> which was reported to remain steady across numerous manipulations, <italic>syp-1</italic>, a gene that encodes a synaptonemal complex protein and therefore is expressed only in the adult and not in embryos, and actin and <italic>gpd-3</italic>, which are more constitutively expressed and commonly used. We include data showing that <italic>pmp-3</italic> levels do not change upon heat-stress relative to <italic>syp-1</italic>, actin and <italic>gpd-3</italic>. We therefore chose to use <italic>pmp-3</italic> for all our studies. We have included data in the Materials and methods section showing that <italic>pmp-3</italic> levels do not change with heat-shock with respect to three other internal controls (subsection “RNA extraction and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The mammalian cell data relies upon the use of inhibitors to suppress the activity of serotonin receptors, and PKA. Given that inhibitors frequently have non-specific effects, this data would be more convincing if confirmed using siRNA against the 5-HT4 receptor and PKA.</p></disp-quote><p>In the course of our experiments we saw that a 24 hour knock-down of PKA was detrimental to cell survival and growth, and that is why we opted to use a fast-acting chemical inhibitor, applied transiently. The PKA inhibitor used, H89, has been used in previous published studies on HSF1 to demonstrate that the S320 phosphorylation site on HSF1 is because of PKA activity. We show in our experiments that treatment with H89 decreases S320 phosphorylation, and therefore is acting as expected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
