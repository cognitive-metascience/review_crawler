Intriguingly, both visible gait alterations and neuroanatomical abnormalities throughout the brain differ across mutants. We previously used the LocoMouse system to quantify specific deficits in locomotor coordination in mildly ataxic <italic>Purkinje cell degeneration</italic> mice (<italic>pcd;</italic> Machado et al., 2015). Here, we analyze the locomotor behavior of severely ataxic <italic>reeler</italic> mutants and compare and contrast it with that of <italic>pcd</italic>. Despite clearly visible gait differences, direct comparison of locomotor kinematics and linear discriminant analysis reveal a surprisingly similar pattern of impairments in multijoint, interlimb, and whole-body coordination in the two mutants. These findings capture both shared and specific signatures of gait ataxia and provide a quantitative foundation for mapping specific locomotor impairments onto distinct neuropathologies in mice.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>locomotion</kwd><kwd>ataxia</kwd><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>computational ethology</kwd><kwd>motor coordination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Starting Grant 640093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>International Early Career Scientist 55007413</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FCT-PTDC/MED-NEU/30890/2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carey</surname><given-names>Megan R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/51210/2010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Machado</surname><given-names>Ana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BPD/119404/2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Marques</surname><given-names>Hugo G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PD/BD/141643/2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Duarte</surname><given-names>Diogo F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001871</institution-id><institution>Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFRH/BD/86265/2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Darmohray</surname><given-names>Dana M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>LocoMouse analysis of severely ataxic reeler mutant mice reveals fundamental features of locomotor ataxia and provides a roadmap for linking high-dimensional behavioral phenotyping to alterations in underlying neural circuits.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Visibly ataxic mouse mutants exhibit varying patterns of neuropathology throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cendelin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fortier et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goldowitz et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mullen et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walter et al., 2006</xref>). Although their motor coordination deficits are generally attributed to abnormal cell patterning within the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arshavsky et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orlovsky et al., 1999</xref>), these lines have distinct patterning defects within the cerebellum, varying degrees of extracerebellar involvement, and differences in age of onset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cendelin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2019</xref>). The nature of the motor deficits exhibited by these mice also varies, and can often be distinguished by trained observers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brooks and Dunnett, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoogland et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schiffmann et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stroobants et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vinueza Veloz et al., 2015</xref>).

A quantitative understanding of the specific nature of gait ataxia in mutants with well-described abnormalities in circuit architecture could provide important clues into neural mechanisms of motor coordination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson and Perona, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown and de Bivort, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darmohray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Datta et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kiehn, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morton and Bastian, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Powell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sarnaik and Raman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Udo et al., 1980</xref>).</p><p>We previously used the LocoMouse system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>) to analyze the locomotor coordination of mildly ataxic <italic>Purkinje cell degeneration</italic> (<italic>pcd</italic>) mice, in which neural degeneration, particularly early in postnatal development, is largely restricted to cerebellar Purkinje cells, effectively disconnecting the output of the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fernandez-Gonzalez et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Le Marec and Lalonde, 1997</xref>).

We further found that the tail movements of <italic>pcd</italic> mice reflected the passive consequences of limb movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). However, it remained unclear to what extent these features represented fundamental features of cerebellar ataxia, or were specific to <italic>pcd</italic> mice.</p><p><italic>Reeler</italic> mice are a classic ataxic mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cendelin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curran and D'Arcangelo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Arcangelo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Arcangelo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Falconer, 1951</xref>) with an autosomal recessive mutation in the reelin gene, which is important for neural cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beckers et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hack et al., 2002</xref>). Its loss causes several defects, in particular aberrant localization of neurons and failure of neuronal layer formation. Several brain regions are affected, including cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamburgh, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Terashima et al., 1983</xref>), hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanfield et al., 1979</xref>), neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mikoshiba et al., 1980</xref>), inferior olive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blatt and Eisenman, 1988</xref>) and substantia nigra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>). Neuropathology in these mice is particularly striking within the cerebellum, where severe irregularities in cellular localization are also associated with corresponding aberrant synaptic connectivity between cell types, abnormal foliation, and hypoplasia. Although their locomotor kinematics and whole-body coordination have not been reported, homozygous <italic>reeler</italic> mutants have been described as having a severely ataxic, ‘reeling’ gait, with difficulties in maintaining their hindquarters upright (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cendelin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lalonde et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2019</xref>). Like most ataxic mutants, <italic>reelers</italic> also exhibit poor performance in rotarod, stationary beam and water maze tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lalonde et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>Thus, <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice share grossly abnormal cerebellar circuitry, but exhibit marked differences in synaptic connectivity within the cerebellum and across the brain. We wondered whether these similarities and differences on the anatomical level might be associated with similarly shared and distinct features of motor behavior. Here we analyze the locomotor behavior of <italic>reeler</italic> mutants and compare it quantitatively to that of the more mildly ataxic <italic>pcd</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). Detailed comparison of locomotor kinematics and linear discriminant analysis reveals both shared and distinct features of gait ataxia in these two mutants. This approach provides a quantitative foundation for mapping specific locomotor impairments onto distinct neuropathologies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Reeler</italic> mice have impaired hindlimb control and exhibit increased variability of movement</title><p><italic>Reeler</italic> mice exhibited visible and severe gait ataxia when walking on the LocoMouse setup (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

First, the equations we previously generated with mixed-effects linear models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>) to predict stride parameters based on walking speed and body size were able to accurately predict the individual stride parameters (including stride length, cadence, stance duration) of <italic>reeler</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Moreover, the continuous forward trajectories of <italic>reeler</italic> front paws were similar to those of size-matched controls, across walking speeds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, top). Notably, the forward trajectories of <italic>reeler</italic> <bold>hind</bold> paws exhibited lower forward velocities compared to size and speed-matched controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, bottom), and they had accompanying increases in swing duration (from size-matched controls = 98.78 ± 6.48 ms to <italic>reeler</italic> = 114.72 ± 8.21 ms). Comparison of 3D trajectories revealed clear differences between <italic>reeler</italic> and control mice in both the side-to-side and the vertical paw movements of both front and hind paws (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–K</xref>).

One possible explanation for the differences in relative tail and nose phasing between <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) is that the shift of supports to front paws leads to the loss of a front-limb steering component in <italic>reeler</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).

The locomotor features contributing most strongly to these two linear discriminants thus correspond to the shared (LD1) and distinct (LD2) features of ataxia in <italic>reeler</italic> and <italic>pcd</italic> mice.</p><p>Inspection of the contributions of each gait parameter to the two LDs reveals that LD1, which separates controls from ataxic mutants, is highly influenced by variables representing 3D paw trajectories and interlimb and whole-body coordination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, x-axis bar graph). The features contributing most strongly to LD2, which captured the differences in locomotor phenotype between the two mutants, included measurements of hindpaw movement (and subsequent changes in support patterns), variability, and relative phase of tail/nose movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, y-axis bar graph). Most variables relating to the averaged forward motion of individual limbs, which are largely spared in both mutants, do not strongly influence either LD.</p><p>The LDA provides a quantitative summary that captures the essential elements of the similarities and differences in locomotor behavior across groups of mice. In so doing, it shows that a high-dimensional set of gait parameters contains a subspace of mixed features in which multiple neuropathologies are represented behaviorally. The results, together with our previous description of the locomotor phenotype of <italic>pcd</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>), reveal multijoint, interlimb, and whole-body coordination as shared, and possibly fundamental, features of locomotor ataxia.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>When assessing motor coordination deficits in mice there is often a tradeoff between specificity and interpretability. For example, approaches such as rotarod testing provide measurable and intuitive low dimensional outputs, but lack specificity. Others, such as the CatWalk system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gabriel et al., 2009</xref>) can provide many detailed measurements of locomotor behavior, but their meaning is not always readily apparent. With LocoMouse we have tried to provide both a comprehensive, quantitative description of locomotor behavior as well as a conceptual framework within which to interpret that high-dimensional data.</p><p>Here we analyzed the locomotor behavior of severely ataxic <italic>reeler</italic> mice and quantitatively compared it with that of <italic>Purkinje cell degeneration</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). Detailed comparison of locomotor kinematics and linear discriminant analysis revealed both shared and distinct features of gait ataxia in the two mouse lines. Although the generality of the conclusions that can be reached from the analysis of two mutants is of course limited, the approach described here provides a comprehensive and quantitative way to map complex patterns of locomotor features onto partially overlapping neuropathologies. Extending it to additional models and manipulations could enable association of specific movement features with increasingly precise alterations in underlying neural circuits.</p><p>Our first finding lies in capturing specific quantitative differences in gait ataxia between <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice. Rather than simple differences in the level of severity in the same set of affected features, the visible gait differences in the two mutants (captured by the second linear discriminant) appear to stem specifically from an increase in movement variability and additional hindlimb involvement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cendelin, 2014</xref>) in <italic>reelers</italic>. As a likely consequence of those deficits, analysis of support patterns and nose and tail movements suggests that <italic>reelers</italic>, unlike controls and <italic>pcd</italic>, use their front paws as their main supports while walking. This difference in support patterns fully accounts for differences in tail movements observed in the two mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It could also explain the inability of <italic>reeler</italic>s to walk in a straight line (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), likely because the front limbs are unable to provide both support and steering control to keep the body moving forward. Thus, while all of these features in combination contribute to the ability of human observers to visually distinguish the overall differences in walking patterns in the two mice, the quantitative LocoMouse analysis is able to distill them down to reveal fundamental underlying alterations in variability and hindlimb control.</p><p>Capturing the essential differences in locomotor control between ataxic phenotypes provides a necessary starting point for understanding the contributions of individual circuit elements to this complex, whole-body behavior. In <italic>pcd</italic>, the main anatomical phenotype is cerebellar, with striking degeneration of Purkinje cells that effectively removes cerebellar cortical input to the cerebellar nuclei. In contrast, <italic>reeler</italic> mice exhibit aberrant cell localization throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Terashima et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stanfield et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mikoshiba et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Blatt and Eisenman, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang et al., 2010</xref>), which could also contribute to their gait abnormalities. Moreover, in <italic>reeler,</italic> abnormal cell migration during development results in aberrant circuit wiring that alters, rather than removes, Purkinje cell activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dupont et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Curran and D'Arcangelo, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Arcangelo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lalonde and Strazielle, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Locomotor differences between the two mutants (captured by LD2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) thus likely represent a combination of specific differences in circuitry within the cerebellum itself plus extracerebellar effects. The differences in variability may be of cerebellar origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Walter et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</xref>). Movement variability is often considered to be a hallmark of cerebellar ataxia, and yet surprisingly, <italic>pcd</italic> mice were <italic>less</italic> variable than controls on several movement measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>). We speculate that the opposite effects on variability in the two mutants may arise as a consequence of altered Purkinje cell output in <italic>reeler</italic>, compared to a lack of Purkinje cell output in <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Medina and Lisberger, 2007</xref>). Meanwhile, differences in hindlimb involvement, and the resulting reliance on front paw supports (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), may be extracerebellar, perhaps resulting from cell positioning defects in <italic>reeler</italic> spinal cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yip et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Phelps et al., 2002</xref>). Future experiments analyzing locomotor phenotypes in additional cerebellar and extracerebellar models will be crucial for establishing mechanistic links between specific features of locomotor behavior and precise alterations in underlying neural circuits.</p><p>Despite the more severe behavioral and anatomical phenotype in <italic>reeler</italic>, we found the overall pattern of affected locomotor features in <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> to be surprisingly similar. The first linear discriminant pulled out a set of shared impairments in multi-joint, interlimb, and whole-body coordination that may reflect core quantitative features of mouse cerebellar ataxia. We propose that these features comprise the gestalt impression of clearly cerebellar gait phenotypes that trained observers can readily identify, despite substantial variation in specific manifestations across models.</p><p>In particular, like <italic>pcd</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>), the tail and nose movements of <italic>reeler</italic>s were also successfully modeled as passive consequences of limb movement, with a shift of supports to the front, rather than hind, paws. We had previously interpreted the pattern of coordination deficits in <italic>pcd</italic> mice, and particularly the passive tail oscillation, as consistent with the lack of an internal forward model that predicts and compensates for the consequences of movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastian et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ebner and Pasalar, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kennedy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). Specifically for locomotor control, a forward model can predict how the movement of one part of the body (e.g., a limb or a paw) will affect the movement of another part (e.g., another limb, or the tail), and inject a compensatory control signal to eliminate those consequences.</p><p>The idea that the cerebellum could provide a forward model for motor control is often invoked when considering the role of the cerebellum in motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shadmehr and Krakauer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wolpert et al., 1998</xref>). Recently, we showed that both <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice were unable to learn to restore gait symmetry on a locomotor learning task that requires predictive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Darmohray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Morton and Bastian, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Reisman et al., 2005</xref>). That finding, together with the passive tail oscillations of both mutants, reinforces the idea that these animals lack the ability, provided by an intact cerebellum, to predict and compensate unintended movements during locomotion. The consistent lack of compensatory predictive mechanisms across mutants and behavioral paradigms suggests that they may represent core features of cerebellar contributions to coordinated locomotion. Extending the current findings and applying a similar approach across a broader range of circuit manipulations could become a key element in understanding how various neural components work together to control complex, whole-body behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All procedures were reviewed and performed in accordance with the Champalimaud Centre for the Unknown Ethics Committee guidelines and approved by the Portuguese Direcção Geral de Veterinária (Ref.

The new tail tracking algorithm was implemented using Matlab and the Signal Processing, Image Processing and Statistics and Machine Learning toolboxes. Tail tracking started with the side view using binary thresholding followed by a skeletonization operation for finding candidate tail segments based on length and position. These points were then projected onto the bottom view starting from the distal tail segment. The bottom view image was convoluted with a hamming window with a kernel width representative of a mouse tail. Subsequent points were identified iteratively towards the proximal tail, stopping at the base of the tail. In the case of tail segmentation after skeletonization the additional step of looking for tail points towards the distal tail was taken. The tail was then divided into 15 tail points (referred to as segments) with constant Euclidian distance (in 3D) between them, similarly to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Machado et al., 2015</xref>.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Shared and specific signatures of locomotor ataxia in mutant mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The work seems like a useful extension of Machado et al., 2015, from a benchmarking perspective – this paper helps to show that LocoMouse &quot;works&quot; at least in the sense of being able to identify commonalities and differences between mutants and to make semantic sense of those similarities and differences. However, after extensive consultation the consensus was reached that the paper does not contain enough new and impactful science for an advance on Machado et al., 2015, especially given reeler data in Darmohray et al., 2019, and the methodology used is that previously used by the authors, albeit in a different context and with a different mutant. The attempt to tie the behavioral defects quantified to circuit level defects were not convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript is a very well written manuscript describing the differences and similarities in the ataxic leg movements during walking in two mutant mouse models that have cerebellar neuropathy. Namely these mice are the Purkinje Cell Generation mice and the <italic>Reeler</italic> mice. They did a nice set of recordings and data analysis. However, this manuscript is purely descriptive, without any conceptual conclusion. I don't think this work, although well done, is not appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>We are still at the proof-of-concept phase for computational neuroethology. One goal of these methods is to identify relationships between complex patterns of behavior by – in a task or context specific manner – balancing (as the discussion says) specificity (e.g., high dimensional measures) with interpretability (e.g., a conceptual framework). This paper puts this hypothesis to the test using the LocoMouse framework developed by this lab to compare ataxic phenotypes among <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice. Here the authors do a very nice job of demonstrating that – like the <italic>pcd</italic> mice – many of the apparent phenotypes in the <italic>reeler</italic> mouse are a simple consequence of the slowed speed and smaller size of the mutants. In addition, the observations that phenotypes are now largely found in the front paws – and that tail and nose dynamics can be predicted from this effect – effectively distinguishes the two mutants. The data are clear, and the findings of significant import and utility to those interested in ataxias and in motor control.</p><p>Given that the technology and analytics associated with LocoMouse are at this point well vetted, I have no specific comments or concerns about the data in the paper. I would like only a few small adjustments. It would be nice to move some of the data from Figure 1—figure supplement 1 into main Figure 1 (or maybe to make Figure 1—figure supplement 1 a new Figure 2) so that the baseline comparisons between the mutants is more front stage in the figures. In addition, it would be clarifying to generate some simplified graphs (maybe focused on specific speeds) that, in at least some cases, enable comparisons of <italic>reeler</italic>, <italic>pcd</italic> and controls all at once. The compromises used in Figure 3 could work here (where you have adjacent panels with two of the three comparisons), but on the whole it would be generally nice to see more direct comparisons across the data in the main figures. Finally, I am left with a sense of the power of the approach to both relate and distinguish, but the one thing that isn't made completely explicit is why <italic>reeler</italic> mice are so much more apparently ataxic when you just look at them. Is this largely the collective consequence of the &quot;high-stepping&quot; phenotype, the increased variability and the steering phenotype? There is obviously not a simple answer to this, but I would appreciate some discussion of what might account for the fact that the <italic>reeler</italic> mice look worse by eye, and how quantitative measures might highlight or obscure the gestalt we have as researchers inspecting our mice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors use established methods from their lab to compare locomotor kinematics in wildtype mice and two mutant mouse lines: <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic>. This work builds on some of their impressive previous work where they already showed the results for the <italic>pcd</italic> mice (Machado et al., 2015), as well as evaluations of both <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice in a different paradigm testing locomotor kinematics, the split-belt treadmill (Darmohray et al., 2019). With the current manuscript, the authors aim to provide a quantitative foundation for mapping specific locomotor impairments onto distinct neuropathologies. The experiments seem to be competently performed, and the manuscript is well written. However, the limitation of the current manuscript is that it does not provide much new insight to the analysis of body part kinematics which hasn't already largely been covered in their previous work.</p><p>The main concerns are:</p><p>1) Lack of novelty compared to their previous papers (Machado et al., 2015; Darmohray et al., 2019). Basic locomotor kinematics of both <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice (as shown here in Figures 1-3) are already described in these papers. Figure 4 does contain new information, although it largely depends on the results from Figure 2. Similar observations to those in Figure 2 of the current manuscript, e.g. different paw supports for the two mutant lines compared to controls, have already been shown in Figure 3D and H of Darmohray et al., 2019, albeit in a different behavioral paradigm.</p><p>2) The authors claim to provide a quantitative foundation for mapping specific locomotor impairments onto distinct neuropathologies. However, there is not enough biological validation for the claim that the data presented in the current manuscript can link behavioral phenotypes with underlying neural circuits, as there is no detailed description of the anatomical differences between the two mutant lines within the cerebellum. Certainly the found behavioral differences between the two are not linked to their neural circuits. The authors would need to revise their conclusions based on the data they present here.</p><p>3) An attempt to possibly rescue the phenotype would help to improve the biological understanding of which behavioral phenotypes are linked to specifically which anatomical underlying structures. I.e., is it possible to intervene in one of the animal models, so that their phenotype switches on the LD1 axis presented in Figure 4 to the side of the control mice? Such conclusions would then truly link behavioral phenotypes to neural circuits, and would help to significantly improve the biological understanding of mouse locomotor kinematics.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Shared and specific signatures of locomotor ataxia in mutant mice&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

A behavioural description of locomotion in <italic>pcd</italic> mice was already included in Machado et al., 2015, so the additional data provided here are for <italic>reeler</italic> mice. The analyses provided reveal that some locomotor parameters are similarly impaired in these two mutant models while other parameters are unique to each mutant.</p><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The reviewers found considerable merit in this advance but have further revisions they recommend that can be accomplished quickly and evaluated by the RE. Two of the reviewers thought that further experiments were needed to sustain the authors claims but realizing that this advance was considerable recommend revision in consultation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>&quot;The analyses provided reveal that some locomotor parameters are similarly impaired in these two mutant models while other parameters are unique to each mutant. While the additional findings presented in this study are sound, it is unclear how much we can generalize from analysis of one additional ataxia model, particularly because the neuropathology in these two models is quite different. Without a deeper evaluation of the generality and specificity of locomotor deficits in mouse models of ataxia, this study only provides a relatively slim additional advance over their previous study, and the more general conclusions they draw are not sufficiently justified. I have the following suggestions for strengthening the present manuscript. The authors show nicely in Figure 5 that combinations of behavioral features can be used to distinguish not only wild type from mutant mice but also <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice from each other. The authors' interpretation of these results is that the locomotor features that commonly distinguish wild type animals from the two mutants have a common underlying neuropathological origin (i.e. a cerebellar deficit) while the features that distinguish <italic>pcd</italic> mice from <italic>reeler</italic> mice reflect differences between these two mutants (i.e. absence of Purkinje cell output vs. miswiring in the cerebellum plus the additional extracerebellar defects in <italic>reeler</italic> mice). This is an important idea that could be bolstered with some additional data/analysis: 1. To show that aberrant cerebellar function is the root cause of the variability along LD1, the authors could use perturbation experiments to specifically affect locomotion by manipulating activity in interpositus-projecting Purkinje cells. This could be done acutely (as in Sarnaik and Raman, 2018) and/or chronically (as in Darmohray et al., 2018). 2. To test if LD1 does indeed distinguish wild type from ataxic mice and LD2 (or higher dimensions) distinguish different types of ataxic mice from each other, the authors could analyze locomotion in other models of ataxia that have different neuropathologies.&quot;</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>&quot;On a related note, a major claim is that the LD analysis defines a core set of behavioral features associated with cerebellar dysfunction. These are: impairments in multijoint, interlimb, and whole-body coordination, as well as in predictive mechanisms (i.e. forward models). It is true that these behavioral impairments are observed in both <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice, which share cerebellar neuropathology. However, it is possible that pathology in other brain circuits (basal ganglia, for example) may also be associated with some of the same behavioral impairments observed in the <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice, which would indicate that these behavioral impairments are not unique to the cerebellum after all. The impact of the paper, and the degree to which it is possible to claim that particular abnormalities are hallmarks of cerebellar dysfunction, would be much higher if the LD analysis could be repeated in mice with gait abnormalities caused by non-cerebellar dysfunction: Amende et al., 2005. Gait dynamics in mouse models of Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease. If it is not feasible at this time to use the Locomouse system to analyze gait abnormalities in the mouse models in the Amende paper, the paper should at least discuss some of the limitations in terms of interpreting results as capturing behavioral hallmarks of cerebellar dysfunction. The distinction is between the impairments being &quot;specific&quot; markers of cerebellar dysfunction (which is supported by the data) vs &quot;unique&quot; markers of cerebellar dysfunction (which is not supported by the data). In other words, if a mouse has cerebellar dysfunction then we would be able to predict, based on the current paper, some of the abnormalities we may expect. On the other hand, if a mouse displays some of the abnormalities, it would not be possible to assume, based on the current results, that the underlying neuropathology is cerebellar.&quot;</p><p>In light of these reservations, the authors should scale back some of their claims and discuss the limitations of the analysis more.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55356.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

In this case, the current manuscript describing <italic>reeler</italic> mice is a follow up of our 2015 paper that developed the LocoMouse analysis framework to quantify the gait impairments of <italic>Purkinje cell degeneration</italic> mice (Machado et al., 2015). Yes, the data in both papers are descriptive. But this does not mean that they have no conceptual conclusion. Many researchers have told us that our 2015 paper fundamentally transformed the way they think about mouse locomotion and the role of the cerebellum. The current manuscript provides solid evidence for some of the ideas we could only speculate about then, as well as capturing shared and specific features of two forms of gait ataxia in a broadly applicable way, for the first time. We have revised the paper, with substantive changes to the Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion, to make our motivation and conceptual points more clear. In particular, the Discussion now highlights conceptual conclusions that are only made possible by taking both of Machado et al., 2015 and the current study into account.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>We are still at the proof-of-concept phase for computational neuroethology.

We also note that this paper’s tight relationship to Machado et al., 2015 is precisely why we submitted this paper as a Research Advance – a format, unique to <italic>eLife</italic>, that allows a manuscript to be formally associated with a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main concerns are:</p><p>1) Lack of novelty compared to their previous papers (Machado et al., 2015; Darmohray et al., 2019).

But all of the <italic>reeler</italic> data in this paper is entirely new. The statement “Basic locomotor kinematics of both <italic>pcd</italic> and <italic>reeler</italic> mice (as shown here in Figures 1-3) are already described in these papers” is just not true.</p><p>That claim appears to be supported by the statement “Similar observations to those in Figure 2 of the current manuscript, e.g. different paw supports for the two mutant lines compared to controls, have already been shown in Figure 3D and H of Darmohray et al., 2019, albeit in a different behavioral paradigm.” We know that the locomotor terminology can be confusing, and so here we aim to clarify an unfortunate misunderstanding. Darmohray et al., 2019 dealt exclusively with locomotor learning. Figure 3D and H of that paper quantified the extent of spatial vs. temporal components of learning in those mutants. Changes in double support symmetry after learning were one way that we assessed the temporal component of learning, but that measure has no correspondence to any parameter reported in the current manuscript. We invite reviewers to consider of Figure 3D and H of Darmohray et al. alongside Figure 2H from our current manuscript. Immediate inspection of these two plots reveals that while they both contain the words “% double support”, they contain entirely different data. While the <italic>reeler</italic> datapoints hover around 0 in the learning experiments (because there was no temporal learning in these mice), the opposite is true in the current manuscript – the <italic>reelers</italic> never approach 0 double support.</p><p>The reason for this discrepancy is that double support aftereffects, which measure learning, are a completely different measure from double support itself. Given that <italic>reeler</italic> mice were not included at all in Machado et al., 2015, and that the only <italic>reeler</italic> data in Darmohray et al., 2019 were a few datapoints concerned only with learning, there is simply no basis for the claim that we have previously reported the locomotor kinematics of <italic>reeler</italic> mice, or that the <italic>reeler</italic> data in the first 3 figures of this paper are not new.</p><p>To avoid additional confusion, we have added a statement in the Introduction to clarify that “the locomotor kinematics and whole-body coordination of <italic>reeler</italic> mice have not been reported”.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer acknowledges that “Figure 4 does contain new information, although it largely depends on the results from Figure 2.” In fact, Figure 4 incorporates results from all figures of this paper and those of Machado et al., 2015, in order to synthesize this vast amount of locomotor analysis into a digestible format. This approach is entirely new and, as we discuss in the Discussion, not only does it allow us to capture shared and specific features of gait ataxia here, it will form an essential component of our ability to extract meaning from the kinds of behavioral quantification that we first described in Machado et al., 2015 and that have become much more common since.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim to provide a quantitative foundation for mapping specific locomotor impairments onto distinct neuropathologies. However, there is not enough biological validation for the claim that the data presented in the current manuscript can link behavioral phenotypes with underlying neural circuits, as there is no detailed description of the anatomical differences between the two mutant lines within the cerebellum. Certainly the found behavioral differences between the two are not linked to their neural circuits. The authors would need to revise their conclusions based on the data they present here.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely apologize if we mistakenly gave the impression that we were trying to link specific aspects of the altered cerebellar circuitry to specific aspects of behavior. This was completely unintentional! We have made a number of revisions to the text to more clearly convey our actual meaning, including:</p><p>– Major changes to Abstract and Introduction to provide additional context and motivation for the current study .</p><p>– Changes in language throughout the paper to favor use of “structures”,</p><p>“neuropathologies”, “anatomical features”, and similar in place of “circuitry”, “circuits”, etc.</p><p>– A clarified and extended discussion of how we think the gait alterations we observe may related to gross pathology (related to the final comment of reviewer 2).</p><p>We hope that these changes have helped clarify that rather than claiming to have mapped specific locomotor features onto specific circuit abnormalities within the cerebellum, we are trying to demonstrate the ability to map shared and specific gait abnormalities onto shared and specific anatomical features. The shared locomotor phenotypes between the two mutants are almost by definition cerebellar, for example, as the neuropathology in <italic>pcd</italic> is largely specific to the cerebellum (particularly at the youngest ages we tested in Machado et al., 2015) and that is the only overlapping anatomical feature between the two lines. We speculate in the Discussion (and have now expanded this section) about possible anatomical foundations for the differences between the two mutants.</p><p>Finally, although we hope it is now clear that we are not attempting to make specific claims about their altered cerebellar circuitry giving rise to specific behavioral differences (other than speculating in the Discussion about the difference between a lack of Purkinje cell output (<italic>pcd</italic>) vs. aberrant Purkinje cell output (<italic>reeler</italic>)), we note that <italic>reeler</italic> and <italic>pcd</italic> are two of the bestdescribed mutants in the literature – their neuropathologies within the cerebellum and beyond have been described and replicated in countless papers, many of which we cite and describe in some detail here.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) An attempt to possibly rescue the phenotype would help to improve the biological understanding of which behavioral phenotypes are linked to specifically which anatomical underlying structures. I.e., is it possible to intervene in one of the animal models, so that their phenotype switches on the LD1 axis presented in Figure 4 to the side of the control mice? Such conclusions would then truly link behavioral phenotypes to neural circuits, and would help to significantly improve the biological understanding of mouse locomotor kinematics.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that it would be quite powerful if such a rescue were possible, it would essentially amount to curing ataxia, which is clearly outside the scope of the current manuscript. Instead, what we propose is that applying this same approach to a broad range of mutants and circuit manipulations could achieve a similar goal. As we outline in the Discussion, we would argue that LD1 here represents “cerebellar dysfunction”, which is the shared anatomical feature in the two mutants, whereas LD2 would represent a combination of a) specific differences in the circuitry within the cerebellum itself, and b) extracerebellar effects. With the future addition of more mouse models and manipulations, the LDA would acquire more axes that could capture the contributions of other brain areas or cell types. We absolutely were not trying to imply that we had already achieved that broader goal, and we have tried to be more circumspect in our conclusions as suggested in major point #2. However, we emphasize that our approach has successfully captured and distilled the shared and specific locomotor phenotypes of two mutants with very clear, and previously well described, shared and specific neuropathologies – and to our knowledge this is the first time that this has been done. We hope to share the success of this approach with a wide audience in the hopes that others will build on the foundation we have established here – as they have already started to do with the LocoMouse system.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions for this paper:</p><p>The reviewers found considerable merit in this advance but have further revisions they recommend that can be accomplished quickly and evaluated by the Reviewing Editor.

If it is not feasible at this time to use the Locomouse system to analyze gait abnormalities in the mouse models in the Amende paper, the paper should at least discuss some of the limitations in terms of interpreting results as capturing behavioral hallmarks of cerebellar dysfunction. The distinction is between the impairments being &quot;specific&quot; markers of cerebellar dysfunction (which is supported by the data) vs &quot;unique&quot; markers of cerebellar dysfunction (which is not supported by the data). In other words, if a mouse has cerebellar dysfunction then we would be able to predict, based on the current paper, some of the abnormalities we may expect. On the other hand, if a mouse displays some of the abnormalities, it would not be possible to assume, based on the current results, that the underlying neuropathology is cerebellar.&quot; In light of these reservations, the authors should scale back some of their claims and discuss the limitations of the analysis more.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for these insightful comments and suggestions. We absolutely acknowledge that the conclusions that can be drawn from two mutants are limited and fully agree that the inclusion of additional cerebellar and non-cerebellar models within the framework we provide here will be hugely informative as to the specific contributions of both cerebellar and other circuits to locomotor phenotypes. Indeed, this has always been our plan, and we hope to follow up on this study with exactly those analyses in the near future. We have revised our language throughout the manuscript to soften our claims, address limitations, and make more explicit distinctions between what we have actually shown here, vs. predictions for future studies.</p></body></sub-article></article>
