Current, widely used methods for long-term measurement of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are limited by low throughput and the difficulty of performing longitudinal monitoring of aging phenotypes. Here we describe the WorMotel, a microfabricated device for long-term cultivation and automated longitudinal imaging of large numbers of <italic>C. elegans</italic> confined to individual wells. Using the WorMotel, we find that short-lived and long-lived strains exhibit patterns of behavioral decline that do not temporally scale between individuals or populations, but rather resemble the shortest and longest lived individuals in a wild type population. We also find that behavioral trajectories of worms subject to oxidative stress resemble trajectories observed during aging. Our method is a powerful and scalable tool for analysis of <italic>C. elegans</italic> behavior and aging.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26652.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26652.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26652.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Aging affects almost all living things, yet little is known about the biological changes that occur as we get older. Scientists often study aging in the microscopic roundworm <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> because it reproduces quickly and its lifespan is short (about 2–3 weeks on average). To date, investigations have helped to reveal genes that affect overall lifespan. However, it is not known how much these genes also affect the animal’s healthy lifespan or “healthspan”, that is to say, the length of time before advancing age begins to negatively affect health.</p><p>Until now, studies with worms have often been limited because measuring health and aging required time-consuming and difficult manual experiments. This also meant that worms were studied together as groups, rather than as individuals, providing a simplified picture of what was going on. An automated system in which many single worms can be analyzed and assessed would provide a much more detailed view of the effects of aging on health.</p><p>Churgin et al. have now developed a device called the WorMotel to allow simultaneous automated examination of 240 worms throughout their entire adult lifespan. The WorMotel is a rectangular slab of clear silicone rubber with small wells in it. A single worm is confined in each well with a source of bacteria for food, and a camera is used to track and monitor each worm’s behavior over time. This device confirmed that worms move more slowly as they get older, which was taken to be a measurement of the worms’ declining health. Worms that lived the longest declined over the first few days and then had a long plateau of very low activity before eventually dying. Short-lived worms became slower and died fairly promptly.</p><p>Churgin et al. also showed that the worms with mutations that increase lifespan declined in a similar way to the longest-lived normal worms, and that mutants with shorter lifespans declined like the shortest-lived normal worms. Also, normal worms that had been exposed to a chemical called paraquat – which stresses the worm's cells and shortens the worm’s lifespans to a few days – slowed down in a similar manner as aging worms, suggesting that the stress is similar to the aging process.</p><p>Tools like the WorMotel can improve our understanding of the links between lifespan and healthspan. The tool is designed to be versatile and can be used with standard imaging systems and automated tools, meaning it can be scaled up to deal with tens of thousands of worms at once. Churgin et al. are now using the WorMotel to find other genes that influence healthspan and understand how they contribute to deteriorating health as animals age. Aging affects us all and learning more about healthspan could lead to drugs or interventions to help more people to live healthily for longer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26652.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26652.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>WorMotel</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>healthspan</kwd><kwd>stress resistance</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS-084835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Churgin</surname><given-names>Matthew A</given-names></name><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG-NS-1109-13</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jung</surname><given-names>Sang-Kyu</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xiangmei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>633589</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-NS-088432</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Raizen</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Fang-Yen</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Studies of model organisms such as the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic> have identified highly conserved processes and pathways which influence aging, including dietary restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Greer and Brunet, 2009</xref>), insulin/insulin-like signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>), and the cytoprotective DAF-16/FOXO pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Greer and Brunet, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eijkelenboom and Burgering, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ogg et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Current, widely used methods for long-term measurement of <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging are based on manual inspection of worm survival on agar plates. These methods are robust and technically simple, but have a number of limitations. They are labor intensive, low in throughput, and are largely focused on lifespan at the population level without access to information about health or behavior during individual life trajectories.</p><p>Previous efforts have aimed to automate <italic>C. elegans</italic> survival assays. One method produces high resolution survival curves by monitoring large populations of animals on standard agar plates using flatbed scanners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stroustrup et al., 2013</xref>). However, this method monitors only lifespan and is not designed to track individual animals over their entire lifetime. Therefore, this system is limited in its ability to study aging in individual animals.</p><p>Another method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) used small hydrogel compartments between a glass slide and a PDMS membrane to perform long-term longitudinal monitoring of <italic>C. elegans</italic> aging. However, the device has a number of limitations: it is not easily scalable to large numbers of animals and does not lend itself to screening experiments. The hydrogel device requires complex image analysis software and prevents access to animals during the experiment, limiting the additional phenotypes that can be assayed in tandem. Also, the hydrogel device requires sterile mutations to be crossed into all strains tested, and all experiments must be performed at the restrictive temperature of 25° C, limiting the prospects for genetic screening.</p><p>Here, we describe a device we call the WorMotel (WM), which is capable of longitudinally tracking behavior of up to 240 uniquely identified animals of any genotype per device for over 60 days. The WM consists of an array of individual wells, each of which is filled with standard agar media, bacterial food, and a single worm, enabling long-term cultivation and imaging of hundreds of uniquely identified animals. By conforming to the ANSI standard microplate format, our method leverages existing scalable automation technology including worm sorters, robotic plate handlers, and chemical library screening tools. We apply our method to quantifying inter-individual and inter-strain differences in behavioral decline during aging and stress, as well as in understanding the relationship between behavior and lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A scalable platform for long-term imaging of worm behavior, development, and lifespan</title><p>Conventional 96-well or 384-well microplates are not well suited for worm imaging and cultivation on agar media due to three problems. First, the vertical walls of each well make it difficult to image the worms when they are close to the edge of the wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Second, worms tend to crawl between the agar and well edges, again making them difficult to image clearly. Third, under humid conditions, animals can climb over the walls of the wells, mixing with other worms.</p><p>We designed the WorMotel to address these limitations. Each WorMotel consists of a transparent polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) substrate containing a rectangular array of up to 240 wells, produced by molding from an acrylic photopolymer 3D-printed master (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shepherd et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The well geometry is optimized for worm cultivation and imaging of a single worm per well. A rounded concave well geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) provides a clear view of the animal at all positions on the agar surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), and also inhibits worms from burrowing under the agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). A network of narrow moats containing a copper sulfate solution surrounding the wells prevents animals from escaping from their wells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26652.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>WorMotel design, fabrication, preparation, and experimental setup.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) 3D rendering of WorMotel geometry.

As expected, mean lifespan of <italic>daf-16</italic> mutants (WM: 7.7 ± 0.3 days, n = 61; Manual: 7.0 ± 0.2 days, n = 117) was shorter than that of N2 (WM: 12.3 ± 0.3 days, n = 123; Manual: 12.2 ± 0.5 days, n = 94) while <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants showed a longer lifespan (WM: 33.5 ± 1.9 days, n = 46, Manual: 30.8 ± 2.0 days, n = 52).

Moreover, our lifespan results agree with those previously reported for each strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>We asked whether the aversive copper sulfate solution in the moat, which helps to retain animals inside their respective wells, had any effect on survival or development. We compared the duration of the L4 stage, a measurement of developmental rate, and lifespan of worms grown on a WorMotel with moats filled with NGMB to a WorMotel with moats filled with 100 mM copper sulfate (see Materials and methods). We found no difference in developmental rate of worms grown from the L3 stage to adulthood in the presence of an NGMB (L4 Duration = 12.2 ± 0.2 hr) and copper sulfate moat (L4 Duration = 12.2 ± 0.2 hr, p=0.95).

Manual assessments of lifespan were performed daily within two hours of a thirty-minute imaging epoch. We compared the time of death measured by our software to that measured by a human observer scoring death manually by standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>). For N2 worms, the average difference between manual and automated lifespan measurement was 0.66 ± 0.6 days (n = 79), indicating that automated lifespan calculation is accurate within the time resolution of standard lifespan assays. Automated lifespan was always less than or equal to manual lifespan, indicating that dead animals were never incorrectly scored as alive. Furthermore, we found no correlation between the error in automatic lifespan measurement and true lifespan (p=0.18), indicating that the error in automated lifespan score is independent of lifespan itself, i.e. absolute measurement error does not increase for worms with longer lifespan.</p><p>Together, these results show that with regard to development and lifespan, results from the WorMotel are similar to those using standard methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mutant strains display diverse behavioral profiles during aging</title><p>Aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is accompanied by a deterioration of many behaviors, including slowing of locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>) and feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2004</xref>), and a reduced capacity for learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stein and Murphy, 2012</xref>).

First, the rate of physiological decline was slower in long-lived individuals, as might be expected. The second, however, was counter-intuitive: the additional lifespan of longer-lived individuals was primarily due to differences toward the end of the lifespan. That is, long-lived animals exhibited longer periods of low physiological function, or ‘extended twilight’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A different picture was suggested by a study using automated assays of lifespan in the ‘Lifespan machine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stroustrup et al., 2016</xref>). In this study it was reported that various genetic and environmental perturbations do not fundamentally change the shape of the survival curve, but rather only compress or dilate it in time.

The concept of a universal scaling parameter in aging would suggest that the short and long-lived individuals within any strain (whether with normal, short, or long mean lifespan) would resemble their short and long-lived counterparts in the reference strain, but with a temporal scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). If the variations in aging rate among individuals in any isogenic strain are governed by similar factors, we would expect that short and long-lived individuals would display similar late-life characteristics as their wild type counterparts. If, on the other hand, short-lived strains as a whole physiologically more closely resemble short-lived individuals of a wild type population, we might expect them to display late-life characteristics similar to these short-lived individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>).

Furthermore, our results suggest that there exists a relationship between change in decline rate and lifespan that lies along a continuum across strains in addition to between individuals of the same strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e,f</xref>). Therefore, our results suggest that while behavioral decline does not temporally scale with lifespan, the stochastic sources of variability between isogenic individuals modulate the shape of aging along the same axis of variability as between short and long lived strains.

To test this idea, we grew animals on the WorMotel as we did for normal aging experiments. We then added paraquat on day 9 of adulthood, and monitored worms’ subsequent behavior and survival.

Future experiments comparing gene expression in rapidly or slowly aging worms may elucidate how aging variability is manifest at the molecular level.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Extension of late-life decrepitude in long-lived worms</title><p>In addition to this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), a recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Podshivalova et al., 2017</xref>) also observed an extension of late-life behavioral quiescence in N2 and <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants. The authors found that intestinal bacterial colonization is a risk factor for death in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and that <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, which exhibit a greater fraction of late-life decrepitude compared to N2, were less susceptible to this bacterial colonization. When the authors fed worms killed bacteria, they found a greater lifespan extension in N2 (40%) than <italic>daf-2(e1368)</italic> (16%), suggesting that bacterial colonization is a cause of premature death in N2 worms. Finally, the authors found that feeding worms dead bacteria specifically extended the period of infirmity rather than that of good health, suggesting that bacterial colonization may be a primary cause of lifespan truncation in short-lived individuals. That is, bacterial colonization may cause a reduction in late-life decrepitude in short-lived worms by causing premature death.</p><p>If bacterial colonization is a fundamental cause of the smaller fraction of late-life decrepitude observed in short-lived worms, the question remains as to why long-lived worms exhibit extended behavioral quiescence in old age. One possibility is that muscle integrity degrades with age faster than other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herndon et al., 2002</xref>) such that older worms are physically able to move less well than reflected by their probability of dying. Another possibility might be related to the reduction in feeding worms exhibit with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2004</xref>). Feeding and locomotion are linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">McCloskey et al., 2017</xref>), so it might be that worms that have ceased feeding also tend to cease spontaneous locomotion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Scaling of behavioral decline during acute stress</title><p>It has been hypothesized that normal aging constitutes a low-level stress that results in the slow accumulation of damage leading to senescent decline. While the accelerated aging observed during oxidative stress in our experiments is far greater than what occurs during normal physiological processes, our result that the shape of functional decline is similar during normal aging and acute oxidative stress suggests a potential underlying similarity between these two conditions. Furthermore, we show that the relationship between individual decline and survival is conserved between oxidative stress and normal aging, indicating that the processes governing the unique shape of decline for short-lived and long-lived individuals are preserved. Our results indicate that the process of functional decline can be sped up by at least a factor of twenty while still maintaining a similar average shape. Together, our results suggest that normal aging and acute oxidative stress similarly impact the process of functional decline. Future work will aim to define mechanisms for this similarity.</p><p>If functional decline were dictated only by lifespan, we expect to observe a single curve relating the shape of decline to lifespan, regardless of environmental conditions. That is, interventions that drastically shorten lifespan, such as the addition of paraquat, should all exhibit an increase in decline rate between early and late life to be continuous with the curve presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>. Instead, however, we observe a translation of the tradeoff we observe during normal aging between the shape of functional decline and lifespan. This indicates that the shape of decline is not dictated by lifespan per se, but instead by the distance of an individual's lifespan relative to some standard in a given set of environmental conditions. For example, during normal aging, a lifespan of about 12 days results in neutral decline, or no change in decline rate between early and late life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a,d,e</xref>), whereas during oxidative stress, a lifespan of about 12 hr results in neutral decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7i</xref>). Together, these results suggest that relative to a standard lifespan in a given environment, there exists a defined shape of aging in the individuals whose lifespans differ from that standard as a result of genetic and/or stochastic factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>ODR-10 is required for elevated response threshold but not increased lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants</title><p>We found that ODR-10 did not affect baseline locomotion of <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, but did reduce the locomotory response of <italic>daf-2</italic> worms to an aversive stimulus. Furthermore, ODR-10 knockdown did not reduce <italic>daf-2</italic> lifespan, suggesting that elevated sensory response threshold is not required for increased lifespan of <italic>daf-2</italic> animals.</p><p>We found that ODR-10 suppressed locomotion in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants only in response to stimulation, whereas Hahm <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hahm et al., 2015</xref>) found that ODR-10 suppressed locomotion per se in <italic>daf-2</italic> mutants, One simple explanation for this discrepancy is that in Hahm <italic>et al.,</italic> locomotion assays were conducted soon after worms were manually stimulated due to picking onto the assay plate. The WorMotel allowed us to monitor worm behavior in a long-term unstimulated state in addition to after blue light stimulation. Future experiments may shed further light on whether reduced movement is required for the extended longevity of <italic>daf-2.</italic> The WorMotel will be useful in quantifying behaviors that unfold over long periods of time and further exploring the relationships between behavior and lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Additional axes of variation govern the aging process</title><p>It has been reported that survival curves scale by a multiplicative constant across a diverse set of genetic and environmental perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). This result was interpreted as being compatible with the sum of biological inputs being filtered through a single state variable that determines the rate of aging. Our results indicate that a single variable is unlikely to be able to account for the inter-individual variability observed in aging. We observe variability in the shape of aging between individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5a–f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6a–c</xref>), indicating that the shape of aging does not scale for individuals with different lifespans. At the same time, we do observe a scaling of the relationship between the shape of aging and lifespan when the mean population rate of aging is accelerated with oxidative stress. Furthermore, we observe a difference in variability in aging decline across genotypes with differences in lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). Therefore, our results indicate the likely existence of at least one additional variable across which the process of aging may vary between individuals within and across populations. Future work may uncover the full space across which the aging process may vary and mechanisms underlying variability in aging.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains</title><p>The following strains were used in this study: N2, CF1038: <italic>daf-16(mu86) I</italic>, CB1370: <italic>daf-2(e1370) III</italic>, TJ1052: <italic>age-1(hx546) II</italic>, PR678: <italic>tax-4(p678) III</italic>, DA509: <italic>unc-31(e928) IV</italic>, KG1180: <italic>lite-1(ce314) X</italic>, RB754: <italic>aak-2(ok524) X</italic>, CX32: <italic>odr-10(ky32) X</italic>.

All experiments were carried out at 20°C unless otherwise stated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>WorMotel design and fabrication</title><p>To fabricate the WorMotel, we developed a 3D-printing based molding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shepherd et al., 2011</xref>). We designed a chip containing a rectangular array of either 48 or 240 rounded wells with 3 mm diameter, 3 mm depth, and center-to-center spacing of 4.5 mm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Each well was surrounded by a 0.5 mm wide and 3 mm deep channel, which would serve as the moat. Designs of the WorMotel masters were created using MATLAB. We printed a master corresponding to the negative of this shape with an Objet30 photopolymer 3D printer using the material VeroBlack. To mold the WM devices, we mixed Dow Corning Sylgard 184 PDMS according to the manufacturer’s instructions and poured 35 g or 5 g of PDMS into the 240-well or 48-well masters, respectively. We then degassed the poured PDMS in a vacuum chamber for 1 hr or until no more bubbles were visible. Devices were cured overnight at 40°C and then removed from molds using a spatula.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>WorMotel preparation</title><p>To prepare devices for experiments, the chips were first treated with oxygen plasma for 4 min using a plasma cleaner (PE-50, Plasma Etch Inc., Carson City, NV or Plasmatic Systems Plasma Preen II, Plasmatic Systems. Inc., North Brunswick, NJ). This treatment renders PDMS temporarily hydrophilic, which greatly facilitates the filling of wells and moats. The medium was based on standard NGM media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) except low-gelling temperature agarose (gelling temp. 26–30°C, Research Products International, Mount Prospect, IL) was substituted for agar to minimize solidification of the agar during filling of the wells, and streptomycin (200 ng/mL) was added to the media to minimize bacterial contamination.</p><p>For lifespan experiments, but not for development experiments, we added 5-fluoro-2’-deoxyuridine (FUdR) to prevent growth of progeny. A frozen FUdR stock solution of 10 mg/ml in water was thawed and added to molten agar at 40°C at a concentration of 5 μL per mL just prior to filling. This yielded a final FUdR concentration of 200 μM. The moat solution consisted of 100 mM copper sulfate, which was approximately in osmotic equilibrium with the agar medium via the humidified air inside the chamber. The moat solution was added using a P200 pipette. About 15 µl of molten NGM agarose was added to each well. About 5 µl of a suspension of the <italic>Escherichiae coli</italic> bacterial strain DA837 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis et al., 1995</xref>), which is a streptomycin-resistant derivative of OP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brenner, 1974</xref>) was added to each well after agarose solidification. For aging experiments, late-L4 worms were added to the WorMotel manually with a platinum wire pick.</p><p>PDMS devices were placed inside either a 90 mm petri plate for 48-well WorMotels or an OmniTray (Nunc Thermo Scientific) for 240-well WorMotels. 240-well WorMotels contained alignment tabs to keep devices in alignment with respect to the OmniTray. To maintain humidity inside the dishes, we used water-absorbing polyacrylamide crystals (AgSAP S, M2 Polymer, West Dundee, IL). Sterile water was added to the crystals in a ratio of 150:1 (water:crystals) by weight. Approximately 15 g of hydrated crystals were added around the WorMotel. We placed lids on all dishes. To prevent accumulation of water condensation, lids were prepared by coating with a 30% solution of Tween 20 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) in water, which was allowed to dry before use. We wrapped Parafilm (Bemis, Nennah, WI) around the sides of the plate to reduce water loss while allowing sufficient gas exchange.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Image acquisition</title><p>Images were captured with an Imaging Source DMK 23GP031 camera (2592 × 1944 pixels) equipped with a Fujinon lens (HF12.5SA-1, 1:1.4/12.5 mm, Fujifilm Corp., Japan). We used IC Capture (Imaging Source) or Phenocapture imaging software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://phenocapture.com/">http://phenocapture.com/</ext-link>) to acquire time lapse images through a gigabit Ethernet connection. For daily imaging we used the time schedule option in Phenocapture to record images every 5 s for a 30 min period twice daily. All experiments were carried out under dark-field illumination using four 4.7&quot; red LED strips (Oznium, Pagosa Springs, CO) positioned approximately 2&quot; below the WorMotel. Images were saved and processed by a 64-bit computer with a 3.40 GHz Intel Core i3 processor and 4 GB of RAM. Images were analyzed using custom-written MATLAB software.</p><p>Different spatial resolutions can be attained by adjusting the camera’s field of view and thus by modulating the number of wells viewed at once. Imaging six wells at once yields approximately 5 μm resolution, imaging 12 wells yields 7 μm resolution, imaging 48 wells yields 15 μm resolution, and imaging 240 wells yields 36 μm resolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Image processing</title><p>Temporally adjacent images were subtracted and divided by the average pixel intensity between the two images to generate normalized maps of pixel value intensity change. Depending on the task, time intervals of either 5 or 60 s were used to generate difference images. We refer to such difference images as 5-s or 60-s activity, respectively (see Aging Behavior Quantification). A Gaussian smoothing filter with standard deviation of one pixel was applied to the resulting difference image in order to reduce image noise. A binary threshold of 0.25 was used to minimize image noise was then applied to the filtered intensity change image in order to score whether or not movement occurred at each pixel location. All pixels in which movement occurred were summed up and the resulting value was called the ‘activity’ between the two frames.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Blue light stimulation, uniform illumination, and temperature monitoring</title><p>To supply the blue light illumination, we use two high power LEDs (Luminus PT-121, Sunnyvale, CA) secured to an aluminum heat sink and connected in series. We used a relay (Schneider Electric, France) controlled by MATLAB through a LabJack (LabJack Corp., Lakewood, CO) or NIDaq (National Instruments, Austin, TX) interface to drive the LEDs at a current of 20 A through a power supply. To maximize the blue light irradiance and uniformity at the WorMotel, we constructed a box consisting of four acrylic mirrors with mirrored sides facing inwards and placed it around the WorMotel. We measured irradiance using a silicon power meter (Coherent, Santa Clara, CA). During aging experiments, blue light stimulation was applied once every twelve hours for 10 s. Temperature was continuously monitored with a temperature probe (LabJack EI1034) placed beside the sealed WorMotel.</p><p>A previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Edwards et al., 2008</xref>) found that continuous blue illumination at an irradiance of 2.8 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> kills N2 worms in 30 min. In our experiments, worms are subject to 20 s of blue light per day (10 s per stimulus, two stimuli per day). Therefore, it would take 90 days for worms to accrue 30 min of total illumination time with blue light. The irradiance of our blue light stimulus is approximately five times weaker than that used in this Edwards <italic>et al.</italic> study. Assuming a linear response of blue light dosage toxicity, it would take 450 days for worms to accrue a toxic blue light dose in our experiments. Since the typical worm lifespan is between 15 and 30 days, we believe blue light toxicity in our experiments is not significant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Copper sulfate experiments</title><p>To test whether filling moats with a copper sulfate solution had any effects on worm development or survival, we prepared two WorMotels: in the first, moats were filled with NGM Buffer (NGMB), and in the second, moats were filled with 100 mM copper sulfate. NGMB consists of the same constituents as NGM agar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>) but without peptone, cholesterol, or agar.</p><p>We manually added L3 larvae to each device and monitored the duration of the L4 stage as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nelson et al., 2013</xref>). When these worms reached the first day of adulthood, each animal was manually transferred to a new WorMotel in which the agar contained FUdR in order to assess the effect of moat solution on survival. Worms grown as larvae in the presence of a copper sulfate moat were transferred to a WorMotel in which moats were filled with copper sulfate; likewise for worms grown in the presence of an NGM moat.

Those that failed to respond were scored as dead. For automated assays, the maximum activity value recorded during the fifteen minutes after each light stimulus was used to determine time of death. Time of death was defined as the time point after the last time point for which the maximum 60-s activity was nonzero.</p><p>Any worm whose activity was uniformly zero beginning on day 2 of adulthood was assumed to have left its well or was not added due to experimental error, and these wells were censored from further analysis. 15 out of 1230 worms (1.2%) were censored in this manner. <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants were found to escape their wells as young adults at a much higher rate than all other strains.

Spontaneous and stimulated locomotion reflect the maximum movement of an individual before or after blue light stimulus, respectively. The response duration was calculated as the total time during which the 5-s activity was greater than zero after the light stimulus. Response duration reflects the total time spent moving after the stimulus. The response latency was calculated as the time elapsed between the blue light stimulus and the first non-zero 5-s activity. The response latency reflects the time required for an individual to respond to an aversive blue light stimulus. Animals that did not move at all during the 15 min following blue light stimulation were assigned a response latency of 900 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Decline rate calculation</title><p>We first considered the stimulated activity of each individual as a fraction of life rather than chronological time. We defined early-life as 20–60% of an individual’s life. We defined late-life as 60–100% of an individual’s life. Decline rate was calculated to be the negative of the slope of the stimulated activity during either early or late-life. Slope was determined with a linear fit in Matlab. For each individual, the change in decline rate was calculated as the late-life decline rate minus the early-life decline rate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Paraquat treatment, imaging protocol, and data processing</title><p>300 mM paraquat stock solutions were prepared fresh each day. L4 animals were added to a WorMotel as normal. On either day 1 or day 9 of adulthood, 2 μL of paraquat stock solution were added to each well and allowed to dry. The final concentration of paraquat per well was about 40 mM, assuming uniform distribution into the agar. After addition of paraquat to each well, excess liquid was allowed to dry (about two hours), and plates were imaged continuously at 0.2 frames per second. Blue light stimulation occurred once per hour for 10 s. Stimulated activity for each animal was determined as the maximum activity between each light stimulus. Lifespan was determined automatically as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Comparison of behavioral decline during aging and stress</title><p>For a given population, we calculated stimulated activity as a fraction of life during aging and stress. We then corrected the activity during stress by calculating the average difference between the two quantities. By correcting for activity amplitude we could then ask whether the shape of decline was similar during aging and stress regardless of any offset. Finally, we calculated the normalized difference between aging and stress behavior at each fractional time point of life. The average normalized difference was reported as the percentage difference between behavior during aging and stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Day replicates</title><p>Day replicates were defined as WorMotels prepared independently on separate days.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Piali Sengupta (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Coleen T Murphy (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very nice Tools and Resource paper describing a new automated method (WorMotel) for longitudinal imaging of <italic>C. elegans</italic> during aging. The goal is to automate these studies to not only increase throughput but to also monitor behaviors of animals as they age. In particular, a major advantage of this method is the ability to follow the behaviors of individual animals over time as they age. As required for a Tools/Resource paper, the work describes the technology, documents basic controls that validate the approach, defines locomotory parameters of spontaneous and provoked movement, and makes accessible the WormMotel analysis software. A major strength is that the work addresses the variation in aging populations, distinguishing lifespan and &quot;aging&quot; indicators in a novel way. For example, the WorMotel is used to track individual life trajectories, allowing the authors to conclude that long and short-lived animals of different genotypes are in fact very similar to one another, but do not temporally scale as previously postulated. The WorMotel will be a valuable resource for the worm community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection “Mutants with short and long lifespan display patterns of late-life behavioral decline resembling those of short and long lived worms from a wild-type population”, third paragraph, arguments regarding extended twilight vs. universal scaling. This is an interesting dichotomy and the authors rightly distinguish this as a question to be resolved in the field. I think the accessibility of the author's arguments might be enhanced by the inclusion of a figure that illustrates the alternative hypotheses and anticipated outcomes.</p><p>2) At the simplest level, all animals might have the potential to exhibit rapid decline and plateau but the short-lived strains do not have the opportunity to exhibit this extended twilight, as they die early. Consider the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, H</xref>; at day 20-daf-16 both dies and is at the lowest activity number at this point; at day 20, daf-2 and N2 appear to be initiating a plateau stage in activity. I think it is important that the authors note the absence of the later plateau stage for daf-16 and short-lived N2, and that they note that daf-2 resemble long lived N2 suggesting the absence of a scaled response. Still, an unresolved question is why the data look as they do. This ambiguity might be better taken into account in interpreting consequences for aging biology in the discussion.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and analysis of bottom and top quartiles. I think the authors might also compare all quartiles in supplemental figures, and/or feature the middle quartiles. What does the middle sector look like for the 25% middle for N2; and at the individual level? Do individual curves support a temporal cutoff of the transition for shorter-lived animals in the group?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and paraquat stress. Paraquat induces high oxidative stress that is likely non-physiological; indeed, treated animals die 20X faster than untreated. The comparison to natural aging raises the apples/oranges issue. That shapes of decline curves are similar but the mechanistic question of why is unclear – this point should be discussed clearly.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <italic>odr-10</italic>. The goal to test whether upregulation of <italic>odr-10</italic> in part underlies the reduced activity of daf-2 animals on bacteria is a worthy one, especially given the recent Hahm et al. 2015 paper. This experiment also highlights the use of the WorMotel for deep phenotyping. However, given the known caveats of RNAi in the nervous system, and the availability of <italic>odr-10</italic> null alleles, it is suggested that these experiments be repeated using an <italic>odr-10</italic> genetic mutant.</p><p>6) <italic>Lite-1</italic>. The use of the <italic>lite-1</italic> mutant is a bit confusing. It seems <italic>lite-1</italic> should be a good control for the induced activity measure, as the response to blue light is altered, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1, suggest that response latency and duration can still be measured, so some response is indicated – why? How has <italic>lite-1</italic> previously been related to lifespan? Authors should better explain rationale on this.</p><p>7) A particularly strong advantage of this work is the ability to look at individual variability. While the reader can perhaps extract this information from the heat maps, it would be nice if the authors can address whether the extent of individual variability is altered (decreased/increased) in specific genotypes across the lifespan.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26652.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Subsection “Mutants with short and long lifespan display patterns of late-life behavioral decline resembling those of short and long lived worms from a wild-type population”, third paragraph, arguments regarding extended twilight vs. universal scaling.

We note that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> all quartiles are plotted for each strain against each quartile's lifespan.

The use of the lite-1 mutant is a bit confusing.

How has lite-1 previously been related to lifespan? Authors should better explain rationale on this.</italic> </p><p>We have added a discussion of this justification to the fourth paragraph of the subsection “Mutant strains display diverse behavioral profiles during aging”.</p><p>We are not aware of any other studies of lifespan in <italic>lite-1</italic> mutants. We assayed <italic>lite-1</italic> worms in order to determine whether these mutants, previously shown to have a reduced response to blue light, can be assayed by our blue light illumination system for measuring stimulated activity. As pointed out by the reviewer, we found little difference in the responses to blue light between N2 and <italic>lite-1</italic> mutants, possibly because our light stimulus is very strong. We chose to include the <italic>lite-1</italic> mutant data in our manuscript because it indicates that even mutants with deficits in blue light response can be assessed by our method.</p><p><italic>7) A particularly strong advantage of this work is the ability to look at individual variability. While the reader can perhaps extract this information from the heat maps, it would be nice if the authors can address whether the extent of individual variability is altered (decreased/increased) in specific genotypes across the lifespan.</italic></p><p>We have added data for individual change in decline rate plotted against lifespan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref> as well as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. This data allows readers to observe the trends in individual intra-strain and inter-strain variability.</p><p>We also compared the variation in decline rate change across strains and added this data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F-G</xref>. From this analysis we conclude that longer-lived strains exhibit less variation in the shape of behavioral decline compared with shorter-lived strains. We have added discussions of these results in the last paragraph of the subsection “Mutants with short and long lifespan display patterns of late-life behavioral decline resembling those of short and long lived worms from a wild-type population” and subsection “Additional axes of variation govern the aging process”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
