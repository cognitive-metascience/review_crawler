We identified a tripartite connectivity-based parcellation of SN with a limbic, cognitive, motor arrangement. The medial SN connects with limbic striatal and cortical regions and encodes value (greater response to monetary wins than losses during fMRI), while the ventral SN connects with associative regions of cortex and striatum and encodes salience (equal response to wins and losses). The lateral SN connects with somatomotor regions of striatum and cortex and also encodes salience. Behavioral measures from delay discounting and flanker tasks supported a role for the value-coding medial SN network in decisional impulsivity, while the salience-coding ventral SN network was associated with motor impulsivity.

In monkeys, SN/VTA dopamine neurons display variations in both anatomy and function. SN neurons can be divided into three tiers based on their staining, morphology, and connectivity with the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haber, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>): moving from a dorso-medial to ventro-lateral location in midbrain, dopamine neurons project to limbic, associative and then motor striatum. All three subdivisions send dendrites ventrally into the adjacent SN pars reticulata (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>). Distinct functional characteristics have also been reported for SN/VTA neurons by recording neural activity during appetitive and aversive outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nomoto et al., 2010</xref>). Cells in ventromedial SNc and VTA encode a value signal, being excited by appetitive events and inhibited by aversive events. Neurons in lateral SN may encode a salience signal, responding equally to appetitive and aversive stimuli.</p><p>Dopamine plays a crucial role in decision-making and reinforcement learning by encoding a reward-prediction error signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayer and Glimcher, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glimcher, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Schultz et al., 1997</xref>). More recently, the role of dopamine in motivational and cognitive processing has been extended by descriptions of responses not only to rewarding outcomes but also to novel, salient, and possibly aversive experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lisman and Grace, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Redgrave and Gurney, 2006</xref>).</p><p>An important clinical aspect of dopamine signaling is its role in impulsivity, defined as a tendency to act rapidly and prematurely without appropriate foresight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagher and Robbins, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dalley and Robbins, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Morris and Voon, 2016</xref>). Impulsivity is a key feature of drug addiction, obesity, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can be divided into different components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meda et al., 2009</xref>). Decisional impulsivity is characterized by a tendency to make maladaptive or inappropriate choices and is typically tested with the Delay Discounting task. Motor impulsivity, on the other hand, refers to premature responding or an inability to inhibit an inappropriate action, and can be tested using Go/No Go type tasks. Discrete neural networks may underlie different forms of impulsivity: VS and ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC), which encode stimulus value, are implicated in decisional impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kable and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">McClure et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sellitto et al., 2010</xref>); somatomotor cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), anterior insula and dorsal striatum are thought to play a role in motor impulsivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bari and Robbins, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chikazoe et al., 2009</xref>). All these brain regions are interconnected with SN: they receive dopamine innervation and send back direct or indirect projections that can modulate dopamine neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we sought to determine anatomical and functional subdivisions of human SN, their connections with striatal and cortical regions, and their role in value versus salience coding, and in different forms of impulsivity. To date, the in-vivo mapping of SN connectivity in humans has been challenging. The brainstem is prone to artifacts from head movement, pulse and respiration, as well as image distortions during data acquisition. Besides, the SN is a relatively small structure that connects with cortical and striatal regions through dense tracts in the internal capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meola et al., 2016</xref>), which causes difficulties for diffusion tractography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jbabdi et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we attempt to overcome these limitations using data from the human connectome project (HCP), taking advantage of the high spatial resolution and rich collection of multimodal measures. First, we used diffusion MRI (dMRI) to identify subdivisions of SN according to their connectivity patterns with the rest of brain. We then mapped the distinct connectivity profiles for each subdivision. Next, we used an fMRI gambling task to differentiate Blood Oxygen Level Dependent (BOLD) activity in SN subdivisions and their projections in terms of responding predominantly to value or salience. Finally, we related individual differences in value and salience coding during the gambling task to measures of decisional and motor impulsivity to reveal dissociable neural substrates underlying impulsive choice and impulsive action.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Subdivisions of substantia nigra</title><p>The SN was parcellated based on spectral clustering of the connectivity patterns of SN voxels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al., 2016</xref>).

A tripartite pattern of SN was revealed, consisting of a medial (mSNc)Â tier, a lateral (lSNc)Â tier and a ventral (vSN) tier. A similar anatomical and connectional differentiation of SN has been widely described in monkeys. Indeed, many studies report that midbrain dopamine neurons can be divided into two or three tiers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">FranÃ§ois et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lynd-Balta and Haber, 1994</xref>), with a dorsal calbindin-positive tier that extends medially to the VTA, and a ventral calbindin-negative tier whose dendrites extend ventrally into the pars reticulata of the substantia nigra. This ventral tier can be further subdivided into a more medio-dorsal densocellular group and a ventro-lateral group of columnar cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haber, 2014</xref>). Tracer studies in monkeys have been used to map the striatal afferent and efferent projections of these SN subdivisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lynd-Balta and Haber, 1994</xref>). The dorsal tier mainly connects with ventromedial striatum, while the ventral tiers project to central and dorsolateral striatum. Coinciding with monkey anatomy, we also found a tripartite division of SN with similar anatomical and connectivity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Specifically, our mSNc corresponds to the monkey pars dorsalis and connects with ventral striatum; lSNc corresponds to the ventrolateral columnar part of SNc and connects to the motor regions of dorsal striatum. Finally, our vSN corresponds to the ventral densocellular portion that projects to the middle, associative, part of the striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haber, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the cortical projections of SN subdivisions we identified using diffusion tractography also fit with this limbic (mSNc), associative (vSN), and somatomotor (lSNc) organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). This specific association of lSNc with sensorimotor cortex explains its crucial role in the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease, in which ventrolateral SNc is preferentially targeted by neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gibb and Lees, 1991</xref>). It is worth mentioning that this organizational pattern of SN projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was detected by using a winner-takes-all approach, which emphasizes the distinct connections among subdivisions. A more lenient threshold for the identification of connections reveals large overlaps of anatomical connections among SN subdivisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The three SN subdivisions have different but overlapping connectional profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, while SN-vmPFC connections were mostly derived from medial SNc, the other two subdivisions also made considerable contributions. This is consistent with the view that vmPFC is a connectional hub that integrates broad domains of information to support the valuation process during decision-making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benoit et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Roy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The inverted dorsal/ventral topography of SN-striatum connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haber, 2014</xref>) found here has previously been described in human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chowdhury et al., 2013</xref>).

In contrast to this study, we used the whole-brain connectivity profiles to identify the subareas within SN instead of using predefined regions of interest restricted to striatal regions.</p><p>Recently, whole-brain tractography was also performed on the HCP dataset to identify the major brainstem white matter tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meola et al., 2016</xref>). Two distinct fiber tracts were found projecting through SN: the frontopontine tract (FPT) connecting prefrontal cortex and anterior SN and running through the anterior limb of the internal capsule, and the corticospinal tract (CST) connecting motor cortex and posterior SN and passing through the posterior limb of the internal capsule. This accords with our fiber-tracking results, with vSN mainly connecting to the prefrontal cortex through the anterior limb of the internal capsule adjacent to the anterior dorsal striatum (including the body of caudate and anterior part of putamen), and lSNc preferentially connecting to the sensorimotor cortex via the posterior limb of the internal capsule and adjacent posterior dorsal striatum (including the tail of caudate and posterior putamen). We identified an additional fiber tract, i.e. a mesolimbic pathway connecting medial SNc with ventral striatum, vmPFC and OFC. On the other hand, some detected connections of SN were unexpected. For instance, the midbrain projections to visual cortex are sparse in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012</xref>), but we detected relatively strong anatomical connections between mSNc and visual areas using both probabilistic and deterministic tractography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). This might be caused by an intersection of mSNc outflow with the temporo-parieto-occipito-pontine tract in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Meola et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The somatomotor to associative to limbic (from lateral to medial) organization of SN accords with the cortical arrangement of information flow proposed by Mesulam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mesulam, 1998</xref>), in which unimodal areas project to heteromodal associative, and then to prelimbic and limbic regions. A recent study proposed a similar gradient of cortical information processing based on resting state fMRI data from the HCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). Our results suggest that the somatomotor to associative to limbic principle of cortical organization appears to be reflected in the SN.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Value and salience coding in SN projections</title><p>We found a dissociation between coding of value and salience within SN subdivisions and their projections. While all three subdivisions responded to both winning and losing money during the gambling task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), only mSNc encoded a classical value signal, showing significantly greater BOLD response to wins than losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Medial SNc preferentially connects to limbic areas including ventral striatum, ventral pallidum, hippocampus, amygdala and OFC/vmPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These brain regions have been reported to support value-based reinforcement learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Garrison et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Glimcher, 2011</xref>), and goal-directed behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Goto and Grace, 2005</xref>), and have been implicated in drug addiction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, vSN encoded salience, showing a similar BOLD response to rewarding and aversive events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Ventral SN mainly connects to the prefrontal cortex and salience network, including lateral frontal cortex, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, dACC and anterior insula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These brain areas are associated with attention, orientation and cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Menon and Uddin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Uddin, 2015</xref>). Finally, the lSNc subdivision also appeared to encode salience, responding equally to monetary gains and losses. In contrast to the mesocortical pathway derived from vSN, the predominant projections of lSNc were with the motor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and posteriorly into the parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The value/salience dissociation of lateral and medial SNc corresponds to the findings from recordings in Macaque midbrain dopamine neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>). A somewhat similar functional dissociation in SN was reported in a fMRI study with a Pavlovian learning paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pauli et al., 2015</xref>), with the lateral SN encoding a prediction signal for aversive events, and the medial SN encoding a reward prediction error signal for appetitive learning.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>SN and impulsivity</title><p>Impulsivity has been reported to contribute to a wide range of psychopathology including bipolar disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Swann et al., 2009</xref>), ADHD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Winstanley et al., 2006</xref>), alcohol and substance dependence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ersche et al., 2010</xref>), pathological gambling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leeman and Potenza, 2012</xref>) and addictive behaviors in Parkinsonâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Averbeck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dagher and Robbins, 2009</xref>). A current account of impulsivity assigns a key role to midbrain dopamine neurons, which modulate choice behaviors through the direct and indirect corticostriatal pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buckholtz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dalley and Roiser, 2012</xref>). Specifically, phasic bursts of dopamine firing enhance impulsive and risk-taking behaviors through D1 receptors within the direct pathway, while pauses in dopamine firing activate inhibitory control through D2 receptors within the indirect pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Collins and Frank, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox et al., 2015</xref>). Impulsivity may also be a reflection of top-down cortical and striatal control of SN activity.</p><p>The multi-dimensional view of impulsivity proposes at least two major components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Meda et al., 2009</xref>), namely impulsive action and impulsive choice. Here, we included two different impulsivity measures, the Delay Discounting task (impulsive choice) and the Flanker inhibitory control task (impulsive action), and explored the neural basis of these two constructs.</p><p>Our results suggest that two different dopamine systems modulate these two components of impulsivity in parallel. Specifically, decisional impulsivity, measured by the Delay Discounting task, was associated with the value-coding system comprising mSNc and VS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Stronger value-coding signals in these areas were associated with more impulsive choices during delay discounting, meaning higher preference for immediate and smaller rewards. Meanwhile, motor impulsivity measured by the Flanker inhibitory control task was associated with the salience-coding system consisting of dACC and anterior insula (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Stronger BOLD signals in the salience network predicted better attentional inhibitory control. This finding is consistent with the theory that anterior insula plays an important role in inhibitory control by increasing the saliency of stimuli, especially for unexpected events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ghahremani et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations</title><p>We included a large population of healthy young subjects acquired from the public HCP dataset. Multimodal data included structural, diffusion-weighted and functional MRI, as well as behavioral impulsivity measures. There were a few missing imaging or behavioral data and some datasets failed during additional preprocessing. The final dataset included 485 subjects for the gambling-task fMRI data, 430 subjects for the diffusion data, and 488 subjects for the behavioral measures. In the end, we had over 400 overlapping subjects who had all three modalities.</p><p>The SN is a small nucleus located in the brainstem, where MRI data usually suffer from distortions and signal losses. Partial volume effect might have impacted the imaging data, especially for fMRI. However, in the HCP data, these problems have been mitigated by advanced high-resolution imaging sequences and preprocessing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Glasser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sotiropoulos et al., 2013</xref>). Still, one potential limitation of the current study is inferring midbrain dopaminergic projections from diffusion MRI. Diffusion tractography has several known limitations, including the inability to perfectly resolve crossing fibers, a relatively high susceptibility to false positives and negatives and a tendency to terminate in gyral crowns as opposed to sulci, resulting in diminished anatomical accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jbabdi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jones et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Thomas et al., 2014</xref>). A greater concern, however, is the possibility of systematic biases in probabilistic tractography that may give an incorrect impression of whole-brain SN connectivity patterns. For example, it is accepted that connections are less likely to be detected if they travel a long distance, exhibit marked curvature or branching, travel close to cerebrospinal fluid, or pass through more complex white matter regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jbabdi et al., 2015</xref>). Most of our results are unlikely to be due to such biases. First, although the SN parcellation and projection maps were based on diffusion tractography, they also reveal a functional dissociation. That is, projection maps of SN subdivisions reflect a limbic, associative and somatomotor organization, rather than a purely geometric pattern. Moreover, our parcellation of SN accords closely with tract tracing studies in macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Haber, 2014</xref>). The inverted dorsal-ventral topology of SN-striatum connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) is difficult to account for based on a distance or curvature bias; however, the medial-lateral gradient of SN projections with basal ganglia described here could reflect such a limitation. We found that medial SNc mainly connects with the medial part of nucleus accumbens and globus pallidus, while lateral SNc predominantly connects with lateral dorsal striatum, including tail of caudate and posterior putamen. This medial-lateral arrangement could result from a bias of tractography. While the SN-striatum arrangement is in accordance with known connectivity in macaque (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Haber et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Haber and Knutson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lynd-Balta and Haber, 1994</xref>) and other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">DÃ¼zel et al., 2009</xref>), it is possible that SN-pallidal connections described here are artifactual, as they do not accord with previously documented anatomical connections of basal ganglia. The pattern of SN-striatum connections is also consistent with the presumed functional roles of medial (limbic) and lateral (motor) structures in both SN and striatum. Regarding SN-cortical connections, the predominant topology found here is not medial-lateral. For example, the lateral SNc connects mostly medially in primary and supplementary motor areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Indeed, the topological arrangement of SN-cortical connections exhibits a rotation from medio-lateral in SN to ventro-dorsal (and rostro-caudal) in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as described previously for tractography of the ventral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jbabdi et al., 2013</xref>). Another limitation is that connectivity measured by diffusion tractography cannot resolve the direction of a connection, which makes it impossible to distinguish efferent dopamine projections from top-down fronto-nigral or striato-nigral projections.</p><p>Thus, although our results are consistent with those of Matsumoto and Hikosaka in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>), in which there is a medial to lateral gradient for reward/salience coding, we cannot attribute either connectivity or fMRI activation to dopamine neurons per se. The population of neurons in VTA and SN is heterogeneous and includes GABAergic and glutamatergic projection neurons and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Henny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Morales and Margolis, 2017</xref>). Thus, despite a reward/salience dissociation found in SN activation and projections, our results do not contradict the theory that dopamine neurons in SN/VTA are predominantly excited by reward and reward prediction error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fiorillo, 2013</xref>). It is also notable that the fMRI results demonstrated a salience response (i.e. to both wins and losses) throughout the SN, consistent with recordings in monkeys, and that our connectivity findings support the theory that predominantly reward versus predominantly salience coding SN neurons belong to different brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bromberg-Martin et al., 2010</xref>). Note, however, that our inability to assign activation or connectivity to dopamine neurons (rather than SN neurons generally) means that our results do not contradict the alternative interpretation that no dopamine neurons encode actual aversive value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fiorillo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schultz et al., 2017</xref>). These authors suggest that dopamine neurons have an initial positive short-latency response to all stimuli that depends on their intensity, but that the subsequent response always encodes true value (activation for rewards, suppression for punishments).</p><p>Finally, we describe associations between behavioral measures of impulsivity and BOLD activation during the gambling task. While these findings indicate a relationship between intrinsic organization of SN-related brain networks and impulsivity, the correlation values are small (on the order of 0.1). Therefore, most of the variability in behavior is accounted by other factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We subdivided the human SN into three subpopulations according to anatomical connectivity profiles, with a dorsal-ventral and lateral-medial arrangement. Our three-way partition of SN reveals multiple dopaminergic systems in human SN, showing a limbic, cognitive and motor arrangement, and encoding value and salience signals separately through distinct networks. Corresponding to this connectional arrangement, we also found dissociable functional response during the gambling task and correlations with impulsivity measures. Specifically, the mSNc-VS system was involved in value-coding and associated with impulsive choice, while the vSN-dACC-insula system was involved in salience-coding and associated with response inhibition. Building on the traditional reward prediction error model of dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schultz, 1998</xref>), our study provides evidence for the connectional and functional disassociations of SN neurons in humans, which encode motivational value and salience, possibly through different dopaminergic pathways. We also extended the current view on the role of dopamine in impulsivity by uncovering different neural substrates for decisional and motor impulsivity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects and data acquisition</title><p>Data from 485 healthy individuals (age: 29.1Â Â±Â 3.5 years, 202 females) were obtained from the 500-subject release of the Human Connectome Project (HCP RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_008749">SCR_008749</ext-link>) database from March 2015.

The parcellation of SN was carried out on 120 randomly selected subjects in order to limit computation time and data storage. To test the robustness of parcellation, we randomly divided the 120-subject dataset in half and applied the parcellation procedure (as explained below) independently in each group.

Detailed descriptions of these tasks are available in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barch et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, the Delay discounting paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Estle et al., 2006</xref>) was selected as the measure of self-regulation and impulsive choice, which describes the temporal discounting of monetary rewards. Subjects choose between a smaller immediate and a larger delayed reward. A discounting measure of area-under-the-curve (AUC; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Myerson et al., 2001</xref>]) was calculated based on participantsâ choices across a series of trials, ranging from 1 (no discounting) to 0 (maximum discounting) with larger values representing less impulsive decisions.

The Flanker Inhibitory Control Task from the NIH Toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nihtoolbox.org">http://www.nihtoolbox.org</ext-link>) was selected as a measure of response inhibition.

Here, we hypothesized that ventral striatum and vmPFC were part of a value-coding system (with greater activation to reward than punishment), while dACC and anterior insula were more involved in salience-coding (i.e. responding similarly to reward and punishment). Note that we use a definition of salience as an equal response to rewarding and aversive events, as used in monkey electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>) and human fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rutledge et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Connectivity-based parcellation of SN</title><p>A data-driven connectivity-based brain parcellation procedure was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al.

A target mask was constructed for each subject that includes all brain voxels (white or gray matter) connecting to the seed region. The whole-brain connectivity profile for each SN voxel was then saved as a connectivity map, where the intensity shows how many streamlines reach the target area and is therefore a measure of the connectivity strength between the seed and target. These connectivity maps were used to generate a connectivity matrix with each row representing the whole-brain connectivity profile of one seed voxel. Next, a correlation matrix was calculated as a measure of similarity between the connectivity profiles of each voxel pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Johansen-Berg et al., 2004</xref>). Spectral clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shi and Malik, 2000</xref>) was applied to the similarity matrix to identify clusters with distinct connectivity profiles. We applied this procedure separately for each subject and each hemisphere to generate a series of parcellation maps for all individuals at different resolutions (i.e. numbers of regions/parcels). Considering the small size of the SN, we chose cluster numbers ranging from 2 to 8 in each hemisphere and chose the most stable and consistent parcellation map (see below).</p><p>An additional group-parcellation procedure was applied to summarize the general pattern of parcellation across subjects.

Specifically, we randomly split the entire group into two non-overlapping subgroups 100 times and generated the group parcellation maps for each subgroup separately. The consistency between each pair of parcellation maps was evaluated by different stability indices, including normalized mutual information (NMI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), Dice coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and Cramerâs V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fan et al., 2014</xref>). The average indices among 100 samples were calculated to represent the stability of each parcellation.

The resulting connectivity maps were first normalized by the size of the seed region and total number of streamlines (i.e. 10,000) in order to generate the relative tracing strength from the seed to the rest of the brain. A threshold of 0.001 (i.e. 10 out of 10,000) was then used to remove noise effects of fiber tracking. The resulting individual tractograms were combined to generate a population map of the major fiber projections for each SN subdivision. Another probabilistic threshold of 50% was applied to the population fiber-tract maps (i.e. at least half of subjects showing each retained fiber tract). This resulted in a group averaged tractogram for each subdivision of SN. Finally, a maximum probability map (MPM) of fiber tracts, which represents distinct components of fiber projections for each subdivision, was also generated based on the population fiber-tract maps. Specifically, a connectome mask was first generated for each subdivision by binarizing its group tractography map with connectivity probability at 0.01. Note that different probability thresholds do not change the organizational pattern, but only enlarge or shrink the coverage of major fiber tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Each voxel within the combined connectome mask was then classified according to the SN subdivisions with which it had the highest connectivity. This calculation of MPM on probabilistic tractography has been widely used in subdividing brain structures, including thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrens et al., 2003</xref>), amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Saygin et al., 2011</xref>) and striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>). Here, we use this method to generate the organizational topography of fiber projections among SN subdivisions.</p><p>A quantitative representation of the connectivity profiles was also generated by calculating the connectivity fingerprints between each SN subdivision and each cortical/subcortical area. A recently published brain atlas based on anatomical connectivity profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fan et al., 2016</xref>) was chosen to define the target areas, consisting of a fine-grained parcellation of frontal, parietal, temporal, occipital cortex, limbic areas, as well as striatum and thalamus. The relative connectivity strength between each SN subdivision and each brain parcel for an individual was calculated by dividing the streamline counts by the size of each SN subdivision and each target area, as well as the total number of streamlines from each SN subdivision (i.e. 10,000). Next, we scaled this tracing strength by dividing it with the total tracing strength from the entire SN seed, which yields, for each target region and SN subdivision, the proportion of SN-target projections starting from that subdivision relative to the other two subdivisions. These normalized connectivity values were used to estimate the connectivity fingerprints for each SN subdivision.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Neural activity during gambling task and correlations with impulsivity measures</title><p>This dissociation of reward value and motivational salience assessed by simultaneous manipulation of appetitive and aversive outcomes has been used often in the animal and human literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bissonette et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roesch and Olson, 2004</xref>). Several studies have provided evidence for this dissociation in prefrontal and cingulate areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kahnt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Litt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roesch and Olson, 2004</xref>), and in midbrain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cohen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Matsumoto and Hikosaka, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rigoli et al., 2016</xref>). Here, based on the rewarding and aversive outcomes of the fMRI gambling task, two new contrasts were defined, thatÂ is, a value signal as the difference in BOLD response to rewarding and aversive outcomes, and a salience signal as the average response to reward and punishment.</p><p>Moreover, to examine the association between task-related BOLD activity and impulsivity measures, we performed partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the PLScmd Matlab toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/pls/">http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/pls/</ext-link>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McIntosh et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McIntosh and Lobaugh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">MiÅ¡iÄ et al., 2016</xref>]), which identifies linear combinations of brain activity and behavioral measures that maximally covary with each other. Briefly, a singular value decomposition was first performed on the correlation matrix of brain and behavioral data. The brain data included the BOLD response of three SN subdivisions and four other regions (VS, vmPFC, dorsal ACC, insula) under the condition of either value- or salience-coding. The behavioral data consisted of the two behavioral measures of impulsivity. A set of mutually orthogonal latent variables (LVs) was identified, where the left and right singular vector weights correspond to an optimal combination of BOLD response and behaviors, respectively. The effect size of each component was estimated as the ratio of the squared singular value to the sum of squared singular values from the decomposition. The overall significance of each pattern was assessed by permutation tests, whereby subject labels are randomly permuted and a distribution of singular values is generated under the null hypothesis that there exists no relation between the brain and behavioral data. p-Values were estimated as the proportion of permuted singular values that exceed the original singular value. The reliability with which each region or behavior contributes to the multivariate pattern was estimated by bootstrap resampling: participants were sampled with replacement to construct a sampling distribution for each weight. To identify weights that (a) make a large contribution to the multivariate pattern and (b) are stable across many resamplings, we estimated bootstrap ratios: singular vector weights divided by their bootstrap-estimated standard errors. If the bootstrap distribution is approximately unit normal, the bootstrap ratio is approximately equivalent to a z-score (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Efron and Tibshirani, 1986</xref>). We therefore thresholded all weights at bootstrap ratios equal to 1.96, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data Availability</title><p>TheÂ resulting maps from our study are available atÂ <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.neurovault.org/collections/2860/">https://www.neurovault.org/collections/2860/.</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by funding from the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anatomical and functional organization of the human substantia nigra and its connections&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by David Van Essen (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Heidi Johansen-Berg (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Suzanne N Haber (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thorough and thoughtful study assessing the anatomy and functional specialisations of subregions of the human substantia nigra. The study has a number of strengths including use of a relatively large, high quality dataset, careful methodological steps such as assessing repeatability across samples and assessing clustering across a range of different cluster numbers. Overall the connectivity profiles of the SN are convincing and relatively consistent with the literature with some exceptions (see below). Indeed, given the small size of the SN, these results are impressive. However, there are a few issues that should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Subsection âSeed regionsâ, last paragraph â why would an equal response to reward and punishment be more involved in salience-coding? Given that these are both value-coding, isn't is possible that the dACC and insula may not distinguish between these valences, but nonetheless are coding general value. Using a neutral, surprise stimulus might be a better way to evaluate salience. It would be helpful to clarify the motivation for the stimuli chosen.</p><p>2) Due to its relatively small size, identifying SN in MR images is challenging. The authors use a substantia nigra ROI obtained from a publicly available 7T MRI atlas and register this to every individual subject. It would be good for the authors to illustrate (maybe in a figure supplement), how well this approach works. Are registration errors due to algorithmic inaccuracies/individual anatomy differences small enough to ensure reliable identification of SN across all subjects in dMRI space?</p><p>3) Some of the connectivity profiles are surprising and not supported by the literature. This is likely due to the pitfalls of diffusion and/or seed placement. Nonetheless, the authors should recognize them in the Discussion and address what might account for these mismatches. Moreover, these connections are not as black and white as the authors suggest. Indeed, some of their data show this, but the text doesn't reflect it. Below are some examples.</p><p>The mSNc preferentially is connected to the striatum compared to the vSN and lSNc. Since all parts of the SNc project to the striatum, one would expect both the v and lSNc to have strong projections there. One likely explanation is that the majority of fibers from the SNC to the striatum travel medially, turning dorsally and curving around the STN as they travel rostrally to the striatum. Thus, a seed placed in the mSNc will capture a large group (but not all) striatal fibers, and would likely include those from lateral and more ventral areas.</p><p>The lSNc mainly connects to the somatomotor and dorsal attention networks. The somatomotor connections are consistent with the literature, but why would this region target the dorsal attentional network primarily. One might expect a mixture of connections from both the lSNc and the vSNc. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, there appears to be a contribution from the vSNc, which is greater than that from the mSNC, albeit less than lSNc.</p><p>Why would the mSNc preferentially connect to visual areas?</p><p>Why would the vSN connect to the GPe, while the mSNc connect to the GPi and VP? Again, this is likely due to the seed placement and the streamlines that are captured rather than a reflection of actual connections.</p><p>4) Statistics for FMRI â the aim of the FMRI is to 'determine the different functional roles of different SN subdivisions'. However, the statistical contrasts run are not appropriate to address this aim as no direct comparisons between SN subdivisions are made. For both the whole brain analysis and the ROI analysis significant differences are found for reward v punishment in the VS and vmPFC whereas no significant differences for reward vs punishment are found in anterior insula, dorsal ACC and dorsal striatum. The opposing pattern is found for salience. However, a difference in significance does not imply a significant difference.</p><p>Similarly, these results do not show anatomically specific encoding of reward/salience. To make this conclusion requires direct statistical comparison between the regions â i.e. to test for an interaction between reward and region in the ROI analysis â and/or between the conditions â e.g. to directly contrast reward and salience in the whole brain analysis. Such tests are essential for the conclusion in the Discussion that &quot;we found a double dissociation between coding of value and salience within SN subdivisions and their projections&quot;.</p><p>5) Correlations between FMRI and behaviour:</p><p>These correlations should be corrected for multiple comparisons (number of regions x number of behavioural measures). The authors show that value activity in medial SNc and VS correlated with delay discounting but not with flanker. Again, a difference in statistical significance doesn't imply that these correlations are significantly different. If the authors wish to conclude that these brain areas are more strongly correlated with response inhibition than motor inhibition then this requires a direct statistical test to compare the two correlations (e.g. using Fishers test). The same is true for the opposite patterns for dACC etc.</p><p>6) The same points about multiple comparisons and comparisons between correlations can also be made for the connectivity strength section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26653.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a thorough and thoughtful study assessing the anatomy and functional specialisations of subregions of the human substantia nigra.

In the neuronal recordings of Hikosaka in monkeys, DA neurons said to encode âvalueâ are those that respond with increased firing to rewards (juice) and reduced firing to punishments (airpuff). On the other hand, neurons said to encode motivational âsalienceâ respond equally to juice and airpuffs i.e. appear to encode the absolute value of the stimulus (whether rewarding or aversive). Note that this interpretation has been questioned by Fiorillo (Fiorillo, 2013) and Schultz (Schultz et al., 2017), who argue that no dopamine neurons encode actual aversive value. They suggest that dopamine neurons have an initial positive short-latency response to all stimuli that depends on their intensity, but that the subsequent response always encodes true value (activation for rewards, suppression for punishments). (Events on this time scale are too fast for fMRI to resolve.)</p><p>The monkey literature is concerned with individual DA neurons. However, similar arguments can apply at the spatial resolution of fMRI. Glimcher and Rutledge dissociated âvalueâ, specifically reward prediction error (RPE), and âsalienceâ (as defined here) in humans using fMRI and monetary reward (Rutledge et al., 2010). They define value in the usual sense for monetary reward, as the signed monetary amount of the reward. In their work, RPE (value) is found to be encoded by BOLD signal in the ventral striatum, while salience is encoded in the insula. Here a salience signal is one that reflects the absolute value of the monetary outcome (i.e. greater for large gains <italic>and</italic> large losses).</p><p>We now describe this as follows (Material and methods section âNeural activity during gambling task and correlations with impulsivity measuresâ):</p><p>âThis dissociation of reward value and motivational salience assessed by simultaneous manipulation of appetitive and aversive outcomes has been used often in the animal and human literature (Roesch and Olson, 2004; Bissonette et al., 2014). [â¦] Here, based on the rewarding and aversive outcomes of the fMRI gambling task, two new contrasts were defined, i.e. a value signal as the difference in BOLD response to rewarding and aversive outcomes, and a salience signal as the average response to reward and punishment.â</p><p>And in the Discussion:</p><p>âNote, however, that our inability to assign activation or connectivity to dopamine neurons (rather than SN neurons generally) means that our results do not contradict the alternative interpretation that no dopamine neurons encode actual aversive value (Fiorillo, 2013; Schultz et al., 2017). These authors suggest that dopamine neurons have an initial positive short-latency response to all stimuli that depends on their intensity, but that the subsequent response always encodes true value (activation for rewards, suppression for punishments).â</p><p>We agree with the reviewer(s) that salience could also be defined relative to outcome probability (i.e. salience equals surprise), but this was not manipulated in the current study. Given that HCP is an open access database not designed by us, we took the data available. Thus, we defined value encoding as greater BOLD response to rewarding than aversive outcomes, and salience encoding as greater response to rewards and punishments than neutral.</p><p>In this study, we used the cope images of rewarding and aversive outcomes provide by the HCP dataset. Two contrasts were defined, namely the value effect as the difference in BOLD response to rewarding and aversive outcomes, and the salience effect as the average response to reward and punishment.

The authors use a substantia nigra ROI obtained from a publicly available 7T MRI atlas and register this to every individual subject. It would be good for the authors to illustrate (maybe in a figure supplement), how well this approach works. Are registration errors due to algorithmic inaccuracies/individual anatomy differences small enough to ensure reliable identification of SN across all subjects in dMRI space?</p></disp-quote><p>We performed quality control (visual inspection) on every registration of individual brains (T1w) to stereotaxic space. We show the location of the SN mask on the group averaged structural images and FA maps of 430 HCP subjects in stereotaxic space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Despite variations in brain shapes and gross anatomy, the approach identifies the correct location for human substantia nigra on average. All individual brains and the transformed SN masks can be provided if needed. The mask position is also compared to the Keuken and Forstmann (2015) atlas (Keuken and Forstmann, 2015) in the coronal plane in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>T atlas of Basal ganglia illustrating the location of Substantia Nigra.</title><p>Figure adapted from the Keuken and Forstmann (2015) atlas.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26653-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Also, this mask is only used to limit the search volume for parcellation.

This is likely due to the pitfalls of diffusion and/or seed placement. Nonetheless, the authors should recognize them in the Discussion and address what might account for these mismatches. Moreover, these connections are not as black and white as the authors suggest. Indeed, some of their data show this, but the text doesn't reflect it. Below are some examples.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the discussion for the connectivity profiles of SN subregions. First, it is true that there are large areas of overlap among projections from the three SN subdivisions, especially in prefrontal and striatal areas. Therefore, it is true that some of the figures could give the impression that connectivity was more segregated than it is in reality â however, other figures did show the overlap, especially among cortical projections of the three subdivisions (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we used a relatively high threshold on tractography maps to emphasize the differences of cortical projections among SN subdivisions (probability of connectivity=0.05). With a lower threshold of connectivity probability at 0.01, we can now see the overlap among the major fiber tracts. We have added this as a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Second, a winner-takes-all approach was used to generate the maximum probability map (MPM) of tractograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. This emphasizes the differences in connectivity profiles among SN subdivisions, but obscures areas of overlap. The method is explained in detail in the subsection âSubdivisions of SNâ. Such an approach has been used to show distinct projections within subareas of thalamus (Behrens et al., 2003), amygdala (Saygin et al., 2011) and striatum (Cohen et al., 2009). Nonetheless, the MPM of fiber tracts only indicates the distinctive parts of SN projections, which depends on the chosen threshold of connectivity probability, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>. The overlaps of fiber projections among SN subregions are now also shown in both the connectivity patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and fingerprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>We have added the following caveat to the Discussion:</p><p>âIt is worth mentioning that this organizational pattern of SN projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) was detected by using a winner-takes-all approach, which emphasizes the distinct connections among subdivisions. [â¦] For example, while SN-vmPFC connections were mostly derived from medial SNc, the other two subdivisions also made considerable contributions. This is consistent with the view that vmPFC is a connectional hub that integrates broad domains of information to support the valuation process during decision-making (Roy et al., 2012; Benoit et al., 2014).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The mSNc preferentially is connected to the striatum compared to the vSN and lSNc. Since all parts of the SNc project to the striatum, one would expect both the v and lSNc to have strong projections there. One likely explanation is that the majority of fibers from the SNC to the striatum travel medially, turning dorsally and curving around the STN as they travel rostrally to the striatum. Thus, a seed placed in the mSNc will capture a large group (but not all) striatal fibers, and would likely include those from lateral and more ventral areas.</p></disp-quote><p>The statement on mSNc preferential connection to striatum was incorrect, and in contradiction to the rest of the paper. It was present in the legends to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Indeed, in the manuscript, we emphasized repeatedly in the text and figures that all three SN subregions connect to different parts of striatum (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

This inverted dorsal-ventral arrangement is unlikely due to the propensity of diffusion imaging to identify tracts that are more direct. A medial-lateral gradient was also present such that medial SNc mainly connects with the medial part of Nuclear Accumbens and Globus Pallidus, while lateral SNc predominantly connects with lateral striatum, including tail of Caudate and posterior putamen. This medial-lateral organization might indeed be a result of the greater ease in identifying white matter connections that are shorter and less curved (Jbabdi et al., 2015). We now discuss this potential bias in the limitations section.</p><p>âMost of our results are unlikely to be due to such biases. [â¦] Indeed the topological arrangement of SN-cortical connections exhibits a rotation from medio-lateral in SN to ventro-dorsal (and rostro-caudal) in cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), as described previously for tractography of the ventral prefrontal cortex (Jbabdi et al., 2013).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The lSNc mainly connects to the somatomotor and dorsal attention networks. The somatomotor connections are consistent with the literature, but why would this region target the dorsal attentional network primarily. One might expect a mixture of connections from both the lSNc and the vSNc. Indeed, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, there appears to be a contribution from the vSNc, which is greater than that from the mSNC, albeit less than lSNc.</p></disp-quote><p>The dorsal attentional network based on resting-sate functional MRI includes frontal eye fields (FEF) and precentral regions as well areas in intraparietal sulcus and superior partial lobe (Yeo et al., 2011).

The connectional profiles and fingerprints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>) showed that lSNc most strongly connects with the precentral gyrus and parietal areas, areas with well-described motor function. (Put another way, the resting state network called âdorsal attentionâ includes motor areas such as premotor cortex and posterior parietal cortex.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why would the mSNc preferentially connect to visual areas?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree: direct monosynaptic projection from SN to visual areas appear to be relatively sparse (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012). Comparing our mSNc projections with the Brainstem tractographic atlas based on this dataset (Meola et al., 2016), we found some overlap between mSNc projections and the pathways of the temporo-parieto-occipito-pontine tract (TPO-PT) in the posterior limb of the internal capsule. The connection could therefore be artifactual. (Interestingly, however, one of the frequent symptoms of dopaminergic overdose in Parkinsonâs disease is visual hallucinations, which is thought to implicate dopamine signaling in visual areas.)</p><p>We have added the following text as a qualification:</p><p>âOn the other hand, some detected connections of SN were unexpected. For instance, the midbrain projections to visual cortex are sparse in rodents (Watabe-Uchida et al., 2012), but we detected relatively strong anatomical connections between mSNc and visual areas using both probabilistic and deterministic tractography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). This might be caused by an intersection of mSNc outflow with the temporo-parieto-occipito-pontine tract in the posterior limb of the internal capsule (Meola et al., 2016).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why would the vSN connect to the GPe, while the mSNc connect to the GPi and VP? Again, this is likely due to the seed placement and the streamlines that are captured rather than a reflection of actual connections.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, SN projections to pallidum showed a medial-lateral gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), with medial SNc showing dominant connections with the internal part of the globus pallidus and ventral pallidum while vSN more strongly connected to external part of the globus pallidus. We agree that this could be due to a bias of tractography, and we now address this specifically within the new section on limitations:</p><p>â[â¦] it is quite possible that SN-pallidal connections described here are artifactual, as they do not accord with previously documented anatomical connections of basal ganglia.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Statistics for FMRI â the aim of the FMRI is to 'determine the different functional roles of different SN subdivisions'. However, the statistical contrasts run are not appropriate to address this aim as no direct comparisons between SN subdivisions are made. For both the whole brain analysis and the ROI analysis significant differences are found for reward v punishment in the VS and vmPFC whereas no significant differences for reward vs punishment are found in anterior insula, dorsal ACC and dorsal striatum. The opposing pattern is found for salience. However, a difference in significance does not imply a significant difference.</p><p>Similarly, these results do not show anatomically specific encoding of reward/salience. To make this conclusion requires direct statistical comparison between the regions â i.e. to test for an interaction between reward and region in the ROI analysis â and/or between the conditions â e.g. to directly contrast reward and salience in the whole brain analysis. Such tests are essential for the conclusion in the Discussion that &quot;we found a double dissociation between coding of value and salience within SN subdivisions and their projections&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have performed more statistical analysis to address this issue.</p><p>First, a whole-brain contrast between value- and salience-related BOLD responses confirmed that there were separated brain systems for value and salience coding. The value-related response was defined as the difference in BOLD response to winning versus losing outcomes, while the salience-related response was defined as the average response to wins and losses. A paired t-test was used to show the differences in brain response to value vs salience (thus defined). For instance, ventral striatum (peak: x=0, y=6, z=-12; T=27.76) and vmPFC (peak: x=0, y=58, z=-4; T=30.03) showed greater evidence for value-coding, while dACC (peak: x=-4, y=8, z=26; T=11.91) and anterior insula (peak: x=40, y=20, z=-2; T=33.20) showed greater evidence for salience-coding.</p><p>Second, âtwo-way repeated measures ANOVA revealed a significant interaction effect between SN subdivisions and BOLD response to reward or punishment (F=6.6, p=0.0014). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, all three SN subregions were activated by both reward and punishment, but only medial SNc showed significantly greater neural activity to monetary gains than losses (T= 3.96, p&lt; 0.0001). Moreover, among the subdivisions of SN, medial SNc showed significantly higher BOLD response to positive value (gains) compared to the other two subdivisions (T= 3.52, p=0.0005 for vSN; T= 2.98, p=0.003 for lateral SNc), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3</xref>.â</p><p>âA significant interaction effect was also detected between the four target regions (VS, vmPFC, dACC, insula) and their BOLD response to reward or punishment (F=30.26, p-value=3e-19).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Correlations between FMRI and behaviour:</p><p>These correlations should be corrected for multiple comparisons (number of regions x number of behavioural measures). The authors show that value activity in medial SNc and VS correlated with delay discounting but not with flanker. Again, a difference in statistical significance doesn't imply that these correlations are significantly different. If the authors wish to conclude that these brain areas are more strongly correlated with response inhibition than motor inhibition then this requires a direct statistical test to compare the two correlations (e.g. using Fishers test). The same is true for the opposite patterns for dACC etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We now present the results corrected for multiple comparisons and compare the two correlations using Fisherâs test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, we start with a more sophisticated statistical analysis using partial least squares (PLS), which identifies orthogonal latent variables to show the dissociation between decisional and motor impulsivity. The PLS approach is described in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>âMoreover, to examine the association between task-related BOLD activity and impulsivity measures, we performed partial least squares (PLS) analysis using the PLScmd Matlab toolbox (http://www.rotman-baycrest.on.ca/pls/, (McIntosh et al., 1996; McIntosh and Lobaugh, 2004; MiÅ¡iÄ et al., 2016)), which identifies linear combinations of brain activity and behavioural measures that maximally covary with each other. [â¦] We therefore thresholded all weights at bootstrap ratios equal to 1.96, corresponding to a 95% confidence interval.â</p><p>The result of this analysis supports the anatomical dissociation between decisional and motor impulsivity:</p><p>âTo characterize the relationship between BOLD activity and impulsivity measures, behavioral PLS analysis was performed. [â¦] The resulting brain networks and behavioral measures are consequently independent if they belong to different components.â</p><p>Finally, we also provide the individual correlations between BOLD and impulsivity (as before) including Bonferroni correction and Fisherâs test:</p><p>âIndividual correlation analysis between BOLD response and impulsivity measure was also applied to confirm the observed brain-behaviour relations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). [â¦] Moreover, the correlation of value-coding response in VS was significantly higher with Delay-Discounting measures than inhibitory control scores (p=0.02), while the association of salience-coding response in anterior insula was significantly stronger with inhibitory control than Delay-Discounting (p=0.008).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The same points about multiple comparisons and comparisons between correlations can also be made for the connectivity strength section.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree. We have decided to remove this part of the analysis (and Figure 8) from the paper. The relationships between tractography findings and impulsivity, while intriguing, did not survive multiple comparisons and in any case were a minor part of the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
