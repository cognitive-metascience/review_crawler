Here, we explored the impact of social experiences on circulating oxytocin (OT) concentration, telomere length (TL), and novelty-seeking behaviour in male and female rats. Prolonged social housing raised circulating OT levels in both sexes while elongating TL only in females. Novelty-seeking behaviour in females was more responsive to social housing and increased OT levels than males. The OT antagonist (OT ANT) L-366,509 blocked the benefits of social housing in all conditions along with female-specific TL erosion and novelty-seeking deficit. Thus, females seem more susceptible than males to genetic and behavioural changes when the secretion of endogenous OT in response to social life is interrupted. Social enrichment may, therefore, provide a therapeutic avenue to promote stress resiliency and chances of healthy aging across generations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>social enrichment</kwd><kwd>oxytocin</kwd><kwd>telomere length</kwd><kwd>novelty seeking</kwd><kwd>corridor field task</kwd><kwd>oxytocin antagonist</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Metz</surname><given-names>Gerlinde AS</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Avicenna Institute of Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Basic Research Program 41108â010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moeeini</surname><given-names>Reza</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Social enrichment supports longevity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The quality and quantity of social relationships in the modern era are rapidly changing,Â with increasing social isolation, and many individualsÂ no longer living in extended families or missing close confidants. Restricted social relationships can endanger public health and increase mortality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mikosz et al., 2016</xref>). Males and females, both human and animal, respond differently to social interactions. Differences may range from changes in neurobiological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mikosz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stack et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ngun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cherif et al., 2003</xref>) to displaying distinctive gender-specific behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Szell and Thurner, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jukka-Pekka Onnela et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Palchykov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Trainor et al., 2011</xref>). Genetic and hormonal determinants regulate social behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Choleris et al., 2018</xref>) and dictate morphological and behavioural variations in males and females. Robust sexual dimorphism was found in the neuropeptide oxytocin (OT) receptor density throughout the rat brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2017</xref>) and in OT receptor signaling in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), whichÂ may modulate social interactions in females in response to OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>). Primarily synthesized in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) and supraoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jurek and Neumann, 2018</xref>), OT is a key hormonal correlate of social behaviours in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anacker and Beery, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Knobloch and Grinevich, 2014</xref>). OT exposure promotes social behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gamer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Guastella et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andari et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lim and Young, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bernaerts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">McGraw and Young, 2010</xref>) and facilitates adaptive responses to stressors and stress resiliency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Olff et al., 2013</xref>). OT has also been shown to prevent premature aging of muscle tissue and facilitates muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Elabd et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, it can be hypothesized that OT exposure influences the chances of healthy aging.</p><p>A specific cellular index which differs according to age and sex indicates changes in telomere length (TL). Telomeres are DNA-repetitive nucleotide segments at the ends of each chromosome in mammals that protect genetic material from degradation during somatic cell division. Telomeric DNA in humans naturally shortens with age, and therefore TL represents a sensitive indicator of tissue-specific cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Puterman et al., 2016</xref>). As TL decreases along with proliferation in each cell division, telomere shortening can be considered a measure of biological aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sahin and DePinho, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Blackburn, 2005</xref>). A variety of influences such as distress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Epel et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Epel et al., 2010</xref>), childhood adversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Puterman et al., 2016</xref>), interpersonal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Drury et al., 2014</xref>), social disadvantages and deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Theall et al., 2013</xref>), and social isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aydinonat et al., 2014</xref>) have been shown to be correlated with TL erosion. TL has also beenÂ shown to be positively associated with psychosocial factors, such as conscientiousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edmonds et al., 2015</xref>), optimism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schutte et al., 2016</xref>), social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Uchino et al., 2012</xref>), and social-pair mate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Johnsen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It appears that females generally haveÂ longer telomeres than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gardner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett and Richardson, 2011</xref>), and shorter telomeres in males are correlated with reduced social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zalli et al., 2014</xref>). This has led to the speculation that social experiences possibly make females more susceptible to telomere elongation than males, a lifestyle-dependent process that, in concert with sex-specific hormonal correlates results in longevity gender gaps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Merrill et al., 2017</xref>). Also, females show facilitated social learning compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ervin et al., 2015</xref>), along with estrogenic control of OT and OT receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anacker and Beery, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, we have recently shown that prolonged social experiences change brain structure and behaviours in a sexually dimorphic manner in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Faraji et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we investigated whether social experiences modulate genetic and behavioural repertoires through OT in male and female rats. Whereas OT facilitates novelty-seeking behaviour and TL, the OT antagonist (OT ANT) L-366,509 in sociallyÂ raised male and female rats intermittently reduced OT secretion. The results suggest that extended social experiences modulate novelty seeking and TL through OT in a sex-dependent manner, with females being more susceptible than males.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Social experience increased plasma OT concentration in females</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows changes in plasma OT concentrations across different groups as a function of housing condition (standard, <italic>males</italic>: nÂ =Â 23, <italic>females</italic>: nÂ =Â 21; social, <italic>males</italic>: nÂ =Â 22, <italic>females</italic>: nÂ =Â 22).

The present findings expand these earlier studies by demonstrating that social rearing elevates plasma OT concentration, and this hormonal response to social experience appears more prominent in females than males. Experiment 2 replicated these findings from Experiment 1.</p><p>ThereÂ areÂ two possible mechanisms thatÂ may underlie the dynamic interaction between social experience and OT. First, social interaction is associated with persistent sensory stimulation during development which may promote hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis function and brain plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zucchi et al., 2014</xref>). This assumption is supported by a recently published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>) in which sensory experiences in mice promoted cortical development by up-regulation of synthesis and secretion of OT. Second, ongoing emotional sharing and social support foster prolonged social relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beery and Kaufer, 2015</xref>) along with activation of the brainâs dopamine reward system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rilling et al., 2002</xref>). Both, regulating stress responses and rewarding social interaction, are vital corollaries in OT-mediated social engagement.</p><p>While OT is produced both centrally and peripherally, social cues generally cause OT releases centrally in the brain, which in turn modulates OT-receptor activities in the sociallyÂ relevant circuitry. Sex-specific differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Joel et al., 2015</xref>) in cortical regions including mPFC revealed higher OT receptor density and signaling in females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakajima et al., 2014</xref>). Accordingly, compared with males, vertebrate females appear sensitized to social support and interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Beery and Kaufer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ozbay et al., 2007</xref>) in terms of emotional expressions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kring and Gordon, 1998</xref>) and enhanced social cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gur et al., 2012</xref>).

The present changes after social experience for 3 mo address both types of intervening factors resulting in sex-specific regulation of social behaviour and exacerbated hormonal responses in female.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Social experiences promote novelty-seeking behaviour</title><p>The present experiments provide evidence for the involvement of OT in exploratory and novelty-seeking behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kazlauckas et al., 2005</xref>) encouraged by the novel central object in the CFT. In agreement with our previous findings, female rats that experienced social enrichment across development showed extended exploration of the central areas in the CFT, thus increasing the radius of exploratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faraji et al., 2014</xref>). The latter indicates lowered stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faraji et al., 2014</xref>), which agrees with the finding that sociallyÂ raised female rats display lower HPA axis response and reduced anxiety-related behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Faraji et al., 2018</xref>). Accordingly, intensified OT action through social enrichment enhances social bonding and reduces stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Swain et al., 2014</xref>).

Moreover, social relationships play key roles in the formation of emotional and social responsiveness that reduce aversive outcomes (e.g. fear and anger) in social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ozbay et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Averbeck, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sippel et al., 2015</xref>).

Axonal release of OT in the brain and in the circulatory system seem to be coordinated as central OT and peripheral OT in animals can be released simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wotjak et al., 1998</xref>). In humans, a correlation was shown between plasma and brain OT indicating that peripheral OT represents a suitable proxy of central OT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefevre et al., 2017</xref>). It is also important to consider that, as they share a common ontogenetic origin from ectoderm, both brain and skin tissues contain similar collagenous proteins, reticulin, vasculature, and connective tissues such as fibroblasts and adipocytes. Therefore, changes in peripheral TL in general, and skin cells in particular, predict TL alterations found in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hehar and Mychasiuk, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The present results revealed that exposure to the OT antagonist across development and during social experiences accelerates TL attrition only in females. A causal explanation of how social and neurohormonal processes interact to induce a sex-dependent effect on TL was beyond the scope of the experiments. Three lines of evidence, however, support the observation of TL alteration in socially enriched females: (1) correlation between OT and social behaviours in females is stronger than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barraza and Zak, 2009</xref>); (2) both social experiences and OT hormone blunt HPA axis activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sippel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ditzen et al., 2009</xref>); and more importantly, (3) TL shortening is associated with dysregulation of HPA axis activity and abnormal levels of cortisol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schutte et al., 2016</xref>). Hence, the pathways involved in social experience-induced OT responses may contribute to sex differences in TL in close interaction with the HPA system. Notably, social experiences in our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Faraji et al., 2018</xref>) reduced HPA axis activity in F0 female rats and the F1 non-social housing offspring born to social mothers, which suggests an intergenerational impact of social rearing history through regulation of theÂ HPA response in female rats. Various other genetic mechanisms not investigated here may also determine social behaviours. Immediate-early genes, such as <italic>zif268</italic> mRNA expression in the dorsal and ventral medial mPFC in rats, appear to be sexually dimorphic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stack et al., 2010</xref>). Because <italic>zif268</italic> expression can activate specific signaling pathways, it may lead to long-lasting synaptic changes in the brain. For example, rats show sexual dimorphism in neuronal firing rates in the barrel cortex in response to social interaction components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jurek and Neumann, 2018</xref>).</p><p>TakenÂ together, the present results suggest that a socially stimulating environment is especially critical to female health trajectories. Even short periods of OT inhibition make females vulnerable to TL shortening via OT-mediated dysregulation of HPA system activity. Although influenced by sex and gender (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mather et al., 2011</xref>), TL measurement may be a useful tool in future studies to understand and predict health and longevity particularly in females.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Social experiences provide a source of psychoneurophysiological empowerment in both humans and animals and promote healthy development and successful aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). The present data causally associate social stimulation with genetic and behavioural improvements possibly as a function of endogenous OT. The findings indicate that early social experiences may last far into adulthood and manifest in TL elongation and novelty-seeking enhancement as a function of sex. The impact on cortical neuroplasticity, neurohormonal and behavioural outcome may be transmitted to the F1 non-social offspring in a sexually dimorphic manner. Thus, a socially stimulating environment may promote stress resiliency and mental health not only in exposed individuals, but also in their intergenerationally programmed descendants. Social enrichment may therefore provide a therapeutic avenue to promote stress resiliency and chances of healthy aging across generations.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Male and female Wistar rats (222â430 g), bred and raised at the local vivarium were used in the present experiments. All animals were housed in a constant-temperature (21â24Â°C) room on a 12 h light/dark cycle (lights on at 7:30 am) with ad libitum access to food and water. Rats were handled for approximately 3Â min daily for 5 consecutive d prior to any experimental manipulations. Also, body weight in all animals was recorded every 4Â d. The behavioural testing was performed during the light phase of the cycle, at the same time of day by three experimenters blind to the experimental groups. All procedures in this study were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health Guide to the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, and were approved by the institutional animal care committee (Protocol No. 004674BGH; Avicenna Institute of Neuroscience-AINS).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experimental design</title><p>Experiment 1:Â pups and their mothers were left undisturbed from postnatal day (PND) 1â21. After weaning at PND 21, 48 pups (fiveÂ toÂ six rats per litter) gathered from nine different litters were randomly assigned to four experimental groups in two housing conditions: (1) standard housing (males, nÂ =Â 12), (2) standard housing (females, nÂ =Â 12), (3) social housing (males, nÂ =Â 12), and (4) social housing (females, nÂ =Â 12). Novelty-seeking behaviour analysis included seven standard animals (four males, three females) and six social animals (three males, three females) from a previous experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barrett and Richardson, 2011</xref>) to increase sample size. After living in either standard- or social-housing conditions for 86â89 d, all animals were subjected to blood sampling (days 83â86) and behavioural assessment (days 85â90). Animals were euthanized when behavioural assessments were completed. Experiment 2: at weaning, pups from 14 litters were randomly selected for Experiment 2. To accommodate OT antagonist (OT ANT) administration, animals were split into eight groups (nÂ =Â 10â11/group): (1,2) standard housing: male and female (CONTROL), (3,4) standard housing: male and female (OT ANT), (5,6) social housing: male and female (CONTROL), and (7,8) social housing: male and female (OT ANT). All animals were housed in either standard- or social-housing units for 84â90 d and were subjected to blood sampling on days 80â83 and behavioural assessments on days 84â89. Rats were euthanized when behavioural testing was completed on days 88â91.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Housing condition</title><p>A complete description of the housing condition was previously reported by this team (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Faraji et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, animals assigned to the social housing condition were housed and raised in groups of 10â11 within two separate social housing units (86 cmÂ ÃÂ 86 cm Ã 41 cm) with no additional environmental enrichment provided. Animals were constantly living in the same units until completion of the experiment. In contrast, rats assigned to standard housing conditions were housed and raised in non-sibling groups of two or three within Makrolon shoebox cages (86 cmÂ ÃÂ 86 cm Ã 41 cm). Animals were briefly removed from their environments when bedding material was changed. Animals in social and standard housing conditions were raised separated by sex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Blood sampling and oxytocin (OT) assay</title><p>Peripheral levels of OT (OTp) are assumed to reflect central releases of OT (OTc) in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wotjak et al., 1998</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lefevre et al., 2017</xref>) with some procedural exceptions. Blood samples (0.5â0.7 mL) were taken 1â2 d prior to behavioural assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Faraji et al., 2014</xref>) toÂ measure plasma concentration of OT using solid phase radioimmunoassay (RIA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alburges et al., 2000</xref>). Blood sample tubes containing aprotinin (500 kallikrein inactivation units/mL blood) were centrifuged at 3000 rpm (1700 g) for 15 min at 4Â°C. Plasma was stored at â70Â°C until analysis.

Administration occurred every other day (between 11:00Â amÂ andÂ 12:00 noon) for 42â43 d (in total, 42â43 doses/rat) to intermittently inhibit or reduce OT secretion. Administration of L-366,509 started within the first week of the experiment (day 5) and ended 14 h before perfusion. The L-366,509 dosage used in Experiment 2 was chosen based on the results in two pilot experiments (each nÂ =Â 3â5) that were found to significantly reduce plasma OT levels, and a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kobayashi et al., 1999</xref>).

Briefly, the floor of the CFT was divided into three zones: (1) corridor zone comprising the zone between external and internal walls; (2) open zone comprising the area within the task excluding corridor and the central zones; and (3) central zone comprising the middle area of the arena. Both variations of the CFT (plain CFT without a central object, and CFT with a central object) were used in the present study to assess locomotor aspects of free exploration. All rats were individually allowed to freely explore the environment for 8Â min. Animalsâ performance was recorded under dim illumination by a ceiling-mounted camera (CCTV Auto tracking PTZ; SONY, Tokyo, Japan) and analyzed by a computer tracking system (SINA motiongraph, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ayers et al., 2011</xref>), Tabriz, Iran) through analysis of the time spent in each zone.

Telomere length (TL) was measured using a modified protocol for a quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR) assay based on previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hehar and Mychasiuk, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cawthon, 2002</xref>). The protocol enabled calculation of the ratio of telomere copy repeats to a single-copy reference gene (36B4) to determine relative TL. Accordingly, when the ratio was found equal to 1.00, the unknown DNA was assumed to be identical to the reference DNA, whereas the ratios greater to, or less than one, were - respectively - considered increased or decreased telomere repeat numbers. A pipetting robot was used for all assay runs to avoid pipetting errors and inconsistency in reactions, and PCR assays were performed by two independent technicians. The relative TL was determined based on the linear regression equation reported by Cawthon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cawthon, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Effects of main factors (housing condition; two levels, group; four and eight levels, sex; two levels, Zone; three levels, litter; nine and 11 levels) were analyzed separately for the time spent in CFT, with and without central object by repeated-measure and one-way ANOVA, and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). Also, post-hoc test (Tukey) was used to adjust for multiple comparisons. Familywise error was considered prior to the multiple post-hoc analyses if necessary. Data for OT levels and TL were also analyzed by separate ANOVA analyses with the main between-subject factors of group and sex. Linear regression analysis was performed in Experiment 1 to predict the outcome (dependent) variables (the novelty-seeking behaviour in the CFT and telomere length) through the predictor (independent) variable (OT levels). Dependent and independent sample t-tests were conducted when necessary. In all statistical analyses (SPSS 16.0, SPSS Inc., USA), a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Values represent meanÂ Â±SEM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors are grateful to Tanzi Hoover for productive comments on the manuscript.

The big positives are the large groups compared to normal social housing. Comparing normal (yet deprived in the natural scheme of things) to enriched (probably close to true normal for rats) is a strong design, far better than comparing 2-4 rodent groups (deprived) to social isolation (a ridiculous condition with no ecological correlate). The investigation of brave behavior (going in to the OF center with or without an object there) across the sexes and housing conditions is an interesting design aimed at important questions regarding early social development and sexual dimorphisms. The biggest issue with this paper is the lack of an injection control for the OXT antag injections. The results obtained â less exploration of the center after the antag â could easily result from a differential effect of stress (the stress of 28 injections!!) on females compared to males, Is this issue surmountable with the data in hand? I fear no but look forward to seeing what the other reviewers think.</p><p>At the outset of the results it is necessary to state how many rats are in social (n=10-11) and standard (n=2-3) groups.

Which would imply that two Social groups (n=20-22 rats), one for each sex, were compared to 8-10 Standard groups, half for each sex? This should be explicitly stated.

So, this needs to be rewritten into careful English so that the reader is told what was done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a terrific paper that should be published as soon as possible. I believe it stands to make a substantive contribution to the field and will be heavily cited. It explains the interactions among social relationships, Oxytocin, telomeres and longevity convincingly. Links to HPA axis function are also very interesting. The implications for human relationships are very intriguing. The background and discussion are soundly presented. The analytic methods are sound, and the results are compelling.</p><p>I am less able to review the data collection methods, as I am not an animal scientist, so I trust other reviewers to do so.</p><p>There were no grammatical or typos to note.</p><p>Again, I recommend publication as soon as possible.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper demonstrated that long-term social housing in the juvenile period enhanced peripheral OT secretion, together with longer TL. Novelty-seeking behavior was also increased by social housing. These housing effects were more robust in females. The data are interesting because the authors examined causality between OT secretion, TL and behavior. Even though there is no neuron/ brain region analysis conducted, the findings would reveal a new function of OT.</p><p>Here are my concerns,</p><p>1) Ear notch samples were used to assess TL, but is there any evidence showing that these cells express oxytocin receptor? If so, please add the reference in the Materials and methods section. If not, the authors need to include the discussion how blood OT can affect TL in these OTR-lacking cells.</p><p>2) OT antagonist L-366,509 was used to inhibit OT system in the CNS. Please add the information about penetration of this chemical through blood brain barrier in the Materials and methods section.</p><p>3) The authors mentioned the function of OT on the HPA axis, but this paper did not include the data of corticosterone. If the blood samples remain, please measure corticosterone, to make the conclusion more convincing.</p><p>4) Related to #2 and #3, higher corticosterone exposure will shorten the TL in peripheral cells. Please add the corticosterone data if possible.</p><p>5) Were the changes observed in social-housing rats caused by social interactions? If the rats were housed in a large area, the locomotor activity can increase. In this experimental setting, the authors cannot conclude that the changes were caused by social interactions. There might be an appropriate control group needed, such as similar locomotor activity without social interaction. If the authors cannot exclude the effect of activity (physical exercise can facilitate OT secretion, TL etc.), the discussion should be modified.</p><p>6) The social housing was conducted just after the weaning, so the effects of social housing would be robust (still in the developmental period). If the social housing were to be conducted in the adulthood or aged rats, could the same positive affects be observed? In humans, social loneliness in elderly is one of the important social issues related to the health problems.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>In manuscript by Faraji et al., the authors reported correlations between circulating oxytocin concentration and prolonged social housing, in both male and female rats. They further showed that prolonged social housing correlated with elongated telomere length in only in female rats, an effect blocked by the oxytocin antagonist L-366,509. While the correlation between oxytocin and telomere length is potentially interesting, I believe that there are some gaps of logic in the author's interpretation of the results.</p><p>1) The title states that &quot;oxytocin-mediated social enrichment promotes longevity and novelty seeking&quot;. The authors did not measure life span of their experimental animals, only telomere length. To my understanding, telomere length is not equivalent to longevity and thus I find the title misleading.</p><p>2) This is my main concern: the authors showed that social housing increased oxytocin (OT) level in both male and female rats, but only increased telomere length in female rats. Administration of the OT antagonist blocked the effect of social housing in both males and females, but only blocked TL increase in social females. Based on these results, the authors concluded that &quot;â¦extended social experiences modulate TL and novelty seeking through the OT system in a sex-dependent mannerâ¦&quot; (Abstract). These is extensive literature reporting oxytocin as a &quot;social hormone&quot;, thus the correlation between oxytocin level and social housing is consistent with other published results. To my knowledge, the link between oxytocin level and telomere length has not been previously reported and certainly there are no proposed mechanisms. Under these circumstances, I would be more willing to accept the authors' correlative results as potentially interesting and significant, if the correlations between oxytocin level and telomere length were similar to those of social housing, i.e. either both correlations held for males and females, or both held for only females.</p><p>3) I do not know the telomere field, but is telomere length in the ear representative of the entire body? Would telomere length in multiple cell types need to be measured to reach a conclusion?</p><p>4) I do not agree with the authors' interpretation of their results, in statements such as: &quot;The present study demonstrates a key role of OT in socially mediated behavioral fitness and telomere length as an indicator of overall health and longevity&quot; (Discussion section); &quot;â¦Thus OT is causally involved in mediating beneficial effects of social experience on behavior and TLâ¦&quot; (Discussion section), and &quot;The present data causally associates social stimulation with genetic and behavioral improvements as a function of endogenous OT&quot; (subsection âConclusionâ). The authors did not measure behavior fitness, health or longevity. Based on arguments presented in point 2 above, I don't think the results provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a causal link between OT and TL. In order to demonstrate a causal link, at a minimum, the authors would need to demonstrate that in vivo OT administration can promote telomere length, and that the effect of social housing on telomere length are abolished in oxytocin knockout mice. Telomere length needs to be measuring in multiple tissues and not just ear punches. Also, no statements can be made regarding behavior fitness, health or longevity unless data is provided.</p><p>5) Related to points 2 and 4 and given the discussion regarding how accurately oxytocin level in the plasma measured using RIA or ELISA reflects oxytocin level in the brain, the authors could measure oxytocin mRNA level or immunostain for oxytocin in brain sections, to further establish the correlation between oxytocin level and telomere length.</p><p>6) Results presented in Figure 2A-D are very similar to that presented in a previous publication from the same lab (Faraji et al., 2018). The authors should reference their previous results in the Results section, and not just the Materials and methods section.</p><p>7) Statements such as &quot;â¦Thus, social females' exploration in the corridor zone decreased -1.84 for each pM of OT concentration&quot; (subsection âNovelty-Seeking Behaviour in Females was Significantly Influenced by Social Experiencesâ), and &quot;â¦TL, therefore, only in social females increased 8.53 bp for each pM of OT level&quot; (subsection âNovelty-Seeking Behaviour in Females was Significantly Influenced by Social Experiencesâ), do not make sense to me, as the data points for TL range from 4000 to 5700 bp, and that for OT range from around 40 to 125 pM. In light of huge differences in the levels of OT and TL, these precise interpretations do not make much sense to me.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>It is great that you did saline controls. Of course, it is a problem that none of the reviewers realized that. Please address this by making it far more evident in the manuscript.

Indeed, we found out that at least in three previously published papers by Kitano et al., (1997), Bolan and Goren, (1987) and Deing et al., (2013), OT receptors were found to be expressed in the rat inner ear and epididymal adipocytes, and human skin. Two of them are cited now in the manuscript (please see Materials and methods section) to address the reviewerâs concerns. Moreover, the authors hypothesize that one possible mechanism in bridging increased plasma OT concentration to telomere elongation in the present experiments likely relies upon axo-vasal contacts for endocrine neurosecretion (please see Knobloch and Grinevich, 2014). By its traditional definition, endocrine neurosecretion refers to release and delivery of OT, VP and their homologues to systemic blood circulation. It is traditionally assumed that blood stream carries these molecules (e.g. OT) to their receptors which are abundantly expressed in peripheral organs such as uterus, mammary glands, intestinal tracts, heart, and more specifically in this case, even in the skin. Thus, we anticipate that a major part of the observed changes in TL induced by prolonged social experiences and the following OT enhancement is influenced by the axo-vasal contacts, which reveals an alternative explanation of the dynamic dialogue between the central capacities and peripheral repertoires in response to social experiences.</p><p>Also, to further address the reviewerâs concerns, we included a new paragraph in the discussion that now reads:</p><p>ââ¦The pathways through which telomere elongation is influenced by peripheral OT enhancement or inhibition are not yet fully understood. For the present results, axo-vasal contacts for endocrine neurosecretion<sup>14</sup>, a prominent central-peripheral axis which releases OT, vasopressin (VP) and their homologues into systemic blood circulation, may explain how alterations in peripheral OT can influence TL measured in the samples collected from earâ¦â (please see subsection âSocial Experiences Increase TL in Females via OT Enhancement<bold>â</bold>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) OT antagonist L-366,509 was used to inhibit OT system in the CNS. Please add the information about penetration of this chemical through blood brain barrier in the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this thoughtful comment. To our best knowledge, there is no detailed proof available in the literature for the penetration of antagonist L-366,509 through the blood-brain barrier. However, based on experimental evidence, we assumed that L-366,509 crosses the blood-brain barrier. First, all lipophilic molecules readily cross the blood-brain barrier, even though hydrophilic molecules including OT itself do not (please see McEwen, 2004; Churchland and Winkielman, 2012). Because camphor-based non-peptide OT antagonists such as L-366,509 belong to bulky, lipophilic groups (see Evans et al., 1992) that have a high tolerance and considerably improved solubility in aqueous media, we anticipate that antagonist L-366,509 crosses the blood-brain barrier. Second and more importantly, the non-peptide OT antagonist L-368,899 is a newer member of structural classes of spiroindenes that is structurally derived from L-366,509 (see Williams et al., 1994). The most prominent difference between these two antagonists, however, refers to the higher affinity of L-368,899 rather than L-366,509 for OT receptors. Hence, as L-368,899 is reported to cross the blood-brain barrier with selective accumulation in specific areas of the limbic system where it might inhibit OT-induced social behaviours (see Smith et al., 2010), it allowed the authors to predict that antagonist L-366,509 can also cross the blood-brain barrier.</p><p>We fully agree that this issue has to be reported in the manuscript, and we apologize for this shortcoming. Therefore, we addressed the reviewerâs concern in the manuscript in a new paragraph that reads:</p><p>ââ¦Although there is no information available on the penetration of L-366,509 into the blood-brain barrier (BBB) in the literature, a new generation of spiroindenylpiperidine camphor-sulfinamide OT antagonist (Williams et al., 1994) which readily crosses the BBB (Smith et al., 2010) was developed from L-366,509 with the same structural and lipophilic molecular characteristics. Thus, it is likely that antagonist L-366,509 crossed the BBB.â (please see Materials and methods section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors mentioned the function of OT on the HPA axis, but this paper did not include the data of corticosterone. If the blood samples remain, please measure corticosterone, to make the conclusion more convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely right that CORT data could potentially provide support for the current results. Unfortunately, due to economic instabilities in Iran and other practical constraints we were unable to do these analyses. We deeply regret this issue as we indeed had initially planned on these analyses. Instead, to compensate for the lack of information of CORT changes, we now discuss our results in the light of previous relevant work by others and by our team in the Discussion section. The considerable amount of existing evidence provides solid support for our current findings. Again, we very much apologize for this shortcoming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Related to #2 and #3, higher corticosterone exposure will shorten the TL in peripheral cells. Please add the corticosterone data if possible.</p></disp-quote><p>Please, see comment #3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Were the changes observed in social-housing rats caused by social interactions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point for consideration, thank you. We agree with the reviewer that both experiments in the present study could be conducted with more controls to better control for potentially confounding variables, even though we have done our best to have most of the confounding variables controlled. Also, it is very difficult to mention that changes observed in the present experiments were only the results of social interactions, because other uncontrolled external factors simultaneously may confound and/or overshadow our results. However, we strongly believe that social interactions as the most prominent component of social-housing condition designed here played a key role in the changes reported in the present study. Please refer to our logics in the next part of our answer to this comment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If the rats were housed in a large area, the locomotor activity can increase. In this experimental setting, the authors cannot conclude that the changes were caused by social interactions. There might be an appropriate control group needed, such as similar locomotor activity without social interaction. If the authors cannot exclude the effect of activity (physical exercise can facilitate OT secretion, TL etc.), the discussion should be modified.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in the manuscript (please see Materials and methods section), the same size of cage (86 cm Ã 86 cm Ã 41 cm) was used for the social and standard housing conditions, thus varying only the number of cage mates (standard, n = 2â3 vs. social, n =10- 11) while keeping the size of the environments constant (please see Faraji et al., 2018 for further details on the housing conditions). For two reasons, therefore, we do not agree with the reviewer that the observed changes are influenced by the enhanced level of physical activities in social-housing condition. First, if physical activity could determine the incidence or the extent of changes, all of these changes should be normally observed in the standard animals (here, controls) who were raised in the large but less crowded units. Second, changes in OT levels in response to physical activity induced by voluntary wheel running in rats are not entirely evident, yet (for instance, please see Broderick et al., 2014 and Bakos et al., 2007). Moreover, physical activity, to our knowledge, has been shown to impact OT levels in humans only if associated with a more strenuous type of physical exercise (see also Frisen et al., 2017 and Landgraf et al., 1982, for example). No additional enrichment stimulus such as a running wheel was provided for rats in neither standard nor social housing conditions. Further follow-up studies that address these issues would make a timely contribution to the literature.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The social housing was conducted just after the weaning, so the effects of social housing would be robust (still in the developmental period). If the social housing were to be conducted in the adulthood or aged rats, could the same positive affects be observed? In humans, social loneliness in elderly is one of the important social issues related to the health problems.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question and worthy a follow-up study. Unfortunately, the present data do not allow a conclusion on social enrichment effects in older age, although previous data suggest that this assumption is very reasonable and worthy of further consideration (For example, please see Okabayashiâs report about social interactions and their effects on subjective well-being among Japanese elders; Okabayashi and Houghman, 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>In manuscript by Faraji et al., the authors reported correlations between circulating oxytocin concentration and prolonged social housing, in both male and female rats. They further showed that prolonged social housing correlated with elongated telomere length in only in female rats, an effect blocked by the oxytocin antagonist L-366,509. While the correlation between oxytocin and telomere length is potentially interesting, I believe that there are some gaps of logic in the author's interpretation of the results.</p><p>1) The title states that &quot;oxytocin-mediated social enrichment promotes longevity and novelty seeking&quot;. The authors did not measure life span of their experimental animals, only telomere length. To my understanding, telomere length is not equivalent to longevity and thus I find the title misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and changed the title. The revised title now reads:</p><p>Oxytocin-mediated social enrichment promotes longer telomeres and novelty seeking</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This is my main concern: the authors showed that social housing increased oxytocin (OT) level in both male and female rats, but only increased telomere length in female rats. Administration of the OT antagonist blocked the effect of social housing in both males and females, but only blocked TL increase in social females. Based on these results, the authors concluded that &quot;â¦extended social experiences modulate TL and novelty seeking through the OT system in a sex-dependent mannerâ¦&quot; (Abstract). These is extensive literature reporting oxytocin as a &quot;social hormone&quot;, thus the correlation between oxytocin level and social housing is consistent with other published results. To my knowledge, the link between oxytocin level and telomere length has not been previously reported and certainly there are no proposed mechanisms. Under these circumstances, I would be more willing to accept the authors' correlative results as potentially interesting and significant, if the correlations between oxytocin level and telomere length were similar to those of social housing, i.e. either both correlations held for males and females, or both held for only females.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to address this thoughtful and challenging comment by discussing several main arguments. First and most importantly, we believe that the experimental design of the present study enables us to make causal conclusions for the most parts of the results. Therefore, although for some experimental constraints we did not identify and/or offer a causal mechanism to connect variations in dependent variables such as peripheral OT levels to the TL, our data are still able to profile a clear âcausal effectâ for the independent and dependent variables, beyond the mere correlational conclusion. Indeed, the presence of control group(s) in both experiments assures empirical correlation along with temporal priority of the independent variable, thus providing a solid causal effect. Like the reviewer, the authors are also concerned about spurious data interpretation. Moreover, heavily standardized conditions by which we raised the groups of animals in standard units and aged-matched groups in a social environment helped us to interpret most variations in dependent variables (behavioural, hormonal and genetic) in the light of a causal conclusion. We believe that if we could (1) provide evidence of empirical association between at least one independent variable and one dependent variable, (2) confirm temporal priority of the independent variable (here, housing condition) using control groups, and also (3) tried to have nonspurious changes which were not influenced by irrelevant variable(s), the minimum criteria for making an experimental casual effect are met. Therefore, we believe that as long as we are able to manipulate the independent variable in a systematic manner and address internal and external control variables using careful implementation and analysis, the causal conclusion (<italic>if</italic> A [where A is social experience], <italic>then</italic> B [where B is OT enhancement and/or telomere elongation) can be possible and suggested.</p><p>Second, we agree with the reviewer that ââ¦these is extensive literature reporting oxytocin as a &quot;social hormone&quot;, thus the correlation between oxytocin level and social housing is consistent with other published resultsâ¦â. However, to our knowledge, most of these correlational reports are depicting a hormone-to-behaviour approach (as stated in the manuscript) through which subjects are exposed to OT first, and then they are monitored for possible behavioural impacts of OT. In the present experiment, by contrast, we have chosen an alternative, behaviour-to-hormone approach by which we examined the impact of prolonged social experience on OT levels. This approach provides a new argument of causality to our results and conclusions as opposed to most literature about the experimental administration of OT and its consequences.</p><p>Third, we regard our data as considerably valid to causally link social lifestyle in early development (the major independent variable) among females to behavioural, endocrine and genetic outcomes (dependent variables). This seems more important when such changes are questioned in response to interruptions in social relationships among females and their health consequences, or when factors that in general determine telomere length in early life are investigated. Also, simultaneous responses (enhanced novelty seeking, increased levels of OT and telomere elongation) of females to persistent social experiences have implications in future investigations to causally hypothesize these changes. Examples include sex hormones that were previously shown to play a key role in telomere length (see Calado et al., 2006, for example) or for neurotrophins (e.g. BDNF) that are confirmed to influence telomere function (see Niu and Yip, 2011) and OT receptors in women (see Chagnon et al., 2015).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I do not know the telomere field, but is telomere length in the ear representative of the entire body? Would telomere length in multiple cell types need to be measured to reach a conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>These are very exciting questions. The answer to both questions is ânot necessarilyâ, even though the TL in lifespan is gender-related and follows a tissue-specific regulation during development. Indeed, the TL within individual tissues is regulated independently. In humans, TL seems highly variable between tissues and individuals. However, samples taken from peripheral organs such as kidney, liver, lung, etc. for inter-tissue comparison in intact rats are showing the same profile of changes in the TL (please, see Cherif et al.,âs work, such as Cherif et al., 2003). Also, studies with various strains of mice did not detect any differences in TL between tissues such as liver, testes or kidney (for instance, please see Coviello-McLaughlin and Prowse, 1997), although the TL generally differs between species. Moreover, TL in hearts and lungs in rats are equally affected by physical stress (please, see Wang et al., 2018) meaning that peripheral organs are possibly showing similar telomeric responses to experimental manipulations. Therefore, because different tissue types may represent different deterioration processes along with variable mortality, inter-tissue analysis in humans can potentially create more valid assessment of TL alterations in response to developmental influences or environmental manipulations. However, this does not seem to be necessarily required in rats as mentioned above. The only exception is for the TL in the brain tissues in rats and mice that were shown to depict different rates of TL alterations when compared with, for instance, spleen or other peripheral organs. Importantly, the reasons by which we have chosen the ear notch samples in the present study, in addition to the ease of collection, was that samples from ear are emerged from ectoderm, the same lineage as brain tissue. Like brain tissue, skin samples also contain a mixture of collagenous proteins, reticulin, vasculature, and connective tissues such as fibroblasts and adipocytes. Therefore, changes in rat peripheral TL in general, and skin cells in particular not only may represent TL changes in other organs influenced by experimental interventions, but also arguably predict TL alterations in the brain tissue (please see Hehar and Mychasiuk, 2016). To address this concern, we have included a new statement in the Discussion section that now reads:</p><p>ââ¦It is also important to consider that, as they share a common ontogenetic origin from ectoderm, both brain and skin tissues contain similar collagenous proteins, reticulin, vasculature, and connective tissues such as fibroblasts and adipocytes. Therefore, changes in peripheral TL in general, and skin cells in particular, predict TL alterations found in brain tissue (Hehar and Mychasiuk, 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I do not agree with the authors' interpretation of their results, in statements such as: &quot;The present study demonstrates a key role of OT in socially mediated behavioral fitness and telomere length as an indicator of overall health and longevity&quot; (Discussion section); &quot;â¦Thus OT is causally involved in mediating beneficial effects of social experience on behavior and TLâ¦&quot; (Discussion section), and &quot;The present data causally associates social stimulation with genetic and behavioral improvements as a function of endogenous OT&quot; (subsection âConclusionâ). The authors did not measure behavior fitness, health or longevity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to the reviewer for these comments. We have made some changes in the sentences in the manuscript as the reviewer requested. We hope that these changes address the reviewerâs concerns:</p><p>- Old sentence: ââ¦The present rodent study demonstrates a key role of OT in socially mediated behavioral fitness and telomere length as an indicator of overall health and longevityâ¦â.</p><p>New sentence: ââ¦The present rodent study indicates that persistent social experience is causally associated with increased OT level, elevated exploratory behaviour, and telomere elongationâ¦.â (please see Discussion section).</p><p>- Old sentence: ââ¦Thus OT is causally involved in mediating beneficial effects of social experience on behaviour and TLâ¦&quot;.</p><p>New sentence: ââ¦Thus OT is arguably involved in mediating beneficial effects of social experience on behaviour and TLâ¦â (please see Discussion section).</p><p>- Old sentence: ââ¦The present data causally associates social stimulation with genetic and behavioural improvements as a function of endogenous OTâ¦&quot;.</p><p>New sentence: ââ¦The present data causally associates social stimulation with genetic and behavioural improvements possibly as a function of endogenous OTâ¦â (please see Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on arguments presented in point 2 above, I don't think the results provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate a causal link between OT and TL. In order to demonstrate a causal link, at a minimum, the authors would need to demonstrate that in vivo OT administration can promote telomere length, and that the effect of social housing on telomere length are abolished in oxytocin knockout mice. Telomere length needs to be measuring in multiple tissues and not just ear punches. Also, no statements can be made regarding behavior fitness, health or longevity unless data is provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that data in the present experiments cannot draw a direct line to connect changes in OT levels to TL, as the study was not originally designed for such questions. However, we still believe that the present data can make causal conclusion(s) for bridging the independent variable (i.e. social life) and dependent variables (i.e. enhanced novelty-seeking, increased levels of OT and/or telomere elongation). Please see our rationales in response to comment 2. Moreover, even though longevity was not measured in the present study, TL itself has been proposed as a potential biomarker for longevity in humans, mice, and other organisms in many studies (please, see Calado and Dumetrio, 2013, for example). More importantly, as shown by Monaghanâs team, TL in early life predicts lifespan (see Heidinger et al., 2012). From our viewpoint, results in our experiments significantly advance the understanding factors that may causally determine early life influences on TL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Related to points 2 and 4 and given the discussion regarding how accurately oxytocin level in the plasma measured using RIA or ELISA reflects oxytocin level in the brain, the authors could measure oxytocin mRNA level or immunostain for oxytocin in brain sections, to further establish the correlation between oxytocin level and telomere length.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and apologize for our mistake. The authors confirm that 7 standard animals (4 males and 3 females) and 6 social animals (3 males and 3 females) from our previous experiment were included into the analysis of novelty-seeking behaviour in Experiment 1 in the present study. The inclusion of these animals has been conducted to increase sample size and to reduce within-group variation, thus achieving more precise estimates of average. To address the reviewerâs concern, we included a new sentence into the Material and Methods section which seemed more relevant that now reads:</p><p>ââ¦Novelty-seeking behaviour analysis included 7 standard animals (4 males, 3 females) and 6 social animals (3 males, 3 females) from a previous experiment (Faraji et al., 2018) to increase sample sizeâ¦â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Results presented in Figure 2A-D are very similar to that presented in a previous publication from the same lab (Faraji et al., 2018). The authors should reference their previous results in the Results section, and not just the Materials and methods section.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the great suggestion. Some of us (SR and RM) are analysing brain tissues for OT responses in the PVN and SON in the hypothalamus in response to social life, but unfortunately the results might not be reported in the present manuscript due to the extended amount of time required for such analyses. For the present study, based on previous findings in the literature we assumed that peripheral levels of OT can properly reflect central releases of OT in rats (for example, please see Wotjak et al., 1998). Furthermore, it seems that there is a coordinated axonal release of OT in the brain and in the circulatory system, and central OT and peripheral OT in animals can be released simultaneously. In humans, a correlation was shown between plasma and brain OT indicating that (at least under specific testing conditions) peripheral OT represents a suitable proxy of central OT (please see Lefvre and others 2017). Therefore, the authors believe that plasma OT concentration in the present study can be considered as a marker of its action in the brain. To address this concern, we have included a new statement in the Discussion section that now reads:</p><p>ââ¦Axonal release of OT in the brain and in the circulatory system seem to be coordinated as central OT and peripheral OT in rats can be released simultaneously (Wotjak et al., 1998).

In light of huge differences in the levels of OT and TL, these precise interpretations do not make much sense to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and are now convinced that the reviewer is absolutely right.
