However, the role of gap junctions in insect cognition remains poorly understood. Using a flight simulator paradigm and genetic tools, we found that gap junctions are present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kenyon cells (KCs), the major neurons of the mushroom bodies (MBs), and showed that they play an important role in visual learning and memory. Using a dye coupling approach, we determined the distribution of gap junctions in KCs. Furthermore, we identified a single pair of MB output neurons (MBONs) that possess a gap junction connection to KCs, and provide strong evidence that this connection is also required for visual learning and memory. Together, our results reveal gap junction networks in KCs and the KC-MBON circuit, and bring new insight into the synaptic network underlying fly’s visual learning and memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13238.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13238.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>gap junctions</kwd><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>visual learning and memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group> <funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Gap junctions exist in Kenyon cells and Kenyon cell-mushroom body output neuron neural networks, and are also critical in visual learning and memory in Drosophila</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In addition to chemical synapses, neurons communicate via gap junctions, also called electrical synapses. A gap junction consists of an intercellular channel that is formed by two hemichannels, each containing six homo- or heteromeric protein subunits. These subunits belong to the <italic>connexin</italic> or <italic>pannexin</italic> gene families in vertebrates and the <italic>innexin (inx</italic>) gene family in invertebrates. Gap junctions allow the circulation of small molecules, such as ions and cAMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hervé and Derangeon, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Phelan and Starich, 2001</xref>). The function of gap junctions in noise reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeVries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veruki and Hartveit, 2002</xref>) and neuronal synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bloomfield and Völgyi, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pereda et al., 2013</xref>) is critical for visual and olfactory processing in mammals. In addition, the synchronization of neurons through the function of gap junctions was proposed to play a key role in cognitive processes, such as perception, attention, as well as learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bissiere et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hormuzdi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tamás et al., 2000</xref>). The complexity of the mammalian central nervous system makes it difficult to determine the function of gap junctions during cognitive processes. In comparison, insects have much simpler neural systems, yet still perform sophisticated cognitive functions, however, the role of gap junctions in cognition has rarely been investigated.</p><p>There are 8 types of <italic>inx</italic> genes expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. In the brain, it has been reported that <italic>ogre (inx1), inx2</italic> and <italic>inx3</italic> were expressed in interstitial glia and lamina with similar expression patterns; the expression of <italic>inx5</italic> and <italic>inx7</italic> were detected in the cell body rind with very similar domains, and <italic>inx6</italic> was detected uniquely in an outer layer of cell body rind; <italic>inx6</italic> and <italic>inx7</italic> were also discovered between the anterior paired lateral (APL) neuron and dorsal paired medial (DPM) neuron; <italic>shakB (inx8</italic>) was expressed in scattered neurons, giant fiber system and antenna lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stebbings et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>). Gap junctions in giant fiber system are necessary for the escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Phelan et al., 1996</xref>). Gap junctions connect L1 with L2 neurons in the lamina, allowing for simultaneous activation of both pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joesch et al., 2010</xref>). Gap junctions in olfactory glomeruli mediate lateral excitation which promotes olfaction sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>). Especially, heterotypic gap junctions between APL and DPM neuron are critical for anesthesia-sensitive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Mushroom bodies (MBs) are a pair of clearly distinguishable structures in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, and play critical roles in cognition, such as olfactory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Masse et al., 2009</xref>), olfactory learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>),context generalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1999</xref>), feature extraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Peng et al., 2007</xref>), reversal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ren et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wu et al., 2012</xref>), and value based decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tang and Guo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). The precise role of MBs in visual learning and memory, however, remains under debate. It was thought previously that MBs are not necessary for visual operant conditioning in a flight simulator system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>); however, recently it was reported that the MB γ lobe participates in visual learning and memory in color-based visual learning assays in groups of walking flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). Kenyon cells (KCs), the major neurons of MBs, are the main components of the MB neural network, which is composed of dopamine neurons (DAs), MB output neurons (MBONs), and other cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). While eight <italic>inx</italic> genes are expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the existence of functional gap junctions in KCs remains to be investigated. Here, we set out to study the presence and function of gap junctions in MBs, using the visual conditioning paradigm in a flight simulator as well as dye coupling and whole-cell recording approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Non-chemical-synaptic transmission in MBs participates in visual learning and memory</title><p>To study the role of MBs in visual cognition in flying flies, we combined an optogenetic stimulator with a flight simulator system. A laser was focused to an area between the two compound eyes of the fly to activate halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gradinaru et al., 2010</xref>), and <italic>all-trans</italic> retinal (ATR) was replaced with β-carotene to avoid photolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We found that visual learning and memory was impaired when α/β neurons of KCs, driven by 17d-GAL4, were hyperpolarized, and the memory was restored when GAL4 activity was blocked in MBs by MB247-GAL80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper panel). These experiments were repeated with a second UAS-NpHR strain, yielding similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Hyperpolarizing α’/β’ neurons with MB370B-GAL4, γ neurons with MB131B-GAL4, or α/β and γ neurons of KCs with MB247-GAL4 also abolished visual learning and memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> lower panel). These results indicate that KCs participate in visual learning and memory. However, when synaptic release was impaired via expression of <italic>shibire<sup>ts1</sup> </italic>(<italic>shi<sup>ts1</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kasuya et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Praefcke and McMahon, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">van der Bliek and Meyerowitz, 1991</xref>) in KCs by 17d-GAL4, MB370B-GAL4 or MB247-GAL4, visual learning and memory was intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Tetanus toxin (TNT) was also used to inhibit the chemical-synaptic transmission. When TNT was expressed in α/β neurons (17d-GAL4) or all KCs (VT61721-GAL4), fly’s visual learning and memory remained intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to blocking the output of chemical synapses, hyperpolarization could also affect other mechanisms that influence visual learning and memory. To confirm the effect of hyperpolarization in KCs, Kir2.1, ectopic expression of an inward rectifier potassium channel that induces irreversible hyperpolarization was achieved in KCs by using the MB247–GeneSwitch GAL4 driver (MBSwitch) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Osterwalder et al., 2001</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, visual learning and memory were again abolished. However, in agreement with previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>), visual learning and memory remained intact in flies of which MBs were ablated by hydroxyurea (HU) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Taking together, these results indicated that visual learning and memory might be influenced in real time by non-chemical-synaptic transmission in MBs. We therefore speculated that electrical-synaptic transmission via gap junctions was a plausible candidate for such observation.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13238.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Visual learning and memory is abolished upon hyperpolarization of KCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Setup of the optogenetic flight simulator system. A 593 nm laser was used to activate halorhodopsin. To avoid influencing the visual perception of the flies, a focuser was used to focus the laser into a Gaussian light spot and to direct it in between the two compound eyes (diameter, ~0.3 mm). (<bold>B</bold>) Visual learning and memory was impaired when UAS-eNpHR3.0-YFP was used to hyperpolarize KCs labeled with 17d-GAL4, MB370B-GAL4, MB131B-GAL4 and MB247-GAL4. The expression pattern of these GAL4 lines are illustrated above the bars. MB247-GAL80 restored memory impaired by17d-GAL4.

First, the excitation light can disturb visual perception; second, <italic>Drosophila</italic> need to take in <italic>all-trans</italic> retinal (ATR) in order to use optogenetics. However, ATR is light-sensitive and must be protected from light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suh et al., 2007</xref>), while light deprivation leads to abnormal development of the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barth and Heisenberg, 1997</xref>). (<bold>A</bold>) To solve the first problem, we focused the laser light into a small Gaussian spot (593 nm, diameter 0.3 mm) and directed it between the two compound eyes of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. (<bold>B</bold>) Visual learning and memory under different laser intensities were tested in wild type CS and eNpHR3.0/+ flies. A laser strength of greater than 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> impaired visual learning and memory. (<bold>C, D</bold>) To address the second problem, an optogenetic locomotor system was established. (<bold>C</bold>) Flies were individually placed into a 3.5 cm dish. The fly’s locomotor behavior was recorded by a camera with a visible light filter. Illumination was supplied by three infrared LEDs. In the test groups, three yellow LEDs supplied yellow light (590 nm, 0.06–0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>). Temperature was controlled at 25 ± 1°C. Yellow arrow, recorded fly. Scale bar, 1 cm. (<bold>D</bold>) Locomotor behavior of cha-GAL4 &gt; UAS-eNpHR3.0 and UAS-eNpHR3.0/+ flies raised in different conditions; this behavior reflects the activation of halorhodopsin. For each fly, the distance moved, time spent moving (activity) and speed were calculated. If the flies raised in a 12 hr L/D cycle were fed with ATR (changed every night), halorhodopsin would be disabled. The β-carotene has been reported to be transformed into ATR in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and is more stable in light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang and O'Tousa, 2007</xref>). Feeding flies β-carotene for 3 days after eclosion could partially rescue the halorhodopsin inactivation. Thus, β-carotene could be used in place of ATR for optogenetics. N = 18 to 20 for each data point. All data represent the mean ± SEM. (<bold>E</bold>) Hyperpolarization of KCs labeled with 17d-GAL4 with UAS-NpHR-YFP (raised with a 12 hr L/D cycle, fed with β-carotene food) also impaired visual learning and memory.

The dye-filled neurons were identified based on their position and morphological characteristics as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lee et al., 1999</xref>). Among the 143 successfully stained brains, 64 α/β neurons, 40 α’/β’ neurons and 39 γ neurons were loaded with dye. Dye-coupled neurons were observed in 14 brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In 10 out of the 14 brains, dye coupling was observed between the same subtype of KCs, including 8 α/β-α/β, 1 α’/β’-α’/β’ and 1 γ-γ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). One representative example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>. There, biocytin was loaded into a GFP-expressing α/β posterior (α/β p) neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>) (driven by c205-GAL4). Across the calyx, the MB dendrites region, there was only one biocytin-filled fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>); however, two biocytin-filled fibers were found in the peduncle and the lobe region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). One fiber overlapped with the GFP fluorescence, while the other fiber showed no signs of GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Tracing the two fibers, we found that one of them belongs to an α/β p neuron, and the second belongs to an α/β core (α/β c) neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Notably, there were three potential connection points between these two neurons, including the beginning of the lobes, the horizontal branch tip of the α/β p neuron, and the middle of the vertical branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref> right panel, marked with “*”).

Based on the morphology of these fibers and the position of the somas, these non-KC neurons were likely to be MBONs. MBON-β’2mp neurons which have somas on the dorsal anterior surface near the mid-line of the brain, and arborize on the tip of β’ lobe, were supposed to be reasonable candidates. To investigate the possible existence of an efferent pathway mediated by gap junctions in MBs, we explored whether there were electrical synapses between MBONs and KCs. We used either the proton pump eArch3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mattis et al., 2012</xref>) or halorhodopsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gradinaru et al., 2010</xref>) to hyperpolarize KCs (247LexA &gt; LexAop-eArch3.0-EYFP or 247LexA &gt; LexAop-eNpHR3.0-EYFP), and MBONs were labeled with split GAL4-driven tdTomato (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using whole-cell recording, we monitored the changes in membrane potential in MBONs whilst KCs were hyperpolarized simultaneously using a yellow laser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Considering that the electrical coupling coefficient might not be high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yaksi and Wilson, 2010</xref>), we used the maximal power of our laser, which should be the most promising condition to get obvious results. Inasmuch as there was no significant difference between the effect of eArch3.0 and eNpHR3.0 to hyperpolarize KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), the data using eArch3.0 or eNpHR3.0 were pooled together for analysis. Upon hyperpolarization in KCs, we measured a hyperpolarization in MBON-β’2mp neurons labelled by MB002B-GAL4 or MB011B-GAL4. This response remained unchanged after the application of tetrodotoxin (TTX), which blocks chemical synapses by suppressing action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In contrast, laser-induced hyperpolarization disappeared when gap junctions were blocked by 2-octanol (2-OCT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohrmann and Haas-Assenbaum, 1993</xref>), and was recovered after 2-OCT was washed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), while 2-OCT application could induce slight hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The delivery of 2-OCT did not affect the optogenetic hyperpolarization in KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that β’2mp MBONs are able to receive inputs from KCs through electrical synapses.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13238.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Electrical coupling reveals presence of gap junctions between KCs andβ’2mp neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Strategy used to detect electrical coupling between MBONs and KCs.

However, a possible involvement of gap junctions in cognition had not been well addressed, especially in KCs. Here, we showed that in addition to chemical synapses, gap junctions also exist in KCs and KC-associated neural networks, and play important roles in visual learning and memory. Compared with chemical synapses, gap junctions are simple, fast, and non-discrete for information transfer in neural networks. Similar to their function as a low-pass filter in reducing noise during sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeVries et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Veruki and Hartveit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), gap junctions in KCs may contribute to noise reduction, especially those that connect KCs of the same subtype with common inputs. Considering that the different KC subtypes have diverse functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guven-Ozkan and Davis, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yi et al., 2013</xref>), gap junctions that connect KCs of different subtypes may serve as a communication channel that links multiple processing units. The gating, assembly, internalization and degradation of gap junction channels can be delicately modulated by phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Laird, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Moreno, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Solan and Lampe, 2005</xref>); and these regulation may underlie memory encoding in MB-MBON networks.</p><p>Our results showed that approximately 10% of all KCs possess active gap junction connections, which is very likely to be an underestimate of their density, due to the following reasons: 1) The dye coupling efficiency may be restricted with the gating of gap junction channels, which might not be always open and which might be delicately modulated; 2) filling an entire neuron with sufficient amounts of dye is a difficult and time-consuming (1–2 hr) procedure, due to the slender morphology of their neurites. According to electron microscope results from our lab (unpublished data), KC neurites are extremely narrow in various sections, often only 50 nm in diameter. However, some organelles in the neurites, such as mitochondria, are quite big, with the diameter more than 500 nm. Thus, the diffusion of dye in KCs might be interrupted when neurites were congested by organelles. In general, Alexa Fluor 568 (791.8 Da) stained less details of the neurites than biocytin (372.48 Da) in KCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). This difference also suggested that the KC neurites are not free enough for the dye diffusion. It is therefore unsurprising that the neurites of the coupled neurons were rarely completely filled with dye, with similar reasoning for the soma parts. The low efficiency of dye coupling was also evident in our results from β’2mp neurons. In this study, the probability of dye coupling was approximately 1/12 the probability of electrical coupling, which we believe is reasonable, as electrical currents flow more easily than dyes, both in neurites and through gap junctions. We could not exclude the possibility that the distribution of gap junctions between KCs, and between KCs and MBONs is rare, and possibly differs substantially across individual flies. It is worth noting that the proportion of simultaneously opened gap junctions is probably not very high, thus synchronizing only a minority of KCs. Otherwise, it would be akin to creating a single processing unit, and the MBs would lose their processing capacity. Thus, such fine-tuned modulation of gap junctions may be critical for MB function.</p><p>Our findings indicate that INX 5 and 6 in KCs and MBON-β’2mp neurons are necessary for visual learning and memory. Nevertheless, the features of gap junctions involved are not yet determined, such as the constitution (homotypic or heterotypic), the conductance and the rectification properties of particular gap junction channels in particular neural networks. Combining whole-cell recording with both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing optogenetic tools could be helpful to study the electrical physiological properties of gap junctions, and further clarify the dynamics of neural networks with both chemical synapses and gap junctions.</p><p>Our results suggest that MBs take part in visual learning and memory via gap junctions. However, in previous reports, visual learning remained intact in the <italic>mbm<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant and MBs-ablated flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolf et al., 1998</xref>). The experiment was repeated with HU-treated MBs-ablated flies in our flight simulator, yielding similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, this unconformity is unlikely to be caused by the upgrading of the flight simulator. Developmental compensation may be a reasonable explanation for this discrepancy in results. HU inhibits ribonucleotide reductase, blocking the synthesis of DNA, and causing the death of dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sweeney et al., 2012</xref>). It has been reported that the trajectory of the neurons which proliferated during larva period develop independently of each other, although the final branching pattern of these neurons is dependent upon the presence of appropriate neuronal targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lovick and Hartenstein, 2015</xref>). In the MB ablated flies, MB-targeting neurons might still grow to the MB region and form new circuits with the remainder γ neurons which proliferated before larval hatching and therefore could not be ablated by HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The developmental compensation might alleviate the change of the topological structure and function of the MB-associated neural network. A comparison of the MB-associated network between the MB-ablated flies and wild type flies, including the topological structure and the physiological responses during visual operant conditioning, would be helpful to understand the neural computations underlying visual cognition.</p><p>Recently, it was reported that blocking the output of MB γ lobes with <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> affects visual learning and memory when assessed using two color-based, multiple walking fly participation paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>). However, in the experiments using a flight simulator, visual conditioning was not affected when the chemical synaptic output of the α/β and γ lobes was inhibited by <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic> or TNT. This discrepancy can probably be attributed to the differences between the behavioral paradigms. In the paradigms for the walking flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Vogt et al., 2014</xref>), to ensure the blocking of <italic>shi<sup>ts</sup></italic>, the flies was tested at high temperature (33°C), but in flight simulator, files could not accomplish the visual learning and memory task when the temperature was higher than 30°C. Moreover, the efficiency of TNT could not be tested in these behavior paradigms. Thus, we cannot formally rule out the possible roles of chemical transmission in visual learning and memory. Our results show that gap junctions in the α/β and α’/β’ lobes, but not those in the γ lobes, are required for the operant visual learning, suggesting that the chemical synaptic circuits and electrical synaptic circuits may be complementary in distribution and function. Therefore, we propose that gap junctions cooperate with chemical synapses to perform the complex function of MBs. Tracing the gap junction networks in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and clarifying the synergy between gap junctions and chemical synapses should contribute to our understanding of functional neural calculations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were reared in standard food vials at 25°C and 60% relative humidity with a 12 hr dark/light (L/D) cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guo et al., 1996</xref>), excluding the flies that were indicated as raised in the dark and the flies crossed with UAS-shibire<sup>ts1</sup>;;shibire<sup>ts1</sup>, which were reared at 21°C.

The laser was focused into a Gaussian light spot (diameter: 0.3 mm with 99% of the power). For visual learning and memory experiments, the laser power was 0.1 mW/mm<sup>2</sup>. Due to the possible low efficiency of electrical coupling, the laser power was maximized to 0.7 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> for electrophysiological experiments. Flies for visual conditioning were raised with a 12 hr L/D cycle and fed with food containing 100 μM β-carotene (C9750, Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri) for 3~5 days before the experiments. For electrophysiological experiments, flies were raised in the dark and fed throughout their lives with food containing 100 μM ATR. In the optogenetic locomotor system, yellow light was supplied by LEDs (590 nm, 0.06–0.1 mW/mm2).

The torque meter measured each fly’s yaw torque around its vertical body axis and rotated the panorama around the fly via a negative feedback mechanism. This arrangement allowed the tethered flies to stabilize and choose their flight orientation with respect to the panorama by adjusting their yaw torque. The flies’ yaw torque and the panorama’s angular position were recorded continuously and stored in the computer (sampling rate, 20 Hz) for subsequent analysis. The panorama was divided into 4 quadrants, with horizontal bars at their respective centers. An infrared laser beam (10,600 nm) that projected to the fly’s abdomen was switched on when the fly oriented to the dangerous quadrants and was switched off when the fly oriented to the safe quadrants. For half of the flies, the lower bars were coupled with punishment, and for the other half, the higher bars were coupled with punishment. Standard 24 min training paradigms consisted of 12 blocks of 2 min each: blocks 1–3, pre-training sessions; blocks 4, 5, 7 and 8, training sessions; blocks 6 and 9–12, test sessions. In our experiments, the horizontal bars were black on white backgrounds; the bars had a length of 40° and a width of 12°. The difference in the center of gravity between the higher and lower bars was 44°. Patterns in opposite quadrants were identical, whereas patterns in neighboring quadrants were different. These patterns were printed on paper with a color inkjet printer (Epson Stylus Photo 1390). The paper arena was illuminated by transmitted light from a white LED array. The performance of tethered flies was evaluated quantitatively in 2 min bins using the “performance index” (PI), which was calculated as follows: PI = (t1–t2)/(t1+t2), where t1 is the time spent heading toward safe patterns and t2 is the time spent heading toward dangerous patterns. The final PI was calculated as the average of PIs 9 to 12.

After loading for one to two hours, the dye labeled the soma and neurites of the recorded neuron and diffused to other neurons through open gap-junction channels if present. Because of the small size of KC somas, they were almost always removed with the electrode when the electrodes were drawn out after dye loading was complete. Thus the loaded soma was observed in only a few brains. Next, the brain was fixed in 4% PFA for 12–15 min at room temperature and then washed several times in PBS with 0.3% Triton X-100. The Alexa Fluor 568-labeled brains were mounted in Vectashield H-1000 (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California) for confocal imaging. The biocytin-labeled brains were incubated with Alexa Fluor 568-conjugated streptavidin (Life Technologies; 1:200) overnight at 4°C. The brains were washed several times and then mounted in Vectashield H-1000 for confocal imaging. A Nikon Eclipse FN1 confocal system with a 40× water-immersion objective and an Olympus FV10I system with a 60× oil-immersion objective were used to obtain the Z-stacks of the brains. The dye-filled neurites were identified based on their position and morphology. The examples that meet the following criteria were counted as dye-coupled examples: (1) More than one dye-filled fibers were observed in peduncle. (2) Only one fiber was observed in peduncle, but fibers in lobe region belonged to different subtypes. (3) Only one fiber was observed in the peduncle and fibers in the lobe region belonging to the same subtype, but were not branches of one neuron. Condition (3) only applied to αβ core neurons, which generally have few branches. In blind experiments, the brain mounting, confocal imaging and identification of dye coupling were performed by an experimenter who was unaware of the genotypes of the brains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as the mean ± SEM or by box plot. We applied the Wilcoxon signed rank test to compare the performance indices against chance level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brembs and Wiener, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liu et al., 1999</xref>), and to evaluate differences between matched samples. Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used for comparisons between two groups. To compare three or more matched groups, we used Kruskal-Wallis test, and the significance of differences between each pair of groups were corrected by Bonferroni method. Statistical analysis was performed using MATLAB. Asterisks indicate the level of statistical significance (*p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We sincerely thank Yoshinori Aso for assistance in identification of neurites, Mu-ming Poo for constructive comments, Mingkui Zhang and Jingwu Hou for assistance with experimental setup, and Liping Wang for assistance in optogenetics.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Benjamin de Bivort, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Liu and colleagues examine an important and understudied question in neuroscience, what is the role of gap-junctions in behavior, specifically visual pattern learning in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The authors first reduce expression of a series of innexins, the genes encoding gap junctions, in the mushroom bodies, integrating neuropils which the authors characterize as the cognitive centers of the fly brain. They find that knocking down a specific subset of innexins renders flies' learning scores statistically indistinguishable from zero (no learning). Interestingly, blocking synaptic release using the dominant negative dynamin allele <italic>shibire</italic> has no effect on learning, suggesting that MB function in this behavior is gap-junction mediated. In a careful sequence of experiments and controls they are able to show that this effect is specific to regional subsets of the mushroom body and that <italic>innexin</italic> function is required post-developmentally. Next, the authors report diffusion of small dye molecules from patched Kenyon cells (KCs = MB intrinsic neurons) to other KCs. Using optogenetic stimulation paired with whole-cell recording, they show that hyperpolarization can be transmitted between KCs and a specific class of MB output neurons (MBONs), which can be temporarily blocked by the application of 2-octanol, a gap-junction blocker. Lastly, they find corresponding dependence of visual learning on innexin expression in those MBONs.</p><p>In general, the paper presents compelling genetic evidence of the requirement of MB-specific gap junction expression for visual learning, and direct evidence of gap junctions by dye diffusion (though as the authors discuss, the observed rate of dye coupling may underestimate the rate of gap-junctioning between pairs of KCs). The paper is well written, with generally solid use of controls. The balance of evidence is convincing that gap junctions likely play an important role in visual learning in the MBs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While this is a very nice study, we do have a major conceptual concern and other important ones too.</p><p>1) Previous literature, including from the senior author of this study, has argued that MBs are totally dispensable for flight simulator visual learning except in cases where context is altered or where more complex combinations of features (such as shape and color) are used. This previous literature made use of HU ablation of MB. In other words, flies that have no MB structures at all are able to perform normally in this visual learning paradigm. Defects in visual learning in MB-less flies are only revealed with more complex tasks that were not employed here. This literature includes several classic studies from the Heisenberg group (e.g. Wolf et al. 1998 and Liu et al. 1999), as well as a more recent study by Guo and colleagues (Peng et al., 2007). So if in fact MB are not required for this task, it would obviously undermine the very foundation upon which they test the requirement for gap junctions within MB for this task. The authors correctly point out that a recent study by Vogt et al. points to a role for MB (using <italic>shibire</italic> to block output) in a visual learning task, and they correctly point to the literature that MB are required for visual learning that involves changes in context. But still, in this flight simulator visual learning assay, the literature is very consistent in the finding that MB ablated animals have no defect. The authors suggest that this discrepancy could be caused by developmental compensation with HU ablation. And we suppose that methodological differences in the flight simulator assay employed here could differ from those circa late 1990s. But this is the crux of the current study, so we were really surprised that they didn’t just do a simple HU ablation and test performance in their current assay. If performance is normal, it would be tough to read past the first figure without further explanation right? We see two types of explanation to reconcile the fact that HU ablation in previous publications has no impact on flight simulator visual learning, whereas acute manipulations of gap junctions does. One possibility is that when MB are ablated developmentally, there is some compensation mechanism in which the brain arrives at a solution that is independent of MB. This is certainly possible. But the other possibility is that the exact details of the current version of the flight simulator behavioral paradigm are sufficiently different from those historically reported. In this case, the current version of the flight simulator, in these researcher's hands, engages the MB in a way that previous versions of the assay did not. These are two really different interpretations. And it would be trivial for the authors to address this: just do an HU ablation of MB and test learning in their flight simulator. This lab has done HU ablation in the past. So this requires no new expertise and is such an obvious experiment that we would guess they have already thought of it. We agree that a positive result here would be an important addition to this study. If the authors find again that developmental ablation of the MB does not impair this behavior, then an in-depth discussion of the plausibility of developmental compensation is needed.</p><p>2) Our other major criticism concerns the presentation of statistical findings. Specifically, the authors conflate two statistical observations: that 1) an experimental group is not significantly different from 0 (while its control group is) and 2) that experimental group is therefore significantly different from the control. This faulty inference is made in several places. Relatedly, the author's description of the steps they took to correct for multiple comparisons is insufficient (but it is important to get this right, especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>3) Next, we found the Introduction to be too short to provide proper background for the findings.

This previous literature made use of HU ablation of MB. In other words, flies that have no MB structures at all are able to perform normally in this visual learning paradigm. Defects in visual learning in MB-less flies are only revealed with more complex tasks that were not employed here. This literature includes several classic studies from the Heisenberg group (e.g. Wolf et al. 1998 and Liu et al. 1999), as well as a more recent study by Guo and colleagues (Peng et al., 2007). So if in fact MB are not required for this task, it would obviously undermine the very foundation upon which they test the requirement for gap junctions within MB for this task. The authors correctly point out that a recent study by Vogt et al. points to a role for MB (using shibire to block output) in a visual learning task, and they correctly point to the literature that MB are required for visual learning that involves changes in context. But still, in this flight simulator visual learning assay, the literature is very consistent in the finding that MB ablated animals have no defect. The authors suggest that this discrepancy could be caused by developmental compensation with HU ablation. And we suppose that methodological differences in the flight simulator assay employed here could differ from those circa late 1990s. But this is the crux of the current study, so we were really surprised that they didn’t just do a simple HU ablation and test performance in their current assay. If performance is normal, it would be tough to read past the first figure without further explanation right? We see two types of explanation to reconcile the fact that HU ablation in previous publications has no impact on flight simulator visual learning, whereas acute manipulations of gap junctions does. One possibility is that when MB are ablated developmentally, there is some compensation mechanism in which the brain arrives at a solution that is independent of MB. This is certainly possible. But the other possibility is that the exact details of the current version of the flight simulator behavioral paradigm are sufficiently different from those historically reported. In this case, the current version of the flight simulator, in these researcher's hands, engages the MB in a way that previous versions of the assay did not. These are two really different interpretations. And it would be trivial for the authors to address this: just do an HU ablation of MB and test learning in their flight simulator. This lab has done HU ablation in the past. So this requires no new expertise and is such an obvious experiment that we would guess they have already thought of it. We agree that a positive result here would be an important addition to this study. If the authors find again that developmental ablation of the MB does not impair this behavior, then an in-depth discussion of the plausibility of developmental compensation is needed.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for the comments and suggestions. We have performed the HU ablation experiments and found that ablation of the MBs at early developmental stage does not impair fly’s visual learning and memory, which is in agreement with previous reports (Liu et al., 1999; Peng et al., 2007; Wolf et al., 1998). We have strengthened the discussion of developmental compensation in our manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) Our other major criticism concerns the presentation of statistical findings. Specifically, the authors conflate two statistical observations: that 1) an experimental group is not significantly different from 0 (while its control group is) and 2) that experimental group is therefore significantly different from the control. This faulty inference is made in several places. Relatedly, the author's description of the steps they took to correct for multiple comparisons is insufficient (but it is important to get this right, especially in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</italic></p><p>Thanks for pointing out our mistakes. We have rephrased our expression. When the performance index of the test group was significantly different from the control, we describe the visual learning of these flies as they were impaired. When the performance index of the test group was not significantly different from the control, and significantly different from zero, we describe the visual learning of these flies as they were intact. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, the indices of 17d &gt; <italic>inx4</italic> RNAi and 17d &gt; <italic>inx5</italic> RNAi flies was nether significantly different from the control nor from zero. We changed the description of “knockdown of <italic>inx4, inx5</italic> and <italic>inx6</italic> in 17d-GAL4-labeled neurons resulted in impairment of fly learning and memory” to “knockdown of <italic>inx6</italic> in 17d-GAL4-labeled neurons resulted in impairment of fly learning and memory. Flies with the knockdown of <italic>inx4, inx5</italic> or <italic>inx6</italic> were not able to achieve performance indices significantly different to zero, whereas the control groups did.” We have also added the description of the correction for multiple comparisons in the Materials and methods.</p><p><italic>3) Next, we found the Introduction to be too short to provide proper background for the findings. It consists of a paragraph about the general function of gap junctions and a paragraph about the role of the mushroom bodies in learning and memory in flies. A major area for which there are previous findings is the role of gap-junctions in other Drosophila circuits, such as the optic lamina, the Horizontal system cells, and the giant fiber system.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the suggestions. We have added the introduction of studies on gap junctions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> circuits, like the giant fiber, the optic lamina, olfactory glomeruli and the APL-DPM neural circuits.</p><p><italic>4) Lastly, we would recommend that the authors edit their manuscript to make its interpretation easier for non-Drosophila MB experts. Specifically, Gal4 reagents are introduced without any description of their expression pattern. This makes interpreting the findings much harder.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for pointing out our negligence. We have added the description of expression pattern of each Gal4.</p><p><italic>5) In addition, we have few data presentation issues:</italic></p><p><italic>A) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>: I cannot see the green fills in this figure.
