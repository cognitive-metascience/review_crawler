Here, we show that following local gp120 injection lymph node (LN) SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> sinus macrophages located in interfollicular pockets and underlying SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages form a cellular network that rapidly captures gp120 from the afferent lymph. In contrast, two other antigens, phycoerythrin and hen egg lysozyme, were not captured by these cells. Intravital imaging of mouse LNs revealed persistent, but transient interactions between gp120 bearing interfollicular network cells and both trafficking and LN follicle resident gp120 specific B cells. The gp120 specific, but not the control B cells repetitively extracted gp120 from the network cells. Our findings reveal a specialized LN antigen delivery system poised to deliver gp120 and likely other pathogen derived glycoproteins to B cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06467.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06467.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06467.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human immune system contains many different cell types, which play specific roles in defending the body from invading pathogens, such as bacteria and viruses. For example, macrophages engulf and digest foreign material, whereas specialized B cells termed plasma cells produce molecules called antibodies that help to destroy specific pathogens. However, specific antibodies are only produced if naive B cells have already encountered the pathogen or its surface proteins.</p><p>Attempts to improve how the immune system responds to the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) have failed to control and prevent infection. One of the main components of many prospective HIV-1 vaccines is a protein called gp120, which is located on the surface of the virus. Specific B cells recognize this protein and can develop into plasma cells that produce antibodies against HIV-1. However, little is known about how these specific B cells initially get exposed to gp120.</p><p>Park et al. injected gp120 into mice, and used sophisticated microscopy to track its movement through the animal. This revealed that gp120 is rapidly transported to nearby lymph nodes—organs that are spread throughout the body, and play an important role in maintaining the immune response. Specialized macrophages can then capture and deliver gp120 to other macrophages in the lymph node.</p><p>These specialized macrophages serve as a gp120 reservoir and are located in part of the lymph node that is a bit like a traffic hub, in that other immune cells constantly pass through it. As such, B cells that specifically recognize gp120 have a high likelihood of encountering these gp120-bearing macrophages, thereby allowing the specific B cells to extract gp120, develop into plasma cells, and produce HIV-1 specific antibodies. Manipulating this macrophage network may help to optimize the antibody responses to gp120 and so, in the future, could provide a way of treating or preventing HIV-1 infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06467.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06467.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>lymph node</kwd><kwd>HIV-1</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>B lymphocyte</kwd><kwd>gp120</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006492</institution-id><institution>Division of Intramural Research, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (Division of Intramural Research of the NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Chung</given-names></name><name><surname>Arthos</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Cicala</surname><given-names>Claudia</given-names></name><name><surname>Kehrl</surname><given-names>John H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lymph node gp120 specific B cells extract locally injected HIV-1 gp120 from SIGN-R1 positive macrophages that line the subcapsular sinus overlying the lymph node interfollicular channels.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human immunodeficiency virus (HIV-1) functional envelope spike is a trimer of non-covalently associated gp120/gp41 heterodimers, which are coated with N-linked carbohydrates that shield vulnerable protein surfaces from antibody recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonomelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">White et al., 2011</xref>). The host cell glycosylation pathways attach these carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Varki et al., 2009</xref>). However, the glycosylation processing of gp120 diverges from typical host glycoproteins resulting in densely packed patches of oligomannose glycans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Doores et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonomelli et al., 2011</xref>). Such clusters do not occur on mammalian glycoproteins and, two such sites on the envelope, one associated with the first/second hypervariable loops (V1/V2-glycan), and the other around the third hypervariable loop (V3-glycan) have served as targets for broadly neutralizing antibodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonomelli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raska et al., 2014</xref>). The glycan shield protects additional sites of viral vulnerability including the gp120 CD4 binding site and the envelope membrane proximal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raska et al., 2014</xref>). The impact of the glycan shield on the uptake of gp120 by antigen presenting cells (APCs) and its subsequent delivery to B cells in lymph nodes (LNs) or the spleen is unknown.</p><p>For B cells to mount an antibody response to an antigen such as gp120 they must encounter intact antigen. Since most B cells reside inside lymphoid follicles in the spleen, LNs, and at mucosal immune sites, most studies of LN antigen delivery have focused on the transport of antigen to the LN follicle and its subsequent loading onto follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pape et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batista and Harwood, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cyster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuseff et al., 2013</xref>). FDCs retain antigen and are needed for the clonal selection of B cells with high affinity antigen receptors during germinal center reactions. Following local injection most antigens access the afferent lymph and are rapidly transported into the subcapsular sinus of the regional LN. Hen egg lysozyme (HEL) is a low molecular weight protein that can rapidly access LN follicle via the conduits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>). The conduits are an interconnected network of tubules that function as a molecular sieve allowing fluid and small molecules to enter the LN from the subcapsular sinus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gretz et al., 1997</xref>). However, gp120 is too large to enter the conduits as is phycoerythrin (PE), a fluorescent non-glycosylated algae protein, whose delivery to FDCs has been examined as an antigen–antibody complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Phan et al., 2007</xref>). PE immune complexes are efficiently trapped by subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSMs) and delivered to FDCs in a complement dependent manner. Furthermore, cognate B cells residing in the follicle can acquire the antigen directly from the overlying SSMs. Keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) is perhaps a better model for gp120 as it also heavily glycosylated, but similar to PE, KLH has been studied as an immune complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Roozendaal et al., 2009</xref>). While these studies have contributed to our understanding of FDC loading and germinal center responses, the kinetics of primary antibody responses do not favor naïve, recirculating B cell encountering high molecular weight antigens on FDCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">MacLennan, 2007</xref>). This suggests that another mechanism tailored to deliver a neo-antigen such as gp120 to cognate, naïve B cells might exist.</p><p>One possibility is the SSMs that directly overlie the LN follicle. SSMs are CD169<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>−</sup> and besides capturing immune complexes they also retain particulate material such as ferritin and liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>). Perhaps less likely are two other types of LN macrophage, medullary sinus macrophages (MSMs) and medullary cord macrophages (MCMs). Like the SSMs, the MSMs are also CD169<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>, but they also express F4/80 and the pattern recognition receptors SIGN-R1 and MARCO. Their known functions are to clear particulates, pathogens, and dying cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>). The MCMs are CD169<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>F4/80<sup>+</sup>April<sup>+</sup> and they support plasma cell homeostasis. However, these macrophages are not very motile and localized far from most follicular and trafficking B cells. A better candidate is the interfollicular macrophages (IFMs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>). They are phenotypically similar to the MSMs, but they reside between the LN follicles in the interfollicular channel (IFC), a site where early T-B cell collaboration occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kerfoot et al., 2011</xref>). High endothelial venules (HEVs) and cortical sinus lymphatics are located nearby (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Park et al., 2009</xref>). However, the functional role of IFMs in humoral immunity is poorly defined. LN resident dendritic cells (DCs) predominately sample the conduit contents making them an unlikely contender; however DCs in the vicinity of locally administered antigens can capture them, enter the afferent lymphatics, and access local LNs via the IFCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Qi et al., 2006</xref>). Yet such a mechanism is slow compared to the rapid antigen delivery via the lymph. Local DC-mediated antigen delivery is likely important for those antigens that do not enter the afferent lymph.</p><p>To test how gp120 is captured in the LN we injected mice with fluorescently labeled gp120 near the inguinal LN. We followed the label using thick LN sections and confocal microscopy, and by intravital two-photon laser scanning microscopy (TP-LSM). We also developed a gp120 overlay assay that allowed the identification of gp120 binding cells in lymphoid organ sections. To determine how cognate B cells acquire gp120 we adoptively transferred B cells from mice in which the variable portions of the human b12 neutralizing antibody were introduced into endogenous mouse Ig heavy and light chain loci by gene targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ota et al., 2013</xref>). The b12 antibody recognizes the CD4 binding site in gp120 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Roben et al., 1994</xref>). Following injection of fluorescently labeled gp120 we could track the acquisition of antigen by the gp120 specific B cells using intravital TP-LSM. Together these studies identified a group of macrophages that overlie the IFC and which extend to the cortical ridge and sinuses that bound and delivered gp120 to both re-circulating and follicle B cells. These IFMs are adjacent to, but distinct from the SSMs that overlie the LN follicle. We also identified a SIGN-R1 positive cell located in the splenic marginal zone that rapidly acquired blood borne gp120. Our studies revealed an efficient mechanism for exposing trafficking naïve B cells to gp120.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Locally injected gp120 is captured in the LN by SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophages and SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> IFC macrophages</title><p>For these studies we used an early HIV-1 viral isolate subtype A/C gp120, R66M, expressed in 293F cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nawaz et al., 2011</xref>), and injected 1 μg of fluorescently labeled gp120 near the base of the mouse tail. Confocal microscopy of thick LN sections prepared 2 hr after gp120 injection revealed that labeled gp120 had been captured by LN macrophages that overlie and extend into IFCs and that localize at the cortical medullary junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top and middle panels). The asymmetric gp120 signal results from the gp120 accessing the afferent lymphatics serving the left side of the inguinal LN as it is oriented in the figure. Further immunostaining revealed that gp120 co-localized with SIGN-R1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, bottom panel), a c-type lectin and functional ortholog of DC-specific ICAM-3-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), which has been implicated in HIV-1 transmission by human DCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Geijtenbeek et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2003</xref>). Intravital TP-LSM revealed the rapid appearance of gp120 in the subcapsular sinus and identified the same subset of SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages capturing gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Together the imaging and flow cytometry identified the gp120 binding cells as SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>mid</sup>CD11b<sup>mid</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD11c<sup>−</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> sinus macrophages (SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophages) and SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>/CD169<sup>mid</sup>CD11b<sup>low</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup>F4/80<sup>low</sup> IFM (SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> IFC macrophages) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These cells are to be distinguished from the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> DCs located in the medullary region, previously identified to uptake inactivated influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>). The SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> DCs also bound gp120 and are likely important for T cell priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Next, we investigated the role of SIGN-R1 in gp120 binding. To do this we first checked whether gp120 bound in vitro to LN SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>mid</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells and whether unlabeled gp120 competitively inhibited the binding. We found that gp120 bound a phenotypically similar subset of macrophages and that unlabeled gp120 reduced the binding of the labeled material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). When we added a SIGN-R1 blocking antibody with the labeled gp120, the level of SIGN-R1 on the LN SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>mid</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells declined as did the fluorescent gp120 binding arguing that SIGN-R1 directly participated in the binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The percentage of cells that bound gp120 declined by approximately 50% in the presence of the SIGN-R1 antibody. To directly visualize these cells in vitro, we sorted Gr-1<sup>−</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup>SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>+</sup> cells from mice previously injected with fluorescent gp120. The sorted cells were imaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because of the rarity of the cells in the LN population the sorted cells were contaminated with other cell types yet many gp120<sup>+</sup>SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> cells could be visualized. We also cultured the sorted cells with M-CSF. At day 7 the cultured cells were incubated with fluorescent gp120 and immunostained for SIGN-R1. The majority of the cultured cells retained SIGN-R1 expression and most of these cells bound gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine whether the uptake of gp120 triggered a biologic response in the IFC macrophages we injected gp120 locally and checked the intracellular interferon-γ levels in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Some of the LN SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>mid</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> cells had an elevated level of intracellular interferon-γ compared to control cells. We verified these results using an interferon-γ eYFP reporter mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Reinhardt et al., 2009</xref>). Flow cytometry was used to assess the percent of eYFP positive cells in the gated SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and to examine the induction of eYFP expression in various other cell populations in the immunized LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). To verify that the eYFP signal arose from the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages we sorted the Gr-1<sup>−</sup>CD11c<sup>−</sup>SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>+</sup> cells and imaged them. We could readily identify SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>eYFP<sup>+</sup> cells, while the other contaminating cells present in the sorted population lacked YFP expression. Finally, we injected non-labeled gp120 near the inguinal lymph of the reporter mouse and 6 hr later made thick LN sections from the draining LN node and from a distant LN. Confocal microscopy revealed eYFP positive SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>CD169<sup>mid</sup> cells in the IFC region of the draining LN, but similar cells were not present in the distant LN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Together these results identified a subset of mouse subcapsular macrophages that overlie and reside in the IFC, which express SIGN-R1 and rapidly uptake gp120. In addition, our data indicates that the local injection of gp120 likely elicits interferon-γ production by these cells.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06467.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SIGN-R1 positive interfollicular channel (IFC) and cortical medullary junction macrophages rapidly accumulate lymph borne gp120.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal microscopy of thick lymph node (LN) sections prepared from mice that had received adoptively transferred B cells (previous day), injected with fluorescently labeled gp120, and immunostained as indicated.

Using intravital TP-LSM we checked both the loading of the IFC macrophages and the FDC network in a nearby follicle. As we had previously noted the IFC macrophages rapidly captured the lymph borne gp120, however, in contrast to the naïve mouse within 4 hr of injection both gp120 preparations had loaded on to the FDC network of a germinal center (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The germinal center region was outlined by adoptively transferred naïve B cells. The strongly fluorescent cells in the germinal center are likely tingible body macrophages.</p><p>To more drastically change the carbohydrate structure of gp120, we treated the purified 293F gp120 with PNGaseF, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides. The untreated gp120 and the PNGaseF treated gp120 were used in a mouse LN overlay assay. As previously the untreated gp120 bound strongly to the SIGN-R1 positive macrophages, while the PNGase F treated gp120 exhibited much less selectivity, binding to many different cell types. This resulted in a reduction in the co-localization between SIGN-R1 and gp120. We verified that the PNGase F treatment appropriately altered the molecular mass of gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the trimeric version of gp120 offers different antigenic determinants and is rapidly becoming accepted as the preferred vaccine candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanders et al., 2013</xref>), we also checked whether a trimeric version of gp120 was captured by the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages overlying the IFC. We found a very similar pattern of uptake as we had observed with the monomeric gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together these results indicate that the carbohydrate structure of gp120 can affect the binding of gp120 to the SIGN-R1 positive macrophages, which may affect the subsequent antibody response. However minor differences in the glycosylation of gp120 did not impact FDC loading in the setting of gp120 specific antibody.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Newly arriving gp120 specific B cells can capture gp120 from the IFC cellular network</title><p>Next, we monitored the interaction of B cells with the gp120 bearing cells in the LN by adoptively transferring b12 knock-in B cells that possess gp120 reactive antigen receptors. The knock-in B cells bearing the H &amp; L, H chain, and L chain genes bind gp120 with high, low, and no detectable affinity, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burton et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ota et al., 2013</xref>). Previously 90% of all mature b12 HL B cells bound soluble trimers of HIV Env (the JRFL isolate), as measured by flow cytometry. Similar to the results with the soluble trimers of the JRFL envelope, labeled R66M gp120 bound more than 90% of the splenic follicular and marginal zone b12 HL B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ota et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Of note, the average gp120 mean fluorescent intensity on marginal zone B cells exceeded that on follicular B cells by twofold. Next we transferred gp120 specific B cells 2 hr after the injection of gp120 to assess the delivery of gp120 to newly arriving HIV-1 specific B cells. The tracks of the newly arriving b12 HL B cells and b12 L B cells predominately localized in the IFC although the b12 HL B cells focused preferentially on the gp120 bearing network cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The motility patterns of the b12 HL and b12 L B cells differed. Although the average velocities were similar, the b12 HL B cells moved less straight with more speed variability and exhibited greater displacements than the b12 L B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The b12 HL B cells interacted vigorously with the gp120 bearing cells extracting gp120 from the network cells, which accumulated in their uropods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). By loading the b12 HL B cells with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive dye, Calcium Orange, we could observe transient increases in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the b12 HL B cells interacted with, and extracted gp120 from the IFC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). The intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> rise often occurred in conjunction with an increase in gp120 in the b12 HL B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results indicate that newly arriving recirculating B cells can acquire antigen from the IFC macrophages bearing gp120.

This allowed the B cells to localize in the follicle. Then, we injected gp120 and over the next 2 hr monitored its uptake by the IFC network and the behavior of B cells in the LN follicle. As noted previously the IFC network cells rapidly accumulated gp120 and within 30 min fine cellular processes bearing gp120 became visible along the follicle edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Tracking the transferred B cells near the follicle edge revealed that the b12 HL B cells moved slower and tended to remain in the imaging space longer resulting in a longer track lengths and increased displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As a consequence b12 HL B cells accumulated at these sites while the control B cells did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The b12 HL B cells made numerous, transient interactions with the gp120 bearing cellular processes (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Tracking individual b12 HL B cells revealed that the B cells slowed as they extracted antigen from the network, after which they sped up and the cell associated gp120 signal declined, whereupon they re-engaged the network and extracted more gp120 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).

These macrophages are distinguishable from the standard subcapsular macrophages, but their localization over the IFC and by their expression of SIGN-R1 and other pattern recognition receptors. The IFC macrophages underlying these cells gradually acquire gp120. A blocking antibody to SIGN-R1 reduced the interaction of gp120 with these cells as did altering the gp120 glycan shield. Arguing that a similar subset of macrophages is present in human LN, a gp120 overlay assay revealed CD163<sup>+</sup>DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> cells localized near the LN follicle that bound gp120. In the immunized mouse LN, gp120 specific B cells arriving via the HEVs could interact with, and extract gp120 from the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Some of these macrophages extended cellular processes into the LN follicle. This allowed gp120 specific B cells located in the follicle to also acquire gp120. The B cells did not form long-lasting conjugates with the gp120 bearing IFC macrophages, but rather they repetitively, and transiently, interacted with them. B cells lacking gp120 reactive antigen receptors often wandered away showing little interest in the IFC cells. As observed previously with HEL transgenic B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>), the migrating gp120 specific B cells localized the extracted antigen to their uropods. These results suggest that much like germinal center B cells, which extract antigen from FDCs to acquire T cell help, naïve B cells can extract antigen from the IFC macrophages to acquire T cell help to initiate the extra-follicular antibody response and to generate germinal center precursors.</p><p>The IFC and cortical ridge is a crossroad for cellular traffic in the LN. Blood borne B cells enter nearby HEVs to access the LN parenchyma. The presence of the IFC macrophages and newly arrived antigen laden DCs explains why recent LN B cell entrants spend several hours exploring the IFC before entering the follicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2012</xref>). This region likely serves as a testing ground for B cells arriving in the LN from the blood to determine whether their BCRs possess sufficient affinity to acquire antigen. The IFC macrophage antigen repertoire will reflect the specificity of their cell surface receptors for material delivered in the subcapsular sinus lymph. In the case of gp120, SIGN-R1 is functionally important for its capture by the IFC cells. However, IFC macrophages likely express other receptors that assist in gp120 acquisition since the blocking SIGN-R1 antibody only reduced the uptake of gp120 by 50%. Those B cells that do not find an IFC cell with cognate antigen migrate into the LN follicle where they remain for approximately a day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Park et al., 2012</xref>). During that time should new antigen arrive in the subcapsular sinus that can be captured by the IFC macrophages, cognate B cells migrating near the follicle edge can acquire it. It will be of interest to determine whether antigen loading of the IFC macrophages results in their production of EBI2 ligands, which would tend to localize LN follicle B cells toward the IFC network cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hannedouche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kelly et al., 2011</xref>). We did note that the velocity of both the WT and the gp120 specific B cells along the follicle edge increased during the 2 hr imaging period that followed gp120 injection. The follicle B cell can also scan the FDC network for cognate antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Suzuki et al., 2009</xref>), however, until gp120 specific antibody appears little gp120 will likely be present. Those B cells that do not find cognate antigen eventually leave the follicle to exit the LN via the cortical lymphatics. Again they will have an opportunity to scan the IFC cellular network and cortical lymphatic macrophages for cognate antigen.</p><p>Although the b12 B cells carry a mutated BCR, they are functionally naïve as they have not been exposed to cognate antigen. The affinity of the b12 HL BCR for the R66M gp120 is likely low as the b12 antibody predominately recognizes B clade HIV-1 gp120 while the R66M gp120 is an A/C clade. In addition, the b12 antibody binds weakly to recombinant R66M gp120 (J Arthos, unpublished observation). As indicated above the gp120 specific B cells did not make a single long lasting synapse with the gp120 bearing IFC macrophages, but rather many transient interactions during which time the specific B cells serially extracted gp120 from the IFC cells, much like bumble bees gathering nectar. The temporal variation in gp120 fluorescence associated with the specific B cells, presumably reflects gp120-b12 HL BCR engagement, BCR internalization, gp120 degradation, and reduced fluorescence. As the B cell moves on to interact with another gp120 loaded macrophage the process is repeated. The reason why naïve B cells spend several hours repetitively engaging cognate antigen bearing cells is unclear. The serial BCR engagements and antigen extractions should provide additional B cell activation signals and saturate class II MHC molecules with peptide fragments, respectively. Those B cells that capture the highest amounts of antigen are most likely to receive help from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yuseff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Avalos and Ploegh, 2014</xref>). Our study is consistent with a recent study that showed murine B cells can very rapidly extract antigen from plasma membrane sheets decorated with antigen or an antigen surrogate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Natkanski et al., 2013</xref>). In that study B cells acquired antigen from APCs by invaginating and pinching off the presenting cell membrane using their BCR along with myosin IIa-mediated contractions. Since we visualized the IFC macrophages as a consequence of their gp120 binding, we could not detect whether the gp120 specific B cells also pinched off IFC macrophage membrane although the imaging suggested that might be the case as the B cells appeared to grab aggregates of fluorescent gp120. Alternatively, B cells can extract immobilized antigen by recruiting MHC class II-containing lysosomes to a B cell synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yuseff et al., 2011</xref>). Localized lysosome exocytosis acidifies the synapse and releases hydrolases, which promote antigen extraction. In our study this scenario seems less likely due to the transient nature of the interactions.</p><p>For the gp120 specific B cells to gather gp120 from the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages, the gp120 must remain on the surface of the macrophage and not be fully internalized. SIGN-R1 functions as a phagocytic receptor and is known to bind bacterial dextrans and the capsular polysaccharides of <italic>Streptococcus pneumonia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kang et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2004</xref>). Our data indicates that SIGN-R1 is also involved in gp120 binding and that sufficient gp120 remains surface bound for B cells to acquire it from the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. Intravital imaging the inguinal LN of a naïve mouse 72 hr after local injection of three micrograms of labeled gp120 revealed its continued presence on IFC macrophages although the fluorescence levels had declined. This suggests that the gp120 remains available for several days following its acquisition by the IFC macrophages. Of note at the same time point gp120 was not found on the LN follicle FDCs (C Park, unpublished data). It will important to assess how long the injected gp120 remains associated with the IFC macrophages and to determine whether at later time points other cell types can acquire and provide gp120 to B cells. The eventual loading of FDCs following gp120 immunization will likely depend upon gp120 persistence, the primary antibody response, gp120 immune complex formation, the capture of immune complexes by subcapsular macrophages, and their delivery to the underlying FDC network. Consistent with that scenario within 4 hr of the injection of gp120 into previously immunized mice, we found gp120 on the FDC network; however, the IFC macrophages also continued to capture it.</p><p>The LN SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> IFC macrophages preferentially captured two early viral isolate monomeric gp120 preparations and a HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein trimer that adopts a native conformation. In contrast, a monomeric gp120 protein preparation treated with Peptide-N-Glycosidase F to reduce its glycan content, the algae protein PE, or HEL showed little specificity for these cells. As many of the current recombinant vaccine candidates are being produced in HEK 293 they are also likely to be captured in the LN by the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> IFC macrophages we have described. However, the glycosylation pattern of the HIV-1 recombinant envelope proteins we tested likely differ from the HIV-1 envelope proteins produced in vivo in infected T cells and macrophages. Additional studies with gp120 or HIV virions produced in endogenously infected cells types are certainly warranted.</p><p>Disruption of the IFC cellular network by pathogens would likely limit early antibody responses to gp120 and other antigens captured by this network of macrophages. As a consequence this would reduce subsequent immune complex formation and ultimately decrease FDC network loading. The IFMs are possible HIV-1 targets as they are CD4 and CCR5 positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gray and Cyster, 2012</xref>). Furthermore, cells located within the LN IFC have been noted to be infected in HIV patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schuurman et al., 1988</xref>). Conversely, enhancing the loading and function of the IFC macrophages could improve the early humoral response to gp120 vaccines and other antigens captured by the IFC cells. Since we injected gp120 in the absence of any adjuvant, further experiments will be needed to assess how different adjuvants affect gp120 capture and its delivery to LN B cells. In addition, our study predominately focused on the events that occurred over the first several hours following gp120 injection. Many questions remain to be answered. What are the fates of the B cells that encounter antigen from the macrophages in the IFC? How does the binding of gp120 to the IFC macrophages functionally affect them? Additional studies built on the identification of this IFC cellular network should help to optimize the early extra-follicular antibody production and germinal center formation following gp120 immunization.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 and C.129S4(B6)-Ifngtm3.1Lky/J (GREAT mice) were obtained from Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME).

After anesthesia the skin and fatty tissue over inguinal LN were removed. The mouse was placed in a pre-warmed coverglass chamber slide (Nalgene, Nunc, Thermo Fisher Scientific). The chamber slide was then placed into the temperature control chamber on the microscope. The temperature of air was monitored and maintained at 37.0 ± 0.5°C. Inguinal LN was intravitally imaged from the capsule over a range of depths (10–220 μm). All two-photon imaging was performed with a Leica SP5 inverted 5 channel confocal microscope (Leica Microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany) equipped with 25× water dipping objective, 0.95 NA (immersion medium used distilled water). Two-photon excitation was provided by a Mai Tai Ti:Sapphire laser (Spectra Physics, Newport Research Corporation, Invine, CA) with a 10 W pump, tuned wavelength ranges from 810 to 910 nm. Emitted fluorescence was collected using a 4 channel non-descanned detector.

For four-dimensional analysis of cell behavior, stacks of various numbers of section (z step = 3, 4, or 6 μm) were acquired every 10–12 s to provide an imaging volume of 30–100 μm in depth. Sequences of image stacks were transformed into volume-rendered four-dimensional videos using Imaris software v.7.7.1 64× (Bitplane AG, Zurich, Switzerland), and the tracks analysis was used for semi-automated tracking of cell motility in three dimensions by using the following parameters: autoregressive motion algorithm, estimated diameter 10 μm, background subtraction true, maximum distance 20 μm, and maximum gap size 3. Tracks acquired that could be tracked for at least 20% of total imaging duration were used for analysis. Some tracks were manually examined and verified.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before reaching this decision, and the Reviewing Editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>To understand how antibody responses are mounted against HIV gp120 it is important to define how the antigen is captured and displayed for B cell recognition. The current manuscript by Kehrl and coworkers addresses this issue using the mouse as a model. They find gp120 is preferentially captured by cells in interfollicular regions of draining LNs, including SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. This is a distinct pattern of capture from that reported for immune complexes, antigen-coated beads and VSV, which were all found in previous studies to be preferentially bound and displayed by CD169<sup>+</sup> subcapsular sinus macrophages (SSMs). The gp120 binding pattern is most similar to that previously reported for inactivated influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzalez et al., 2010</xref>) and although the authors suggest there is little similarity to that pattern, the central conclusion of the influenza study, like the present one, was that SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>LN macrophages were involved in antigen capture and presentation to B cells. The focus on interfollicular regions in the present work is considered a positive feature of the study, though it should be noted that the distinction between interfollicular and medullary regions is not always straightforward as B cells follicles can be proximal to the medulla.</p><p>In a series of well performed experiments, this study describes the time course of labeled gp120 appearance on interfollicular cells, and shows this distribution differs from that of a small soluble antigen (HEL) that accesses LN conduits. Cognate B cells are shown to encounter and capture gp120 from interfollicular cells, to transmit Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals during this process, and to transiently modulate their migration during interactions leading to antigen capture. They also find that a form of gp120 with higher sialylation gains deeper access to interfollicular regions and this is correlated with a more robust antibody response.</p><p>Overall, this study provides important new information about the distinct ways in which a highly glycosylated antigen is handled in the LN during a primary immune response, describing properties of the cell types involved and demonstrating that cognate B cells can capture antigen from these cells. Perhaps the one significant concern I have is whether the antigen-capture and display logic observed for gp120 in the mouse applies in humans. Since HIV1 is not a natural pathogen of mice, to understand how directly translatable these findings are for gp120 antigen handling in humans it would seem reasonable to ask if any aspect of the antigen handling can be recapitulated with human or primate tissue. In particular, the fluorescent gp120 overlay experiment of the type used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> could be attempted with human or primate LN sections.</p><p>Other comments:</p><p>1) Published work has highlighted the difficulty of isolating LN macrophages in pure form (e.g. Gray et al., 2012 PLoS One 7, e38258). To establish that the cells analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E and F</xref> are macrophages and to validate the statement that the gp120 binding cells are SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>/CD169<sup>mid</sup>/CD11b<sup>mid</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup>/ CD11c<sup>-</sup>/F4/80<sup>low</sup> sinus and interfollicular macrophages (subsection “Locally injected gp120 is captured in the LN by SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> subcapsular macrophages and SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> IFC macrophages”), microscopy analysis of isolated cells should be provided. The IFNγ data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> are not especially convincing as the shift is small and it is not stated how many experiments are represented by these data. The conclusion might be stronger if it were backed up by a second measurement such as using the IFNγ-eYFP reporter mice available live from Jax.</p><p>2) The data showing the SIGN-R1 dependence of gp120 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) are not especially convincing. It is not clear how many experiments are represented by the data shown or what is the fold difference in binding. This result might be stronger if the effect of SIGN-R1 blocking in LN sections on the ability of gp120 to bind were shown. Alternatively, data could be provided for cells from SIGN-R1 KO mice. If the binding of gp120 really were selectively dependent on SIGN-R1 then the authors would be in a position to perform a mechanistic test of whether antigen capture by SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> cells is important for induction of anti-gp120 antibody responses by immunizing SIGNR1 deficient or blocked mice.</p><p>3) The authors show, using gp120, that it is deposited on SIGN-R1 positive macrophages. They then used two unglycosylated proteins, HEL and PE, which were not deposited on the cells, and on the basis of this, they have concluded that glycosylation on gp120 causes the retention. This needs to be proved more convincingly, for example by treating gp120 with glycosylases to remove glycosylation from GP120 itself and showing that the treated protein is no longer retained. Similarly, can a SIGN-R1 blocking antibody inhibit antigen retention? As its stands this is only shown in vitro which could lead to artifacts.</p><p>Another possibility would be to use gp120 produced in cells treated with glycosylase inhibitors such as Kifenensen.</p><p>4) To quantify B cell response to gp120 in the presence of inhibitory SIGN-R1 antibody. Is the deposition on these macrophages the only way B cells do see gp120?</p><p>5) It is well established that SIGN-R1 is expressed on medullary macrophages and dendritic cells but not in interfollicular regions. A key finding of this work is that SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages also appear to be present in interfollicular regions. It would be important to have a more definitive examination of this. Whole lymph node imaging providing a comparison between medullary SIGN-R1 staining and the described SIGN-R1 staining in interfollicular regions would significantly add to this work. Such an analysis would also benefit from the addition of a CD11c marker. As recently demonstrated by Ron Germain's group, dendritic cells in interfollicular regions (LS DCs) are able to capture antigen; it would therefore be important to demonstrate that SIGN-R1 interfollicular macrophages are actually capturing the gp120 and exclude the possibility that this is coming from DCs.</p><p>6) The authors show at the beginning of the manuscript that gp120 co-localizes with SIGN-R1. From then onwards, they mostly rely on only the localization of gp120 and not SIGN-R1 as well, which may lead to confusion. It is important to have this control in all the figures.</p><p>7) Is this the case for whole of HIV? It would be great if the authors were to consider the injection of inactivated HIV. However, something that the authors will have to deal with is to discuss their findings in the context of the wider literature. It is important to recognize that several groups, such as the one of Uli Von Adrian, have been making seminal contributions on virus retention in the follicles. Similarly, the behavior of the B cells looks similar to the one described during antigen extraction from FDCs or in vitro, which has been reported by both the Cyster group and by the Neuberger group, the latter having actually introduced the term.</p><p><italic>Should you be unable to use</italic> HIV for these experiments you can use a more native trimer preparation such as the ones that have been crystalized by Ian Wilson and Peter Kwong consisting of BG505 native trimers.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “The HIV-1 envelope protein gp120 is captured and displayed for B cell recognition by SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> lymph node macrophages” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Data are added to show SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> staining of isolated LN macrophages by fluorescence microscopy of sorted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). However, in the example shown it appears that 1 cell out of ∼4 is SIGNR1<sup>+</sup>. It needs to be indicated what frequency of the sorted cells have a macrophage appearance and SIGNR1<sup>+</sup> surface staining.</p><p>2) Related to 1, the amount of IFNγ-YFP expression by the ‘macrophages’ is surprising given the limited evidence in the literature for IFNγ expression by macrophages. Without knowing how well excluded T cells, NK cells and ILCs are from the macrophage gate (e.g. by frequency determination for several experiments in 1 above), it is difficult to feel confident about the IFNγ data.</p><p>3) Given that the binding to SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> cells strongly depends on glycosylation, how well matched is the glycosylation of gp120 produced in CHO-S cells or 293F cells to the form produced in vivo by infected T cells and macrophages? The cellular tropism of highly glycosylated proteins may reflect more the cell types in which they are expressed than unique properties of the antigen. In this regard, it is notable that the “two other antigens” mentioned in the Abstract as not being captured by SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages are also not made in CHO-S or 293F cells and neither one is a glycoprotein. Some text should be added to the Discussion to address this issue (perhaps commenting that the antigen studied may be most relevant to vaccine type antigens) and to highlight the need for future studies with gp120 or HIV virions produced from endogenously infected cell types.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06467.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Overall, this study provides important new information about the distinct ways in which a highly glycosylated antigen is handled in the LN during a primary immune response, describing properties of the cell types involved and demonstrating that cognate B cells can capture antigen from these cells.

Our initially sorted cells were predominately macrophages based on their behavior and morphology. To eliminate other cell types we cultured the sorted cell with in M-CSF containing media for 7 days. The majority of these cultured cells captured gp120 in an overlay assay, and all the capturing cells were SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>.

The % of gp120<sup>+</sup> cells in gate b of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> was reduced from 41.8 to 23.7 percent. We have noted this in the text. When we injected the SIGN-R1 blocking antibody in vivo, we also saw a similar reduction in the percent of gp120<sup>+</sup> cells in gate b (data not shown). While our data indicates that SIGN-R1 is important for binding gp120, other receptors likely help capture it.</p><p><italic>This result might be stronger if the effect of SIGN-R1 blocking in LN sections on the ability of gp120 to bind were shown</italic>.</p><p>We tried pre-incubating the sections with the SIGN-R1 antibody prior to the gp120 overlay.

However, we agree with the reviewer that looking at the early gp120 antibody response in SIGN-R1 KO mice would be very interesting (see above). In addition, we think that SIGN-R1 is very good marker for these macrophages.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show, using gp120, that it is deposited on SIGN-R1 positive macrophages. They then used two unglycosylated proteins, HEL and PE, which were not deposited on the cells, and on the basis of this, they have concluded that glycosylation on gp120 causes the retention.

Similarly, can a SIGN-R1 blocking antibody inhibit antigen retention? As its stands this is only shown in vitro which could lead to artifacts</italic>.</p><p>To address this issue we treated gp120 with PNGaseF, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides from <italic>N</italic>-linked glycoproteins. The native gp120 and the PNGaseF treated gp120 were used in a mouse lymph node overlay assay. As usual the native gp120 bound strongly to the SIGN-R1 positive macrophages, while the PNGaseF treated gp120 exhibited much less selectivity binding to many different cell types. This resulted in a reduction in the co-localization between SIGN-R1 and gp120. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. The injection of the SIGN-R1 antibody (in vivo) reduced the amount of binding to the SIGN-R1 positive macrophages by a similar amount to that noted in the in vitro assays (data not shown).</p><p><italic>Another possibility would be to use gp120 produced in cells treated with glycosylase inhibitors such as Kifenensen</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this would be useful experiment. We are in the process of obtaining gp120 produced in cells treated with Kifunensine, however, we do not yet have the protein. The Kifunensine treated cells should produce a high mannose gp120.</p><p><italic>4) To quantify B cell response to gp120 in the presence of inhibitory SIGN-R1 antibody. Is the deposition on these macrophages the only way B cells do see gp120?</italic></p><p>We have only looked at the initial interaction between B cells and gp120 bearing cells. While our data indicates that at these early time points these macrophages provide a major mechanism by which B cells can acquire gp120, however, we do not know if B cells are also acquiring antigen from other cell types. Since resident and trafficking dendritic cells should also acquire gp120 from these macrophages, they may also participate in antigen presentation to B cells. During the time interval we have noted the traditional subcapsular macrophages overlying the lymph node follicle capture very little gp120, making them an unlikely source of antigen for B cells during a primary response.</p><p><italic>5) It is well established that SIGN-R1 is expressed on medullary macrophages and dendritic cells but not in interfollicular regions.

We suspect that DCs are also acquiring gp120 in the interfollicular region from the gp120 bearing SIGN-R1 positive macrophages. We added an additional supplementary figure that shows the localization of interfollicular CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells in relation to gp120 and CD169 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the overlay assay performed with the human lymph node section shows partial co-localization between CD163, gp120, and DC-Sign.</p><p><italic>6) The authors show at the beginning of the manuscript that gp120 co-localizes with SIGN-R1. From then onwards, they mostly rely on only the localization of gp120 and not SIGN-R1 as well, which may lead to confusion. It is important to have this control in all the figures</italic>.</p><p>We tried to show the important controls in each figure. In the revised manuscript, we have added two new supplementary figures that show gp120, SIGN-R1, and a macrophage marker. In addition, we show the human lymph node section with gp120, DC-SIGN, and CD163 partial co-localization. We also show a SIGN-R1, gp120 positive sinus lining macrophage likely interacting with an endogenous B cell by intravital microscopy (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Is this the case for whole of HIV?

Similarly, the behavior of the B cells looks similar to the one described during antigen extraction from FDCs or in vitro, which has been reported by both the Cyster group and by the Neuberger group, the latter having actually introduced the term</italic>.</p><p>Should you be unable to use <italic>HIV for these experiments you can use a more native trimer preparation such as the ones that have been crystalized by Ian Wilson and Peter Kwong consisting of BG505 native trimers.</italic></p><p>We are unable to use HIV virus; however, we were able to acquire a biotinylated trimeric gp120 made by John Moore. When injected near the inguinal lymph node it showed a similar binding pattern as did the monomeric gp120. Following the trimeric gp120 injection near the inguinal lymph node, sections were prepared and the localization of gp120 determined by staining with and labeled streptavidin. This data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>In their revised manuscript the authors have added new data and made a number of changes that help address several of the earlier concerns.

Without knowing how well excluded T cells, NK cells and ILCs are from the macrophage gate (e.g. by frequency determination for several experiments in 1 above), it is difficult to feel confident about the IFN</italic>γ <italic>data</italic>.</p><p>We agree that the expression of IFNγ by macrophages has been controversial. Initially we used intracellular FACS to check several different cytokines in the “gate b” cells. Of the cytokines we checked the only one that showed a reproducible gp120 inducible response was IFNγ. We also agree that contaminating cells can be an issue when sorting a low frequency cell population (less than 1% in this case). Furthermore, sorting tissue macrophage can be problematic due to their association with other cell types. As the reviewer noted, our sorted populations were contaminated. The issue is whether these contaminating cells gave a false positive in our analysis. We think not, and have added some additional data to address this issue. Using the IFNγ-YFP mouse we characterized the level of YFP expression in various cell populations following immunization with gp120. As expected, NK and NKT cells constitutively expressed YFP, however, gp120 immunization led to little change in their expression levels, while a significant shift was noted after immunization in the “gate b” cells that includes the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages. This can be explained by either the induction of YFP expression by the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages or a tight association between the SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup> macrophages and an IFNγ expressing cell type that occurred as a consequence of the gp120 immunization. Arguing against the latter explanation the only sorted cells that we observed to express YFP were SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>. An image of several sorted YFP positive SIGN-R1 positive cells is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>. Because of the difficulties in purifying and sorting these cells we also used a more direct approach. We immunized the IFNγ-YFP mouse with gp120 near the inguinal lymph node and 6 hours later removed the adjacent inguinal lymph node and as a control took a cervical lymph node. We made thick lymph node sections and immunostained for SIGN-R1 and CD169. Confocal microscopy identified YFP<sup>+</sup> cells in the interfollicular region of the immunized LN, some of which were SIGN-R1<sup>+</sup>/CD169<sup>+/-</sup>. In contrast, we did not find such cells in the non-immunized cervical lymph node. Together this data indicates that the SIGNR-1<sup>+</sup> macrophages can make at least modest levels of IFNγ following immunization with gp120.</p><p><italic>3) Given that the binding to SIGN-R1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>cells strongly depends on glycosylation, how well matched is the glycosylation of gp120 produced in CHO-S cells or 293F cells to the form produced in vivo by infected T cells and macrophages? The cellular tropism of highly glycosylated proteins may reflect more the cell types in which they are expressed than unique properties of the antigen. In this regard, it is notable that the “two other antigens” mentioned in the Abstract as not being captured by SIGN-R1</italic><sup><italic>+</italic></sup> <italic>macrophages are also not made in CHO-S or 293F cells and neither one is a glycoprotein. Some text should be added to the Discussion to address this issue (perhaps commenting that the antigen studied may be most relevant to vaccine type antigens) and to highlight the need for future studies with gp120 or HIV virions produced from endogenously infected cell types</italic>.</p><p>We have added some text to discuss the issues raised above.</p></body></sub-article></article>
