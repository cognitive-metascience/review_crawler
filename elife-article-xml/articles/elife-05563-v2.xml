Understanding how this occurs is highly relevant to cardiac regenerative therapy. Yet, how cardiomyocytes achieve and maintain a post-mitotic state is unknown. Here, we show that cardiomyocyte centrosome integrity is lost shortly after birth. This is coupled with relocalization of various centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope. Consequently, postnatal cardiomyocytes are unable to undergo ciliogenesis and the nuclear envelope adopts the function as cellular microtubule organizing center. Loss of centrosome integrity is associated with, and can promote, cardiomyocyte G0/G1 cell cycle arrest suggesting that centrosome disassembly is developmentally utilized to achieve the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Adult cardiomyocytes of zebrafish and newt, which are able to proliferate, maintain centrosome integrity. Collectively, our data provide a novel mechanism underlying the post-mitotic state of mammalian cardiomyocytes as well as a potential explanation for why zebrafish and newts, but not mammals, can regenerate their heart.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05563.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05563.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05563.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Muscle cells in the heart contract in regular rhythms to pump blood around the body. In humans, rats and other mammals, the vast majority of heart muscle cells lose the ability to divide shortly after birth. Therefore, the heart is unable to replace cells that are lost over the life of the individual, for example, during a heart attack. If too many of these cells are lost, the heart will be unable to pump effectively, which can lead to heart failure. Currently, the only treatment option in humans with heart failure is to perform a heart transplant.</p><p>Some animals, such as newts and zebrafish, are able to replace lost heart muscle cells throughout their lifetimes. Thus, these species are able to fully regenerate their hearts even after 20% has been removed. This suggests that it might be possible to manipulate human heart muscle cells to make them divide and regenerate the heart. Recent research has suggested that structures called centrosomes, known to be required to separate copies of the DNA during cell division, are used as a hub to integrate the initial signals that determine whether a cell should divide or not.</p><p>Here, Zebrowski et al. studied the centrosomes of heart muscle cells in rats, newts and zebrafish. The experiments show that the centrosomes in rat heart muscle cells are dissembled shortly after birth. Centrosomes are made of several proteins and, in the rat cells, these proteins moved to the membrane that surrounded the nucleus. On the other hand, the centrosomes in the heart muscle cells of the adult newts and zebrafish remained intact.</p><p>Further experiments found that that breaking apart the centrosomes of heart muscle cells taken from newborn rats stops these cells from dividing. Zebrowski et al.'s findings suggest that the loss of centrosomes after birth is a possible reason why the hearts of adult humans and other mammals are unable to regenerate after injury. In the future, these findings may aid the development of methods to regenerate human heart muscle and new treatments that may limit division of cancer cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05563.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05563.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>cardiomyocyte</kwd><kwd>newt</kwd><kwd>primary cilium</kwd><kwd>MTOC</kwd><kwd>terminal differentiation</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocyte proliferation</kwd><kwd>heart regeneration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005156</institution-id><institution>Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Sofja Kovalevskaja Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EN 453/9-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001652</institution-id><institution>Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EFI/ CYDER</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engel</surname><given-names>Felix B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000860</institution-id><institution>European Society Of Cardiology (ESC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>German Cardiac Society (Klaus-Georg und Sigrid Hengstberger-Forschungsstipendium)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weidinger</surname><given-names>Gilbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mammal hearts are unable to replace lost cardiomyocytes, which may be due to the loss of centrosome integrity in these cells after birth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The adult mammalian heart is considered to be a post-mitotic organ, as mammalian cardiomyocytes lose their ability to proliferate shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Soonpaa et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zebrowski and Engel, 2013</xref>). This is supported by the limited regenerative capacity of the adult mammalian heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Senyo et al., 2014</xref>) and the fact that primary adult cardiomyocyte-born tumors are extremely rare, if they exist at all (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dell'Amore et al., 2011</xref>). Understanding the underlying mechanisms governing the post-mitotic state of adult mammalian cardiomyocytes may clarify whether it is possible to induce cardiac regeneration based on cardiomyocyte proliferation as seen in zebrafish and newts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gamba et al., 2014</xref>). Tremendous efforts have been invested to induce postnatal mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, besides the fact that cell cycle promoting factors (e.g., Cyclins) are downregulated around birth, while cell cycle inhibitors (e.g., Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors) are induced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ikenishi et al., 2012</xref>), little is known about the mechanisms that induce cell cycle exit or establish the post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van Amerongen and Engel, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The centrosome is a solitary, juxtanuclear organelle in metazoan cell-types. It consists of a pair of tubulin-based structures, called centrioles, encased in a dense, non-membranous, multi-protein cloud called the pericentriolar matrix (PCM), which is further surrounded by a dispersed array of proteins termed centriolar satellites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bettencourt-Dias, 2013</xref>). Traditionally, the centrosome is known as the <underline>m</underline>icro<underline>t</underline>ubule <underline>o</underline>rganizing <underline>c</underline>enter (MTOC) of the cell, and is required for primary cilium formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim and Dynlacht, 2013</xref>). Recently, the centrosome has emerged as a critical signaling hub for the cell cycle regulatory machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pascreau et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this role, increasing evidence supports the requirement of a functional centrosome for proliferative potential in mammalian cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, cells undergo G0/G1 arrest when (i) centrosomes are removed via laser ablation, (ii) centrosome integrity is disrupted via knockdown of centrosome proteins, or (iii) centriole biogenesis is blocked via a chemical inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinchcliffe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikule et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wong et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To date, the role of centrosome integrity in cell proliferation has always been studied in the context of centrosome component mutants. Here, we show that centrosome integrity is developmentally regulated in mammalian cardiomyocytes, revealing a novel mechanism that renders cells post-mitotic. Our findings might have important implications for efforts to induce therapeutic cardiomyocyte proliferation in adult mammalian hearts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A normal diploid cell in G0/G1-phase contains one centrosome with two paired centrioles. During S-phase the centrosome duplicates whereby the two parental centrioles form daughter centrioles. Around the transition from G2-phase to mitosis, parental centrioles ‘split’ (loss of cohesion) resulting in two separated centrosomes that become part of the spindle poles during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>). When centrosome integrity is compromised during G0/G1-phase, centrioles can lose cohesion (i.e., become unpaired) adopting a premature ‘split’ configuration, defined as a distance &gt; 2 µm between centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graser et al., 2007</xref>). To determine if centrosome integrity changes in cardiomyocytes during development, we analyzed centriole configuration using antibodies against γ-tubulin, a marker of both the centriole and the PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>). Centrioles were observed to be in a typical paired configuration in the majority of cultured cardiomyocytes isolated from embryonic day (E) 15, E18, and postnatal day (P) 0 rat hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) as well as in cardiomyocytes from E15 and P0 rat heart sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In contrast, shortly after birth, centrioles were split in the vast majority of P3 and P5 cardiomyocytes in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Analysis of mother and daughter centriole markers (Odf2 and Centrobin, respectively) in isolated rat cardiomyocytes verified that each γ-tubulin signal represented a single centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As an internal control, cardiac non-myocytes from the same cultures and tissue sections were examined. The majority of non-myocytes in the heart are fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells that all have the ability to proliferate. At all examined developmental stages, non-myocytes showed a typical paired-centriole configuration indicating that the split-centriole phenotype was cardiomyocyte-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that centriole cohesion, and thus centrosome integrity, is lost in mammalian cardiomyocytes shortly after birth.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05563.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Loss of centrosome integrity during heart development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of centriole (γ-tubulin) configuration in E15- or P5-isolated ventricular rat cardiomyocytes (Troponin I).

The PCM proteins Pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2 have previously been shown to be required for centriole-cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsuo et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this function, both PCM proteins localized to the centrosome in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). In contrast, both proteins were localized to the nuclear envelope in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>). Although remnants of Pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2 could be observed at the centriole in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>), their presence was significantly reduced when centrioles were split (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). <italic>Pcnt</italic> siRNA-mediated knockdown in P0-isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in an increase of split-centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>), confirming that Pericentrin is required for centriole-cohesion in cardiomyocytes. In contrast to PCM proteins, the centriole-associated proteins CEP135, Odf2, and Centrobin were not observed at the nuclear envelope in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that loss of centriole cohesion is accompanied by redistribution of centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope.</p><p>Centrosome localization of Pericentrin is dependent on the centriole satellite protein PCM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barenz et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this, PCM1 localized at the centrosome and the nuclear envelope in E15- and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Further, nuclear envelope localization of PCM1 occurred by P0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>), prior to that of Pericentrin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Occasionally, PCM1 was observed in a semi-belt pattern at the nuclear envelope proximal to the centrosome in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), indicating a transitional state. These data suggest that in cardiomyocytes, PCM1 is also required for the localization of Pericentrin to the centrosome. To test this, we overexpressed the major isoform of Pericentrin associated with the centrosome, Pericentrin B, in E15-, P0-, and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes. Pericentrin B-GFP localized to centrioles in non-myocytes as well as E15-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). In contrast, Pericentrin B-GFP did not localize to the centrioles in the vast majority of P0- and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes but rather created cellular aggregates which were not observed in E15 cardiomyocytes or non-myocytes. These data indicate that the machinery required for centrosome integrity is lost in postnatal cardiomyocytes.</p><p>To determine if relocalization of centrosome proteins to the nuclear envelope and loss of centriole-cohesion is caused by cell autonomous mechanisms, long-term culturing experiments were performed. Long-term culturing of E15-isolated and P0-isolated cardiomyocytes resulted in PCM1 and Pericentrin relocalization to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and loss of paired-centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>), respectively. Further, mouse iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes had split-centrioles and the centrosome proteins PCM1 and Pericentrin localized to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These results indicate that loss of centrosome integrity begins during fetal development and progresses in a cell autonomous manner.</p><p>Previously, it has been demonstrated that <italic>Pcnt</italic> is alternatively spliced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyoshi et al., 2006</xref>), resulting in two isoforms; Pericentrin B which resembles the human Pericentrin Kendrin, and Pericentrin S, which lacks an N-terminus region. Pericentrin B is ubiquitously expressed at all developmental stages. In contrast, expression of Pericentrin S starts late in fetal development and was found to be specific for adult heart and skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miyoshi et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that expression of the Pericentrin S isoform may coincide with changes in centrosome integrity during the development of cardiomyocytes. RT-PCR analysis revealed the appearance of <italic>Pcnt S</italic> expression shortly before birth in the heart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Antibodies specific for the Pericentrin B isoform indicated that Pericentrin S, and not Pericentrin B, was the predominant Pericentrin isoform at the nuclear envelope in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>Pcnt</italic> is alternatively spliced during perinatal heart development and this change is related to its relocalization to the nuclear envelope.</p><p>Loss of centrosome integrity in postnatal cardiomyocytes suggested that centrosome function might be compromised as well. Nearly all cell-types studied to date are capable of forming a primary cilium when arrested in G0/G1-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bowser and Wheatley, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nigg and Stearns, 2011</xref>). This suggests that cardiomyocytes, which are arrested shortly after birth in G0/G1 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Takeuchi, 2014</xref>), should be capable of ciliogenesis. Yet, given that PCM1, which is required for ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2008</xref>), is lost from the centrosome during development, we speculated that ciliogenesis is suppressed in cardiomyocytes. Induction of ciliogenesis via serum starvation resulted in the formation of a primary cilium in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes and non-myocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the frequency of cardiomyocytes capable of ciliogenesis decreased with heart development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) with less than 1% of isolated postnatal cardiomyocytes, which were arrested in G1/G0 as confirmed by lack of Ki67 expression and FACS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>), forming a primary cilium. Further, no postnatal binucleated cardiomyocytes were observed to be capable of ciliogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In contrast to cardiomyocytes, the frequency of cardiac non-myocytes capable of ciliogenesis was high at all developmental stages investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05563.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Loss of centrosome function during heart development.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Identification of primary cilium (Arl13b) in E15- and P5-isolated cardiomyocytes (Troponin I) and non-myocytes.

As these proteins localize to the nuclear envelope during neonatal development, we hypothesized that the cellular MTOC is transferred from the centrosome to the nuclear envelope. In accordance with this hypothesis, microtubules were found to predominantly emanate from the centrosome in E15-isolated cardiomyocytes as also observed in non-myocytes. In contrast, in P3-isolated cardiomyocytes microtubules were found to predominantly emanate from the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

To test this, the cell cycle marker Ki67 was assessed in cardiomyocytes from different developmental stages. Cardiomyocyte proliferative potential decreased with neonatal development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, P3-isolated cardiomyocytes with paired-centrioles exhibited greater proliferative potential than those with split centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>) at a frequency similar to that of E15- and P0-isolated cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>)—of which the vast majority have paired-centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Subsequently, we tested whether centrosome integrity is required for cardiomyocyte proliferative potential. Centrosome integrity was disrupted by either siRNA-mediated knockdown of <italic>Pcnt</italic>, or overexpression of a RFP-tagged dominant negative C-terminal Pericentrin (RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>), which displaces endogenous Pericentrin localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gillingham and Munro, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikule et al., 2007</xref>).

Previously, it has been demonstrated that p38 inhibition (p38i) allows postnatal cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engel et al., 2005</xref>). This raised the question whether p38i can over-ride post-mitotic arrest in cardiomyocytes with split-centrioles. p38i enhanced the proliferative potential of P3-isolated cardiomyocytes with split-centrioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Thus, we determined if the observed changes in centrosome integrity affects spindle pole number during mitosis in postnatal cardiomyocytes when cell cycle progression is induced. In response to serum stimulation, P0- and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes exhibited a typical metaphase consisting of two γ-tubulin foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>). p38i had no effect on the number of γ-tubulin foci in P0-isolated cardiomyocytes during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>).

Similarly, adult-isolated cardiomyocytes induced to re-enter the cell cycle by p38i + FGF1 also exhibited multiple γ-tubulin foci during metaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).

Since RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> RNA did not cause necrosis or lethality, it is plausible that the observed developmental delay was caused, at least partly, by reduced proliferation of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>-expressing cells. To further test an effect on proliferation, we injected DNA constructs driving RFP or dominant negative Pericentrin (RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>) expression from the CMV promoter into one-cell stage embryos and analyzed the size of RFP-positive clones of cells at 20 hpf. Embryos were sorted into four classes according to the size of the clones, namely no visible clones (class I), few scattered cells (class II), medium-sized clones (class III), and large clones (class IV).

In contrast, the majority of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> DNA-injected embryos contained either no clones (class I) or few scattered clones (class II), while larger clones (class III and IV) were rarely seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G,H</xref>). This suggests that clonal expansion of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> expressing cells is reduced, which substantiates the hypothesis that expression of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> reduces cell proliferative potential. These results suggest that zebrafish cells require centrosome integrity for proliferation in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Increasing evidence supports the requirement of a functional centrosome for cellular proliferative potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doxsey et al., 2005</xref>). For instance, somatic cell-types arrest in G0/G1 when centrosomes are removed or disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hinchcliffe et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khodjakov and Rieder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mikule et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Further, centrosome degradation occurs during female meiosis—a process believed to inhibit parthenogenesis—with mitotic cycles restored upon fertilization when the sperm donates a centrosome during zygote formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Klotz et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clift and Schuh, 2013</xref>). Moreover, relocalization of the MTOC to non-centrosomal loci has been described for several post-mitotic, highly differentiated, cell-types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartolini and Gundersen, 2006</xref>). This body of literature coupled with our results suggests that centrosome integrity can be developmentally regulated to achieve a post-mitotic state.</p><p>Centrosome disassembly appears to be a very effective way to achieve a post-mitotic state. But why do cardiomyocytes disassemble their centrosomes? Upon birth, the neonatal heart, and the cardiomyocytes therein, undergo increased hemodynamic stress. Effective cardiomyocyte function in response to increased hemodynamic stress may require a cytoskeletal architecture more conducive to handling postnatal physical stresses (e.g., a nuclear envelope-based MTOC). Thus, centrosome disassembly may be a result of cytoskeletal reorganization. In this scenario, proliferative potential might be sacrificed for postnatal function.</p><p>It has long been considered that skeletal myoblasts and cardiomyocytes have distinct molecular mechanisms to control their proliferative growth. This theory has been primarily based on the observation that proliferation and differentiation (contraction) are mutually exclusive in skeletal muscle but occur in parallel in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ueno et al., 1988</xref>). However, our results together with others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tassin et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bugnard et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srsen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fant et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zaal et al., 2011</xref>) challenges this dogma, as establishment of a post-mitotic state in both muscle cell-types coincides with MTOC relocalization to the nuclear envelope and centrosome disassembly.</p><p>The observation that p38i promotes cardiomyocyte proliferative potential in the absence of a functional centrosome provides some optimism for heart regeneration via proliferation of endogenous cardiomyocytes. However, we observe that an absence of centrosome integrity correlates with multiple spindle poles. Although multiple spindle poles are generally resolved into a semi-clustered/pseudo-bipolar conformation, this process is nevertheless highly prone to the formation of merotelic spindle-kinetochore attachments, which can promote chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ganem et al., 2009</xref>). Indeed, postnatal cardiomyocytes induced to proliferate exhibit chromosome segregation abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engel et al., 2006</xref>). While cell viability can exist when aneuploidy is limited (e.g., as seen in Down Syndrome), aneuploidy is generally not well tolerated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Torres et al., 2008</xref>). Therefore, proliferation of adult cardiomyocytes may not necessarily result in viable daughter cells. Thus, in the absence of a functional centrosome, whether a particular manipulation induces aneuploidy, and to what degree, may be a critical factor in determining its regenerative therapeutic potential.</p><p>The origin of multiple spindle poles (i.e., multiple γ-tubulin foci) during cardiomyocyte mitosis is not entirely clear. Interestingly, in addition to centriole-cohesion, Pericentrin and Cdk5Rap2 are also required for centriole-engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrera et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Rhee, 2012</xref>). During S-phase, centrioles are duplicated, with each mother centriole forming a daughter centriole, which remains closely attached (i.e., engaged) until mid-anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuriyama and Borisy, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sluder, 2013</xref>). When mother-daughter centrioles are engaged, only the mother centriole exhibits a strong γ-tubulin signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, one speculation is that when cells that lack centriole-cohesion enter mitosis, they have an increased likelihood of premature loss of centriole-engagement, thus accounting for the four γ-tubulin signals observed at metaphase. However, it has to be considered that induction of mitosis in bi-nucleated cardiomyocytes, which increasingly appear after birth, results in four γ-tubulin signals in metaphase corresponding to four duplicated centrioles.</p><p>The ability of zebrafish and newts to regenerate their heart has gained extensive interest in recent years. One major question is what distinguishes mammalian cardiomyocytes from those of zebrafish and newts with regards to their proliferative potential. Our data demonstrate that the state of cellular differentiation of cardiomyocytes from various species is not evolutionary conserved. The fact that adult zebrafish and newt cardiomyocytes maintain their centrosome integrity indicates that factors promoting adult zebrafish cardiomyocyte proliferation might not necessarily induce adult mammalian cardiomyocyte proliferation.</p><p>Recently, it has been shown that planarians can develop and regenerate in the absence of centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azimzadeh et al., 2012</xref>). This has questioned the requirement of a centrosome for cell proliferation during development and regeneration. However, there are significant differences between planarians and vertebrates in cell cycle control. For example, planarians express only one single repressive E2F, whereas mammals and zebrafish express several repressive and activating E2Fs. In addition, planarians do not have Cyclin E or Cyclin A homologs. Further, cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 (to which Cyclin E/A usually binds) is expressed at such low levels in planarians that it is considered functionally dead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu and Pearson, 2013</xref>). This is important as in mammals centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pascreau et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, at least in the case of Cyclin E and Cyclin A, planarians lack centrosome-regulated cell cycle factors. In addition, our data indicate that centrosome integrity is required for proliferation during zebrafish development. This is in agreement with the recent observation that plk4 depletion in zebrafish impairs centriolar biogenesis during development and increases premature cell cycle exit (independent of ciliogenesis defects) resulting in reduced zebrafish size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2014</xref>). Other examples of centriole-associated genes whose depletion causes cell cycle defects resulting in impaired development are <italic>stil</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pfaff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vulprecht et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2014</xref>) and <italic>cetn2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delaval et al., 2011</xref>). While there is no evidence for the requirement of functional centrosomes in cardiac regeneration in zebrafish, there are data that indirectly suggest that centrosome function might be required for cardiac regeneration. For example it has been shown that inhibition of <italic>mps1</italic> and <italic>plk1</italic>, factors implicated in centrosome assembly and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pike and Fisk, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al., 2014</xref>), impairs cardiac regeneration in zebrafish after apex resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jopling et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, it will be interesting in the future to test if destruction of centrosome integrity will indeed abolish the ability of zebrafish to regenerate their heart.</p><p>Taken together, this study suggests that relocalization of the MTOC disrupts centrosome integrity which, in turn, promotes a post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes. Given the increasing role of the centrosome in cell cycle control, understanding how centrosome integrity is regulated during development may reveal new mechanisms to regulate cell proliferation with implications for regeneration and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The investigation conforms with the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals published by the Directive 2010/63/EU of the European Parliament and according to the regulations issued by the Committee for Animal Rights Protection of the State of Hessen (Regierungspraesidium Darmstadt) as well as Baden-Württemberg (Regierungspraesidium Tübingen).

Newt ventricular cardiomyocytes were isolated using the following procedure. To prevent contaminations, animals were kept 24 hr in advance in a Sulfamerazine bath (5 g/l, Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA) for disinfection. Organ removal was performed under deep anesthesia, by incubating the animals in a Tricaine solution (1 g/l, Sigma) with pH 7.4 for 15–20 min. After decapitation, ventricles were removed, washed several times with 65% L15 Leibovitz media (Gibco, Grand Island, New York, USA) with antibiotics (2% penicillin/streptomycin and ciprofloxacin (10 µg/ml)) and incubated over night at 25°C. Thereafter, enzymatic digestion followed with a sterile mixture of collagenase (1 mg/ml, Sigma), elastase (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) and DNase (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma) with glucose (3 mg/ml, Sigma) and BSA (1.5 mg/ml, Sigma) in aPBS (75% PBS) for 6 hr at 27°C.

Mouse iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes (Axiogenesis AG, Cologne, Germany) were thawed and plated according to manufacturer's instructions. Mammalian cardiomyocytes were cultured on 1 mg/ml fibronectin (Sigma)-coated glass coverslips. Isolated cardiomyocytes were seeded and cultured in DMEM/F-12, Glutamax<sup>TM</sup>-I (Life Technologies, Darmstadt, Germany) + Penicillin (100 U/ml)/Streptomycin (100 µg/ml) (Pen/Step) (Life Technologies) for 2 days prior to experimentation. To analyze proliferative potential of whole cardiomyocyte populations, cardiomyocytes were cultured with 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma) for 2 days. To analyze proliferative potential between cardiomyocytes with paired and split centrioles, cardiomyocytes were cultured with 20% FBS + 2 mM hydroxyurea (HU) (Sigma), for 2 days. As centriole-cohesion is normally lost at G2/M, G1/S arrest with hydroxyurea prevents misinterpreting normal loss of centriole-cohesion (which occurs in G2) for precocious loss of centriole-cohesion (which occurs during G1). To analyze mitotic aberrations, neonatal cardiomyocytes were cultured with 10% FBS for 2 days, and adult cardiomyocytes were seeded in 10% horse serum and 20 µM cytosine β-D-arabinofuranoside (Sigma) for 2 days and then stimulated with 50 ng/ml FGF1 (R&amp;D Systems, Abingdon, UK) + p38i (5 µM SB203580, Tocris Biosystems, Bristol, UK) for 2 days as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Engel et al., 2005</xref>).

Subsequently, cells were washed with nocodazole-free media for 5–10 min to allow microtubule regrowth. To analyze microtubule regrowth in newt cardiomyocytes, cells were cultured for 5 days and then placed on ice for 3 hr. Subsequently, cells were returned to 25°C for 10 min. For siRNA studies cells were cultured for 2 days prior to transfection of siRNAs (Qiagen, Venlo, Limburg, Netherlands) using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX (Life Technologies). Cycling and MTOC regrowth assays utilizing siRNAs were conducted 2 days after siRNA transfection. Plasmids were transfected with Lipofectamine LTX (Life Technologies) on the day of seeding.

They further show that cardiomyocytes from fish and newt, which are known to maintain proliferative activity, maintain centrosome integrity, consistent with their model. The manuscript is well written, and the data are mostly convincing. Although the role of centrosome integrity in cell proliferation has been heavily studied, it has been always in the context of centrosome component mutants leading to a cell proliferation problem. In contrast, this manuscript provides a novel insight into how centrosome disassembly may be developmentally utilized to achieve cell cycle arrest. That conceptual distinction would be worth clarifying early in the manuscript.</p><p>1) All of the reviewers found the ideas in this manuscript conceptually interesting. The major concern is that all of the conclusions are based on correlations. Functional evidence is required to show that species-specific developmental changes in centrosome disassembly lead to differences in cardiomyocyte proliferation. The authors present data indicating that newt and zebrafish heart muscle cells contain centrosomes, whereas adult mouse heart cells do not. This result is exciting, as it could potentially explain how heart tissue can regenerate in newt and zebrafish. However, no further experiments are provided to test this hypothesis. It is not clear if centrosomes in adult newt and zebrafish cardiomyoctyes are indeed needed for regeneration. Nor is it clear if these centrosomes are even functional (i.e., do they nucleate MTs?). This is important to test, because tissue regeneration occurs in planarians even though they lack centrosomes. Furthermore, planarian regeneration proceeds normally even if centriole formation is abrogated via RNAi-mediated knockdown of SAS-4 (Azimzadeh, 2012, Science). Thus, the link between centrosome integrity and regenerative capacity requires more investigation. Does centrosome loss in cardiomyocytes eliminate the ability of adult newts or zebrafish to regenerate heart tissue?</p><p>2) In other systems, ciliogenesis is associated with G1/G0. Therefore, the lack of ciliogenesis in post-mitotic (supposedly G1/G0-arrested) cardiomyocytes requires further explanation/discussion. First, how firm are the data that support “G1/G0” arrest of cardiomyocytes? Is it possible that they are arrested in G2 phase of the cell cycle (thus do not form cilia)? Has anybody really examined the cell cycle status of post-mitotic cardiomyocytes? Ki67 is only a marker for “cycling cells” and does not tell in which cell cycle stage the cells are. Instead, true G1 markers such as Cip/Kip, Arf and DNA content (2N vs 4N) should be tested. Cardiomyocytes may represent a novel population of mammalian cells that enter quiescence and differentiate in G2 phase of the cell cycle (with 4C DNA content). This possibility is particularly plausible. Given the result shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> (p38i) are these cells in G2 with four centrioles (G2 cells have two centrosomes, each of which contains two centrioles)? Upon differentiation, those two centrioles would split as is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, yielding 4 spindle poles when forced to enter mitosis due to p38i.</p><p>3) The authors show that the splicing isoform of Pericentrin (B and S) might underlie centrosome disassembly during cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest. Two questions regarding this point: 1) does overexpression of Pericentrin B prevent cardiomyocytes from entering cell cycle arrest (possibly with a differentiation defect)? 2) Do fish and newts have the S isoform? Since most of the data in this paper are correlational, the sufficiency of the Pericentrin B form to inhibit cell cycle arrest should be shown. We understand that Pericentrin might not be the only regulator of centrosome integrity and the negative results would not necessarily be conclusive.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “Centrosome disassembly promotes a post-mitotic state in mammalian cardiomyocytes” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although the role of centrosome integrity in cell proliferation has been heavily studied, it has been always in the context of centrosome component mutants leading to a cell proliferation problem. In contrast, this manuscript provides a novel insight into how centrosome disassembly may be developmentally utilized to achieve cell cycle arrest. That conceptual distinction would be worth clarifying early in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Thank you very much for pointing out this issue. We have modified the Abstract and the Introduction to clarify this <italic>conceptual distinction</italic> early in the manuscript</p><p><italic>1) All of the reviewers found the ideas in this manuscript conceptually interesting. The major concern is that all of the conclusions are based on correlations. Functional evidence is required to show that species-specific developmental changes in centrosome disassembly lead to differences in cardiomyocyte proliferation. The authors present data indicating that newt and zebrafish heart muscle cells contain centrosomes, whereas adult mouse heart cells do not. This result is exciting, as it could potentially explain how heart tissue can regenerate in newt and zebrafish. However, no further experiments are provided to test this hypothesis. It is not clear if centrosomes in adult newt and zebrafish cardiomyoctyes are indeed needed for regeneration</italic>.</p><p>While we have not provided experimental evidence that zebrafish require a centrosome for cardiac regeneration, we would like to emphasize the following points:</p><p>A) Our data clearly demonstrate that centrosome integrity is lost in mammalian cardiomyocytes in contrast to zebrafish and newt (see also B) below). As described in the Introduction, mammalian cell types require a centrosome for cell cycle entry and thus also for cardiac regeneration based on cardiomyocyte proliferation. In this regard, we have shown that “siRNA-mediated knockdown of Pericentrin, or overexpression of a RFP-tagged dominant negative C-terminal Pericentrin construct (RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>), which disrupts endogenous Pericentrin localization at the centrosome, suppressed P0-isolated cardiomyocyte proliferative potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D-F</xref>).” Thus mammalian cardiomyocytes have to overcome a hurdle to enter the cell cycle that does not exist in zebrafish or newt cardiomyocytes.</p><p>B) The literature provides evidence that a functional centrosome is required for zebrafish development and cell cycle progression. For instance, plk4 depletion in zebrafish impairs centriolar biogenesis during development and increases premature cell cycle exit (independent of ciliogenesis defects) resulting in reduced zebrafish size (Martin et al., Nat Genetics, 2014). Other examples of centriole-associated genes whose depletion impairs zebrafish development exhibiting cell cycle defects resulting in reduced zebrafish size are “SCL/TAL1 interrupting locus (SIL or STIL)” (Pfaff et al., Mol Cell Biol 2007; Vulbrecht et al., J Cell Sci 2012; Sun et al., J Biol Chem, 2014) and “Centrin2” (Delaval et al., Cell Cycle, 2011). To clarify this issue we have modified the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition, we provide in collaboration with Gilbert Weidinger (Ulm) dnPCNT overexpression (RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>) data in zebrafish (delayed development and decresead mitosis index in RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup> RNA-injected embryos, reduced clonal size of RFP-Peri<sup>CT</sup>-positive cells in DNA-injected embryos) suggesting that also PCNT is required for cell proliferation in vivo. To clarify this issue we have modified the Results, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1C-F</xref>), Discussion and Methods sections accordingly.</p><p>C) The fact that vertebrate regeneration recapitulates development and that a centrosome is required for proliferation strongly suggests that cardiac regeneration in zebrafish (which occurs by cardiomyocyte proliferation) requires a functional centrosome. While we agree that there is currently no conclusive evidence for this, there is data that indirectly suggest that centrosome function might be required for cardiac regeneration in zebrafish. For example it has been shown that inhibition of Mps1 and plk1, factors implicated in centrosome assembly and maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pike and Fisk, 2011</xref>, Cell Div; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kong et al. 2014</xref>, J Cell Biol; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Joukov et al., 2014</xref>, Moll Cell), impair cardiac regeneration in zebrafish after apex resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poss et al., 2002</xref>, Science; Jopling et al., Nature, 2010). We have included this information in the revised manuscript in the Discussion section.</p><p>D) We agree that despite the developmental data it will be still interesting to determine the functional requirement of centrosomes in cardiac regeneration in zebrafish. Therefore, we work on establishing transgenic animals in which we can specifically induce in cardiomyocytes centrosome dysfunction. However, the generation of such a model alone takes at least 1 year. Thus, this is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Nor is it clear if these centrosomes are even functional (i.e., do they nucleate MTs?).</italic></p><p>To address this issue we have initiated collaborations with the groups of Steffen Just (Ulm) and Thomas Braun (MPIHL) to study centrosome function in adult primary zebrafish as well as newt cardiomyocytes. Our data based on immunofluorescence stainings and MTOC regrowth assays demonstrate that centrosomes in adult zebrafish as well as newt cardiomyocytes “nucleate MTs”. These results have been inserted in the Results section, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1A, B</xref>, and the Methods section was changed accordingly.</p><p><italic>This is important to test, because tissue regeneration occurs in planarians even though they lack centrosomes. Furthermore, planarian regeneration proceeds normally even if centriole formation is abrogated via RNAi-mediated knockdown of SAS-4 (Azimzadeh, 2012, Science). Thus, the link between centrosome integrity and regenerative capacity requires more investigation</italic>. <italic>Does centrosome loss in cardiomyocytes eliminate the ability of adult newts or zebrafish to regenerate heart tissue?</italic></p><p>The phenomenon that planarians can regenerate in the absence of centrosomes is interesting but due to significant evolutionary and functional differences in cell cycle control we believe planarians cannot be compared to zebrafish or mammals. For example, although the planarian genome contains all components of the Rb pathway, they have undergone gene loss from the ancestral state, similar to other species in their phylum. A single Rb homolog (Smed-Rb) controls stem cell maintenance, similar to the Rb-homologs p107 and p130 in vertebrates. The most severe reduction occurred in E2F genes with a single remaining repressive E2F, in contrast to several repressive and activating E2Fs in mammals and zebrafish (Zhu et al., 2013, Dev Biol). In addition, genome and transcriptome analyses have revealed that planarians do not have either Cyclin E or Cyclin A homologs and further, cyclin-dependent kinase CDK2 (to which Cyclin E/A usually binds) is expressed at such low levels in planarians it is considered functionally dead (Zhu, 2013, Developmental Biology). This is important, as in mammals centrosome localization of Cyclin E and Cyclin A is required for G1/S cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pascreau et al., 2011</xref>, Cell Cycle). Thus, at least in the case of Cyclin E and Cyclin A, planarians lack centrosome-regulated cell cycle factors. Thus, the fact that planaria do not need a centrosome might not necessarily indicate that it is not required for proliferation in cell types of other species. To clarify this issue we have modified the Discussion section.</p><p>In addition, we would like to point out that regeneration in planarians occurs by neoblast (stem-like cells) proliferation while we study a well differentiated cell type, cardiomyocytes. Thus, the cell biology of the cells involved in planarian regeneration compared to zebrafish and mammalian cardiac regeneration is vastly different.</p><p><italic>2) In other systems, ciliogenesis is associated with G1/G0.

In addition, to further substantiate that the cardiomyocytes used in our study are arrested in G1/G0, we have isolated P0/1 and P3 cardiomyocytes, cultured them for 3 days in the absence of mitogenic stimuli, as done with ciliogenesis assay, and then determined their cell cycle stage by FACS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-D</xref>, the vast majority of P0/1- and P3-isolated cardiomyocytes are in G0/G1-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A-D</xref>).</p><p>Therefore, the inability for postnatal cardiomyocytes to perform ciliogenesis is not due to being arrested at the G2 phase of the cell cycle.</p><p><italic>This possibility is particularly plausible.

Thus, these cells are not in G2 phase but in mitosis.</p><p><italic>3) The authors show that the splicing isoform of Pericentrin (B and S) might underlie centrosome disassembly during cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest. Two questions regarding this point: 1) does overexpression of Pericentrin B prevent cardiomyocytes from entering cell cycle arrest (possibly with a differentiation defect)?</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, due to technical issues it is not possible to answer this question:</p><p>1) The standard technique (and by far the most efficient) to ectopically express proteins in cardiomyocytes is the infection with adenoviruses. Unfortunately, the gene encoding Pericentrin B is too big to generate an adenovirus.</p><p>2) Transfection technologies like Lipofectamine are not efficient in cardiomyocytes. Electroporation provides an alternative but its efficiency decreases markedly with the construct size.</p><p>3) The only assay that came to our mind to test whether “overexpression of Pericentrin B prevent cardiomyocytes from entering cell cycle arrest” is to culture fetal cardiomyocytes in serum. However, it takes nearly a week before these cells exit the cell cycle and thus would require long-term overexpression.</p><p>Nevertheless, we performed Pericentrin B overexpression experiments. While transfection efficiencies is low, it still allowed us to evaluate cellular localization. Our data indicate that PCM1 is lost from the centrosome before Pericentrin B. As PCM1 is required for the recruitment of centrosome proteins such as Pericentrin B to the centrosome it is unlikely that Pericentrin B overexpression can prevent cardiomyocytes from entering cell cycle arrest. To verify this hypothesis we have overexpressed Pericentrin B in non-myocytes and cardiomyocytes and analyzed its localization. While Pericentrin B-GFP localized to the centrosomes of non-myocytes and most E15-cardiomyocytes, it failed to localize to centrioles in the majority of P0 and P3 cardiomyocytes. These observations are consistent with the absence of PCM1 at the centrosome post birth. We have added these data to the revised manuscript and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2A, B</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Do fish and newts have the S isoform?</italic></p><p>Unfortunately, there are no antibodies available for Pericentrin in zebrafish or newt. Thus, we cannot determine whether Pericentrin S is expressed on protein level. Also, the mRNA sequence encoding the Pericentrin S isoform is neither known for zebrafish nor newt. For the newt no sequence data are available for the Pericentrin gene. However, for zebrafish the full-length gene encoding Pericentrin is known.</p><p>To determine if zebrafish might express the Pericentrin S isoform we performed RT-PCR experiments. A particularity of mouse and rat Pericentrin S is the inclusion of a unique exon.
