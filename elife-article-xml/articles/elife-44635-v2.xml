We systematically determined the phosphorylation-site motifs for the entire Nek kinase family, except for Nek11. While all Nek kinases strongly select for hydrophobic residues in the −3 position, the family separates into four distinct groups based on specificity for a serine versus threonine phospho-acceptor, and preference for basic or acidic residues in other positions. Unlike Nek1-Nek9, Nek10 is a dual-specificity kinase that efficiently phosphorylates itself and peptide substrates on serine and tyrosine, and its activity is enhanced by tyrosine auto-phosphorylation. Nek10 dual-specificity depends on residues in the HRD+2 and APE-4 positions that are uncommon in either serine/threonine or tyrosine kinases. Finally, we show that the phosphorylation-site motifs for the mitotic kinases Nek6, Nek7 and Nek9 are essentially identical to that of their upstream activator Plk1, suggesting that Nek6/7/9 function as phospho-motif amplifiers of Plk1 signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>kinase biology</kwd><kwd>Nima-related kinase</kwd><kwd>Nek kinase

essential role in nearly all signaling events and physiological processes within the cell. Protein serine/threonine kinases, together with ubiquitin ligases, play a particularly important role in mitosis, during which thousands of sites are phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dephoure et al., 2008</xref>). These mitotic phosphorylation events are predominantly mediated by the kinases Cdk1, Plk1, Aurora A and Aurora B, together with several members of the NimA-related kinase (Nek) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joukov and De Nicolo, 2018</xref>). For Cdk1, Plk1 and the Aurora kinases, multiple substrates and detailed downstream signaling functions have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Joukov and De Nicolo, 2018</xref>), although much remains to be learned. In contrast, for the Nek family kinases only a few substrates have been identified, and many of their functions within the complex network of mitotic signaling are not well understood.</p><p>The Nek kinase family consists of 11 serine/threonine kinases that together form an independent evolutionary branch of the human kinome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The first human mitotic Nek kinase to be identified was Nek2, which is required for centrosomal disjunction following their duplication during S-phase, in order to assemble a bipolar mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry et al., 2017</xref>) A similar function was assigned to Nek5, which, in addition, also regulates centrosome composition in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prosser et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, Nek6, Nek7 and Nek9 have been shown to cooperate as a signaling module during various stages of mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belham et al., 2003</xref>). In this process, Nek9 is first phosphorylated in early mitosis by Cdk1, creating a binding site for the Plk1 polo-box domain. Plk1-mediated phosphorylation and activation of Nek9 then leads to Nek9-dependent phosphorylation and interaction-dependent activation of Nek6 and Nek7, allowing them to perform their downstream functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richards et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertran et al., 2011</xref>). As a signaling module, Nek6/7/9 have been reported to play a role in centrosome separation and maturation, nuclear envelope breakdown, metaphase and anaphase progression, mitotic spindle formation and cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roig et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yissachar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Regan and Fry, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Salem et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertran et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Laurell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sdelci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cullati et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, although Nek6 and Nek7 share more than 80% sequence homology in their kinase domain, their mitotic functions are not completely redundant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cullati et al., 2017</xref>). This is most likely due to their short but divergent N-terminal domains that drive differential interactions and might affect substrate selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Vaz Meirelles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Souza et al., 2014</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44635.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation-site motifs for the human NimA-related kinases.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Dendrogram showing the phylogenetic relationship between all human kinases.

This revealed a surprisingly large amount of diversity in substrate-specificity among the Nek-kinases, and identified Nek10 as a dual-specificity kinase, that can phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine in addition to serine. Furthermore, these studies demonstrated that the mitotic kinases Nek6, Nek7 and Nek9, have a phosphorylation-site motif that is almost identical to the motif of Plk1, suggesting that the Nek6/7/9 module functions as a Plk1-motif amplifier.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of the phosphorylation-site motif for all members of the Nek kinase family</title><p>To obtain the consensus phosphorylation-site motif for each individual Nek kinase, we performed Oriented Peptide Library Screening (OPLS) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hutti et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2011</xref>). In these experiments, each kinase is tested in 198 individual <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase reactions, each with a different peptide library as substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Each peptide library is composed of a pool of 10-mer peptides containing an equimolar mix of serine and threonine at the phospho-acceptor site, and one other fixed amino acid on a position ranging from five residues upstream (−5 position) to four residues downstream (+4 position) of the phospho-acceptor residue. The fixed amino acid is one of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids, or either phospho-threonine (pT) or phospho-tyrosine (pY). The remaining eight unfixed positions in the library contain an equimolar mix of all natural amino acids except cysteine, serine or threonine. The preference of the protein kinase for each residue at each position is then determined by directly comparing its activity against each individual peptide library. Lastly, to study phospho-acceptor site specificity of the kinase, we included three completely degenerate peptide libraries that contain either a fixed serine, threonine or tyrosine phospho-acceptor site, but no cysteine, serine, threonine or tyrosine in the degenerate positions.</p><p>Each of the Nek kinases were expressed as 3xFLAG-tagged variants in HEK 293T cells, isolated by anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation (IP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and assayed by OPLS. For Nek1, Nek3, Nek6, Nek7, Nek8, and Nek9 the full-length protein was used. For Nek4 and Nek5, the kinase activity of the full-length molecule was low, and OPLS experiments were therefore performed using the isolated kinase domains, which displayed more activity. For Nek11, neither the full-length construct nor the isolated kinase domain displayed sufficient activity for motif determination, but clear motif data was obtained for all the other Nek-kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; Figure 4A,B). To ensure that the phosphorylating activity assayed by OPLS directly corresponded to that of the FLAG-tagged Nek kinase of interest, inactivating point mutants of each Nek kinase were generated, expressed in HEK 293T cells, purified and assayed as above by OPLS. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, none of the kinase-dead (KD) point mutants showed any detectable phosphorylation of the peptide libraries, demonstrating that the signal obtained with the wild-type Nek kinases was generated by the purified Neks and not by a contaminating kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

However, the OPLS-experiments also demonstrated clear specificity differences between the different family-members. Most notably, our results revealed a dichotomy in phospho-acceptor site preference within the family, with Nek1/3/4/5/8 preferentially phosphorylating threonine residues, while Nek6/7/9 primarily targeted peptides with serine residues as the phospho-acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since the phosphorylation-site motif determined previously for Nek2 did not contain information on acceptor site specificity, an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay of isolated Nek2 with degenerate peptide libraries containing either a serine or threonine phospho-acceptor site was performed. Nek2 phosphorylated the serine phospho-acceptor library more efficiently than the threonine library, indicating that Nek2 shares a preference for a phospho-acceptor serine residue with Nek6/7/9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Together, these data reveal a Nek kinase family core consensus motif of [LMFW]-X-X-S/T-[no P], but with additional specificity-differences.

We hypothesized that this result could indicate that Nek10 is a tyrosine kinase. This could explain the effective phosphorylation of all peptide libraries containing a fixed tyrosine, because the tyrosine itself could serve as a phospho-acceptor site. In addition, it would explain the absence of additional preferences, because each of the 198 peptide libraries will contain tyrosine residues on non-fixed positions and therefore have many different target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Therefore, we reasoned that sequence comparison between the Nek kinases might reveal residues that permit Nek10 to phosphorylate both serine and tyrosine residues. Structural analysis has implicated specific regions of the kinase domain that contribute to serine/threonine or tyrosine specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 1995</xref>), and one of these regions is the P+1 loop, which lies directly N-terminal of the conserved APE-motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We therefore aligned the P+1 loop sequences of the Nek kinase family members, and noted that Nek10 has an isoleucine whereas all the other Nek kinases have a proline at the position four residues N-terminal of the APE-motif (APE-4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Interestingly, an isoleucine in the APE-4 is typically found in tyrosine kinases, but in less than 5% of serine/threonine kinase, which more commonly have a proline on this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). We therefore mutated the APE-4 isoleucine in Nek10 to a proline (I693P) and found that this increased its capacity to phosphorylate a substrate peptide on a serine residue but rendered Nek10 incapable of phosphorylating the same peptide on a tyrosine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>Another region contributing to phospho-acceptor site specificity is the catalytic loop, which contains the aspartic acid which serves as the catalytic base within the conserved HRD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 1995</xref>). Intriguingly, Nek10 has a threonine in the HRD+2 position, which is uncommon within the serine/threonine kinome. Instead, 86% of serine/threonine kinases contain a lysine residue in the HRD+2 position, including all the other Nek kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Mutation of the HRD+2 threonine to a lysine (T657K) generated a Nek10 variant that, like Nek10 I693P, could effectively phosphorylate serine residues but was incapable of phosphorylating tyrosine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Finally, we sought to make a variant version of Nek10 that would exclusively phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine residues. To this end, we mutated the threonine in the APE-5 position to a proline, which is highly conserved in tyrosine kinases, but present in only three serine/threonine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast to the I693P and T657K mutations, this APE-5 mutation (T692P) severely reduced overall Nek10 kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). However, the resulting Nek10 T692P variant could still detectably phosphorylate tyrosine residues while it was unable to phosphorylate serine residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). Taken together, these results identify specific residues in the kinase domain of Nek10 that are essential for its dual-specificity, and show that point-mutations in the catalytic or P+1 loop can toggle Nek10 between being a dual-specificity, serine-specific, or tyrosine-specific kinase.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>An APE-4 isoleucine in Nek1 enhances substrate phosphorylation on tyrosine residues</title><p>We next investigated whether introduction of an HRD+2 threonine and/or APE-4 isoleucine in a serine/threonine kinase would be sufficient to induce tyrosine-directed activity.

However, murine Nek1 has been reported to be a dual-specificity kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Letwin et al., 1992</xref>), suggesting that Nek1 might have intrinsic tyrosine-phosphorylation capacity in specific contexts, and might therefore be more susceptible than other serine/threonine kinases to mutations that broaden phospho-acceptor specificity.</p><p>Mutants of Nek1 containing a threonine in the HRD+2 position (Nek1 HRD+2), isoleucine on the APE-4 position (Nek1 APE-4), or both (Nek1 Double Mutant; DM), were generated and the recombinant kinases were tested for their capacity to phosphorylate peptide substrates containing either a threonine or tyrosine phospho-acceptor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Notably, either point mutation reduced kinase activity ~ 6-fold to 8-fold compared to Nek1 WT, while the combination of mutations almost completely abrogated Nek1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). To facilitate comparison of threonine and tyrosine-directed activity for all the Nek1 variants, these experiments were therefore repeated using a 6-fold reduced concentration of Nek1 WT compared to the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C,D</xref> Nek1 WT and both mutants phosphorylated peptides on threonine residues better than on tyrosine residues (note the differences in the Y-axis scale), Nonetheless, the APE-4 isoleucine mutant, but not the HRD+2 threonine mutant, enhanced the relative preference of Nek1 for tyrosine substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E</xref>) to ~ 20% of the efficiency with which it phosphorylated threonine-containing peptides.

We reasoned that the phosphorylation-site sequence context might play a major role, and therefore set out to determine whether Nek10 recognizes distinct phosphorylation-site motifs for serine and tyrosine substrates. In these experiments we used a serine-specific variant of Nek10 (I693P) to eliminate issues arising from tyrosine-phosphorylation of peptide libraries by WT Nek10 that made the previous OPLS-results uninterpretable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, for Nek10 I693P the strong preference for tyrosine in every position was absent, but instead it displayed a clear preference for hydrophobic and basic residues, similar to the Nek1/3/4/5/8 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). However, in contrast to other members of this group that preferentially select for threonine as the phospho-acceptor, Nek10 I693P preferentially phosphorylates serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To eliminate the possibility that the I693P mutation affected the intrinsic serine-motif specificity of Nek10, we validated these OPLS-results with WT Nek10, rather than with the Nek10 I693P mutant. An optimal serine peptide substrate ((S)-tide) was synthesized on basis of the OPLS-results, along with variants in which the favored hydrophobic residue in the −3 position and the favored basic residue in the −1 positions were replaced by a disfavored aspartic acid residue (−3D, −1D), and these peptides were used as substrates in an in vitro kinase assays. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, WT Nek10 could effectively phosphorylate (S)-tide but not the −3D and −1D peptides, therefore corroborating our OPLS-results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44635.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation-site motifs for Nek10 on tyrosine and serine target sites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The phosphorylation-site motif of Nek10 I693P was determined by OPLS.

These OPLS experiments revealed a very different Nek10 phosphorylation-site motif for tyrosine substrates compared to serine substrates. On tyrosine substrates, Nek10 does not select for the canonical Nek-family motif signature [LMFW]-X-X-S/T-[no P], but instead shows a near-absolute requirement for aromatic or selected hydrophobic residues in the +1 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Tyrosine phosphorylation was assessed by anti-FLAG IP followed by immunoblotting with an antibody recognizing phospho-tyrosine. Clear tyrosine phosphorylation was observed of WT Nek10, but not of a KD or serine-specific variant, consistent with Nek10 auto-phosphorylation on tyrosine residues in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In contrast to what we found <italic>in vitro</italic>, however, we could not detect any tyrosine phosphorylation on tyrosine-specific Nek10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), likely due to a combination of the very low activity of this Nek10 variant, and the higher threshold required for antibody detection compared to <sup>32</sup>[P]-radiolabeling.</p><p>To map the tyrosine(s) targeted for auto-phosphorylation by Nek10, we used the OPLS phosphorylation-site motif to select seven candidate Nek10 target sites, and mutated each of these sites to a phenylalanine. WT and mutant kinases containing 3xFLAG-tags were expressed in wild-type, non-edited U-2 OS cells, followed by anti-FLAG IP and immunoblotting for phospho-tyrosine. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, tyrosine-phosphorylation was detected on each of the mutants, but the signal was substantially reduced upon mutation of Y644 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). A possible interpretation of these results is that Y644 is a major auto-phosphorylation target site of Nek10. To test this hypothesis, we performed an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay using an active tyrosine-specific form of Nek10 to phosphorylate <italic>in trans</italic> either a KD Nek10 Y644 control, or a KD Nek10 containing the Y644F mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This experiment confirmed that <italic>in vitro</italic>, Nek10 directly auto-phosphorylates Y644 <italic>in trans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, the Y644F mutation dramatically reduced the activity of Nek10 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay with a serine peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), and a similar result was obtained with a tyrosine peptide substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These results strongly indicate that Nek10 auto-phosphorylation on Y644 contributes to its activity.</p><p>Finally, to study serine auto-phosphorylation in cells, we isolated WT, KD, serine-specific and tyrosine-specific Nek10 from the doxycycline-induced Nek10 knock-out cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and analyzed its phosphorylation status by mass spectrometry. Multiple phosphopeptides were detected, but the region corresponding to N346-R365 of Nek10, which is outside of the kinase domain, was the most abundant phosphopeptide in the WT and serine-specific samples, and was completely absent in the KD and tyrosine-specific samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). This peptide contains six serine residues, of which four were identified as phosphorylated by MASCOT protein identification software (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Mutation of these four serine sites in KD Nek10 reduced its phosphorylation <italic>in trans</italic> by a serine-specific Nek10 variant, demonstrating that one or more of these sites can be auto-phosphorylated <italic>in trans</italic> by Nek10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). To determine which of these four sites was the most likely target site, we manually annotated the MS/MS spectra, and identified S358 of Nek10 as the phosphosite most consistent with the mass spectrometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, we conclude from these results that Nek10 can auto-phosphorylate both <italic>in vitro</italic> and in cells, that <italic>in vitro</italic> auto-phosphorylation can occur <italic>in trans</italic>, and we identified Y644 in the kinase domain, and S358 outside of the kinase domain, as auto-phosphorylation target sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>The Nek kinase family diverges into four specificity-groups</title><p>The OPLS results indicated that there are substantial differences in specificity among the Nek kinase family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To examine this in more detail, we performed hierarchical clustering of the Nek kinome based on quantitative OPLS motif information. To also include Nek10 in this analysis, we used the serine phosphorylation-site OPLS motif (Nek10(S)), because the tyrosine phosphorylation-site motif is very distinct from the motifs of the other Nek kinases. This clustering revealed that Nek1/3/4/5/8 were clearly separated from Nek2/6/7/9/10(S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Importantly, this division of the Nek kinases based on preferred substrate sequence cannot be explained by amino acid sequence similarity between the Nek kinase domains themselves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Instead, an important contributor to this hierarchy is the preference for either serine or threonine as the phospho-acceptor site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). To assess non-phosphosite contributions, we re-clustered the Nek kinase family based on motif specificity, but excluded the phospho-acceptor site preference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This revealed that within the group of threonine-directed Nek kinases, Nek 1/3/4 cluster separately from Nek 5/8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Overall then, the motif data indicate that the Nek kinase family can be separated into four specificity groups based on phospho-acceptor preference and additional amino acids specificities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Interpretation of the sequence logos shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> indicates that Nek 1, 3 and 4 cluster in Group 1 based on their shared preference for arginine in the −1 position. Within Group 1, Nek 1 and 4 also show strong selectivity for lysine and arginine in the +2 position, and they are exceptional in their lack of preference for a tryptophan in the −3 position. Group 2 consists of Nek 5 and 8, and is closely related to Group 1, but has a less prominent selection for arginine in the −1 position. Group 3, which consists of Nek 2 and 10, are distinguished by their serine phospho-acceptor specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), although the remaining motif specificity of Nek two is similar to that of kinases in Group 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Finally, Group 4 consists of Nek 6, 7, and 9, and clusters distantly from the rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) based on a preference for acidic residues in the −5,–4, and particularly in the −2 position that is not shared with any of the other Nek kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44635.016</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>The Nek family diverges into four specificity-groups.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Similarity matrix and dendrogram depicting the Pearson correlation between the phosphorylation-site motifs of the Nek kinase family members.

To further investigate the relevance of these motif differences between Group 4 and the other Nek kinases in substrate phosphorylation, we then performed <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays using Nek3 and Nek7 with either a good peptide-substrate for Groups 1 and 2 (13458-tide), or a good peptide-substrate for Group 4 (679-tide).

To address this possibility, we analyzed the candidate Plk1 substrates at the mitotic spindle that were obtained in a phosphoproteomic study, during which either a small molecule inhibitor or an shRNA was used to block Plk1 function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Santamaria et al., 2011</xref>). <italic>Scansite</italic> scoring of these substrates showed a strong correlation between the Nek7-scores and Plk1-scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Using a cut-off for the top 25% of best-scoring sites, we identified 109 distinct sites on 77 different proteins as potential targets of both Plk1 and Nek7. This included S453 on Cdc27, and S170 on RacGAP1, both of which have been established as direct Plk1 substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burkard et al., 2009</xref>). To test whether Nek7 could also directly phosphorylate these substrates, we generated WT Cdc27 and S434A/S435A double mutant proteins using <italic>in vitro</italic> transcription/translation (IVTT), and incubated them with isolated Plk1 or Nek7 in an <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay. As previously reported, Cdc27 was readily phosphorylated by WT but not KD Plk1, and this phosphorylation was reduced by mutation of the S434/S435 target site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, upper panels; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraft et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, the same assay performed with Nek7 instead of Plk1 demonstrated that Nek7 could also phosphorylate Cdc27 on the same site as Plk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, lower panels). A second <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assay using RacGAP1 confirmed that this substrate is also directly phosphorylated by both Plk1 and Nek7, although phosphorylation was not reduced by mutation of S170, indicating that both kinases appear to target sites other than or in addition to S170 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). Together, these experiments indicate that Plk1 and Nek6/7/9 share a strikingly similar phosphorylation-site motif, have substantial overlap in potential substrates in the phosphoproteome, and are capable of phosphorylating the same protein substrates on the same target sites <italic>in vitro</italic>.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>While it is widely appreciated that the Nek kinases function in various stages of mitosis, and also play roles in essential non-mitotic processes including cilia formation and the DNA damage response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moniz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fry et al., 2017</xref>), only a limited number of direct substrates of these kinases have been identified to date. To facilitate future substrate identification, we systematically determined the phosphorylation-site motif for each kinase in the family, with the exception of Nek11, using OPLS. This analysis revealed that all Nek kinases share a common preference for selected hydrophobic residues in the −3 position, but differ substantially in their preference for specific amino acids at other positions within the motif, including their preference for either a threonine (Nek1/3/4/5/8) or serine (Nek2/6/7/9) as the phospho-acceptor residue. A strong determinant of phospho-acceptor site specificity is the residue in the activation loop of the kinase at the DFG+1 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), and the observed dichotomy of serine versus threonine phospho-acceptor preference within the Nek family can be explained by the presence of a leucine versus isoleucine/serine in this position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the phosphorylation-site motifs indicate that the Nek family can be divided in four specificity-groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>). To date, all kinases in specificity Groups 3 (Nek2/10) and 4 (Nek6/7/9) have been implicated in one or more mitotic processes, with the exception of Nek10. The exact function of Nek10 is not known, but it has previously been reported to play a role in the response to UV-stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moniz et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore tempting to speculate that the Nek kinase specificity clustering might reflect functional divergence between mitotic and non-mitotic Nek kinases.</p><p>In addition to the four specificity-groups, we identified amino acid selection preferences that are unique to individual Nek kinases. For example, Nek6 and Nek7 showed a clear preference for substrate peptides that are already phosphorylated on tyrosine on the −1 position, suggesting cross-talk between tyrosine and serine/threonine kinases during mitosis. It is becoming increasingly clear that tyrosine phosphorylation events do, in fact, play a role in mitotic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caron et al., 2016</xref>), and multiple tyrosine kinases have been shown to prefer an acidic residue in the −1 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller and Turk, 2018</xref>), which would generate good target sites for Nek6/7 (<italic>i.e.</italic> a DE-pY-S motif).</p><p>In general, good substrates for a kinase usually contain phosphorylation site sequences that closely match the optimal sequence motif for the kinase, although additional factors including secondary docking sites, surface accessibility, and substrate protein conformation also play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Linding et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller and Turk, 2018</xref>). It is therefore expected that the phosphorylation sites on Nek kinase substrates should be enriched for the amino acids preferred by the upstream Nek kinase. However, to date, too few substrates have been definitively and reproducibly characterized for most of the individual Nek kinases to allow quantitative comparison of those sites with the optimal motifs. The maximal number of substrates reported for any Nek kinase is eleven (for Nek6), with less than five substrates known for all other Nek kinases except for Nek2. There are no published substrates for Nek 4, 5, 8, and 10. Nonetheless, a global analysis of all previously reported Nek kinase target sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) reveals an overrepresentation of leucine and phenylalanine in the −3 position, consistent with the motif reported here. Of the eleven published Nek6 substrates, three contain an asparagine on the −2 position, which we identified as a specificity unique to Group 4 Nek kinases, and four others have a glycine, which is also positively selected for by Nek6. However, not all reported phosphorylation sites on Nek kinase substrates match the optimal Nek kinase motifs, and some even contain strongly disfavored residues such as a proline in the + 1 position (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This could indicate that such a target site is not directly phosphorylated by a Nek kinase, even though its phosphorylation status was affected by manipulation of Nek kinase activity. However, it is important to emphasize that substrate phosphorylation by a kinase does not require a perfect match between the target site and the optimal motif. Rather, the better the site matches the optimal motif, the more efficiently it is phosphorylated by the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Obenauer et al., 2003</xref>), as we also demonstrate here in our peptide phosphorylation studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-F</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, our assays revealed that Nek10 is a dual-specificity kinase, and thus joins a small group of human serine/threonine kinases with reported dual-specificity. These are the GSK-3 kinases, the DYRK-kinases, the kinases of the MAP2K-family, TTK, CK2, Myt1 and the TESK-kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gómez and Cohen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kentrup et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wilson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toshima et al., 1999</xref>). GSK-3 and the DYRK kinases only phosphorylate tyrosine residues when auto-phosphorylating during folding <italic>in cis</italic>, although it was recently reported that the folded, mature DYRK1A retains a weak tyrosine auto-phosphorylation capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cole et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lochhead et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Soundararajan et al., 2013</xref>). TTK and CK2 have weak tyrosine phosphorylation activity compared to their serine phosphorylation activity, and Myt1 and the kinases of the MAP2K family only phosphorylate on tyrosine and threonine in the very distinct context of a TY-site on Cdk1 and a TxY-site on MAP kinases, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gómez and Cohen, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lindberg et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liu et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marin et al., 1999</xref>). The TESK-kinases are therefore an exception within the group of dual-specificity kinases, because they can efficiently phosphorylate multiple protein substrates <italic>in trans</italic> on both tyrosine and serine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Toshima et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that Nek10’s dual-specificity is most like that of the TESK-kinases, because Nek10 phosphorylates tyrosine residues as efficiently as serine residue on substrates <italic>in trans</italic>. Serine/threonine kinases are structurally different than tyrosine kinases, primarily in the catalytic loop and the P+1 loop of the kinase domain. These regions make extensive contact with the substrate, including with the phospho-acceptor site, and structural differences within these loops dictate whether kinases exclusively phosphorylate either serine/threonine or tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Taylor et al., 1995</xref>). We show here that an isoleucine in the APE-4 position, and a threonine in the HRD+2 position, makes the P+1 loop and catalytic loop of Nek10 unlike those typically found in either tyrosine kinases or serine/threonine kinases, and these unique residues give Nek10 the capacity to phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine in addition to serine. Serine/threonine kinases have a conserved lysine on the HRD+2 position in the catalytic loop, which makes contact with the P+1 loop and the substrate backbone, and therefore helps positioning the substrate for phosphorylation. The HRD+2 threonine, rather than lysine, in Nek10 is essential for its ability to phosphorylate substrates on tyrosine, and within the dual-specificity kinome this residue is only shared with the TESK kinases. This could potentially explain why of all dual-specificity kinases, Nek10 and the TESK kinases appear to have the broadest tyrosine phosphorylation capacity. Although our experiments with a Nek1 HRD+2 mutant suggest that an HRD+2 threonine is not sufficient for dual-specificity in all sequence contexts, it would be interesting to study the phospho-acceptor site specificity of the serine/threonine kinases BubR1, Plk4, PRPK and MISR2, which also have a serine or threonine residue in the HRD+2 position.</p><p>Additionally, the sequence surrounding the phosphorylation site also affects substrate positioning, and can therefore affect phospho-acceptor site specificity. As an example of this interdependence, we have previously noted that the preference of the kinases ATM/ATR for phosphorylating serine-glutamine versus threonine-glutamine motifs appears to depend on the residues found at other positions in the motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joughin et al., 2012</xref>). A similar observation of interdependence between phospho-acceptor residue identity and specific amino acids in other positions within the motif has been shown for the dual-specificity kinase CK2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marin et al., 1999</xref>). Marin et al. observed that tyrosine phosphorylation of a yeast substrate of CK2 depended on specific residues in the −1 and +1 positions. However, phosphorylation of the same substrate with the tyrosine replaced by a serine residue was considerably less influenced by substitutions of the amino acids in the −1 and +1 positions and instead depended on the residue identity in the +3 position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marin et al., 1999</xref>). Here, we identified distinct phosphorylation-site motifs for Nek10 on tyrosine and on serine/threonine substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This indicated that the ability of Nek10 to phosphorylate peptides on tyrosine was strongly dependent on the presence of an aromatic residue or a leucine in the +1 position of the substrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but Nek10 was much more tolerant of other amino acids in this position when phosphorylating substrates on serine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Potentially, a bulky +1 residue orients the substrate within the catalytic cleft in a manner that generates space for the large tyrosine phospho-acceptor site.</p><p>Finally, our study showed that Nek6/7/9 share a common phosphorylation motif with Plk1. Plk1 interacts with Nek9 and functions as the upstream activating kinase in a linear mitotic signaling pathway with Nek6, 7, and 9, raising the possibility that the common phosphorylation motif we observed arises from cross-contamination in the isolated kinase preparations. However, the fact that our Plk1 motif was determined using the recombinant kinase domain of Plk1 expressed in bacteria, and that catalytically dead versions of each of these Nek kinases displayed no phosphorylation activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) argues against this interpretation. Instead, it may be that these mitotic kinases function together to form a coherent feed-forward loop analogous in some ways to the coherent type 1-feed forward loop with OR gate function described by Uri Alon for transcription factor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alon, 2007</xref>). Such a signaling network of kinases sharing a highly related phosphorylation-site motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>) might allow persistence of this phospho-motif for a period of time after Plk1 inactivation, or could help spread this specific phospho-motif beyond direct Plk1 substrates by acting as a ‘phospho-motif amplifier’. Clearly, many future experiments investigating the spatial and temporal phosphorylation of <italic>in vivo</italic> substrates by kinases within this network will be required to distinguish between these and other possibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK 293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# CRL-3216, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>U-2 OS</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# HTB-96, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0042">CVCL_0042</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>U-2 OS Nek10 KO</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Nek10 gene was edited by CRISPR technique, selected clone</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>U-2 OS Nek10KO + ind Nek10</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Dox-inducible Nek10 was introduced in the Nek10 KO clone</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-FLAG M2</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F1804, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_262044">AB_262044</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-FLAG</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# F7425, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_439687">AB_439687</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rat monoclonal anti-HA 3F10</td><td>Roche</td><td>Roche Cat# ROAHAHA, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2687407">AB_2687407</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:500</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-B-Actin</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A2228, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476697">AB_476697</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-B-Actin</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 4967, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_330288">AB_330288</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal anti-phosphotyrosine</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology</td><td>Cell Signaling Technology Cat# 8954, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2687925">AB_2687925</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal anti-Plk1</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology Cat# sc-5585, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2167406">AB_2167406</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal anti-Plk1</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>Santa Cruz <break/>Biotechnology Cat# sc-17783, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_628157">AB_628157</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:100</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal -anti-Mouse 800/680</td><td>LI-COR Biosciences</td><td>LI-COR Biosciences Cat# 926–32210, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_621842">AB_621842</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal-anti-Rabbit 800/680</td><td>LI-COR Biosciences</td><td>LI-COR Biosciences Cat# 926–32211, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_621843">AB_621843</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal-anti-Rat 800</td><td>LI-COR Biosciences</td><td>LI-COR Biosciences Cat# 926–32219, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1850025">AB_1850025</ext-link></td><td>WB 1:10,000</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-FLAG M2 affiinity gel</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich Cat# A2220, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10063035">AB_10063035</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HA affinity matrix</td><td>Roche</td><td>Roche Cat# 11815016001, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390914">AB_390914</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>V1900-Nek3-3xFLAG (idem for Nek4-Nek9)</td><td>This paper</td><td/><td>Gateway cloned from ORFeome into V1900 (pCMV-Sp6 with C-term.

were obtained from the CCSB-Broad Human Kinase ORF collection. Using gateway cloning technology, Nek3-Nek9 were cloned into V1900 (a kind gift from Karen Colwill/Tony Pawson, The Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute, Toronto, ON, Canada) a gateway destination vector derived from pCMV-Sp6 with a C-terminal 3xFLAG epitope tag (DYKDHDGDYKDHDIDYKDDDDK). All other cloning was done by restriction ligation, Quick-Fusion cloning (Biotool.com) or Gibson assembly using the NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly Cloning Kit (New England Biolabs). Nek1 was PCR amplified from the ORFeome entry vector, and cloned into pcDNA3 that was re-engineered to contain a C-terminal 3xFLAG tag (pcDNA3-MCS-3xFLAG). The Nek4 kinase domain (aa: 1–300) was PCR amplified from the V1900-Nek4 plasmid, and cloned into pcDNA3-MCS-3xFLAG. The Nek5 kinase domain (aa: 2–300) was PCR amplified from the V1900-Nek5 plasmid, and cloned into pcDNA3, which was reengineered with an N-terminal MBP (maltose-binding-protein)−3xFLAG epitope tag. The Nek2 kinase domain (aa: 1–271) was PCR amplified from copy-DNA generated from U-2 OS mRNA, and cloned into pcDNA3, which was reengineered with a C-terminal 3xFLAG-TEV-2xStreptagII-6xHIS epitope tag. (TEV: Tobacco Etch Virus cleavage site (ENLYFQG), StreptagII: WSHPQFEK). The construct pCMV-3xFLAG-Nek10 has been described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Moniz et al., 2011</xref>). A small missing region in the Nek10 cDNA (bp: 2869–3012) was repaired by PCR, and the cDNA including N-terminal 3xFLAG-tag was subcloned into pcDNA3, or the cDNA without 3xFLAG-tag was subcloned into pcDNA3-2xHA-Strep, which is a pcDNA3-variant that was reengineered for epitope-tagging with an N-terminal 2xHA-StreptagII epitope tag (HA: YPYDVPDYA). The Plk1 kinase domain (aa: 38–346) was PCR amplified from plasmids previously described and cloned into pET-RSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elia et al., 2003</xref>). Cdc27 and RacGAP1 cDNA was PCR amplified from copy-DNA, and cloned into pcDNA3-2xHA-Strep. All mutants of the Neks, and Cdc27 and RacGAP1 mutants, were generated by PCR-mediated mutagenesis. All kinase-dead variants were made by mutation of the aspartic acid in the conserved HR<underline>D</underline> motif into an asparagine, and in case of Nek4, an additional aspartic acid to asparagine mutation was made in the conserved <underline>D</underline>FG-motif (DLG in case of Nek4). In order to make the Nek10 KO cell-line, a Nek10-targeting sgRNA (sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">GTCTGAGCCCGCCATCAGGG</named-content>) was cloned into lentiGuide-Puro (addgene #52963), and Cas9 was subcloned from pCW-Cas9 (addgene #50661) into pLVX-Cas9-ZsGreen. In addition, a Cas9-targeting sgRNA (sequence: <named-content content-type="sequence">CTTGTACTCGTCGGTGATCA</named-content>) was cloned into lentiguide-puro. The inducible Nek10 construct was generated by replacing Cas9 in pCW-Cas9 with 3xFLAG-Nek10-T2A-eGFP. Silent mutations were introduced in the PAM-sequence of the Nek10 sgRNA target site, and the puromycin cassette in pCW was replaced with a blastidicin resistance cassette.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p>All Nek kinases, unless indicated otherwise below, were purified from transiently transfected HEK 293T cells. In short, 7 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK 293T cells were plated in 15 cm plates, and the next day transfected with 20–25 µg kinase-DNA using polyethyleneimine (PEI). After O/N incubation, transfection medium was replaced with fresh medium, and another 24 hr later cells were washed with PBS and harvested by scraping in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton-X100, 1 mM DTT) supplemented with protease inhibitors (complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche). Lysates were incubated on ice for 20 min, and cleared by centrifugation. Next, anti-FLAG M2-affinity gel (Sigma) was added to the cleared lysate, followed by incubation for 2 hr at 4°C while rotating. After incubation, the beads were pelleted by centrifugation, washed twice with lysis buffer and washed twice again with wash buffer (50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.01% NP-40, 10% glycerol). Protein was eluted from the beads by incubation for 1 hr at RT (while rotating) with 150–250 µl wash buffer supplemented with phosphatase inhibitors (PhosSTOP, Roche) and 0.5 mg/ml 3xFLAG peptide (APExBIO). To determine concentration and purity, a BSA standard curve and a sample of the eluate were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Coomassie-staining (SimplyBlue Safe stain, Life Technologies). Eluted kinase was either used directly, or snap-frozen and stored at −80°C. The 2xHA-Streptag-Nek10 KD (HA-tagged Nek10 KD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) was isolated essentially exactly as described above. However, Strep-Tactin XT superflow (IBA lifesciences) was used instead of anti-FLAG affinity gel, the composition of the wash buffer was different (100 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCL, 1 mM EDTA) and the kinase was eluted in 1x Biotin elution buffer BXT (IBA lifesciences). Plk1 was isolated from bacteria. A BL21 Rosetta two strain was transformed and induced to express the 6xHIS-MBP-TEV-tagged Plk1 kinase domain. The bacteria were lysed, followed by incubation with an Amylose resin (New England Biolabs)) and elution with maltose. In case of constitutively active T210D Plk1, a second purification step on a nickel-column (Ni Sepharose 6 Fast Flow, GE Healthcare) was performed, followed by imidazole-elution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Oriented Peptide Library Screen</title><p>Oriented Peptide Library Screens were performed as described in Hutti <italic>et al.</italic>, but with a slightly adapted protocol so that the assay could be done in 1536-well plates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hutti et al., 2004</xref>). The serine/threonine peptide library (Kinase Substrates Library, Group I and Group II, Anaspec) consists of 198 peptide pools with the sequence Y-A-Z-X-X-X-X-S/T-X-X-X-X-A-G-K-K-(LC-Biotin)-NH2, were X = mixture of all natural amino acids except Cys, Ser and Thr, S/T = equal mixture of Ser and Thr, and LC-Biotin = long chain biotin. In each peptide pool, the Z is fixed to be a single amino acid, which can be any of the 20 natural amino acids or phospho-Thr or phospho-Tyr. In the example, the Z is positioned on the P-5 relative to the S/T, but in the complete library the Z would be fixed in a position ranging from −5 to +4 relative to the S/T. Hence, there are nine different positions and 22 different amino acids, generating 198 different peptide pools. In addition, the library contains three peptide pools that are completely degenerate with the exception of a fixed Ser, Thr or Tyr as phospho-acceptor site for use in determining the 0 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The tyrosine-peptide library (custom order, JPT) consisted of peptide pools with the sequence G-A-Z-X-X-X-X-Y-X-X-X-X-A-G-K-K-(LC-Biotin)-NH2, and in this library Cys, Ser, Thr and Tyr were absent from the amino acid mixtures on the X positions. All peptides were dissolved in DMSO to 7.5 mM for the Ser/Thr library, and 5 mM for the Tyr-library. The peptides were arrayed in a 1536-well plate by multi-channel pipetting, and diluted to 500 µM with water.</p><p>For the kinase assay, 2.2 µl kinase buffer per well was dispensed in 1536-well plates using a Mantis nanodispenser robot (Formulatrix). The core kinase buffer consisted of 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 0.1 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, 50 µM ATP, 1 mM PKA-inhibitor (Sigma) and 0.1% Tween-20, and was supplemented with 10 mM MgCl2 and 2 mM MnCl2 for Nek1/2/3/4/6/7/9, 10 mM MnCl2 for Nek5/8, and 10 mM MgCl1 and 10 mM MnCl2 for Nek10. Next, 250 nl peptide was transferred from the peptide-stock plate to the kinase assay plate using a pintool with slot tips (V and P Scientific, Pin type FP3S200). Subsequently, 200 nl of a mix of kinase and [γ-<sup>33</sup>P)-ATP was added using the Mantis, with a final concentration in each well ranging from 5 to 50 nM of the kinase and 0.027 μCi/μl for the [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP. Between every step, the 1536-well plate was centrifuged briefly to collect all liquid, and cooled on ice as needed to prevent evaporation. After addition of the kinase, the plate was incubated at 30°C for 2 hr. Subsequently, 250 nl of each reaction was spotted on streptavidin-membrane (Promega) using the pintool, the membrane was washed and dried, exposed to a phosphorimaging screen, and imaged on a Typhoon 9400 imager (GE Healthcare).</p><p>Spot intensities were quantified using ImageStudio (Li-COR BioSciences), and normalized by dividing the measured intensity for an individual spot by the average spot intensity for all amino acids in that position. For each kinase, OPLS-experiments were done at least twice, and normalized values were averaged for all replicates. In case of a fixed serine or threonine on the Z-position, the fixed residue presents a second acceptor site in addition to the 0-position S/T, and spot intensities are therefore high at those positions, which does not necessarily reflect real sequence preferences. To correct for this, normalized intensities for fixed S or T were changed to one in case of intensity &gt;1. For Nek10 on the Tyr-library, the same was done but for intensities measured for fixed-Tyr peptides. The exception was the +1 Tyr, because we reasoned the normalized intensity &gt;1 most likely reflected a true preference, considering its strong preference for aromatic amino acids. Next, normalized values were log2-transformed. These values were used to generate heatmaps using Morpheus (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/">https://software.broadinstitute.org/morpheus/)</ext-link>. These values were transformed to sequence logos with Seq2Logo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thomsen and Nielsen, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title><italic>In vitro</italic> kinase assays</title><p>For <italic>in vitro</italic> kinase assays with a peptide-substrate, 5–50 nM of kinase was pre-incubated at 30°C for 30 min in the same kinase buffer as used for OPLS, but without the 0.1% Tween-20. Subsequently, [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP (or in some cases [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP) was added to a final concentration of 0.075–1 μCi/μl, and peptide added to a final concentration of 50 μM. Peptides were synthesized in-house at the 5 μmol starting resin scale per 96-well plate well, using an MultiPep small scale peptide synthesizer (Intavis) and standard FMOC chemistry. In addition to the peptide-specific 10-mer sequences indicated in the figure panels, each peptide had an N-terminal Y-A (or W-A for peptides of Nek10) sequence to allow concentration determination of peptide-solutions by UV-spectrophotometry. Also, each peptide had a C-terminal G-K-K-K sequence to increase solubility and interaction with phosphocellulose. After adding substrate and [γ-<sup>33</sup>P]-ATP, the mixture was incubated at 30°C for 20 min, and every 5 min a sample was spotted on p81 phosphocellulose papers (Reaction Biology Corp.), with the exception of some of the repeats with the Nek10 T693P variant, that were incubated for 1 hr or 2 hr, with spotting every 20 min or 30 min respectively. After spotting, the phosphocellulose papers were immediately soaked in 0.5% phosphoric acid. At the end of the assay, all papers were washed three times in 0.5% phosphoric acid, air-dried, transferred to vials with scintillation counter fluid and counted by a LS 6500 scintillation counter (Beckman Coulter). The resulting data points were analyzed by linear regression, and the phosphorylation rate was defined as the slope of the linear regression curve.</p><p>To study Nek10 auto-phosphorylation, 250 ng kinase was incubated in OPLS-kinase buffer with 1 μCi/μl [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP for 30 min at 30°C. The reaction was stopped by adding 6x sample buffer (SB) for SDS-PAGE (208 mM Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 42% glycerol, 3 mM beta-mercapto-ethanol, 10% SDS, 5 mg/ml bromophenol blue) and boiling for 5 min at 95°C. The sample was split, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Coomassie staining to asses total Nek10 levels, or analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging to analyze protein phosphorylation.</p><p>To study Nek10 auto-phosphorylation <italic>in trans</italic>, 250 ng of FLAG-tagged kinase-proficient Nek10 was mixed with 250 ng of HA-tagged kinase-deficient Nek10 and 0.06 μCi/μl [γ-<sup>32</sup>P]-ATP in kinase buffer. The mixture was incubated at 30°C for 15 min to 2 hr, depending on the assay, and the reaction was stopped by adding lysis buffer supplemented with EDTA to a final concentration of 20 mM. The sample was split in half and incubated for 1 hr at RT (while rotating) with either anti-FLAG M2 affinity gel (Sigma) or anti-HA affinity matrix (mAb 3F10; Roche). The beads were washed once with lysis buffer, dried, and resuspended in 1xSB. Nek10 was eluted of the beads by boiling in 1xSB, the sample was split, and 1/4th was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting to asses total Nek10 levels, while 3/4ths was analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by phosphorimaging to assess protein phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>U-2 OS KO cell-line generation</title><p>All cell-lines were grown at 37°C in a humidified incubator supplied with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, in DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS. All cell-lines were tested and shown to be free of mycoplasma contamination. Lentivirus was produced by transient transfection of HEK 293T cells using the CalPhos mammalian transfection kit (Clontech laboratories) to introduce packaging vectors (VSVg and GAG/POL/Δ8.2) and either pLVX-Cas9-Zsgreen, or lentiguide-PURO-Nek10 sgRNA, or pCW-Nek10-T2A-GFP-Blasticidin. The viral supernatant was filtered through a 0.45 μm filter and used to transduce U-2 OS target cells. First, U-2 OS cells were transduced with Cas9, followed by sorting for Zsgreen positive cells. These cells were then transduced with Nek10 sgRNA, followed by selection with puromycin (2 μg/ml; Invivogen). Doubly-transduced cells were subsequently cultured for 2 weeks to allow editing, and single cell sorted into 96-well plates. After expansion of the single-cell clones, gene editing was analyzed by PCR-amplifying the edited locus from gDNA, followed by Sanger sequencing of the PCR product, together with TIDE analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brinkman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>After selecting a Nek10-KO clone, Cas9 was removed by transfecting with a Cas9-sgRNA construct using lipofectamine 2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Cells were cultured for 10 days and sorted for ZsGreen-negative cells. Immunoblot analysis indicated that although all cells were negative for Zsgreen, about 30% of Cas9-expression still remained. Next, the cells were transduced with the pCW-Nek10 constructs, followed by selection with Blasticidin S (10 μg/ml; Invitrogen). To select for cells without leaky expression of Nek10, but good induction upon treatment with doxycycline, the following was done: first, GFP-negative cells were sorted, followed by induction of Nek10 expression with 2 μg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) for several days, and a second round of sorting, this time on GFP-positive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Antibodies and western blotting</title><p>Cell lysates was analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and transferred to nitrocellulose membranes by tank electrotransfer.

Primary antibody probing was done either in 1% skim milk in TBS-T (TBS with 0.1% Tween-20), or in Odyssey blocking buffer, for 1-2 hr at RT, or O/N at 4°C. Primary antibodies used are Mouse-anti-FLAG M2 (1:1000; Sigma), Rabbit-anti-FLAG (1:1000; Sigma), Rat-anti-HA 3F10 (1:500; Roche), Mouse-anti-β-actin (1:10,000; Sigma), Rabbit-anti-β-Actin (1:1000, Cell Signaling Technology), Rabbit-anti-phospho-tyrosine P-Y-1000 (1:2000; Cell Signaling Technology), Mouse-anti-Plk1 F-8 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc) and Rabbit-anti-Plk1 (1:100; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Inc).

The cells were lysed and Nek10 was immobilized on anti-FLAG beads as described in the ‘protein purification’ section above. Next, beads were washed three times with lysis buffer, and all bound proteins eluted by boiling in 1xSB. To study tyrosine phosphorylation, eluates and total cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting. To analyze serine phosphorylation by mass spectrometry, eluates were separated by SDS-PAGE, followed by Coomassie staining of the gel. The band containing 3xFLAG-Nek10 was excised, reduced and alkylated, followed by in-gel trypsin digestion. Tryptic peptides were extracted, desalted and lyophilized. Next, phosphopeptides were enriched using the High-Select Fe-NTA phosphopeptide enrichment kit (ThermoFisher Scientific) per manufacturer’s instructions. The elution tubes were coated with trypsinized BSA to prevent loss of phospho-peptides from binding to the tube wall. Eluted phosphopeptides were re-suspended in 0.1% acetic acid and separated by reverse phase HPLC using an EASY- nLC1000 (Thermo) with a self-pack 5 µm tip analytical column (12 cm of 5 µm C18, New Objective). Next, peptides were ionized by nanoelectrospray and analyzed using a QExactive HF-X mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher Scientific). The full MS-scan was followed by MS/MS for the top 15 precursor ions in each cycle. Raw mass spectral data files (.raw) were searched using Proteome Discoverer 2.2 (Thermo) and Mascot version 2.4.1 (Matrix Science). In addition, for the phosphopeptide corresponding to N346-R365 of Nek10, the spectrum was manually annotated by comparison to predicted products using Protein Prospector (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm">http://prospector.ucsf.edu/prospector/mshome.htm</ext-link>) to ensure correct phosphorylation site identification.</p><p>For the Mass Spectrometry experiment depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> , Nek10-deficient HEK 293T cells were generated using CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor, Margaret Frame, and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Mike Yaffe and colleagues describe here the use of oriented peptide library screening to undertake a systematic analysis of the phosphosite motif preference for the human NEK kinome. As well as differentiating subgroups of Neks based on preference for serine versus threonine and specific requirements for charged residues in different positions, they show how Nek10 acts in a unique manner within this family to phosphorylate tyrosine as well as serine. They also present an interesting model to suggest that because the Nek6, Nek7 and Nek9 kinases that work downstream of Plk1 share a very similar motif preference to Plk1, these Neks could possibly act as direct signal amplifiers of Plk1 through phosphorylation of the same substrates.</p><p>This is a well-presented manuscript where the data strongly support the conclusions. This work adds valuable understanding to the mechanism of action of kinase-substrate selection by the human NEK kinome, and it will be of interest to the broader kinase community.</p><p>The reviewers have suggested the manuscript could be improved by provision of a bit more experimental data, and clarification of a number of points at outlined below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures 1-4 present experimental data based on phosphorylation of peptide arrays using purified Nek kinases. A Coomassie Blue, or equivalent, stained SDS-PAGE gel should be shown of the purified full-length or catalytic domain fragments of the NEK kinases used for the OPLS screening as part of Figure 1—figure supplement 1. The same samples should also be Western blotted for Plk1 to confirm there no contamination of these preparations with this kinase. This is important in relation to the data presented in Figure 7. In addition, while it is good to see control experiments performed with inactivated versions of each kinase, the authors should note in the text the slight caveat that many NEKs act in cascades with other kinases and that use of a kinase-inactive protein may lead to failure to activate a downstream co-purifying kinase that is responsible for the peptide phosphorylation.</p><p>2) The results using mutant kinases to analyze what sequences within its catalytic site give Nek10 the ability to phosphorylate tyrosine are interesting and identify a few very specific residues that appear to make the difference (e.g. APE-4 and HRD+2). It would therefore be worthwhile to make the complementary mutations at these sites in one of the classic serine/threonine Nek kinase, for example Nek1 or Nek7 for which structures have been solved, to see if their activity could be re-directed towards tyrosine.</p><p>3) The site of Nek10 phosphorylation. The authors state in subsection “Nek10 is a dual-specificity kinase” and “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in trans, both in vitro and in cells” (latter in relation to Figure 5A and B) that the in vitro sites were identified by mass spectrometry, but the data are 'not shown'. What is the rationale for not revealing these sites in this paper? These should be identified – were they both tyrosine and serine sites? And did they lie within or out-with the catalytic site?</p><p>4) Figure 5 reports data using a U-2 OS cell line in which the endogenous Nek10 gene has been removed by gene-editing at least in some experiments. This loss of Nek10 need to be shown with a Western blot or, if good antibodies are not available, by RT-PCR analysis. The 'in cell' data on tyrosine autophosphorylation of Nek10 are unclear; it is not stated whether the U-2 OS cells were WT or Nek10<sup>-/-</sup> in places (e.g. subsection “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in trans, both in vitro and in cells”), so the contribution of endogenous Nek10 is not always clear.</p><p>5) The identification of Y644 as the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation of Nek10 (Figure 5E) is compromised by the knowledge that this mutation at this site decreases kinase activity (Figure 5G) – could the decrease in phosphorylation of the Y644 mutant simply result from decreased protein kinase activity rather than Y644 being the major site of phosphorylation? A similar criticism could be levelled at the observed effect of the Y644 mutation in the trans phosphorylation study (Figure 5F) if the effect of the Y644 mutation was to cause decrease phosphorylation associated with a conformational change that alters the activity of Nek10. Also, the conclusion that Nek10 autophosphorylation can occur in trans in vitro is demonstrated (Figure 5F) and it is reasonable to assume that this phosphorylation in trans may occur in cells, but there is no data to support this conclusion (subsection “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in trans, both in vitro and in cells”). The data and the conclusion supporting this part of the study should be discussed with these points taken into account.</p><p>6) Figure 7E and F report that both Plk1 and Nek7 can phosphorylate the Cdc27 and RacGAP1 proteins. It is also stated that mutation of residues that were putative phosphorylation sites for both Plk1 and Nek7 led to reduced phosphorylation. This reduction in phosphorylation should be quantified. In addition, it would help the conclusions if the wild-type substrates (or phosphorylated fragments) were subject to mass spectrometry analysis after incubation with the two kinases to demonstrate that there is significant overlap in the phospho-acceptor sites.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44635.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figures 1-4 present experimental data based on phosphorylation of peptide arrays using purified Nek kinases.

In addition, we have analyzed all of the purified Nek kinase preparations for potential Plk1 contamination by anti-Plk1 western blotting, as suggested. As now shown in the new Figure 7—figure supplement 1, no Plk1 contamination was detected in any of the isolated Nek kinase preparations, although Plk1 could easily be detected in the total HEK 293T cell lysates. We therefore conclude that the Nek6/7/9 motifs that we deduced were not the result of Plk1 contamination of these Nek kinase preparations, which is further supported by the complete absence of peptide library phosphorylation using the same purification techniques for kinase-dead mutants of Nek 6, 7, and 9 (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Nonetheless, the reviewers were quite correct to point out that there is a minor theoretical possibility that in general, the activity of co-purified kinases might depend on the activity of the ectopically expressed Nek kinase. These new data are now explicitly discussed in subsection “The Nek kinase family diverges into four specificity-groups” of the Results section in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The results using mutant kinases to analyze what sequences within its catalytic site give Nek10 the ability to phosphorylate tyrosine are interesting and identify a few very specific residues that appear to make the difference (e.g. APE-4 and HRD+2).

As requested, we have now performed the suggested experiments using Nek1, and included this new data in Figure 3—figure supplement 3. As described in subsection “An APE-4 isoleucine in Nek1 enhances substrate phosphorylation on tyrosine residues” in the revised manuscript, replacement of an isoleucine in the APE-4 position, but not a threonine in the HRD+2 position, increases Nek1 phosphorylation of Tyr-containing peptides (Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,E), and reduces phosphorylation of Thr-containing peptides (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C), albeit while substantially reducing the overall kinase activity (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B). Nonetheless, even in the APE-4 isoleucine mutant, tyrosine phosphorylation is only about 20% as efficient as threonine phosphorylation, indicating that additional sequence determinants in Nek10 collaborate with the APE-4 isoleucine to enhance the dual-specificity nature of the Nek10 kinase domain. Please see the revised manuscript for experimental details and conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The site of Nek10 phosphorylation. The authors state in subsection “Nek10 is a dual-specificity kinase” and “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in trans, both in vitro and in cells” (latter in relation to Figure 5A and B) that the in vitro sites were identified by mass spec, but the data are 'not shown'. What is the rationale for not revealing these sites in this paper? These should be identified – were they both tyrosine and serine sites? And did they lie within or out-with the catalytic site?</p></disp-quote><p>As explained in the original manuscript, we mentioned this experiment merely to clarify the basis for the hypothesis that Nek10 might phosphorylate tyrosine residues. The mass spectrometry results were valuable for hypothesis generation, but the experiment was not designed or performed in a comprehensive manner to map all of the sites, and we considered the data too preliminary for publication. (For example, the tryptic fragment containing Y644 is only 4 amino acids long, and was not detected in either the phospho- or non-phospho form). However, based on the reviewers’ request, we now include the results of this mass spectrometry experiment in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript, and describe the findings in subsection “Nek10 is a dual-specificity kinase” of the revised text. The reviewers can appreciate that most of the detected phospho-sites in this preliminary experiment lie outside of the kinase domain, with the exception of T670. More importantly however, several of the identified phospho-sites are on tyrosine residues.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5 reports data using a U-2 OS cell line in which the endogenous Nek10 gene has been removed by gene-editing at least in some experiments. This loss of Nek10 need to be shown with a Western blot or, if good antibodies are not available, by RT-PCR analysis. The 'in cell' data on tyrosine autophosphorylation of Nek10 are unclear; it is not stated whether the U-2 OS cells were WT or Nek10<sup>-/-</sup> in places (e.g. subsection “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in trans, both in vitro and in cells”), so the contribution of endogenous Nek10 is not always clear.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point, and we agree with the reviewers that validating KO cell lines by Western blotting to show loss of protein expression is the preferred method. Therefore, we tested multiple anti-Nek10 antibodies that were commercially available, but unfortunately none of them performed satisfactorily. For this reason we decided to analyze editing of the genomic DNA loci by sequencing of the targeted locus, the results of which were shown in Supplementary Figure 5A of the original and are now shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 1A of the revised manuscript. Note that we sequenced 10 copies of the PCR-amplified Nek10 target site (from 10 bacterial colonies containing a TOPO backbone with the Nek10 PCR insert), and all of them were identified as edited, either by a 19 bp deletion or by a larger deletion that includes the last 80 bp of exon 5. Hence, transcription from both alleles would result in out-of-frame transcripts.</p><p>To further address the reviewers’ point, and exclude the small possibility that we missed a WT locus, we have now analyzed the total pool of PCR product of the Nek10 target site by TIDE analysis (Brinkman et al., 2014). TIDE can deconvolve the sequencing chromatograms to detect the fractions of edited and non-edited species. Notably, no unedited Nek10 DNA was detected by TIDE in the Nek10 KO PCR sample. These results are now described in subsections “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in vitro and in cells” and “In vitro kinase assays” of the revised text. Therefore, we can firmly conclude that all Nek10 loci are edited, and the Nek10 KO cells can only produce out-of-frame Nek10 transcripts.</p><p>In addition to this gDNA analysis, we also followed the reviewers’ suggestion and quantified Nek10 transcript levels by qRT-PCR. We could not detect any decrease in Nek10 mRNA levels in the Nek10 KO cells compared to the parental U-2 OS. However, not all out-of-frame transcripts are directly degraded by nonsense-mediated decay, and loss of protein expression is therefore not necessarily accompanied by loss of mRNA levels (see for example Dabrowska et al., 2018). To have a closer look at what happens on the mRNA level, we then reverse-transcribed the mRNA from parental and Nek10 KO cells, and performed a PCR spanning the edited region. The results of this experiment are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> for the reviewers’ appreciation. A clear single band can be observed for the parental cells, while the Nek10 KO cells contain multiple bands. Hence, the editing we observe on the genomic level, results in the expression of aberrant transcripts. Taken together, we therefore, conclude that the Nek10 KO cells do not contain unedited Nek10 transcripts.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>RNA was harvested from WT U-2 OS cells (parental) or a Nek10 KO U-2 OS clone (Nek10 KO), and reverse transcribed to generate cDNA.</title><p>A PCR with primers spanning the Nek10 sgRNA target locus was performed and analyzed by electrophoresis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-44635-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In any case, the conclusions drawn on basis of the results presented in Figure 5 will not change even in the unlikely event that functional Nek10 protein is translated from the aberrant transcripts. We generated the KO cell-lines to prevent in trans auto-phosphorylation by endogenous Nek10, but as can be observed in Figure 5E, endogenous Nek10 is not abundant or active enough in these U-2 OS cells to detectably phosphorylate the ectopically expressed kinase-dead Nek10.</p><p>Lastly, we apologize for the lack of clarity considering the use of wild-type or Nek10 KO U-2 OS cells. We have clarified this in the Results section and in the legend for Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The identification of Y644 as the major site of tyrosine phosphorylation of Nek10 (Figure 5E) is compromised by the knowledge that this mutation at this site decreases kinase activity (Figure 5G) – could the decrease in phosphorylation of the Y644 mutant simply result from decreased protein kinase activity rather than Y644 being the major site of phosphorylation? A similar criticism could be levelled at the observed effect of the Y644 mutation in the trans phosphorylation study (Figure 5F) if the effect of the Y644 mutation was to cause decrease phosphorylation associated with a conformational change that alters the activity of Nek10. Also, the conclusion that Nek10 autophosphorylation can occur in trans in vitro is demonstrated (Figure 5F) and it is reasonable to assume that this phosphorylation in trans may occur in cells, but there is no data to support this conclusion (subsection “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in trans, both in vitro and in cells”). The data and the conclusion supporting this part of the study should be discussed with these points taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct to point out that the decrease in tyrosine phosphorylation of the Nek10 Y644F variant that we observed in Figure 5E could be caused both by reduced activity of the Y644F mutant, as well as by reduced auto-phosphorylation of the Y644 target site. Also, the reviewers are correct to point out that in trans auto-phosphorylation is demonstrated in vitro, but not necessarily in cells. For both points we have adapted the Results section of Figure 5 (subsection “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in vitro and in cells”) to reflect these more correct interpretations. However, the data depicted in Figure 5F cannot be explained by loss of kinase activity due to the Y644F mutation, as the reviewers suggest, but instead are strong evidence that Y644 is a direct target site in vitro for in trans auto-phosphorylation. To clarify: the FLAG-tagged kinase used in lane 2 and lane 3 is in both cases a tyrosine-specific Nek10 variant, without any additional mutations. The HA-tagged Y644 control (lane 2) or the Y644F mutation (lane 3) was made in the kinase-dead Nek10 mutant that serves as a substrate for in trans auto-phosphorylation by the FLAG-tagged tyrosine-specific Nek10 variant to specifically avoid the potential complication of any Y644F effects on activity. We have adapted the Results section (subsection “Nek10 auto-phosphorylates on serine and tyrosine residues in vitro and in cells”) to explain this experiment more clearly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 7E and F report that both Plk1 and Nek7 can phosphorylate the Cdc27 and RacGAP1 proteins. It is also stated that mutation of residues that were putative phosphorylation sites for both Plk1 and Nek7 led to reduced phosphorylation. This reduction in phosphorylation should be quantified. In addition, it would help the conclusions if the wild-type substrates (or phosphorylated fragments) were subject to mass spectrometry analysis after incubation with the two kinases to demonstrate that there is significant overlap in the phospho-acceptor sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion, and have added the quantification of the Cdc27 and RacGAP1 phosphorylation to Figures 7E and 7F. As can be appreciated, mutation of the target sites on Cdc27 clearly reduced phosphorylation both by Nek7 and Plk1. This is however not the case for RacGAP1, indicating that both kinases target other sites in addition to S170. We had already indicated this conclusion in the original manuscript, but have made it even more explicit in the third paragraph of subsection “Nek6/7/9 share a common substrate motif with Polo-like Kinase 1 and can phosphorylate the same substrates” of the revised manuscript to avoid any misinterpretation.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to perform a mass spectrometry analysis of Cdc27/RacGAP1 after Plk1/Nek7 phosphorylation. However, we would like to point out that the substrate was generated by IVTT for Figure 7, which does not generate sufficient amounts of substrate for mass spectrometry analysis. Hence, the experiment suggested by the reviewers would be a significant effort involving production of recombinant RacGAP1 and Cdc27, both of which are large proteins and likely difficult to express in bacteria, and would involve multiple mass spectrometry repeats to obtain quantitative information. We do not have the resources or funding required to perform these experiments, and would ask the reviewer for leniency here. In summary, we show in Figure 7 that (1) Nek6/7/9 and Plk1 have extremely similar motifs, (2) there are many phosphosites in both the whole proteome and a Plk1 phosphoproteomic dataset that would be very good substrates for both Nek7 and Plk1, and (3) two Plk1 substrates are also phosphorylated by Nek7, and in the case of Cdc27 even on the same site. We believe this is sufficient evidence to support the conclusions made in the manuscript.</p><p>References:</p><p>Dabrowska M, Juzwa W, Krzyzosiak WJ, Olejniczak M.
