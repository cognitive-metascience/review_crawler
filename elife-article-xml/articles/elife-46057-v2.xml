pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46057.001</object-id><p>The SNF2h remodeler slides nucleosomes most efficiently as a dimer, yet how the two protomers avoid a tug-of-war is unclear. Furthermore, SNF2h couples histone octamer deformation to nucleosome sliding, but the underlying structural basis remains unknown. Here we present cryo-EM structures of SNF2h-nucleosome complexes with ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> that capture two potential reaction intermediates. In one structure, histone residues near the dyad and in the H2A-H2B acidic patch, distal to the active SNF2h protomer, appear disordered. The disordered acidic patch is expected to inhibit the second SNF2h protomer, while disorder near the dyad is expected to promote DNA translocation. The other structure doesn’t show octamer deformation, but surprisingly shows a 2 bp translocation. FRET studies indicate that ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> predisposes SNF2h-nucleosome complexes for an elemental translocation step. We propose a model for allosteric control through the nucleosome, where one SNF2h protomer promotes asymmetric octamer deformation to inhibit the second protomer, while stimulating directional DNA translocation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chromatin remodeling</kwd><kwd>ISWI</kwd><kwd>CryoEM</kwd><kwd>smFRET</kwd><kwd>nucleosome</kwd><kwd>ATPase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM073767</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Narlikar</surname><given-names>Geeta J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gamarra</surname><given-names>Nathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Yifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008069</institution-id><institution>University of California, San Francisco</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Program for Breakthrough Biomedical Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Yifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005189</institution-id><institution>Leukemia and Lymphoma Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Stephanie L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM108455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Narlikar</surname><given-names>Geeta J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM082893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Yifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1S10OD020054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Yifan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cryo-EM structures capture different conformational states of chromatin remodeler-nucleosome complexes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling motors play central roles in regulating access to the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Much has been learnt about remodeling mechanisms through the study of four classes of remodeling motors: the SWI/SNF class, the ISWI class, the CHD class and the combined INO80 and SWR class (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>). The ATPase subunits of the SWI/SNF, ISWI and CHD classes have been shown to carry out most of the biochemical activities of their parent complexes. Despite sharing sequence homology within their ATPase domains, these motors play distinct roles in vivo and differ significantly in their biochemical activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapier and Cairns, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). For example, SWI/SNF motors can generate products ranging from translationally repositioned to fully evicted histone octamers (nucleosome sliding and disassembly, respectively). In contrast, the ISWI and CHD family of motors appear to only slide nucleosomes but differ in how their activity is regulated by the extra-nucleosomal DNA flanking a nucleosome and the N-terminal histone H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Narlikar et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, while the human ISWI remodeler, SNF2h, functions most optimally as a dimer, SWI/SNF and CHD family remodelers are proposed to mainly function as monomeric ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asturias et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leschziner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Qiu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Racki et al., 2009</xref>). We note that recent cryo-EM structures of yeast Chd1 showed some states with two Chd1 molecules bound to a nucleosome, but the mechanistic significance of this dimeric architecture is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Despite fundamental mechanistic advances over the past two decades, the structural basis for how remodeling motors work and why different remodeler families differ in mechanism remains poorly understood. Recent advances in electron cryo-microscopy (cryo-EM) methodology have allowed direct visualization of SWI/SNF, CHD, INO80 and SWR remodeling motors bound to the nucleosome at high resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ayala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eustermann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Willhoft et al., 2018</xref>). Here we present cryo-EM structures of the full-length form of the human ISWI remodeler, SNF2h bound to a nucleosome. Carrying out cryo-EM without any cross-linking and using the ATP analog ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> enabled us to trap three different conformational states of the SNF2h-nucleosome complex: a state with an unexpectedly translocated nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>), a state with two SNF2h protomers bound to a nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) and a state with one protomer bound to a nucleosome that shows increased disorder within the histone core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The locations of histone disorder strongly suggest a role for octamer deformation in protomer coordination and directional DNA translocation. In addition, we detect new ISWI-histone contacts that make significant contributions to nucleosome sliding and help explain why ISWI may in differ in mechanism from Swi2/Snf2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46057.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>High resolution structure of SNF2h bound to a nucleosome with 60 bp of flanking DNA in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> and 140 mM KCl.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cryo-EM density map of SNF2h bound to the nucleosome at 3.4 Å from data recorded with a K2-summit camera.

(<bold>C</bold>) Schematic of the ensemble FRET experiment performed in (<bold>D</bold>). Nucleosomes were reconstituted on identical DNA sequence used to obtain Cryo-EM reconstructions and labeled with two fluorophores: cy3 on the 5’ phosphate at the DNA exit side of the nucleosome with a three carbon flexible linker and with cy5 on C8 of the cytosine base at position 149 near the entry side of the nucleosome via a six carbon flexible linker. Upon addition of SNF2h and ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, if the nucleosome is translocated as in the Cryo-EM reconstruction, the two labeled bases will be brought closer together in 3D space. This change in DNA conformation could be read out as a very small increase in FRET efficiency between the two labels. (<bold>D</bold>) Ensemble FRET experiment described in (<bold>C</bold>). FRET efficiency values were normalized to the FRET efficiency of the nucleosome prior to adding SNF2h and nucleotide. Points represent the mean of the indicated number independent experiments and error bars represent the standard error of the mean. Addition of SNF2h and ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> produces an instantaneous drop in FRET efficiency that slowly increases in the presence 140 mM KCl but not in the presence of 70 mM KCl (top). The instantaneous drop in FRET efficiency may be due to subtle changes in the conformation of DNA immediately upon SNF2h binding or due to previously reported changes in the photophysics of the cy3 dye labeled at this position (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Racki et al., 2009</xref>). The subsequent increase in FRET reflects structural changes in nucleosomal DNA which, in principle, could reflect many types of motions such as subtle changes in DNA trajectory. However, the increase observed is consistent with the small ~2 bp translocation captured in our cryo-EM reconstructions. Changes in the photophysical properties of the cy5 label were ruled out as contributing to the change in FRET efficiency as there was no change in fluorescence intensity when cy5 was directly excited (data not shown). No increase in FRET signal was seen when only SNF2h buffer was added (bottom).</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1s3sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46057.006</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 3—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Values used to obtain plots in D.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-46057-fig1-figsupp3-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46057-fig1-figsupp3-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s4" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46057.007</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</label><caption><title>By a single molecule assay, SNF2h induces a change in FRET under the 140 mM KCl conditions, consistent with a movement of the nucleosomal DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Setup of the single molecule assay.

In previous studies we have found that while a monomer of SNF2h can slide nucleosomes, SNF2h functions most optimally as a dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Racki et al., 2009</xref>). In these studies, we were able to visualize both singly bound and doubly bound SNF2h using negative stain EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Racki et al., 2009</xref>). Previous studies have further shown that binding of the ATP analog, ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, promotes a restricted conformation of the ATPase active site in a manner that is dependent on the H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Racki et al., 2014</xref>). The restricted conformation is consistent with observations showing an activating role for the H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamiche et al., 2001</xref>). Further, binding of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> to SNF2h promotes conformational flexibility of buried histone residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). This conformational flexibility is functionally important because restricting the flexibility via disulfide bonds inhibits nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these observations we have previously reasoned that the ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> state mimics an activated reaction intermediate. With the goal of obtaining high-resolution structures of this intermediate, we assembled SNF2h-nucleosome complexes in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>. The nucleosomes contain 60 base-pairs (bp) of flanking DNA on one end (0/60 nucleosomes). SNF2h-nucleosome complexes were assembled using conditions similar to those used in our previous negative stain EM experiments with the additional variable of salt concentration as discussed below (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Racki et al., 2009</xref>). Cryo-EM grids were prepared without using cross-linking.</p><p>During the course of this study, we collected two cryo-EM datasets using two different salt conditions for optimization of cryo-EM grid preparation. Electron micrographs and two-dimensional (2D) class averages calculated from a cryo-EM dataset collected using lower salt (70 mM KCl) on a scintillator-based camera show a relatively high percentage of doubly bound SNF2h-nucleosome complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2A</xref>). In contrast, another dataset collected using higher salt (140 mM KCl) on a K2 direct electron detection camera shows that the majority of the particles have one SNF2h bound to a nucleosome rather than two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). The reason for this difference is not fully understood. While higher salt reduces SNF2h affinity for nucleosomes, we believe the increase in salt by itself is not sufficient to cause complex dissociation as by negative stain EM we observe a high proportion of doubly bound complexes under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The higher salt concentration may, however, have a bigger impact when combined with other destabilizing factors during the process of plunge freezing cryo-EM grids, some of which are discussed in the Methods and further below.</p><p>With the goal of achieving the highest resolution possible we initially focused on the dataset obtained from the K2 direct electron detection camera. Using this dataset we determined a 3D reconstruction with a single SNF2h bound to a nucleosome at a resolution of 3.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The majority of particles contributed to this reconstruction having SNF2h bound to the flanking DNA at Super Helical Location (SHL) −2, judging from the density of flanking DNA. The locations of SHL + 2 and −2 as well as the entry and exit site DNA are defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This map is of sufficient quality for model building of nucleosomal DNA, core histones and the ATPase domain of SNF2h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The nucleotide binding pocket shows clear density of bound ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), but we cannot unambiguously confirm the presence of BeF<sub>x</sub>. The ATP binding site was also functionally confirmed by mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition to the ATPase domain, SNF2h has a C-terminal domain termed HAND-SANT-SLIDE (HSS), which binds flanking DNA, and an N-terminal region termed AutoN, which plays an autoihibitory role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grüne et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). These regions are not visible at high resolution, suggesting conformational flexibility of these regions in this state. By comparison to the K2 dataset, the earlier dataset was collected from a scintillator-based camera, which impeded the achievable resolution of the maps. From this dataset we determined two three-dimensional (3D) reconstructions, one of a nucleosome with doubly bound SNF2h and the other with singly bound SNF2h, both at 8.4 Å resolution with most histone helices fully resolved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2A</xref>). The atomic models derived from the 3.4 Å reconstruction fit well into the density for the doubly bound SNF2h-nucleosome complex as rigid bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).</p><p>To assess whether the main difference between the two structures was simply resolution or whether we had trapped different states of the SNF2h-nucleosome complex, we carried out further analysis and comparisons as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A SNF2h-nucleosome complex that suggests an asymmetrically deformed histone octamer</title><p>For the detailed analysis we first focused on the older data set as this contained a larger set of doubly bound particles.

The density of the SNF2h bound at SHL+2 is weaker than that of SNF2h bound at SHL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This difference likely suggests that the SNF2h bound to the nucleosome at SHL+2 is conformationally more flexible. Substantial previous work has suggested that when ISWI enzymes move end-positioned nucleosomes towards the center, the active protomer initiates translocation from SHL+2 and engages the entry site flanking DNA via its HSS domain (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> for nomeclature) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kagalwala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwanbeck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>). The increased conformational flexibility of the SNF2h protomer bound at SHL+2 is consistent with this protomer being the active one.</p><p>Some regions of the histone octamer in the doubly bound structure were less well resolved than other regions, suggesting specific regions of disorder within the octamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). The apparent disorder was somewhat symmetric, and without an internal control for comparison, we could not unambiguously interpret the lower resolution as resulting from increased disorder as opposed to achievable resolution. However, we noticed that in the singly bound structures, with SNF2h bound at SHL+2, the disorder is asymmetric providing a chance to use the non-disordered half of the octamer as an internal control for achievable resolution. With this internal control the reconstruction obtained from the singly bound particles suggests asymmetric deformation of the histone core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>, compare canonical Face B to disordered Face A). These results suggested that (i) the less well resolved local regions in the doubly bound structure also likely result from increased local disorder and (ii) a given SNF2h protomer causes octamer disorder on only one side of the nucleosome. Specifically, two regions of the folded histones show increased disorder (helix α2 in H3 and the H2A/H2B acidic patch, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The disorder is apparent when the intact density for the blue, red and yellow helices in face B is compared to the missing or altered density for these helices in face A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, black arrows). These locations of octamer disorder are mechanistically informative as detailed below.</p><p>The region of increased disorder at helix α2 in H3 is proximal to the nucleosomal dyad. This region also interfaces with buried residues in H4 that showed increased dynamics in our previous NMR studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). What could be the significance of this potential allosteric deformation? While DNA translocation by SNF2h initiates from SHL+2, nucleosome sliding requires the disruption of histone-DNA contacts to allow propagation of DNA around the octamer. Histone deformation near the dyad could create a relaxed local environment that facilitates disruption and propagation of DNA around the nucleosome. Further, asymmetry in this disruption may facilitate directionality in the sliding reaction. Consistent with this possibility, our previous work shows that constraining the H3 α2 helix by disulfide cross-linking alters the directionality of nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, recent studies by others have suggested asymmetric rearrangements of helix α2 in H3 at 150 mM NaCl and have found that the same disulfide crosslinks inhibit thermally driven nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilokapic et al., 2018a</xref>). Based on these comparisons, our findings here suggest that SNF2h amplifies intrinsic nucleosome dynamics during the sliding reaction.</p><p>The other region of increased disorder is the acidic patch formed between histone H2A and H2B. Previous work has suggested that interactions between SNF2h and the acidic patch play a critical role in stimulating nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gamarra et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, recent biochemical studies using asymmetric acidic patch mutant nucleosomes indicate that the activity of a SNF2h protomer bound at SHL+2 (as defined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) requires the acidic patch on the undistorted octamer face (Face B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levendosky and Bowman, 2019</xref>). All of these observations raise the intriguing possibility that binding of one SNF2h protomer allosterically deforms the acidic patch that is required by the second protomer on the other side of the nucleosome. Such an allosteric effect could serve to inhibit the second protomer from initiating sliding in the opposite direction, thus preventing a tug-of-war between the two protomers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A SNF2h-nucleosome complex with a translocated nucleosome</title><p>The analysis above led us to ask if we could also detect octamer deformation in the newer data set. We first explored if there were particles suggesting increased dynamics in the K2 dataset that we could have missed in the drive for homogeneity and the highest resolution. Including particles with substantial octamer dynamics would by definition increase local disorder in the reconstruction and affect the resolution both locally and globally. However, we failed to extract any subset from the excluded particles that shows signs of octamer dynamics, suggesting that this dataset may not contain particles with deformed octamers.</p><p>However, as part of our analysis for detecting octamer dynamics, we re-picked the particles and separated them into two different classes of single SNF2h-bound nucleosomes: a larger one of 3.9 Å resolution with a single enzyme bound at SHL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and a smaller one of 6.9 Å with a single enzyme bound at SHL+2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The lower resolution of 6.9 Å is primarily due to the small number of particles in this conformation. The atomic models of nucleosomal DNA, core histones and the ATPase domain of SNF2h derived from the 3.4 Å map fit well into the density map of the 3.9 Å and 6.9 Å reconstructions as rigid bodies. Unexpectedly, in both the 3.9 Å and 6.9 Å reconstructions, we observed that 2 bp of DNA is translocated from the exit site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5A–B</xref>). The DNA density at the exit side of the nucleosome is intact and fully resolved, suggesting tight association of DNA with the histone octamer, similar to what is observed in other nucleosome structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chua et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>). The phosphate groups in the double stranded DNA backbone are clearly resolved, which enabled us to precisely locate and count every bp and to confirm the two extra bp on the exit side of the nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). We ruled out the possibility that the nucleosome particles were pre-assembled with two bp shifted before forming a complex with SNF2h, by determining a reconstruction of nucleosomes assembled identically but untreated with SNF2h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). These nucleosomes do not display the 2 bp translocation of DNA from the exit side. Further, intriguingly, no extra DNA density was found in the exit side for the structures obtained at 70 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). These comparisons indicate that the reconstructions obtained using the K2 and scintillator-based cameras at 140 mM and 70 mM KCl respectively represent different states of the SNF2h-nucleosome complex.</p><p>What could be the significance of the 2 bp translocation? Recent studies have shown that the Chd1 remodeling motor can shift 1–3 bp of nucleosomal DNA inwards from the entry site in the apo and ADP states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winger et al., 2018</xref>). These observations raised the possibility that SNF2h may display an analogous property in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>, the nucleotide analog used in our EM preparations. To test if the ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> bound state causes changes in the conformation of nucleosomal DNA, we used single-molecule FRET (smFRET) experiments to measure changes in the location of exit DNA relative to the histone octamer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Under the 140 mM KCl buffer conditions of the EM sample preparation, we observed a change in FRET in the presence of SNF2h and ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). The extent of FRET change is consistent with the change in FRET that would be expected from the translocation of 1–2 bp of DNA out of the nucleosome. This FRET change was not observed in the absence of SNF2h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D</xref>). Complementary ensemble FRET experiments with a different labeling scheme that reports on changes in distance between the DNA at the exit and entry sites of the nucleosome also showed a change in FRET that is consistent with DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). The ensemble FRET change was also dependent on the presence of SNF2h. These results indicate that analogous to Chd1, SNF2h can promote the shifting of ~2 bp of DNA in the absence of ATP hydrolysis. However, these observations raised the question of why comparable DNA translocation was not detected in the EM reconstructions carried out under the 70 mM KCl conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5D</xref>). We reasoned that the combination of SNF2h binding and the higher salt conditions of 140 mM KCl could increase the lability of the histone-DNA contacts and promote translocation of a few bp of DNA. To test this possibility, we repeated the ensemble FRET experiment at 70 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Under these conditions we did not observe a significant change in FRET explaining the absence of translocation in the 70 mM KCl reconstructions.</p><p>Unlike the structures at 70 mM KCl, the structures obtained at 140 mM KCl show a higher proportion of singly bound SNF2h at SHL-2 compared to SHL+2. Yet all the nucleosomes in the higher salt conditions (140 mM KCl) show the 2 bp DNA translocation in the same direction. This result seems paradoxical as a SNF2h protomer bound at SHL-2 is opposite to what is expected for the observed direction of DNA translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dang and Bartholomew, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kagalwala et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schwanbeck et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zofall et al., 2006</xref>). Comparison of the individual protomers in the doubly bound complex obtained at 70 mM KCl indicates that the SNF2h protomer at SHL+2 is conformationally more flexible than that at SHL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This increased flexibility is consistent with the protomer at SHL+2 being the active protomer. We speculate that the increased dynamics of the SNF2h protomer bound at SHL+2 makes it more prone to dissociate during the cryo-EM grid preparation procedure carried out in 140 mM KCl. We therefore interpret the structures captured at 140 mM KCl as arising from partial disassembly of a doubly bound translocated complex, in which the protomer bound at SHL+2 has promoted translocation.</p><p>Based on the above comparisons, we conclude that the reconstructions obtained at 70 mM KCl, represent reaction intermediates that are poised to translocate by exploiting specific deformations in the octamer conformation, while the reconstructions obtained at 140 mM KCl represent translocated SNF2h-nucleosome states in which the deformed octamer has relaxed to its canonical conformation. We next use the 3.4 Å reconstruction of the translocated state to identify new SNF2h-nucleosome interactions and assess their role in nucleosome sliding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The role of SNF2h-nucleosome interactions in nucleosome sliding</title><p>Similar to observations for the Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain and Chd1, our structure implies a large conformational rearrangement in the RecA lobes of SNF2h upon nucleosome binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farnung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hauk et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Previous work has shown that the basic patch residues (KRHRK) of the H4 tail substantially activate ISWI remodeling, in part by counteracting the auto-inhibitory AutoN region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Clapier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clapier et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hamiche et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Racki et al., 2014</xref>).

In our 3.4 Å structure we find that the AutoN domain has moved away from this cleft and one RecA lobe is flipped over the other to form a new cleft for nucleosome binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Most of AutoN is not resolved suggesting conformational flexibility in this state. Some residues of the RecA lobes that were shown to interact with AutoN in the unbound <italic>Myceliophthora thermophila</italic> ISWI structure now engage with the nucleosomal DNA and the H4 tail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). Among these residues is an acidic surface on lobe two that directly engages the histone H4 tail basic patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, top left). This exchange of interactions provides a structural explanation for how the H4 tail relieves autoinhibition by AutoN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clapier and Cairns, 2012</xref>). Similar interactions were observed previously in the crystal structure of the isolated ATPase lobe 2 of <italic>Myceliophthora thermophila</italic> ISWI with an H4 tail peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the H4 tail, the structure reveals new interactions between a loop within RecA lobe two and the globular region of histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, top right). Two residues K440 and K443 are in close proximity to make these direct contacts. Of these K443 is unique to and conserved across ISWI family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). Mutating K440 or K443 to alanine resulted in 4- and 6-fold defects respectively in the maximal rates of remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). The K443A mutation had a much smaller effect on ATPase activity (≤2 fold), suggesting a role in the coupling of ATP hydrolysis to nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). Based on these functional effects we speculate that the interactions with H3 may help stabilize octamer deformation during SNF2h remodeling. Another residue in this loop, D442, is in proximity but not close enough to make a direct contact. Mutating it had a small (2-fold) stimulatory effect on remodeling, suggesting this residue plays a modest autoinhibitory role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). While comparable H3 contacts by SWI/SNF motors have not been observed, similar functionally important interactions between the H3 alpha one helix and an insertion in RecA lobe two are found in structures of the Chd1-nucleosome complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sundaramoorthy et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In terms of DNA interactions, several residues of the conserved lobe 1 and lobe two motifs are in proximity to the DNA at the SHL-2 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Two residues conserved between ISWI and SWI/SNF ATPases are W581 and N448 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). While mutation of W581 in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Swi2/Snf2 ATPase domain causes a &gt; 10 fold defect in remodeling, mutating this residue within SNF2h caused a 3-fold defect in the maximal rate of nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Mutating N448 causes a ~ 9 fold defect in the maximal rate of remodeling (k<sub>max</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>) without causing a significant defect in the K<sub>m</sub> (data not shown), suggesting that this interaction makes a bigger contribution during catalysis rather than binding. In contrast, both mutations had smaller effects on DNA-stimulated ATPase activity (≤2 fold increase, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting these residues contribute to coupling of ATP hydrolysis to DNA translocation. A distortion from the normal path of nucleosomal DNA is also observed at SHL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

In this context ISWI motors have the difficult task of sliding nucleosomes despite the constraints imposed by the histone octamer. Yet these motors are able to cause rapid and directional nucleosome translocation without disassembling the octamer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>). Our results here suggest that instead of acting as a barrier that needs to be overcome, the histone octamer may actively participate in the reaction by acting as a deformable medium for allosteric control. Below we discuss the mechanistic significance of these new findings in the context of previous discoveries.</p><p>We have previously found that SNF2h binding in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> increases the dynamics of a subset of buried histone residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sinha et al., 2017</xref>). These dynamics play a role in the initiation of nucleosome sliding from SHL ± 2 and the directionality of sliding. Relevant to these observations, several prior studies have provided evidence for intrinsic dynamics within nucleosomes. These include spontaneous unpeeling of nucleosomal DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2005</xref>), the identification by EM of alternative configurations of histone helices within distorted nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilokapic et al., 2018b</xref>) and the identification of histone mutants than increase the spontaneous dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kitevski-LeBlanc et al., 2018</xref>) of core histone resides. It has been further demonstrated that core histone dynamics enable spontaneous nucleosome sliding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilokapic et al., 2018a</xref>). However the scale and nature of the octamer deformations promoted by a remodeler such as SNF2h has been unknown. The EM reconstructions obtained at 70 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) provide a starting point for understanding the structural basis of SNF2h mediated octamer fluctuations. Two unexpected features stand out. First, unlike the defined alternative helical conformations observed previously in nucleosomes alone, the EM density changes that we observe imply an ensemble of states with increased disorder in the histone conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bilokapic et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bilokapic et al., 2018a</xref>). Second, the increased disorder is asymmetric and distal from the bound SNF2h protomer suggesting an allosteric mode of octamer deformation.</p><p>We propose that the structure captured at lower salt mimics a reaction intermediate in which SNF2h action results in asymmetric disordering of specific histone regions prior to translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The apparent asymmetric nature of the octamer deformation could help explain a long-standing question about SNF2h protomer coordination. SNF2h assembles on nucleosomes as a face-to face dimer, but what prevents the two protomers from simultaneously translocating DNA in opposite directions, resulting in a stalled nucleosome? Our findings raise the possibility that the active protomer prevents a tug of war by allosterically altering the acidic patch surface required by the second protomer. In addition, the disorder near the dyad is expected to promote the directional translocation of DNA initiated by the active protomer. We further propose that collapse of the reaction intermediate results in an elemental translocation step, which is mimicked by the structure captured at higher salt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with this possibility, previous single-molecule studies have indicated that the elemental translocation event driven by ISWI enzymes is 1–2 bp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Deindl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46057.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Speculative model that places SNF2h-nucleosome Cryo-EM structures within SNF2h reaction cycle .</title><p>Two protomers of SNF2h bind to the nucleosome along with ATP. Based on previous work, the directionality of nucleosome sliding is determined by the motor that engages the longer flanking DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>). By this model, the SNF2h motor bound at SHL+2 (orange protomer) will be the active motor and determine the direction of sliding because it would contact the 60 bp flanking DNA with its HSS domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leonard and Narlikar, 2015</xref>). For simplicity, the HSS domain is not shown. Binding of the SHL+2 protomer asymmetrically deforms the acidic patch and histone H3 near the dyad on the opposite face of the histone octamer. The second protomer can bind at SHL-2, but cannot act because deformation of the acidic patch inhibits its ability to slide nucleosomes. The SNF2h complex with the deformed octamer represents an intermediate that is poised for translocation. Processive DNA translocation is enabled by successive ATP hydrolysis cycles from this activated intermediate, moving DNA in 1–2 bp fundamental increments. We speculate that the cryo-EM structure captured at low salt represents the deformed intermediate, while the structure captured at high salt represents a collapsed product state in which the nucleosome is translocated by 2 bp (translocated bases are highlighted in red).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-46057-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Future studies looking at structures in additional nucleotide states will help advance our understanding of how changes in ISWI conformation are coupled to changes in octamer dynamics.

To prepare the nucleosome-SNF2h complex, nucleosomes were mixed with purified SNF2h on ice, then incubated at room temperature for 10 min before applying to the grids for plunge freezing. Initially, the complex was prepared by mixing 1.45 µM 0/60 nucleosomes with 5 µM SNF2h in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 70 mM KCl, 0.5 mM ADP-Mg<sup>2+</sup>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM BeF<sub>x</sub> (1:5 BeCl<sub>2</sub>:NaF). This sample yielded a reconstruction of nucleosome with two SNF2h bound at 8.4 Å resolution by using a scintillator-based camera. The other sample was prepared by mixing 0.625 µM 0/60 nucleosomes with 1.25 µM SNF2h in 0.5 mM ADP-Mg, 0.5 mM BeF<sub>x</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 140 mM KCl, 3 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1.25 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 1.5% glycerol. This resulted in high-resolution reconstructions using direct electron detection camera. While the resolution difference is mainly caused by the camera technology and unlikely to be related to the differences in sample preparation, the salt concentration could be amplified during the process of blotting and plunge freezing. For the nucleosome alone reconstruction, 1 µM nucleosomes were used directly after the dialysis.</p><p>When plunge freezing cryo-EM grids, both protein and solutes in buffer are concentrated but to very different extents. The concentration of SNF2h-nucleosome samples on cryo-EM grids are roughly ~100 µM, estimated from the number of particles seen in micrographs. This concentration increase is mostly caused by the volume reduction (~10,000 fold) during blotting, in which filter papers preferably absorb water with chemical solutes over proteins. It is not possible to estimate the final concentration of KCl and ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> in a frozen cryo-EM grid, but it may also increase several folds from the sample applied to EM grids, because of evaporation between blotting and freezing. Thus, 70 mM KCl could become as high as ~200 mM and 140 mM KCl become ~400 mM before freezing. If so, it would profoundly impact the binding affinity of SNF2h to the nucleosome, and/or the affinity of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> for SNF2h. We also speculate that macromolecular interactions that are destabilized by the higher ionic strength are more susceptible to being disassembled by the air-water interface during plunge freezing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Negative stain EM</title><p>Grids of negatively stained sample were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohi et al., 2004</xref>).

Specifically, images were recorded in super resolution counting mode using a K2 Summit direct electron detection camera (Gatan Inc) at a nominal magnification of 31,000X, corresponding to a calibrated physical pixel size of 1.22 Å/pixel. The dose rate on camera was set to 8.2 counts (corresponding to 9.9 electrons) per physical pixel per second. The total exposure time was 6 s, leading to a total accumulated dose of 41 electrons per Å<sup>2</sup> on the specimen. Each image was fractionated into 30 subframes, each with an accumulated exposure time of 0.2 s. Images were recorded with a defocus in the range from 1.5 to 3.0 um.

Six unique 2D class averages were used as template reference for an automated particle picking using Gautomatch (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/">http://www.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/kzhang/</ext-link>). Only monodispersed particles are picked. Particle aggregations, which are occasionally seen, are excluded. All picked particles were subject to reference free 2D classifications. Particles within 2D classes that show clear nucleosome features were selected and were further inspected visually to remove any remaining ‘junk’ particles. The total number of particles in each dataset is listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>.

In the first analysis, we picked 120,533 particles and classified into 50 2D class averages. Particles within low quality 2D classes were removed. Through sequential classification and refinement, we obtained a 3.8 Å reconstruction of single SNF2h-bound nucleosome. To separate particles with SNF2h bound to SHL+2 and SHL-2, we first used volume subtraction procedure to subtract the SNF2h from all particles followed by unambiguously aligning all nucleosome particles using the flanking DNA as a fiducial mark. We then performed a focused classification on SNF2h, which lead to two main subclasses: one reconstruction at 3.9 Å resolution has SNF2h bound to the SHL-2 position. The other one at 6.9 Å resolution has SNF2h bound to the SHL + 2 position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both reconstructions show a 2 bp translocation of DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Independently, we re-processed frame motion correction by using MotionCor2 v1.2.1, with option accounting for in-frame motion enabled (InFmMotion 1). The motion corrected images were subjected again to independent particle picking and CTF estimation. In this reprocess, we started with 333,430 initially picked particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We skipped 2D classification for cleaning up the dataset, instead using 3D classification for this purpose. Using cryoSPARC v2 ‘Ab initio reconstruction’ and ‘Heterogeneous refinement’, in subsequent rounds of subsorting, the final reconstruction contains 43,165 particles, which yielded 3.4 Å reconstruction using ‘Non-homogeneous refinement’. We also attempted to separate particles into SNF2h bound to SHL+2 and SHL-2 positions using focused classification and signal subtraction. We succeeded by obtaining a 3.6 Å SHL-2 reconstruction from 28500 particles and a 4.5 Å reconstruction from 14665 particles. The latter likely still contains a mix of SHL+2 and SHL-2 that we were unable to separate further.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Validation of 2 base-pair translocated nucleosome</title><p>We ruled out the possibility of nucleosome mis-assembly as described in the main text (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>). Furthermore, the following additional experiments were carried out to rule out the possibility of any computational artifacts, such as incomplete separation of particles with SNF2h bound to SHL+2 and SHL-2 positions. In addition to the fact that the 3.9 Å reconstruction shows that DNA has a sharp ending without any weak extension, we calculated 20 bootstrapped 3D reconstructions using a subset of particles bootstrapped from the particles that were used to calculate the 3.9 Å map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). These bootstrapped reconstructions show no significant variance at the location of this extra density. These observations demonstrate that this extra density is statistically significant and well defined, and cannot be contributed by misaligned particles. Furthermore, we calculated difference maps between all experimental maps determined from datasets recorded with K2-Summit and the map simulated from the atomic model of nucleosome without the two extra base-pairs at the exit side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>). We also calculated difference maps between the reconstruction of nucleosome alone and the reconstructions of SNF2h bound to either SHL+2 or SHL-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5A–B</xref>). These difference maps confirm the existence of extra DNA density at the exit side of our SNF2h-nucleosome complex reconstructions.</p><p>To calculate the variance map, we bootstrapped 5000 particles 20 times from the 3.9 Å SNF2h dataset and backprojected particles within these subsets to produce 20 reconstructions using relion_reconstruct in Relion2. The variance map between all reconstructions was then calculated. All scripts are included in PyEM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/asarnow/pyem">https://github.com/asarnow/pyem</ext-link>).

We then used Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and Phenix (phenix.realspacerefine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) to extend and fit the DNA into our structures, as well as ensure the correctness of the structure.</p><p>SNF2h was constructed using homology modeling, based on an ISWI crystal structure from <italic>Myceliophthora thermophile</italic> (PDBID: 5JXR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yan et al., 2016</xref>). We separated each of the domains and used rigid body fitting into the EM density. Subsequently, Coot and Phenix were used to adjust and modify parts of the model. For model cross-validation, the final structure was initially subjected to 0.1 Å random displacement and then refined against one of the two half-maps using Phenix. Subsequently, the refined pdb was converted to a density map and FSC curves were calculated between three maps: half map 1 (the refinement map, 'work'), half map 2 (not used for refinement, 'free') and the summed map. A very small difference between the 'work' and 'free' FSC curves indicates little-to-no effect of over-fitting of the atomic model.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Sjors HW Scheres as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In light of the concerns expressed regarding competition, we note that <italic>eLife</italic> provides 'scoop-protection', which means that if another paper comes out while the revision is being done, this does not affect the decision to publish in <italic>eLife</italic>. In light of the competitive situation, you are welcome to communicate with the Senior Editor with any questions regarding the points raised below in advance of preparing a revised manuscript.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript presents data indicating structural changes to the histone components of the nucleosome (in addition to the DNA) upon binding of the remodelling enzyme SNF2h in the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>. This potentially represents key information to support previous data generated by the Narlikar lab which showed that the action of SNF2h was sensitive to cross-links introduced at specific locations within the histone octamer. The three reviewers agreed this manuscript contains sufficiently interesting data to warrant publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there was also a consensus that the 'low-salt' data set is of insufficient quality to merit the conclusions drawn on it (see point 1). Therefore, the authors are encouraged to include a new structure from the sample in the low-salt condition using a direct-electron detector in a revised version. If this is not possible at present, the 2 bp translocation detected in the 3.9Å structure is still a novel observation, and it should be possible to produce a very important manuscript focusing on this aspect alone.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The observation that the nucleosome becomes partially disordered when two SNF2h molecules bind in the low-salt condition plays an important role in the Discussion section. This observation, in the 8.4Å dimer map, is not supported by the data: at these resolutions disorder is very hard to distinguish from noise present in the reconstruction. Detailed analysis of the uploaded maps confirms this. Therefore, the authors are encouraged to include a new structure, calculated from a data set recorded on a direct-electron detector, in a revised version of this manuscript. Otherwise, the model in Figure 5 should be substantially modified.</p><p>2) The sub-division of the K2 data set is not clear: there is a separate path of image processing yielding a 3.4Å resolution map of the SNF2h bound at the -2 position, whereas a split of the same data set into +2 and -2 bound positions yield a 3.9Å and a 6.9Å map. Could it be that the 3.4Å map contains a mixture of the two states, and despite a higher resolution, the 3.4Å map is actually representing a (suboptimal) mixture? All particles contributing to the 6.9Å map should be removed from the 3.4Å map.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>Several different datasets are used and different routes used to process these (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These illustrate the difficulty in distinguishing between particles in which SNF2h is bound to one side of the nucleosome or the other. Subtraction of the density for SNF2h, alignment to linker DNA and back projection was required to distinguish between SNF2H is bound at superhelical location -2 and +2. (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). In the text it is stated that a similar process was used to orient doubly bound nucleosomes from the lower resolution dataset. However, this is not indicated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). This should be clarified. Was this applied for the singly bound species at 70mM KCl? Why is there no SNF2H bound at SHL -2 at 70 mM KCl?</p><p>The density for SNF2h at SHL+2 is lower resolution than that at SHL-2 this is interpreted as increased conformational flexibility. Is it possible that this instead arises because some of the particles included are singly bound on the SHL-2 side?</p><p>Presumably the 2 bp translocation is also observed in the 3.4Å structure?</p><p>In the Materials and methods, it is specified that the low salt sample contained 0.5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in addition to 70mM KCl. But in the &quot;higher salt&quot; sample [140mM KCl], there was no MgCl<sub>2</sub> added. In terms of chromatin compaction, 0.5mM of divalent cations would correspond to approximately 50mM of monovalent salt. Could the difference between the two datasets be related to Mg concentration rather than the amount of KCL?</p><p>Since particles may dissociate during grid preparation, a gel shift EMSA analysis using gentle fixation would be more informative than 2D/3D classification to analyse stoichiometry.</p><p>The single molecule FRET experiments provide a useful alternate means of measurement to support the SNF2h dependent extension of linker DNA. Is it known which side of the nucleosome SNF2h is acting from in these experiments? This important to know whether it substantiates the DNA extension observed in the +2 or -2 structure.</p><p>Could the ensemble FRET shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 be affected by changes in the DNA trajectory rather than DNA translocation? The explanation for the rapid reduction in FRET on adding SNF2h and nucleotide is not clear. The single molecule experiments provide much stronger evidence for c2bp translocation, however, in this case the measurement at 70 mM KCl was not made. It would be good to add this.</p><p>&quot;During the course of this study, we collected two cryo-EM datasets using two different salt conditions for optimization of cryo-EM grid preparation.&quot; In terms of optimization of grid preparation, where there more than two conditions screened?</p><p>&quot;Particles contributing to this reconstruction were aligned unambiguously using flanking DNA as a fiducial marker to break the pseudo symmetry (Figure2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).” But given the low resolution/low SNR of this data set, this may not be true. There are in fact many views where the extra DNA is not visible.</p><p>&quot;The density of the SNF2h bound at SHL+2 is weaker than that of SNF2h bound at SHL-2 (Figure2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). This difference suggests that the SNF2h bound to the nucleosome at SHL+2 is conformationally more flexible.&quot; How can one exclude that instead of flexibility, the worse density of the second SNF2h is caused by incomplete dimer formation, i.e. partial occupancy of the SNF2h at the +2 position? (Again better resolution might help to distinguish between the two, see major point 1.)</p><p>&quot;DNA translocation was not detected in the EM reconstructions carried out under the 70 mM KCl conditions&quot; yet later it is stated &quot;Unlike the structures at 70 mM KCl, the structures obtained at 140 mM KCl show a higher proportion of singly bound SNF2h at SHL-2 compared to SHL+2. Yet all the nucleosomes show the 2 bp DNA translocation in the same direction.&quot; I don't understand this. What does &quot;all nucleosomes&quot; mean? In both the high and low salt conditions?</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 6: it is not clear at which threshold this map is shown. In fact, no orange density is visible at all. It would be useful to see the variance thresholded at for example 2 or 3 sigma, or to show a few slices with grey-scale images through the variance map.</p><p>Figure 1D &amp; Figure 3—figure supplement 2: what is shown in purple? SNF2h? Perhaps it's helpful to add more labels for residues/chains.</p><p>The field view images are too small and at too low resolution to clearly see, but it looks like there are a lot of larger complexes (containing more than one &quot;singly bound&quot; or &quot;doubly bound &quot;nucleosome). That is also seen in the negative stain images, but not discussed in the paper.</p><p>The uploaded maps for the low-salt reconstructions both show evidence that multiple spherical masks (or the 'Volume Eraser' tool in UCSF Chimera?) have been used to remove density. What was in these positions before? Unmasked maps should be uploaded to the EMDB.</p><p>Electron micrographs are too small in the images to see the particles clearly</p><p>Referring to datasets as &quot;early&quot; and &quot;recent&quot; is slightly confusing, especially in the beginning of the Results section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46057.046</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The observation that the nucleosome becomes partially disordered when two SNF2h molecules bind in the low-salt condition plays an important role in the Discussion section.

The major challenge of obtaining a cryo-EM structure of nucleosome-SNF2h complex was in sample preparation. Without cross-linking, cryo-EM grid preparation is very unpredictable and we have not been able to consistently obtain suitable cryo-EM grids of nucleosomes bound with two SNF2h. From many trials in the past several years, we are convinced that the problem most likely arises from particles dissociating at the air-water interface specifically during cryo-EM grid preparation, as we can repeatedly and reproducibly observe nucleosomes with two SNF2h bound by negative stain EM, but not by cryo-EM. We are still trying, but unfortunately, we cannot produce a new structure within the time frame of this revision.</p><p>Regarding our interpretation, we respectfully disagree with reviewer’s comment. Indeed, 8.4Å is a relative low resolution and by itself the weaker density of one helix cannot be interpreted as implying more disorder. However, we compare the weaker density of one helix with the stronger density of its “symmetry” related helix within the same SNF2h-nucleosome complex. Because the “symmetry” related helix serves as an internal control and comparison, we propose the weaker density of the helix can be interpreted as implying disorder. Furthermore, our interpretation is also supported by biochemical and NMR results from our previous published studies (Sinha et al., 2017).</p><p>Nevertheless, we do recognize that the relative low-resolution of the reconstruction casts some uncertainty on our interpretation. Following the suggestions of the reviewers, we have modified the model in Figure 5, and we now describe the disordered state as speculative and as providing a starting point for understanding the structural basis of SNF2h mediated octamer fluctuations. Analogous changes have also been made in the main text (e.g. in the second paragraph of the Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The sub-division of the K2 data set is not clear: there is a separate path of image processing yielding a 3.4Å resolution map of the SNF2h bound at the -2 position, whereas a split of the same data set into +2 and -2 bound positions yield a 3.9Å and a 6.9Å map. Could it be that the 3.4Å map contains a mixture of the two states, and despite a higher resolution, the 3.4Å map is actually representing a (suboptimal) mixture? All particles contributing to the 6.9Å map should be removed from the 3.4Å map.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment from the reviewers.</p><p>We processed this dataset twice, independently. The first processing yielded a clear division into two subsets: 3.9Å and 6.9Å. After releasing an improved version of MotionCor2, we reprocessed the entire dataset in every step, from motion correction, particle picking, classification and refinement. This re-processing produced a map with improved resolution of 3.4Å. We did not attempt again to re-classify the second particle stack (re-picked from the same raw micrographs). Indeed, the 3.4Å reconstruction contains a mixture of two states, nucleosome with SNF2h bound at +2 and -2 positions.</p><p>In the revision, we performed a further 3D classification of the 3.4Å dataset into two classes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2): a clearly defined 3.6Å SHL-2 reconstruction from ~2/3 of the particles in the 3.4Å reconstruction and another 4.5Å reconstruction from remaining ~1/3 of the particles. The latter 4.5Å reconstruction likely still contains a mix of SHL+2 and SHL-2 that we were unable to separate further. The 3.6Å map very closely resembles the 3.4Å reconstruction, with no change in interpretation. In the revised manuscript, we have updated the figures, and revised the Materials and methods section to make this clear (subsection “Validation of 2 base-pair translocated nucleosome”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Several different datasets are used and different routes used to process these (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). These illustrate the difficulty in distinguishing between particles in which SNF2h is bound to one side of the nucleosome or the other. Subtraction of the density for SNF2h, alignment to linker DNA and back projection was required to distinguish between SNF2H is bound at superhelical location -2 and +2. (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). In the text it is stated that a similar process was used to orient doubly bound nucleosomes from the lower resolution dataset. However, this is not indicated in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). This should be clarified. Was this applied for the singly bound species at 70mM KCl? Why is there no SNF2H bound at SHL -2 at 70 mM KCl?</italic></p><p>We now clarified this procedure in Figure 2—figure supplement 2. For singly bound particles at 70mM KCl, the same procedure is applied and yielded only one reconstruction with SNF2h bound at SHL+2 position. Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility of having any particles with SNF2h bound at SHL-2 position included in the final reconstruction, such particles must be very few if any. We speculate that the absence of SHL-2 particles may be due to a weaker affinity of this protomer for the nucleosome in the 70mM KCl condition. The weaker affinity of SHL-2 compared to SHL+2 SNF2h could be the result of multiple aspects of the nucleosome substrate. This includes the absence of flanking DNA on the exit side of the nucleosome, which could be bound by the HSS of the SHL-2 protomer. Additionally, asymmetric dynamics in the H2A/H2B acidic patch, a surface that contributes to SNF2h binding at 70mM KCl (Gamarra et al. 2018, PMID: 29664398), could specifically destabilize binding by SHL-2 SNF2h. Further, recent studies by the Bowman lab (Levendosky et al. 2019, PMID: 31094676), suggest that the SHL-2 protomer uses the acidic patch on face A of the histone octamer to activate nucleosome sliding. This is the same surface that appears to be dynamic in our cryo-EM reconstructions. Consistent with this possibility, we observe a higher proportion of SHL-2 bound species in the 140mM KCl condition where we do not detect histone dynamics. The combination of these features may specifically weaken the interaction of the SHL-2 protomer with the nucleosome at 70mM KCl, resulting in its preferential disassociation from the nucleosome.</p><p><italic>The density for SNF2h at SHL+2 is lower resolution than that at SHL-2 this is interpreted as increased conformational flexibility. Is it possible that this instead arises because some of the particles included are singly bound on the SHL-2 side?</italic></p><p>Separation of singly and doubly bound particles is actually quite effective and straightforward. Therefore, we do not think the weaker density of one SNF2h is caused by including singly bound particles. While we are confident about this, we do agree that it is impossible to completely rule out such possibility. We revised the text as “This difference likely suggests that […]”.</p><p><italic>Presumably the 2 bp translocation is also observed in the 3.4Å structure?</italic></p><p>Yes, it is clearly there. The 3.9Å and 3.4Å, as well as 6.9Å densities, all contain the 2bp translocation-indicating density.</p><p><italic>In the Materials and methods, it is specified that the low salt sample contained 0.5mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> in addition to 70mM KCl. But in the &quot;higher salt&quot; sample [140mM KCl], there was no MgCl<sub>2</sub> added. In terms of chromatin compaction, 0.5mM of divalent cations would correspond to approximately 50mM of monovalent salt. Could the difference between the two datasets be related to Mg concentration rather than the amount of KCL?</italic></p><p>This was a typo on our part. We apologize for this oversight. Both the low and higher salt conditions contained the same amount of MgCl<sub>2</sub>. We have corrected this omission in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Since particles may dissociate during grid preparation, a gel shift EMSA analysis using gentle fixation would be more informative than 2D/3D classification to analyse stoichiometry.</italic></p><p>The reviewer raises a good point. Indeed we have previously carried out detailed studies of stoichiometry as described in (Racki et al. 2009, PMID: 20033039). In this paper we (i) measured the hill coefficient for activity and binding, which is close to 2, (ii) used EPR with spin labels on the histone H4 tail and found that both tails were bound implying two SNF2h subunits and (iii) visually assessed stoichiometry by negative stain EM, which clearly showed that a majority of SNF2h-nucleosome complexes contained two SNF2h molecules bound to a single nucleosome. In this current study we have reproduced our negative stain EM results from 2009 (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), giving confidence that the stoichiometry in solution is 2 SNF2h protomers bound to a single nucleosome.</p><p>However, as the reviewer suggests, some particles are clearly dissociating during cryo-EM grid preparation under the higher salt conditions as we do not observe doubly bound SNF2h particles. While cross-linking provides a way to stabilize the complex, our goal was to trap conformational changes in SNF2h and the nucleosome and we were worried that cross-linking would alter such states.</p><p><italic>The single molecule FRET experiments provide a useful alternate means of measurement to support the SNF2h dependent extension of linker DNA. Is it known which side of the nucleosome SNF2h is acting from in these experiments? This important to know whether it substantiates the DNA extension observed in the +2 or -2 structure.</italic></p><p>Substantial previous work using gaps and nicks in DNA (Schwanbeck et al. 2004 PMID: 15262970, Zofall et al. 2006 PMID: 16518397) has indicated that ATP-dependent movement of DNA from the exit site is catalyzed by the SNF2h motor bound at SHL+2. We therefore hypothesize that the movement observed in our single molecule experiments is also occurring from SNF2h with its ATPase bound at SHL+2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the ensemble FRET shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3 be affected by changes in the DNA trajectory rather than DNA translocation? The explanation for the rapid reduction in FRET on adding SNF2h and nucleotide is not clear. The single molecule experiments provide much stronger evidence for c2bp translocation, however, in this case the measurement at 70 mM KCl was not made. It would be good to add this.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the ensemble FRET could also be affected by changes in DNA trajectory. In terms of the rapid reduction in FRET upon adding SNF2h, we have previous shown that this is due to an environmental effect of SNF2h on the dye fluorescence (Racki et al. 2009 PMID: 20033039, Leonard and Narlikar 2014 PMID: 25684208). In these previous studies we showed nucleosomes that only contained a Cy3 label on the DNA exit site displayed an increase in Cy3 fluorescence upon SNF2h binding that was ATP-independent and could be used to obtain Kd values. We therefore interpret the rapid decrease in FRET in Figure 1 supplement 3 as arising from this environmental effect, which enhances Cy3 fluorescence. The decrease in FRET at later times we interpret as arising from a change in the location of the DNA with respect to the histone core. We have now clarified this reasoning in the revised manuscript and also now mention the possibility that DNA trajectory can contribute to the change in FRET (Section “A SNF2h-nucleosome complex with a translocated nucleosome”, Figure 1—figure supplement 3C-D legend).</p><p>In terms of carrying out smFRET experiments at 70 mM KCl, we agree these would be quite informative. However the technical challenges associated with these experiments makes them not feasible within the time-frame of the revision.</p><p><italic>&quot;During the course of this study, we collected two cryo-EM datasets using two different salt conditions for optimization of cryo-EM grid preparation.&quot; In terms of optimization of grid preparation, where there more than two conditions screened?</italic></p><p>We have repeatedly obtained negative stain EM images showing the majority of particles are nucleosomes with two SNF2h protomers bound. The biochemical conditions are well-optimized for creating doubly bound SNF2h-nucleosome complexes, but we were able to capture such conditions in cryo-EM only once. We have tried all available approaches in cryo-EM grid preparation. As mentioned above, chemical cross-linking can, in principle, preserve the doubly bound complexes but we avoided using this approach due to concerns that it may lock the structure in a conformation that may not be biologically relevant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Particles contributing to this reconstruction were aligned unambiguously using flanking DNA as a fiducial marker to break the pseudo symmetry (Figure2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A).” But given the low resolution/low SNR of this data set, this may not be true. There are in fact many views where the extra DNA is not visible.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comment, and removed the word “unambiguously”, recognizing that it is impossible to completely rule out any alignment error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;The density of the SNF2h bound at SHL+2 is weaker than that of SNF2h bound at SHL-2 (Figure2A, Figure 2—figure supplement 2A). This difference suggests that the SNF2h bound to the nucleosome at SHL+2 is conformationally more flexible.&quot; How can one exclude that instead of flexibility, the worse density of the second SNF2h is caused by incomplete dimer formation, i.e. partial occupancy of the SNF2h at the +2 position? (Again better resolution might help to distinguish between the two, see major point 1.)</p></disp-quote><p>As responded above, separating particles of singly or doubly bound SNF2h is rather efficient. Nevertheless, we do appreciate this comment and recognize the separation is not completely certain. In the revised manuscript, we add the word “likely” to reflect the fact that there is some, although small, uncertainty in our statement.</p><p><italic>&quot;DNA translocation was not detected in the EM reconstructions carried out under the 70 mM KCl conditions&quot; yet later it is stated &quot;Unlike the structures at 70 mM KCl, the structures obtained at 140 mM KCl show a higher proportion of singly bound SNF2h at SHL-2 compared to SHL+2. Yet all the nucleosomes show the 2 bp DNA translocation in the same direction.&quot; I don't understand this. What does &quot;all nucleosomes&quot; mean?
