Here, we demonstrate that regulated expression of cytosolic poly(A)-binding protein 1 (PABPC1) modulates protein synthetic capacity of the mammalian heart. We uncover a poly(A) tail-based regulatory mechanism that dynamically controls PABPC1 protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes and thereby titrates cellular translation in response to developmental and hypertrophic cues. Our findings identify PABPC1 as a direct regulator of cardiac hypertrophy and define a new paradigm of gene regulation in the heart, where controlled changes in poly(A) tail length influence mRNA translation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24139.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24139.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24139.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hundreds of thousands of different proteins are needed to build and maintain the cells in the human body. All proteins are produced when copies of genetic information in the form of molecules of messenger RNA (mRNAs) are translated by the ribosome. The rate at which proteins are made varies widely between different tissues and at different times. In particular, the adult heart has one of the lowest rates of protein production, though this rate can increase markedly during exercise and heart disease. The mechanisms that drive this kind of dynamic change in protein production remain unclear. A better understanding of this process would tell scientists more about how and why cells regulate the translation of mRNAs in general, and might uncover new ways for treating heart disease.</p><p>Molecules of mRNA are composed of smaller building blocks called nucleotides. All mature mRNAs in humans have a long stretch at one end that contains the nucleotide adenosine – commonly referred to as A for short – repeated 200 to 300 times. This sequence is called the poly(A) tail, and specific proteins can bind to this tail and determine the final fate of the mRNA, such as how efficiently it is translated. One such poly(A) binding protein, called PABPC1, is known to promote mRNA translation.</p><p>Now, Chorghade, Seimetz et al. examine how PABPC1 regulates protein production in mice and human cells. The experiments reveal that, before birth, ample amounts of PABPC1 are found in the heart, but that this protein is undetectable in the hearts of adults. Further experiments showed that the levels of the mRNA for PABPC1 in the heart are the same before birth and in adulthood. So why is the mRNA for PABPC1 translated inefficiently in adult hearts? In general, mRNAs with long tails tend to be translated more efficiently compared to those with short tails, and it turns out that the mRNA for PABPC1 has a substantially shorter poly(A) tail in the adult heart. This tail shortening limits the translation of this specific mRNA, which leads to reduced protein production.</p><p>Chorghade, Seimetz et al. also showed that the length of the poly(A) tail on the mRNA and the levels of the PABPC1 protein are restored in adult hearts during a condition known as hypertrophy. This state of hypertrophy can be triggered by exercise or heart disease and is marked by an increase in the size of individual heart cells and enhanced protein production. Finally, Chorghade, Seimetz et al. found that experimentally raising the levels of PABPC1 in adult hearts could, by itself, make the heart cells produce more protein and the heart grow more. Further studies will explore if other mRNAs in the heart also undergo similar changes and whether this is a general mechanism for controlling protein production.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24139.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24139.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>translation control</kwd><kwd>polyadenylation</kwd><kwd>cardiac hypertrophy</kwd><kwd>postnatal heart development</kwd><kwd>protein synthesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL126845</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kalsotra</surname><given-names>Auinash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI081710</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Conrad</surname><given-names>Nicholas K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111816</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32-GM070421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seimetz</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A poly(A) tail-based regulatory mechanism dynamically controls PABPC1 protein synthesis in cardiomyocytes and thereby titrates cellular translation in response to developmental and hypertrophic cues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cellular growth and function depend heavily on protein synthesis, which is often considered a constitutive activity for a cell. However, it is becoming clear that global protein synthesis rates are not always static, that they vary widely among cell types, and that these differences are necessary for normal tissue development and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buszczak et al., 2014</xref>). Particularly, the rate of protein synthesis in adult heart is one of the lowest amongst different tissues but increases markedly in response to stress and hypertrophic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garlick et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 1984</xref>).

Based on these central roles, PABPC1 is thought to be ubiquitously expressed and serve ‘house-keeping’ roles in protein synthesis.</p><p>Here, we report that PABPC1 protein expression is post-transcriptionally silenced in adult human and mouse hearts through shortening of its mRNA poly(A) tail, which results in reduced polysome association and translation of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> transcripts. The developmental silencing of PABPC1 is cardiomyocyte-specific and reversible. We show that <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail length and protein expression are restored during adult-onset cardiac hypertrophy stimulated by endurance exercise or heart disease. Furthermore, we demonstrate that PABPC1 re-expression and its interaction with eIF4G are necessary and sufficient to globally stimulate translation and physiologic growth of cardiomyocytes.

To further quantify global protein synthesis rates in vivo, we pulse-labeled wild-type neonates and adult mice with puromycin followed by immunoblotting using an anti-puromycin antibody (i.e. SUnSET assays) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goodman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmidt et al., 2009</xref>). We detected a robust decrease in puromycin-labeled peptides in adult versus neonatal hearts but not in liver tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Lower protein synthetic capacity of adult striated muscle compared to other tissues was first observed more than three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garlick et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lewis et al., 1984</xref>). Our data showing muscle-specific silencing of PABPC1 thus offers a plausible molecular basis for these historical observations. Low-level protein synthesis in the absence of PABPC1 could presumably result from alternative mRNA circularization mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bukhari et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) or translation of some mRNAs in a closed loop-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Archer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costello et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Next, we investigated the molecular mechanisms responsible for inefficient translation of PABPC1. It appears that suppressed PABPC1 translation in the adult heart is microRNA-independent, as we saw no change in PABPC1 protein or mRNA in tamoxifen-inducible, heart-specific adult <italic>dicer</italic> knockouts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), which are defective in microRNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kalsotra et al., 2010</xref>). We analyzed available RNA-sequencing data from neonatal and adult mouse cardiomyocytes and fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Giudice et al., 2014</xref>) and found no evidence for alternative splicing or a developmental change in <italic>Pabpc1</italic> 5’- or 3’- untranslated regions (UTRs) in either cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We reasoned that <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor(s) might bind to the sequence elements within <italic>Pabpc1</italic> UTRs to suppress its translation. To test this hypothesis, we constructed luciferase reporters fused to 5’-, 3’- or both mouse <italic>Pabpc1</italic> UTRs and transfected them into C2C12 myoblasts. C2C12 cells exhibit marked downregulation of endogenous PABPC1 protein (~10 fold) but not mRNA levels when differentiated into myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Amongst the different reporters, only <italic>Pabpc1</italic> 5’-UTR showed a modest (&lt;2-fold) decrease in luciferase (<italic>Rluc</italic>/<italic>Fluc</italic>) activity during myoblast-to-myotube differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Although PABPC1 binding to an A-rich element within its 5′-UTR could auto-regulate its translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Melo Neto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kini et al., 2016</xref>), the relatively mild effects of 5’-UTR in reporter assays along with decreasing PABPC1 protein levels during muscle development argue against auto-regulatory feedback as the primary mechanism inhibiting <italic>Pabpc1</italic> translation.</p><p>Besides UTRs, poly(A) tail length is another major determinant for protein synthesis; mRNAs containing longer tails being more stable and translated more efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eichhorn et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weill et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we tested whether <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNAs are deadenylated in the adult heart. Both RNaseH cleavage assay and qPCR of long- and short-tailed mRNAs (fractionated by affinity chromatography) demonstrated significant <italic>Pabpc1</italic> deadenylation in adult versus E18 hearts and in myotubes versus myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail length in E18 hearts was estimated to be ~150 nucleotides (nts), whereas it was reduced to ~20 nts in adult hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). <italic>Gapdh</italic> poly(A) tail length was measured as a control and showed no difference between E18 and adult hearts. Importantly, shortening of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail in the adult heart was cardiomyocyte-specific; and partly reversed after TAC or endurance exercise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail length was strongly correlated to its association with monosomes and polysomes. At P0, <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNAs were almost exclusively long-tailed and in polysomes, whereas adult <italic>Pabpc1</italic> fractionated majorly into short-tailed and monosome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). <italic>Gapdh</italic> poly(A) tail length remained unchanged and primarily associated with polysomes at both developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). We further explored if inhibition of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> translation could be due to nuclear retention of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> transcripts. Single-molecule RNA FISH, however, showed primarily cytoplasmic staining without any noticeable difference in <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA localization between myoblasts and myotubes indicating poly(A) tail status does not impact <italic>Pabpc1</italic> nucleo-cytoplasmic export in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these results provide compelling evidence that <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail length is dynamically regulated during cardiac development and hypertrophy, and that poly(A) tail shortening limits <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA translation in the adult heart.</p><p>Because PABPC1 is upregulated in hypertrophy, we tested whether it is required for stimulus-induced growth of cardiomyocytes. PABPC1-depleted neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes were viable but resistant to isoproterenol (Iso) or triiodothyronine (T3)-induced hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–I</xref>). Metabolic labeling of cardiomyocytes with an alkyne-modified glycine analog, L-homopropargylglycine (HPG), to measure newly synthesized proteins revealed that PABPC1 knockdown inhibited the normal surge in protein synthesis rate evoked by Iso or T3 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J,K</xref>). Furthermore, we found that PABPC1 deficiency blocked protein but not mRNA upregulation of the hypertrophic markers <italic>Acta1</italic>, <italic>Myh7</italic> and <italic>Anp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L,M</xref>) indicating that while new protein synthesis is impaired, the transcriptional response to hypertrophic stimuli is still functional in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sergeeva and Christoffels, 2013</xref>).

Intriguingly, despite having a short poly(A) tail, <italic>Pabpc1</italic> transcripts remain stable and are not completely deadenylated or degraded. This might be due to binding of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor(s), the presence of RNA structural element(s), or RNA modifications that act to stabilize <italic>Pabpc1</italic> in adult cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lewis et al., 2017</xref>). We further demonstrate that PABPC1 protein expression and poly(A) tail length are partially restored during adult-onset cardiac hypertrophy to activate new protein synthesis and physiologic growth of cardiomyocytes. PABPC1 was also shown to be both necessary and sufficient to drive cardiomyocyte hypertrophy. Thus, dynamic control of PABPC1 serves an adaptive role in stimulating a beneficial form of cardiac hypertrophy that may be physiologically advantageous to the failing or dilated myocardium.</p><p>Two genome-wide studies found a weak correlation between poly(A) tail lengths and translational efficiency of mRNAs in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Subtelny et al., 2014</xref>). While Subtelny et al. observed clear coupling between poly(A) tail length and translation at early developmental stages in <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebra fish, the association became less apparent in the adults. Thus, it is plausible that at steady states, poly(A) tail length is less critical for translation but becomes a determinant in certain tissue contexts, developmental stages, cell cycle regulation, daily rhythmic oscillations of protein synthesis, or cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Besse and Ephrussi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kojima et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, stronger relationships between poly(A) tail length and mRNA translatability may emerge under conditions where PABPC1 protein concentrations are limiting; our data from adult cardiomyocytes supports this hypothesis.</p><p>Taken together, our findings not only provide insight into the long-standing question of how the heart regulates protein synthesis during development and hypertrophy but also provide a new direction to explore therapeutic interventions. These results set the stage for elucidating the signaling cascades that regulate <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail length in cardiomyocytes, determining mechanistically how those dynamics are achieved, and probing the general roles for poly(A) tail length in translation control within the heart and other somatic tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animal models and human samples</title><p>Mouse PABPC1 cDNA containing an N-terminal FLAG-tag was expressed from a transgene with a TRE/minimal CMV promoter, a genomic fragment including α -MHC untranslated exons 2 and 3 with intron 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kistner et al., 1996</xref>), the <italic>Pabpc1</italic> ORF and the bovine growth hormone polyadenylation site and 3′ flanking genomic segment for proper mRNA 3′ end formation.

Protein complexes were separated using Glutathione-Magnetic beads by incubating for 2 hr at 4°C. For control, purified GST protein was incubated with His-eIF4GI<sub>(161-225 a.a)</sub>. Magnetic beads with the protein complex were washed with ice cold 1X PBS and directly boiled in 2X laemmli buffer before separating on 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The protein complexes were visualized using Coomassie stain.</p></sec><sec id="s3-14"><title>Poly(A)-RNA-binding assay</title><p>Poly(A)25 RNA (IDT) was radiolabeled at the 5’ end with 50 mCi γ−32P-ATP using T4 polynucleotide kinase (NEB). For filter binding assays, 1 fmol of <sup>32</sup>P-poly(A)25 was incubated with purified GST, GST-PABPC1, or GST-PABPC1mRRM2 in a final volume of 100 µL (Tris-HCl buffer (pH 8.0),70 mM KCl, 10% glycerol, 0.05% IGEPAL, 1 mM DTT, 100 ng/mL BSA supplemented with 0.4 unit/mL RNasin). The reaction was incubated at 40°C for 3 hr on a 96-well dot-blot (Minifold I; Schleicher &amp; Schuell Cat.10447900). A Hybond N+ nylon membrane was placed beneath a Amersham Hybond ECL Nitrocellulose Membrane and pre-equilibrated with 1X TBE. These membranes, used to capture Protein-RNA probe complexes and unbound RNA probes respectively, were further sandwiched in dot blot assembly. The incubated mixture was drawn through slowly by vacuum. Following incubation, membranes were separated, air dried, and measured by autoradiography for 6 hr. After 6 hr, the dots from membranes were cut out and corresponding radiation was quantified using a scintillation counter.</p></sec><sec id="s3-15"><title>Co-immunoprecipitation assay</title><p>C2C12 cells were expanded according to previously described methods. In brief, cells were thawed from a low passage number and expanded by splitting before 40% confluency. At 95–100% confluency, cells were infected with AdPABPC1, AdPABPC1<sub>mRRM2</sub>, or AdGFP virus at 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> o.p.u and incubated for 4 days. After 4 days, the cells were washed with PBS and lysed on ice in lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, 10% glycerol, 1% Triton X-100, 5 mM dithiothreitol) supplemented with complete EDTA free protease inhibitor (Sigma-Aldrich, P0044) and phosphatase inhibitor (Thermo Scientific, 88666). Of cell lysate, 1–5 mg was incubated with 50% slurry of 200 μL of anti-Flag magnetic beads (Sigma-Aldrich, M8823) in each IP reaction and incubated at 4°C for 6 hr. After washing, the proteins were separated by 8% SDS-PAGE, transferred to PVDF membranes, and detected with anti-eIF4G1 antibody (#2617, Cell Signaling Technology).</p></sec><sec id="s3-16"><title>Adenovirus design and use</title><p>Adenovirus was produced using the methodology as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhate et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, ORF encoding FLAG-tagged PABPC1 and PABPC1mRRM2 were cloned into the p-Adeno-X-ZsGreen1 vector (Clonetech, 632267) using the In-Fusion kit (Clonetech, 639646) as per the manufacturer’s instructions. High-titer adenoviruses were generated by transfecting Ad-293 cells (~70% confluent) in T-25 flasks with linearized recombinant adenoviral plasmid using Mirus TransIT-2020 reagent. Virus was harvested once a cytopathic effect was observed. Next, two viral amplification steps were performed and the viral particles were purified using a CsCl gradient accurding to the Adeno-X Adenoviral System 3 user manual. After purification of viral particles, the titer was determined by ultraviolet spectrophotometry at 260 nm. Neonatal cardiomyocytes cultured in NW media were transfected with siRNA target the 3’UTR of endogenous <italic>Pabpc1</italic>. After 6 hr, the cardiomyocytes were infected with 5 × 10<sup>9</sup> o.p.u. of Ad-PABPC1, Ad-PABPC1<sub>mRRM2</sub>, or Ad-GFP adenovirus. Cells were washed and treated with 20 nM Isoproterenol following a 12 hr incubation with virus. After 36 hr of Isoproterenol treatment, cells were collected to harvest protein and RNA for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-17"><title>Protein synthesis rate, Click chemistry</title><p>Protein synthesis was measured using the L-homopropargylglycine (HPG) Click-iT (ThermoFisher, C10428) metabolic labeling reagents according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Briefly, cultured neonatal cardiomyocytes were washed twice with warmed PBS and incubated in methionine-free DMEM supplemented with Iso or T3 for 1 hr. The medium was replaced with methionine-free DMEM to which 50 μM of the methionine analog HPG was added. Cells were again treated with same concentration of Iso or T3 and incubated for 60 min for incorporation of the AHA into nascent proteins with or without Iso/T3. After incubation, the dishes were rinsed twice. Newly synthesized proteins labeled with Click-iT HPG were conjugated with the carboxytetramethylrhodamine alkyne (TAMARA) using the Click-iT TAMRA Protein Analysis Kit (Cat. no. C33370). Protein samples were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and was visualized using 532 nm excitation. The gel was subsequently stained with Coomassie blue for normalization.</p></sec><sec id="s3-18"><title>RNA-FISH</title><p>To determine the cellular location of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA, we performed RNA-FISH on undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells using the Stellaris RNA-FISH kit (Biosearch Technologies). In brief, 48 fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes targeting <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA were designed using the custom Stellaris Probe Designer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Undifferentiated and differentiated C2C12 cells were fixed in a 3.7% formaldehyde buffer in 1X PBS. The cells were then permeabilized using 70% ethanol for 48 hr at 4°C. All subsequent steps were performed in the dark to minimize loss of fluorescent signal. Hybridization with the probes was performed by washing the cells with Stellaris Wash Buffer A before incubating overnight at 37°C with hybridization buffer containing the probe set or hybridization buffer only as a negative control. Cells were then washed for 1 hr with Wash Buffer A before incubating with NucBlue (ThermoFisher Scientific) nuclear stain for 5 min. After incubation with DAPI, cells were washed in Wash Buffer B for 5 min and mounted with CC/Mount (Sigma-Aldrich). Images were obtained using a Zeiss LSM 700.</p></sec><sec id="s3-19"><title>RNAse H digestion and northern blotting</title><p>To assess the <italic>Pabpc1</italic> poly(A) tail lengths by northern blot, we mixed total RNA with 0.5 μM DNA oligonucleotides that hybridize to PABPC1 or GAPDH in 15 μL. Where indicated, oligo-dT40 was also included at 0.5 μM. After incubation at 65° for 5 min and chilling on ice, the following components were added to the reaction in 30 μL total volume: 1X RNase H buffer (Promega), 10 mM DTT, 15 ng/μL poly(A) (Sigma), 20 U RNasin (Promega), and 1 U RNase H. The reaction proceeded at 37° for 2 hr and was stopped by addition of 270 μL of G-50 buffer (0.25% SDS, 0.3 M NaOAc, 20 mM Tris pH 6.8, and 2 mM EDTA). RNA was isolated by standard phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. Northern blots were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bresson and Conrad, 2013</xref>). RNA probes were generated by incorporation of <sup>32</sup>P-UTP into in vitro transcribed RNAs using T7 templates generated by PCR.</p></sec><sec id="s3-20"><title>Poly(A) tail fractionation</title><p>This protocol was based on one previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kojima et al., 2015</xref>). Herein, a 1X SSC solution contains 150 mM NaCl and 15 mM sodium citrate at pH 7.0. Briefly, 100 μL of GTC buffer (4M guanidine thiocyanate, 25 mM sodium citrate, pH 7.1) was mixed with ~5–15 μg RNA, 2 μL β-mercaptoethanol, and 3.75 μL of 50 μM biotinylated oligo dT (Promega) in a final volume of ~115 uL. To this mixture, 209 μL of dilution buffer (3X SSC, 5 mM TrisHCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 0.125% SDS, 5% β-mercaptoethanol) was added. The samples were heated to 70°C for 5 min and centrifuged at 12,000 x g at room temperature. The supernatant was then mixed with MagneSphere Streptavidin paramagnetic particles (Promega; 150 μL of manufacturer’s slurry) that had been washed three times with 0.5X SSC and Igepal-CA-630 was added to 0.1%. The RNA and dT and bead solution was allowed to bind for 15 min at 25°C while rotating and subsequently washed three times with 0.5X SSC containing 0.1% Igepal-CA-630. Elutions were performed by incubation of the beads in 400 μL SSC at the indicated concentration plus 0.1% Igepal-CA-630 for 5 min at 25°C. RNA was isolated by standard phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) extraction followed by ethanol precipitation. RNase T1 treatment and poly(A) tail northern blots were performed as previously described<sup>10</sup>. After standardization the elution conditions were then used on 2.5 μg of total RNA from heart tissue. In order to elute short poly(A) tailed mRNA [Poly(A)&lt;30], we used elution buffer containing 0.075X SSC while for eluting long polyA mRNA [poly(A)&gt;30] we used nuclease-free water. Eluted sample was purified and used for cDNA synthesis and downstream qPCR analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-21"><title>Statistics</title><p>All quantitative experiments (for example, qPCR, Western blots, cell areas and counts) have at least three independent biological repeats.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Poly(A) tail length regulates PABPC1 expression and tunes translation in the heart&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Nahum Sonenberg (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors show that PABPC1 expression in the heart (cardiomyocytes) is regulated to support active translation during development and down-regulated to match the significantly reduced rate of translation observed in adult heart. The down-regulation of PABPC1 expression appears to be related to altered poly(A) status of the <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA. The authors further reveal that PABPC1 expression is reestablished during exercise-induced hypertrophy to support the translation required for cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and that, in a model of chronic adult PABPC1 expression, that this adult PABPC1 expression does not appear to have obviously deleterious consequences.</p><p>The paper is of great interest to the readers in the fields of translational control and cardiology. In general, this is a high-quality study that reveals a previously unknown physiological role for PABPC1 and is therefore of significant interest. The data is generally of high quality and the interpretation is reasonable.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors state that they uncovered a poly(A)-based regulatory mechanism. There is a change in poly(A) tail length of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA, but data supporting a mechanistic role for this is missing. The questions that need to be answered are: What is the poly(A) tail status of the reporter mRNAs in C2C12 cells? What is the poly(A) status of <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA in the different fractions across the gradient in E18 and adult heart? Is there a correlation between polysome association and poly(A) tail length, does poly(A) tail length drive polysome association or does it protect/enhance deadenylation? It needs to be clear whether changes in poly(A) tail length are a cause, effect or bystander. The experiment in RRL is not informative and should be deleted.</p><p>2) Polysome profiles should be provided for the PABPC1 overexpression in mouse heart experiment to establish that this does indeed result in a change in translational utilization of mRNAs as posited.</p><p>3) Delete <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> – [or provide validation for the antibody]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> – <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA levels should not be plotted on a log scale – which masks any changes between fetal and adult heart.

This is an interesting experiment, but somewhat artificial because our reporters contain strong heterologous polyadenylation elements as part of the plasmid backbone. Instead, we measured the poly(A) tail status of endogenous <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNAs in C2C12 cells. The poly(A) tail length data obtained were consistent with reduced PABPC1 protein levels seen during myoblast-to-myotube differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>) such that <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNAs were significantly deadenylated in myotubes when compared to myoblasts. These new data are added to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>.</p><p><italic>What is the poly(A) status of PABPC1 mRNA in the different fractions across the gradient in E18 and adult heart?

An additional experiment measuring <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA levels in short and long poly(A) tail fractions from polysome gradients has been added. In the neonatal heart, <italic>Pabpc1</italic> has long poly(A) tail length and associates exclusively with polysomes, whereas in the adult heart most <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNAs are short-tailed and associate with monosome and RNP fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Poly(A) tail length of <italic>Gapdh</italic> mRNAs remain unchanged and primarily associate with polysomes at both developmental stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Thus, these results point towards a causal effect of poly(A) shortening in suppressing <italic>Pabpc1</italic> translation in the adult heart.</p><p><italic>The experiment in RRL is not informative and should be deleted.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have removed the RRL in vitro translation data from the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Polysome profiles should be provided for the PABPC1 overexpression in mouse heart experiment to establish that this does indeed result in a change in translational utilization of mRNAs as posited.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to demonstrate the effect of PABPC1 re-expression on translation. However, we feel that polysome profiles are, by nature, qualitative and believe that our in vivo experiment utilizing the SUnSET method in PABPC1 re-expressing mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>) is not only quantitative, but also more informative regarding the impact of PABPC1 on global translation in the heart. The SUnSET assay has become widely accepted in the field to measure protein synthesis and has been previously demonstrated to match polysome traces (Genes Dev. (2016) 30:1-6; Nat Commun (2016) 11776; FASEB J (2017) 30; 2: 798-812).</p><p><italic>3) Delete <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> – [or provide validation for the antibody].</italic> </p><p>Anti-PABPC1 antibody (Abcam ab21060) used in the Human protein atlas database (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000070756-PABPC1/antibody">http://www.proteinatlas.org/ENSG00000070756-PABPC1/antibody</ext-link>) has been previously validated to specifically cross-react with human PABPC1. siRNA-based validation of this antibody is available in J Virol. 2013 Jan;87(1):243-56.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref> – PABPC1 mRNA levels should not be plotted on a log scale – which masks any changes between fetal and adult heart.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this point.

These lines of investigations are logical extensions of our work, which we will be entertaining and testing in the future but they fall outside the scope of this current study.</p><p><italic>5) Results and Discussion, seventh paragraph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and Figure S3—figure supplement 2A. Although PABPC1 plays an important role in mRNA stability in addition to translation, there are increased levels of Acta1, Myh7 and Anp mRNAs in PabpC1-knockown (KD) cells. Why are these mRNAs so stable in the absence of PABPC1?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this important point. As has been previously reported, we believe that increased mRNA abundance of <italic>Acta1, Myh7</italic> and <italic>Anp</italic> in cardiomyocytes after Isoproterenol or T3 stimulation is due to increased transcription of these hypertrophy markers (J Clin Invest. (2008) 118(1): 124-132; Biochim Biophys Acta. (2013) 1832 (12): 2403-13). However, as the reviewer pointed out, it is interesting to note that the increased mRNA abundance of <italic>Acta1, Myh7</italic> and <italic>Anp</italic> is maintained even in PABPC1 depleted cells after Iso or T3 stimulation. These results imply that PABPC1 knockdown does not (i) interfere with the transcriptional regulatory circuits; and/or (ii) have a major impact on the mRNA stability of these genes. We have added this discussion to the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>6) Results and Discussion, in the conclusion, the authors need to address the question as to why is the Pabpc1 mRNA harboring a short poly(A) tail stable in mature cardiomyocytes in the absence of PABPC1?</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. It is indeed interesting that in spite of harboring short poly(A) tails, <italic>Pabpc1</italic> mRNA is stable in mature cardiomyocytes. This stabilization could be imparted through binding of <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor(s), due to the presence of RNA structural element(s), or RNA modifications that may inhibit further recruitment/activity of deadenylases. We have mentioned these possibilities now in the Discussion section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
