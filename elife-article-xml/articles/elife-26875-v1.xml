evolutionary dynamics that transform within-host variation to global genetic diversity are poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that influenza evolution within infected humans recapitulates many evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale. We deep-sequence longitudinal samples from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections. We find parallel evolution across three scales: within individual patients, in different patients in our study, and in the global influenza population. In hemagglutinin, a small set of mutations arises independently in multiple patients. These same mutations emerge repeatedly within single patients and compete with one another, providing a vivid clinical example of clonal interference. Many of these recurrent within-host mutations also reach a high global frequency in the decade following the patient infections. Our results demonstrate surprising concordance in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26875.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26875.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26875.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza or flu viruses change fast to escape the body’s defenses. While a single course of vaccines will protect someone against polio or measles for their whole life, people need a new flu shot every year to be protected against influenza. Also, some years the flu vaccine is not as effective as hoped because the virus has changed in an unpredictable way.</p><p>All of the change that happens in flu viruses around the world ultimately begins in individual infections, as random mistakes or mutations in the virus’s genetic material that arise as the viruses replicate. Mutations that help the virus aid in its ability to spread from person to person, and eventually spread around the world. As such, understanding flu’s evolution within individual people may help scientists to understand and eventually predict how it changes worldwide. Yet, unlike some viral infections that last months or years, flu infections are usually short and over in a few days. This makes it harder to measure how the viruses change over time in a single infection.</p><p>To get around this issue, Xue et al. analyzed flu samples taken over several weeks from four cancer patients who had longer-than-average flu infections because of their weaker immune systems. In some cases, the exact same mutations were seen in viruses from two or more of the patients. Also, some of the mutations that happened within the patients were the same mutations that later went on to spread around the world. These findings show that the flu virus can change in a single person in some of the same ways that it has been seen to change around the world.</p><p>Xue et al. studied how flu changes in people with weak immune systems, who are infected for longer periods of time. Further studies are needed to reveal more about how flu viruses evolve in the more typical, shorter infections in otherwise healthy people. This kind of investigation is becoming easier because new methods are making it possible to examine the genetic material from many viruses at once. It is hoped that eventually, detecting mutations in individual infections could help predict how viruses will change worldwide, which might help researchers to design vaccines that will be more effective each year.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26875.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26875.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

as they replicate within infected hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andino and Domingo, 2015</xref>), but only a small fraction of these variants transmit between hosts and eventually fix on a global scale. Within hosts, a mutation’s impact on viral replication and immunogenicity affect whether it increases in frequency. At larger scales of space and time, transmission bottlenecks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Varble et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poon et al., 2016</xref>) and host heterogeneity also shape viral genetic diversity. The selective pressures at these various scales reflect complex molecular, immunological, and epidemiological constraints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grenfell et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pybus and Rambaut, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher et al., 2016</xref>), which have formed the basis of recent efforts to forecast influenza evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Luksza and Lässig, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neher et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Neher et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lässig et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Influenza’s rapid global evolution has been the subject of intense study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ghedin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>), but the origins of this variation within single infected hosts are still poorly understood. Recent deep-sequencing studies of human clinical samples suggest that influenza accumulates relatively limited genetic diversity within hosts during most acute infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dinis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sobel Leonard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>), in line with earlier studies in dogs and horses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murcia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoelzer et al., 2010</xref>). Some within-host mutations may confer novel antigenic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dinis et al., 2016</xref>), but most lack clear functional interpretation. Altogether, it remains unclear how influenza’s within-host diversity is transformed into global evolution.</p><p>Influenza infections usually last less than a week and provide limited opportunity for longitudinal study. But among some immunocompromised patients, infections can last weeks or months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nichols et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Memoli et al., 2014</xref>), making it possible to examine longer-term within-host evolutionary dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rocha et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMinn et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rogers et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we use deep-sequencing to characterize the evolutionary dynamics of influenza within immunocompromised hosts. We identify a small set of mutations that arise repeatedly within individual patients, across multiple patients in our study, and at the global scale, revealing surprising similarities in evolutionary dynamics across multiple spatiotemporal scales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The same mutations often arise in multiple patients</title><p>We deep-sequenced 37 viral samples collected longitudinally from four immunocompromised patients with long-term H3N2 influenza infections in the 2005–2006 and 2006–2007 seasons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

In particular, four of the five sites of recurrent within-host mutation in HA are also sites of global influenza variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). The V223I and N225D mutations arise in multiple patients, and then fix globally in the decade after the patient infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Mutations also reach high global frequencies at sites 138 and 193, although the F193 and S193 variants that spread globally differ from the Y193 variant that arises within our patients. However, the concordance is incomplete. Mutation L427F reaches a frequency of &gt;75% in three patients but is rare or nonexistent in influenza globally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), suggesting that this mutation may have within-host benefits that are not reflected in global evolution. But overall across hemagglutinin, within-host variants tend to arise at sites that vary on the global scale.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is remarkable that influenza evolution shows such extensive parallelism at these disparate spatiotemporal scales despite heterogeneity in host immunity, viral genetic background, and the severity and duration of infection. In particular, the immunocompromised patients in our study had complex underlying conditions and diverse immune histories. Notably, the four HA sites that displayed parallel within-host and global evolution in our study (138, 193, 223, and 225) also gave rise to mutations in another study that used Sanger sequencing to analyze laboratory-passaged influenza isolated longitudinally from an immunocompromised child (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baz et al., 2006</xref>). Another previous study used hemagglutination inhibition assays to show that antigenic drift of influenza within an immunocompromised patient resembled global antigenic change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMinn et al., 1999</xref>). These similarities further support our finding that influenza evolution shows parallelism across diverse patients.</p><p>The parallel evolution that we observe in influenza at the within-host and global scales contrasts with HIV, where similar mutations can arise within hosts that share an HLA type, but tend to revert upon transmission to recipients with different HLA types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Leslie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Herbeck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lemey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zanini et al., 2015</xref>). Part of the difference may be that immune epitopes in influenza are broadly similar among individuals, with some exceptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Linderman et al., 2014</xref>), whereas the targets of anti-HIV immunity vary more widely due to patient-specific factors like HLA type.</p><p>We suggest that parallelism in HA evolution may emerge from the confluence of several evolutionary conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lässig et al., 2017</xref>). First, if selection acts concordantly across environments, it will favor a common set of beneficial mutations. Second, in a constrained evolutionary landscape, this set of beneficial mutations will be relatively small. Finally, given sufficiently large population sizes, high mutation rates, and time, these beneficial mutations will emerge and be selected to detectable frequencies. Our observation that similar mutations arise repeatedly within single patients, within multiple different patients, and at the global scale, suggests that at least some of these conditions may hold true.</p><p>The parallelism and extensive evolution that we observe in long-term influenza infections contrasts with the limited within-host variation found in prior studies, which sample from acute infections of immunocompetent hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Murcia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hoelzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dinis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Debbink et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sobel Leonard et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Poon et al., 2016</xref>). For instance, one recent study deep-sequenced HA from several hundred patients but only found a small number of antigenic variants, and mostly at low frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dinis et al., 2016</xref>). But our study suggests that influenza may experience many of the same selective pressures within acute infections as it does globally, even if the short durations of these infections make it difficult for selected mutations to reach frequencies that are detectable with current methods. We suggest that within-host viral diversity may act as a noisy early measurement of global viral evolution, shaped by some of the same immunological and evolutionary constraints. As high-throughput sequencing continues to improve, detailed characterization of within-host variation will be increasingly valuable for understanding how molecular, immunological, and epidemiological forces interact to shape viral evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient material</title><p>Samples were prospectively collected during a surveillance study for respiratory viruses performed in allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HCT) recipients undergoing transplantation between December 2005 and February 2010 at Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>). Following written informed consent, weekly nasal wash samples (or nasopharyngeal swabs if nasal wash samples were precluded clinically) and oropharyngeal swab specimens were obtained at least once before and weekly after HCT up to 100 days. Afterwards, samples were collected as long as the patients continued to test positive for respiratory viruses, if they developed new symptoms, or at least every three months until one year post-transplantation. Nasal wash samples were collected using 5 mL of saline per nostril, and combined with oropharyngeal swabs for real-time PCR testing for a panel of 12 respiratory viruses, including influenza A and B. Samples were considered positive if the assay’s cycle threshold was less than 40, for a limit of detection of approximately 2000 viral copies/mL.

We began with a simple null model in which all sites are equally likely to mutate, and we drew sites from each gene at random without replacement, matching the number of mutations observed in each patient. We calculated the number of unique sites of mutation among all four patients in this simulated data set, and we compared this distribution to the number of unique sites observed in our sequencing data: fewer unique sites of mutation indicates more parallelism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>). This null model is overly simplistic, since some sites in a protein experience more evolutionary constraint. To estimate this constraint, we limited the number of sites considered mutable to the sites that show at least two instances of nonsynonymous mutation in the global H3N2 population between 2000 and 2015 (see Analysis of Global Variation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B</xref>). The p-values given in the main text are calculated under this more conservative null model.

We then calculated the overlap between these two sets of sites.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom, Richard A Neher (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that you present a high-quality data set that quantifies and tracks within host evolution of influenza A virus at unprecedented detail. Similar variants are observed in viral populations in different immuno-compromised individuals and the variable sites have unexpected overlap with polymorphic sites in the global epidemic. This raises the possibility that mutation observed within host can inform predictions of influenza strains dominating future seasons. These are important observations.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>However, before we can recommend your manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, we would like you to address the following points.</p><p>1) Be careful and explicit about what can be concluded from the observed parallelism of mutations. The statement &quot;Influenza evolution within single infected hosts acts as a microcosm of viral evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale&quot; overstates the degree to which global influenza evolution is predicted by within host patterns. In our interpretation, your data suggest that mutations observed within host in HA are enriched for mutations that are polymorphic later in the global epidemic. Beyond that, quite some uncertainty remains. Fixation within host does not imply fixation globally (site 138), and a site observed transiently within host (site 223) might fix globally. The statement that &quot;most&quot; recurrent mutations have the same within host/global dynamics (subsection “Within-host evolution often parallels global evolutionary dynamics”, last paragraph) is not supported by your data and this needs to be toned down. The degree of parallelism is remarkable, but you should be careful not to overstate it.</p><p>2) You use sequences from GISAID. Hence you need to provide a table acknowledging the GISAID contributors (or use only public domain sequences).</p><p>3) Thank you for providing the analysis code. It would be useful to if you could check this code into a git repo (e.g. on github) that <italic>eLife</italic> can then clone. A top-level README that explains the content of the different folders and its relation to the paper would also help.</p><p>4) Please extend the discussion of the statistical tests for parallelism in the main text (subsection “Within-host evolution often parallels global evolutionary dynamics”, first paragraph) to give the reader a better idea of what is being tested. Please also discuss the fact that significant enrichment is only observed when at least half of all amino acids in HA are assumed mutable.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26875.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>However, before we can recommend your manuscript for publication in eLife, we would like you to address the following points.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Be careful and explicit about what can be concluded from the observed parallelism of mutations.

We have revised our original impact statement from &quot;Influenza evolution within single infected hosts acts as a microcosm of viral evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale” to “Influenza evolution within infected hosts recapitulates many evolutionary dynamics observed at the global scale,” a more specific statement from our Abstract.</p><p>In the Results section, we have changed one of the section titles to state that “Within-host variants frequently arise at sites that are polymorphic in influenza globally.” We have also removed the statement that “within-host evolution can sometimes be a microcosm of global evolution” in favor of more specific language about the fixation (or lack thereof) of the specific mutations that the reviewers point out. We also specifically highlight certain differences at the within- and between-host scales like the mutation Y193, which arises at a globally variable site but is never itself observed on at a global scale.</p><p><italic>2) You use sequences from GISAID.
