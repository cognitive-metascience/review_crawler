are translated. In addition, ~35% of mRNA coding genes are translated upstream of the primary protein-coding region (uORFs) and 4% are translated downstream (dORFs). Translated lncRNAs preferentially localize in the cytoplasm, whereas untranslated lncRNAs preferentially localize in the nucleus. The translation efficiency of cytoplasmic lncRNAs is nearly comparable to that of mRNAs, suggesting that cytoplasmic lncRNAs are engaged by the ribosome and translated. While most peptides generated from lncRNAs may be highly unstable byproducts without function, ~9% of the peptides are conserved in ORFs in mouse transcripts, as are 74% of pseudogene peptides, 24% of uORF peptides and 32% of dORF peptides. Analyses of synonymous and nonsynonymous substitution rates of these conserved peptides show that some are under stabilizing selection, suggesting potential functional importance.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08890.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08890.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08890.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our genes encode the instructions needed to make proteins. When a gene is switched on, it’s DNA is used as a template to make molecules of messenger ribonucleic acid (RNA). These RNAs are then “translated” into proteins by large cell machines called ribosomes. Within the messenger RNA, a long region called an “open reading frame” is the section that encodes the protein.</p><p>The human genome also contains a vast amount of DNA that is not part of any gene. Cells can produce molecules of RNA from this DNA (so-called “non-coding RNAs”), but these RNAs are not thought to code for proteins because they lack long open reading frames. Non-coding RNAs can also be made from sections of DNA called “pseudogenes”, which have lost their ability to code for proteins over the course of evolution. Furthermore, messenger RNAs also contain short open reading frames in the “untranslated” regions that flank the protein-coding region.</p><p>The extent to which cells translate non-coding RNAs to produce small proteins (or peptides) is not known. “Ribosome profiling” is a powerful method to determine which RNAs are translated, but it is not always possible to distinguish between the RNAs that are genuinely translated and those that just happen to be bound to ribosomes. Ji et al. overcome these limitations by developing a new computational method to analyse data from ribosome profiling.</p><p>The experiments show that thousands of non-coding RNAs in the human genome are, in fact, translated. This is many more than anticipated and represents approximately 40% of the lncRNAs and pseudogene RNAs, and 35% of untranslated regions in messenger RNAs. Ji et al. also found that a small group of all the lncRNA peptides in the human genome appear to have changed little over the course of evolution, which strongly suggests that they have specific roles in cells. The next challenge is to find out what roles the peptides encoded by these lncRNAs play in cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08890.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08890.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>non-coding RNA</kwd><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>ribosome profiling</kwd><kwd>5'UTR</kwd><kwd>pseudogene</kwd><kwd>biological function</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA 107486</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ji</surname><given-names>Zhe</given-names></name><name><surname>Song</surname><given-names>Ruisheng</given-names></name><name><surname>Struhl</surname><given-names>Kevin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Regev</surname><given-names>Aviv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Thousands of &quot;noncoding&quot; RNAs, 5' &quot;untranslated&quot; regions, and pseudogenes in humans are actually translated, and some of these are likely to express functional proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the central dogma, mRNAs are translated into proteins that carry out biological functions. On a genomic scale, translated regions are identified as open reading frames (ORFs) that are longer (typically &gt;100 amino acids) than expected by chance, given sequence composition. In addition to mRNAs, mammalian cells contain other RNA transcripts generated by RNA polymerase II that are polyadenylated, spliced, and capped, but may not code for protein. One category consists of thousands of long RNAs that lack long open reading frames and have been considered to be non-coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Guttman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabili et al., 2011</xref>). A few lncRNAs play key regulatory roles in various biological processes via functional RNA domains that regulate chromatin modifications, DNA transcription, mRNA stability, and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rinn and Chang, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batista and Chang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>). However, the biological functions of most lncRNAs remain unknown.</p><p>The human genome also encodes thousands of pseudogenes, which are homologous to protein-coding genes but have lost their coding ability and/or are not expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vanin, 1985</xref>). Pseudogenes can function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) regulating other RNA transcripts by competing for microRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salmena et al., 2011</xref>). Some pseudogenes are differentially expressed in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kalyana-Sundaram et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Han et al., 2014</xref>), but it is unknown if the RNAs expressed from pseudogenes are translated or have biological functions.</p><p>By definition, noncoding RNAs should not be translated into protein, but this can be difficult to ascertain using informatics alone because they contain short open reading frames that could be potentially translated. Even if a peptide is expressed from a putative non-coding RNA, it is difficult to determine whether the peptide has a biological function or is a mere by-product of an RNA that performs the biological function. However, there are a few examples of lncRNAs that are in fact translated into short peptides with biological roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galindo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In addition, a number of mammalian mRNAs contain so-called 5’ untranslated regions (5’UTRs) with one or more ORFs upstream of their canonical protein-coding regions (uORFs). Due to the scanning mechanism for translational initiation in which ribosomes scan in a 5’ to 3’ direction from the mRNA cap to find an initiation codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sonenberg and Hinnebusch, 2009</xref>), uORFs have the potential to regulate translation of the primary protein-coding ORF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calvo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2013</xref>). For example, translation of the uORFs in the yeast <italic>GCN4</italic> gene strongly inhibits translation of Gcn4 under normal conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). However, during amino acid starvation, ribosomes reinitiate translation at the canonical AUG codon, thereby permitting increased synthesis of Gcn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>). In human cells, bioinformatic analyses and limited functional testing indicate that uORFs can inhibit protein production, but genome-wide functional analysis has yet to be performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calvo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barbosa et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Ribosome profiling, the sequencing of ribosome-associated RNAs, represents a powerful assay for assessing translation in vivo in an unbiased manner on a genome-wide scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ingolia et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingolia, 2014</xref>). In particular, ribosome profiling in mammalian cells reveals many reads derived from lncRNAs and 5’ UTRs, and lncRNAs and 5’UTRs can be co-purified with 80S ribosome, indicating that these transcripts are translated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">2014</xref>). However, unlike canonical protein coding-genes translated from mRNAs, many lncRNAs do not have a predominant ORF based on the ribosome release or disengagement scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chew et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guttman et al., 2013</xref>). However, due to a variety of limitations, previous analyses typically did not explicitly identify in-frame translated ORFs, and they identified only several hundred translated regions that do not correspond to canonical protein-coding regions. Importantly, ribosome profiling reads do not necessarily represent its active translation, due to potential artifacts from non-ribosomal entities and scanning ribosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guttman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Systematic examination of translation requires a computational method to identify <italic>bona fide</italic> translated ORFs in an unbiased fashion. Here we develop a method, RibORF, to analyze ribosomal profiling data and identify translated ORFs that combines alignment of ribosomal A-sites, 3-nt periodicity, and uniformity across codons. RibORF can effectively distinguish in-frame ORFs from overlapping off-frame ORFs, and it can distinguish reads arising from RNAs that are not associated with ribosomes. Using RibORF, we identify thousands of translated ORFs in lncRNAs, pseudogenes, and mRNA regions upstream (5’UTRs) and downstream (3’UTRs) of protein-coding sequences. Our results suggest that cytoplasmic noncoding RNAs are translated, and that some of these translated products are likely to be biologically meaningful based on their evolutionary conservation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ribosome profiling experiment reveals in vivo translation in single nucleotide resolution</title><p>We performed ribosome profiling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) in two isogenic human cancer cell models: a Src-inducible mammary epithelial model and a Ras-dependent fibroblast model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirsch et al., 2010</xref>). Cells were treated either with cycloheximide, which inhibits translational elongation of ribosomes throughout the mRNA coding region, or harringtonine, which traps the ribosome at the site of translational initiation. After removing reads aligned to rRNAs and multiple genomic locations, we generated 44.0 and 21.2 million unique mappable reads upon cycloheximide treatment for breast epithelial and fibroblast cell transformation models, respectively.

Notably, RPFs with different length have variable distances between the 5’ end and the ribosome A-site, as defined by canonical ORFs in protein-coding genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We used these offset distances in known protein-coding genes to account for the read length distribution and thereby align RPFs to specific A-site nucleotides throughout the entire dataset. Most expressed protein-coding ORFs show a clear 3-nt periodicity corresponding to <italic>codon</italic> triplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The 1<sup>st</sup> nucleotides of codons in an ORF contain about 65% of reads, while the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> have 24% and 11%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In addition, reads in protein-coding genes are uniformly distributed across codons in an ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). 73% of ribosome profiling reads map to canonical ORFs of mRNAs. 2% and 4% map to 5’UTRs and 3’UTRs of mRNAs, respectively, and 9% map to lncRNAs and pseudogenes, suggesting pervasive non-canonical translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Removing sequence reads that are not derived from translated RNA</title><p>Consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guttman et al., 2013</xref>), some ribosome profiling reads map to short noncoding RNAs, including small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA). As snoRNAs are located in nucleus, they should not be accessible to translation machinery located in cytoplasm. Indeed, the sequence reads in the snoRNAs map to a very narrow region and are comparable in the cycloheximide- and harringtonine-treated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating they do not represent translated regions of these RNAs. To exclude reads that do not represent active translation, we developed a Percentage of Maximum Entropy (PME) approach to measure the uniformity of read distribution across codons in a candidate ORF (See Experimental Procedures). A PME value of 1 represents uniform read distribution, indicative of real translation, while smaller values indicate skewed distribution with a minimum value of 0 indicating reads at a single location, expected for reads not derived from translated RNA. As expected, candidate ORFs from short noncoding RNAs show drastically lower PME values, as compared to canonical protein coding ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Low PME values indicate RNAs that are not translated, but rather are protected in non-ribosomal protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ji et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>RibORF identifies a large number of translated ORFs in lncRNAs, pseudogenes, and UTRs of mRNAs</title><p>Based on the 3-nt periodicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and uniformity of read distribution across codons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) of translated regions, we developed a Support Vector Machine classifier, RibORF, to identify translated ORFs from ribosome profiling data. The model was trained by using canonical protein-coding ORFs as positive examples and off-frame ORFs from protein-coding regions and candidate ORFs from short noncoding RNAs as negative examples. The classifier using both features performed almost perfectly to separate positive and negative examples in a testing set (Area Under the ROC Curve [AUC] = 0.996), with 3-nt periodicity making a greater contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Using a stringent cutoff for the probability of prediction (0.7 with a false positive rate 0.67% and a false negative rate 2.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), we identified canonical ORFs in 10,946 protein-coding genes, and truncated or extended variants in 544 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The canonical ORFs in almost all expressed transcripts were identified. In addition, we identified so-called uORFs in the 5’UTRs of 3842 protein-coding genes, and uORFs overlapping with coding regions (overlapping uORFs) in 1054 genes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We also identified ORFs located in 3’UTRs of 550 genes, which we term downstream ORFs (dORFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In general, translated uORFs and dORFs are expressed from the same transcript as the relevant canonical ORF, although in some cases these may arise from truncated transcripts. Lastly, we identified 1204 ORFs in 510 lncRNAs and 278 ORFs in 161 pseudogenes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

Thus, we will refer to the products of translated ORFs as 'peptides', even though direct biochemical evidence is lacking. In this regard, the peptides represent initial translation products whose stability in vivo is unknown.

For the remaining 38% of the lncRNAs, the translated ORF was located upstream of the longest ORF. This preferential translation of ORFs located closer to the 5’ ends of the lncRNAs likely reflects the strong preference of translation to initiated at the first AUG codon. The fact that the longest candidate ORF and/or its 5’ proximal location is not necessarily the portion of the lncRNA that is translated indicates the value of the RibORF algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Conservation of human lncRNA peptides in mouse</title><p>To address the functional significance of peptides translated from lncRNAs, we used four approaches to study their evolutionary conservation. First, we used PhastCon scores based on 44-vertebrate Multiz alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>) to measure conservation of ORF nucleotide sequence among species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, we used the PhyloCSF score to study the protein-coding potential of ORF sequences based on 29-mammal genome alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al., 2011</xref>)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Third, we checked the conservation of human peptides in mouse transcripts at the amino acid level and defined them to be conserved if two homologous ORFs encode peptides with a BLASTP alignment E-value &lt;10<sup>-4</sup> (False Discovery Rate &lt; 0.0005 for all types and lengths of ORFs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Fourth, for lncRNA peptides conserved between human and mouse, we computed the ratio of nonsynonymous (Ka) to synonymous (Ks) substitution rates of the homologous nucleotide sequences. The Ka/Ks ratio is a commonly used parameter to infer the direction and magnitude of natural selection on peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hurst, 2002</xref>). A ratio smaller than 1 indicates a significant number of nucleotide sequence changes that do not result in protein sequence changes, indicating that the protein is under stabilizing (negative) selection and likely to be functional. For these analyses, we excluded the 30 lncRNAs that encode peptides conserved in mouse protein-coding genes and likely to be pseudogenes mis-annotated by GENCODE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>For each translated ORF, we compared its conservation level (Phastcon and PhyloCSF score) to untranslated segments that are matched for length and transcript location. Interestingly, at the nucleotide level, translated ORF sequences tend to be more conserved and have higher coding potential than the untranslated sequences (p&lt;10<sup>-4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3A</xref>). The pattern is consistent for translated ORFs with different lengths, suggesting that some peptides might be functional. Most lncRNA peptides (92%) do not contain protein domains annotated by Pfam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Punta et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). ORF nucleotide sequences encoding short peptides (&lt;100 aa) containing protein domains are more conserved (p&lt;10<sup>-3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>).</p><p>93 translated lncRNAs (19% of the total) have homologous lncRNA genes in mouse.

As expected, these conserved peptides have higher coding potential than non-conserved ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). For example, the human lncRNA LOC284023 expresses a 97 aa peptide encoded by the 5’ end, and a 37 aa peptide encoded downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The 97 aa peptide is conserved in mouse homologous transcript Chd3os, while the 37 aa peptide is not. Interestingly, human lncRNA peptides conserved with mouse peptides encoded by lncRNAs have Ka/Ks ratios significantly lower than 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). The low Ka/Ks ratios were not due to our BLASTP E-value cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). 20 such lncRNAs express peptides with Ka/Ks values smaller than 0.5, and 12 have values &lt; 0.3.

Interestingly, many AP-1 transcription factors (ATF4, ATF5, ATF2, and JUN) have high usage of uORFs, similar to the yeast homolog Gcn4. For example, ATF4 contains 3 uORFs and 1 overlapping uORF, and the uORF expression is over 300-fold higher than the canonical ORF under normal growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, under stress conditions, ATF4 efficiently re-initiates translation of the canonical ORF, thereby resulting in higher protein expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rutkowski and Kaufman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Vattem and Wek, 2004</xref>).

First, with one exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2014</xref>), they did not use 3-nt periodicity to identify translated ORFs, but rather relied on the longest ORF length and/or maximum read density, which does not provide clear evidence for in-frame translation. Second, with one exception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingolia et al., 2014</xref>), they did not filter the many reads that arise from non-ribosomal complexes and hence are irrelevant to identifying translated proteins. Third, we account for the variable distances between the 5’ end of the sequenced fragment and the ribosome A-site that arises due to imperfect RNase trimming of RPFs, and include RPFs with variable lengths into analyses for maximum sequencing read usage and codon coverage. Alignment of A-sites is critical for observing optimal 3-nt periodicity that characterizes translated regions. With this step, we can observe clear 3-nt periodicity for each codon in well expressed translated ORFs. Fourth, with approaches using harringtonine or lactimidomycin treatment to block translational elongation and hence map the translation initiation site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ingolia et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 2012</xref>), additional experiments are required, read peaks are often not precisely located at the start codons, and many genes do not show efficient ribosome pausing at start codons. In addition, the ribosome profiling datasets involving mammalian cells that have been analyzed to date were generated by a polyA tailing procedure that causes inaccuracies in determining the true 5’ end of the RPF.</p><p>The RibORF algorithm combines ribosome A-site alignment, 3-nt periodicity and uniformity across codons (PME approach) to define regions of active translation. Using this approach, we identify a few thousand non-canonical peptides translated from lncRNAs, 5’ UTRs, and 3’UTRs, a dramatic increase over the several hundred previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bazzini et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, we show that, although the vast majority of pseudogenes are not transcribed, 36% of expressed pseudogenes are translated into peptides. We believe that the RibORF approach represents a significant improvement over current methods, and it should be generally applicable.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Many lncRNAs are translated, but most encoded peptides are likely to be nonfunctional</title><p>Approximately 40% of lncRNAs are translated into peptides &gt;10 aa in length, with a median length of 43 aa. The distinction between translated and untranslated lncRNAs is strongly correlated with whether they are or not in the cytoplasm. Furthermore, the translation efficiency of lncRNAs is comparable to that of mRNAs, indicating that simple access of an RNA to the translation machinery in the cytoplasm is a major determinant of how well it is translated. In this regard, lncRNAs are transcribed by RNA polymerase II, capped, and polyadenylated, and hence are largely indistinguishable from mRNAs with respect to translation. It is unclear why some lncRNAs are predominantly nuclear, whereas others are predominantly cytoplasmic, but it seems unlikely that this is simply a matter of chance. It will be interesting to study whether nucleo-cytoplasmic localization of lncRNAs can be regulated during biological processes. However, the translatability of lncRNAs <italic>per se</italic> does not indicate whether the peptide is biologically important or even sufficiently stable to be detected.</p><p>The observation that cytoplasmic lncRNAs are translated suggests that many of the resulting peptides are not themselves biologically functional. In this regard, the majority of lncRNA-encoded peptides are not conserved in mouse or other species. This lack of conservation does not exclude the possibility that these peptides are biologically meaningful, but it seems likely that most lncRNA peptides are not. If so, biological function may be mediated by the lncRNAs themselves or by the act of Pol II transcription, which alters chromatin structure to affect processes such as Pol III transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Moqtaderi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oler and Cairns, 2010</xref>) and V(D)J recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>).

Some of these non-canonical peptides are conserved in mouse and as a class, these peptides have synonymous and nonsynonymous amino acid substitution rates indicating that are under stabilizing selection and strongly suggesting that they perform biological functions. Our results do not indicate that all of the conserved peptides are biologically functional, nor do they identify specific peptides as being functional. Most likely, functional peptides are those with the lowest Ka/Ks ratios, but these ratios need to be corrected for the number of substitutions analyzed for a given conserved region and the probability that they occur by chance. Nevertheless, a few functional lncRNA peptides have been described in other species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galindo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Magny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pauli et al., 2014</xref>), and our results strongly suggest that a significant minority of non-canonical peptides have biological functions. Some previous analyses of lncRNAs tried to eliminate lncRNAs producing potentially functional peptides and removed those with long ORF length, high conservation and protein domains using various cutoffs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>). Here we found many lncRNAs after the filtering are translated, and conserved lncRNA and pseudogene peptides have median length 69 aa and 92 aa, respectively, which is shorter than the typical cutoff 100 aa. Our results indicate that ribosome profiling provides significant values to effectively identify translated RNAs in an unbiased manner, and reveal potential functional short peptides.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The semantics of non-coding RNAs</title><p>By definition, non-coding RNAs are not translated into protein. However, until the advent of ribosome profiling that directly identifies translated regions of RNAs in an unbiased fashion, non-coding RNAs were defined computationally as lacking ORFs of significant length. Secondary bioinformatic considerations such as codon usage, evolutionary conservation, and protein domain have also been used as part of the definition of non-coding RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabili et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that ~40% of so-called lncRNAs and pseudogene RNAs are translated in vivo, and hence are not truly non-coding RNAs. Of course, the translation of these RNAs provides no information on whether the resulting peptides are stable/detectable or biologically meaningful. Our results suggest that many, and perhaps nearly all, peptides generated from lncRNAs and pseudogene RNAs arise from the invariable translation of the cytoplasmic RNAs, thereby fortuitously generating peptides of no biological consequence. In such cases, any biological function of these RNAs would depend on the RNA product itself. However, the evolutionary conservation and low Ka/Ks ratios of some peptides generated by lncRNAs and pseudogene RNAs are suggestive that these peptides confer some biological function. An RNAs that generates a functional peptide may also have a biological function as an RNA molecule.</p><p>Thus, non-coding RNAs can be divided into 3 classes, namely 1) true non-coding RNAs that are not translated, 2) RNAs that are translated into functionally irrelevant peptides, and 3) RNAs that are translated into non-conventional proteins that confer biological function. Furthermore, as the nucleo-cytoplasmic location of RNAs might be regulated by cell-type or environmental conditions, some RNAs that appear to be truly non-coding in our experiments might be translated and give rise to functional peptides in other circumstances.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>All cultures were performed at 37°C under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, we used different training parameters to build the classifier, and the AUC values measuring classifier performances were plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Nucleotide sequence conservation and protein-coding potential of translated ORFs</title><p>We examined whether translated non-canonical ORFs are more conserved and have higher coding potential than untranslated sequences in the same RNAs using PhastCon scores based on multiz alignment of 46 vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Siepel et al., 2005</xref>) and PhyloCSF scores based on 29-mammal alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lin et al, 2011</xref>), respectively. The PhastCon conservation level and PhyloCSF coding potential of nucleotides in a region were calculated as the average scores across nucleotides. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>, for each translated ORF in lncRNAs and pseudogenes, we randomly picked 50 untranslated segments with the same length. As translated ORFs tend to be located in 5’ end of transcripts, the untranslated segments located in the 5’ end are twice more likely to be picked than the 3’ end ones. However, as we did not observe 5’ end of lncRNAs and pseudogenes are significantly more conserved than 3’ end in untranslated regions, the patterns should be consistent if we do not consider the location bias. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>, for translated uORFs and dORFs, we compare their conservation and coding potential levels with their neighboring untranslated regions. If the translated ORF length is <italic>L</italic>, the neighboring untranslated regions were defined as <italic>L/2</italic> region upstream the ORF and <italic>L/2</italic> region downstream. We excluded the translated ORFs which are located within <italic>L/2</italic> regions of canonical ORFs.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Conservation of human non-canonical peptides in mouse</title><p>We used Liftover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karolchik et al., 2014</xref>) to identify orthologous genomic locations of human lncRNA ORFs in mouse, and obtained possible ORFs flanking these regions, considering all coding and noncoding transcripts in mouse genome defined by refSeq and GENCODE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harrow et al., 2012</xref>). Then we used BLASTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Johnson et al., 2008</xref>) to compare the similarity between human and mouse ORF peptide sequences. To obtain the expected distribution of BLASTP E-values between non-conserved peptide sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>), we randomized the nucleotide sequence of each human translated ORF for 50 times and use the BLASTP to compare the human ORF peptide sequence and the randomized the sequence. We consider a human ORF to be conserved in mouse if the two ORFs have a BLASTP alignment E-value &lt;10<sup>-4</sup>. Using this cutoff, the False Discovery Rate (FDR) is &lt;0.0005 for all types and lengths of non-canonical ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Nonsynonymous and synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks ratio) in non-canonical peptides conserved in human and mouse</title><p>The entire nucleotide and encoded peptide sequences of non-canonical peptides conserved between human and mouse were analyzed by KaKs calculator software to examine nonsynonymous (Ka) and synonymous (Ks) substitutions and the resulting and Ka/Ks values, using the approximate method 'NG' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). As a control to exclude the possibility that low Ka/Ks ratios are an artifact of the our cutoff BLASTP E-value &lt;10<sup>-4</sup>, we calculated the Ka/Ks ratios of a given human peptide with 50 randomly generated sequences of the same length as the homologous mouse ORF, and with BLASTP alignment E-value &lt;10<sup>-4</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Protein domain annotation</title><p>We input the peptide sequences encoded by translated ORFs to the Pfam web server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pfam.xfam.org/search#tabview=tab1">http://pfam.xfam.org/search#tabview=tab1</ext-link>).

Your submission has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Although the reviewers agree that you have addressed important aspects of the use of ribosome profiling to identify the full spectrum of the translatome, the major deficiency of this work is the validation of the data. Many reports have already documented ribosome footprinting of unexpected RNA species, but the next advance must be the demonstration that productive translation has indeed taken place. You state: &quot;Future work including the affinity purification of 80S ribosomes and mass-spectrometry of small peptides will provide more accurate determination of the translational status of individual transcripts.&quot; However, ribosome affinity purification has been already applied (Ingolia et al., 2014; Zhou P et al., PNAS 2013) to show that the majority of noncoding RNAs, including most long intergenic noncoding RNAs, are ribosome-bound to the same extent as coding transcripts. You must by now have validation data to add to the paper.</p><p>Ribosome profiling is a powerful technology that can be applied to identify ribosome protected positions in a genome wide unbiased fashion. You revisit one of the less explored aspects of this technique, namely to what extent ribosome profiling data can be used to identify true translation events in e.g. 5' UTRs and long non-coding RNAs. The core issue is that it is unknown to which extent non-ribosome related factors, scanning ribosomes etc. can also result in &quot;ribosome-protected&quot; fragments and to what extent such fragments can occur in a random fashion. You weigh in on this with a new, complementary approach to defining true translation in ribosome profiling data. You develop two tests, for codon periodicity and uniform coverage (as opposed to a single, high-abundance fragment). These approaches are different than the scoring metrics previously used by the Giraldez and Guttman groups, and this new approach is well validated here. You show that lncRNA translation tends to occur on transcripts with cytoplasmic (as opposed to nuclear) localization, which is a clear prediction of any model of lncRNA translation but has not previously been tested. You also develop several lines of evidence supporting protein-level conservation constraining a subset of translated lncRNA regions. Forty-one of these are conserved in mice, and represent candidate genes encoding tiny proteins. You argue for the translation of many pseudogenes, including continued selection on the protein-coding potential of these sequences.</p><p>The major comments that the reviewers made follow. The first, regarding validation, will require additional data, while it may be possible to address the others through modifications to the text.</p><p>1) What the field is in strong need of is a study where suggested translation events are validated at a large scale with an alternative approach than ribosome profiling. This could be mass spectrometry (there are some new approaches that identify and quantify ongoing protein synthesis events) and/or association with polysomes. Such a validation would allow for benchmarking the analysis approaches that are proposed. We believe that a reasonable number of validated targets would be 7-8, for example, from the forty-one that are conserved in mice, and represent candidate genes encoding tiny proteins.</p><p>2) Gerashchenko and Gladyshev,(2014 NAR) described a strong bias in ribosome profiling studies because of the use of cycloheximide, in particular affecting uORFs (but likely also long non-coding RNAs). It is surprising that the protocol used by the authors is not discussed in this context and it does seem possible that artifacts such as those described could indeed be a factor in the present study as well. It is unclear how the analysis approach described would deal with such artifacts.</p><p>3) Pseudogenes retain substantial nucleotide-level identity with their protein-coding ancestors. Short ribosome footprints are particularly prone to mis-mapping, and the authors don't provide details on their handling of multi-mapping reads &amp;c. They should exclude the possibility that apparent translation of pseudogenes is a result of ribosome footprints on conventional protein-coding ancestors.</p><p>4) Can the authors comment on why transcripts with ORFs of &gt;100 (and in some cases &gt;200) amino acids are nonetheless classified as lncRNAs?</p><p>5) The uORF-mediated regulation of ATF4 in particular is well-studied by the Harding lab among others, and the authors should cite this literature in discussing these uORFs.</p><p>6) The authors say that, &quot;By definition, noncoding RNAs should not be translated into protein&quot; (in the Introduction) and &quot;By definition, non-coding RNAs are not translated into protein&quot; (in the Discussion). In fact, this is begging the question to some extent – there may be RNAs, e.g., that function as microRNA sponges in the cytosol but have a translated uORF whose translation is important only to avoid other translation that would interfere with this non-coding function (e.g. Ulitsky &amp; Bartel).</p><p>7) It is surprising that about 35% of all reads do not originate from the expected periodic position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that there is substantial randomness in the methodology, which would be expected to contribute to the stochastic characteristics of the data.</p><p>8) The approach presented relies on the 3 nt periodicity and random distribution (measured by entropy) of the reads across the ORF. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> it appears that it is mainly the 3 nt periodicity that is driving the classification. Thus, one critical issue is to what extent such patterns can occur by chance under the multiple testing situations that are assessed. It is also unclear why we should assume that this situation cannot be the result of factors other than ribosomes or simply occur by chance when the authors states that &quot;It is inconceivable that uniform 3nt period…&quot;.</p><p>9) The conservation analyses are in general relatively modest and it is hard to interpret whether this is a result of that there is a large fraction of false positive translation events and that the true ones are indeed conserved or whether there is an abundance of &quot;unusual&quot; translation events that are not conserved. Indeed many &quot;peptides&quot; are very short which would suggest a larger risk for false positive 3nt periodicity and uniform distribution of reads, especially for lowly expressed genes (it is not clear if there is bias for detecting more genes with low rpf counts as truly translated).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Many lncRNAs, 5'UTRs, and pseudogenes are translated and some are likely to express functional proteins&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor), and the Reviewing editor and two reviewers of the original paper. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. Please note especially that the reviewers commented on the use of the words &quot;inconceivable&quot; and &quot;invariable,&quot; which are not appropriate and can be misleading.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The revised manuscript addresses most of my major concerns from the original submission. In particular, it does seem that mis-mapping cannot explain potential pseudo-gene translation, and I am satisfied that the sequencing data largely reflect 80S ribosome occupancy.</p><p>I have two substantial concerns with the interpretation of the data:</p><p>1) The authors say that cytosolic lncRNAs are translated &quot;invariably&quot; in three places including in the Abstract. This word is too strong even for the set of lncRNAs present in this sample, and more broadly, the only invariable thing in biology is the presence of surprising exceptions.</p><p>2) The authors don't seem to consider transcript isoform variation in their interpretation of uORFs and dORFs. In yeast, translated uORFs sometimes occur on small, independent transcripts (Arribere &amp; Gilbert 2013, Pelechano &amp; Steinmetz 2013) and so the lack of uORF-mediated repression may reflect the fact that the uORF is not translated from the same transcript as the CDS.

Many reports have already documented ribosome footprinting of unexpected RNA species, but the next advance must be the demonstration that productive translation has indeed taken place. You state: &quot;Future work including the affinity purification of 80S ribosomes and mass-spectrometry of small peptides will provide more accurate determination of the translational status of individual transcripts.&quot; However, ribosome affinity purification has been already applied (Ingolia et al., 2014; Zhou P et al., PNAS 2013) to show that the majority of noncoding RNAs, including most long intergenic noncoding RNAs, are ribosome-bound to the same extent as coding transcripts. You must by now have validation data to add to the paper.Ribosome profiling is a powerful technology that can be applied to identify ribosome protected positions in a genome wide unbiased fashion. You revisit one of the less explored aspects of this technique, namely to what extent ribosome profiling data can be used to identify true translation events in e.g. 5' UTRs and long non-coding RNAs. The core issue is that it is unknown to which extent non-ribosome related factors, scanning ribosomes etc. can also result in &quot;ribosome-protected&quot; fragments and to what extent such fragments can occur in a random fashion. You weigh in on this with a new, complementary approach to defining true translation in ribosome profiling data. You develop two tests, for codon periodicity and uniform coverage (as opposed to a single, high-abundance fragment). These approaches are different than the scoring metrics previously used by the Giraldez and Guttman groups, and this new approach is well validated here. You show that lncRNA translation tends to occur on transcripts with cytoplasmic (as opposed to nuclear) localization, which is a clear prediction of any model of lncRNA translation but has not previously been tested. You also develop several lines of evidence supporting protein-level conservation constraining a subset of translated lncRNA regions. Forty-one of these are conserved in mice, and represent candidate genes encoding tiny proteins. You argue for the translation of many pseudogenes, including continued selection on the protein-coding potential of these sequences.</italic>General comments regarding validity and the polysome experiment:</p><p>I am surprised that the Reviewers do not accept the statement that “it is inconceivable the uniform 3-nt periodicity over an extended distance can result in anything other than bona fide translation”. Given that the majority of sequence reads are ribosome-protected fragments of a well-defined size and correspond to codons of canonical ORFs, I cannot imagine a better definition of translation. It is far superior to polysome-associated RNA, the long-time definition, which does not even map the translated region, much less have any connection to codons. Nevertheless, at the suggestion of the Reviewers, we perform a standard 80S/polysome experiment and show that all 7 RNAs tested that encode non-canonical, translated ORFs indeed are associated with 80S and/or polysomes (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Untranslated control RNAs are not associated with either the 80S or polysomes. The alternative explanations for the data mentioned in Review and discussed below are implausible; they are inconsistent with the very-well understood translation mechanism <italic>and</italic> the data.</p><p>1) Non-ribosomal RNA-protein complexes: Other than translating ribosomes, no known RNA-protein complexes have any relationship to codons, 3-nt periodicity, or extended regions. In fact, the opposite is true; such complexes protect very specific regions of RNA. Indeed, 11% of the sequencing reads are highly localized (low PME values), have no 3-nt periodicity, and are comparable in both cycloheximide- and harringtonine-treated cells. These are the non-ribosomal RNA-protein complexes (we have analyzed them in detail in other work).</p><p>2) Scanning ribosomes: Scanning ribosomes, which recognize the 5’ cap of RNA and scan down to the initiation codon, do not incorporate amino acids and do not recognize codons (except initiation codons). As such, scanning ribosomes do not result in 3-nt periodicity; if they did, it would be hard to understand how they select initiation codons independent of reading frame. More importantly, if one looks at ribosome profiles at classical ORFs, sequence reads start at the initiation codon. There are few if any reads upstream where the scanning ribosomes are. So, scanning ribosomes cannot possibly account for 3-nt periodicity, both in principle and according to the ribosome profiling data.</p><p>3) Random binding of ribosomes: There is no evidence that this occurs to any significant extent. Indeed, one of the key experiments leading to the scanning ribosome model was the inability of ribosomes to bind circular RNA (i.e. lacking an end). By the very definition, random binding would not occur in selected and extended regions with 3-nt periodicity.</p><p>4) Most general evidence for validity: The 3-nt periodicity for classical vs. non-conventional ORFs are indistinguishable; i.e. they all have the same relative% reads for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd position. Furthermore, we showed that the translation efficiency (ribosome profiling reads: RNA seq reads) of non-canonical ORFs is comparable (only slightly less) than conventional ORFs. The Reviewers cannot seriously dispute that classical ORFs are translated. How then do they account for the indistinguishable 3-nt periodicity and roughly comparable translation efficiency of non-canonical ORFs? The idea that completely different mechanisms somehow yield remarkably similar results strains credulity.</p><p><italic>1) What the field is in strong need of is a study where suggested translation events are validated at a large scale with an alternative approach than ribosome profiling. This could be mass spectrometry (there are some new approaches that identify and quantify ongoing protein synthesis events) and/or association with polysomes. Such a validation would allow for benchmarking the analysis approaches that are proposed. We believe that a reasonable number of validated targets would be 7-8, for example, from the forty-one that are conserved in mice, and represent candidate genes encoding tiny proteins.</italic></p><p>As mentioned above, we performed the suggested polysome association experiments and obtained the expected results. We did not perform mass spectrometry to identify peptides, because this is not validation for translation. Peptide measurements don’t measure translation per se, because they also reflect stability of the protein. By analogy, transcription is measured by RNA polymerase (e.g. ChIP, Net-seq, GRO-seq), not RNA levels. It is well appreciated that RNA levels are a poor, and indeed unacceptable, approach for measuring transcription, because many “cryptic” RNAs are transcribed but unstable (except under particular conditions or in mutant strains).</p><p><italic>2) Gerashchenko and Gladyshev,(2014 NAR) described a strong bias in ribosome profiling studies because of the use of cycloheximide, in particular affecting uORFs (but likely also long non-coding RNAs). It is surprising that the protocol used by the authors is not discussed in this context and it does seem possible that artifacts such as those described could indeed be a factor in the present study as well. It is unclear how the analysis approach described would deal with such artifacts.</italic></p><p>I don’t understand the relevance of the Gerashchenko and Gladyshev paper. The cycloheximide artifacts in that paper related to stress conditions, which are not relevant here. They also were observed in yeast, not mammalian cells. Also, the main artifact related to a broad peak downstream of the start codon, and this is not observed in our data.</p><p><italic>3) Pseudogenes retain substantial nucleotide-level identity with their protein-coding ancestors. Short ribosome footprints are particularly prone to mis-mapping, and the authors don't provide details on their handling of multi-mapping reads &amp;c. They should exclude the possibility that apparent translation of pseudogenes is a result of ribosome footprints on conventional protein-coding ancestors.</italic></p><p>Although it is true that “pseudogenes retain substantial nucleotide identity with their protein-coding ancestors”, there is no problem with distinguishing reads between these 2 classes of genes. The sequence reads are ~30 nt (paired end) and it is rare for nucleotide identity between pseudogenes and canonical genes to occur over this length. Moreover, we use standard Tophat parameters to eliminate non-unique reads. I should note that we have dealt with issue in other experiments (e.g. different tRNA genes; Moqtaderi et al, 2010 NSMB) where there was much more similarity between related genes.</p><p><italic>4) Can the authors comment on why transcripts with ORFs of &gt;100 (and in some cases &gt;200) amino acids are nonetheless classified as lncRNAs?</italic></p><p>This is a semantic issue, which we tried to address in the Discussion. There is no fixed boundary to distinguish between a “translated lncRNA” making a peptide &gt;100 aa and an mRNA encoding a short peptide. Moreover, by definition, a translated lncRNA is not really a lncRNA, since it is codes for a peptide that is synthesized (although may not be stable). Perhaps one could make some kind of distinction based on how long the peptide is with respect to RNA length, but it is unclear if this has any meaning.</p><p><italic>5) The uORF-mediated regulation of ATF4 in particular is well-studied by the Harding lab among others, and the authors should cite this literature in discussing these uORFs.</italic></p><p>In addition to the appropriate paper already cited, we now cite a review article on ORF-mediated regulation of ATF4. We are well aware of this literature, and indeed cited it and mentioned our ATF4 result as confirmation of previous knowledge.</p><p><italic>6) The authors say that, &quot;By definition, noncoding RNAs should not be translated into protein&quot; (in the Introduction) and &quot;By definition, non-coding RNAs are not translated into protein&quot; (in the Discussion). In fact, this is begging the question to some extent – there may be RNAs, e.g., that function as microRNA sponges in the cytosol but have a translated uORF whose translation is important only to avoid other translation that would interfere with this non-coding function (e.g. Ulitsky &amp; Bartel).</italic></p><p>For decades, “coding” has meant “an ORF/peptide sequence that is translated under some condition”. So, a non-coding RNA, by definition, is not translated. In the example mentioned, if an RNA functions as a miRNA sponge, that fact doesn’t bear on the question of whether this RNA is coding or non-coding. If this “sponge” RNA is translated, it is coding, no matter what the reason (if any) for why it is translated. Again, the last section of the Discussion attempted to deal with the semantic issues here. There are no simple remedies/terminologies for the many cases where RNAs are translated, but the peptides may be unstable and/or have no biological function. Perhaps the reviewers would suggest new terminology for this situation.</p><p><italic>7) It is surprising that about 35% of all reads do not originate from the expected periodic position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This suggests that there is substantial randomness in the methodology, which would be expected to contribute to the stochastic characteristics of the data.</italic></p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and other figures – The reason why 35% of all reads do not originate from the expected periodic position is simply because RNase does not perfectly (i.e. to the nucleotide) degrade unprotected RNA and fail to degrade protected RNA. This means alignment isn’t perfect, and no one would expect that it would be. More importantly, the 3-nt periodicity is striking by simple inspection, especially compared to control regions that are not translated but are bound by non-ribosomal RNA-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The p-value for 3-nt periodicity (null hypothesis is non-ribosomal complexes) is 10-12, which is extremely compelling. And, this p-value is generated on a 10 aa peptide for an RNA expressed at the lower limit of our analysis; longer or more highly expressed peptides would have vanishingly smaller p-values. Of course, the RibORF algorithm specifically addresses the statistical significance of 3-nt periodicity for any putative ORF; that is the whole point and major advance of the method.</p><p><italic>8) The approach presented relies on the 3 nt periodicity and random distribution (measured by entropy) of the reads across the ORF. From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> it appears that it is mainly the 3 nt periodicity that is driving the classification. Thus, one critical issue is to what extent such patterns can occur by chance under the multiple testing situations that are assessed. It is also unclear why we should assume that this situation cannot be the result of factors other than ribosomes or simply occur by chance when the authors states that &quot;It is inconceivable that uniform 3nt period…&quot;.</italic></p><p>Yes, 3-nt periodicity drives most, but not all, of the identification of translated ORFs. But, as discussed in point 6, the chance that the observed periodicity occurs by chance is small. It is unclear what is meant by “multiple testing situations”. If this means that there are many translated ORFs, then it is true that a very small number of ORFs may be false-positives. Indeed, we calculated the false-positive and false-negative rate in the paper, which are extremely low for any genome-scale analysis. This attests to the power of 3-nt periodicity. Lastly, the possibility that our results could be explained by “factors other than ribosomes or simply occur by chance” is inconsistent with current knowledge and the data.</p><p><italic>9) The conservation analyses are in general relatively modest and it is hard to interpret whether this is a result of that there is a large fraction of false positive translation events and that the true ones are indeed conserved or whether there is an abundance of &quot;unusual&quot; translation events that are not conserved. Indeed many &quot;peptides&quot; are very short which would suggest a larger risk for false positive 3nt periodicity and uniform distribution of reads, especially for lowly expressed genes (it is not clear if there is bias for detecting more genes with low rpf counts as truly translated).</italic></p><p>The conservation analyses are straightforward (though novel), and this comment is based on an incorrect premise. As indicated above, there is not a large fraction of false translation events, and all the identified translation events (even those as short as 10 aa) have 3-nt periodicity far above chance expectation. The Reviewers are correct that, like all other experiments of this general type, low-expressed genes are problematic and it might be difficult to establish statistical significance. However, the Reviewers may not have realized that RibORF explicitly deals with this issue, because there it involves a probabilistic cut-off to identify translation events. As such, we never identify translation events from poorly expressed RNAs where 3-nt periodicity is hard to see due to limited sequence reads. There is no bias for detecting more genes with low read counts; in fact, exactly the opposite, because more read counts means better statistics.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The authors say that cytosolic lncRNAs are translated &quot;invariably&quot; in three places including in the Abstract.
