binding domains (LBDs) and form constitutive dimers. Despite the existence of a detailed picture of inter-LBD conformational dynamics and structural snapshots of both isolated domains and full-length receptors, it remains unclear how mGluR activation proceeds at the level of the transmembrane domains (TMDs) and how TMD-targeting allosteric drugs exert their effects. Here, we use time-resolved functional and conformational assays to dissect the mechanisms by which allosteric drugs activate and modulate mGluR2. Single-molecule subunit counting and inter-TMD fluorescence resonance energy transfer measurements in living cells reveal LBD-independent conformational rearrangements between TMD dimers during receptor modulation. Using these assays along with functional readouts, we uncover heterogeneity in the magnitude, direction, and the timing of the action of both positive and negative allosteric drugs. Together our experiments lead to a three-state model of TMD activation, which provides a framework for understanding how inter-subunit rearrangements drive class C GPCR activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GPCRs</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptor</kwd><kwd>conformational dynamics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM124731</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levitz</surname><given-names>Joshua</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01GM021342</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andersen</surname><given-names>Olaf S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM098858-07</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blanchard</surname><given-names>Scott C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single molecule subunit counting, FRET and electrophysiology experiments reveal that metabotropic glutamate receptor subunits interact and rearrange at the level of the transmembrane domains in response to allosteric modulators.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G-protein-coupled receptors form an extremely diverse family of membrane signaling proteins that play central roles in nearly all physiological processes and serve as the most frequent class of drug targets in biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LagerstrÃ¶m and SchiÃ¶th, 2008</xref>). Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) form a particularly important family of GPCRs in the brain, where they work in concert with ionotropic iGluRs to control glutamatergic transmission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reiner and Levitz, 2018</xref>). Based on their central roles in basic synaptic neurobiology along with compelling preclinical and clinical evidence, mGluRs serve as potential drug targets for a wide range of neurological and psychiatric diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicoletti et al., 2011</xref>). This physiological and clinical significance motivates studies on the mGluR activation process and the molecular mechanisms of mGluR-targeting drugs.</p><p>mGluRs, and other class C GPCRs, have a unique domain structure consisting of large, bi-lobed extracellular ligand binding domains (LBDs) and cysteine-rich domains (CRDs) that are coupled to seven-helix transmembrane domains (TMDs) which are structurally homologous among all GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Niswender and Conn, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, mGluRs constitutively dimerize in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>), and dimerization is required for glutamate-driven G-protein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Moustaine et al., 2012</xref>). This unique domain structure and dimeric architecture raises many questions about the allosteric processes that underlie receptor activation. Recent single-molecule imaging studies have provided a dynamic interpretation of existing dimeric LBD crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Muto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tsuchiya et al., 2002</xref>) to provide a model of the intrasubunit (i.e. LBD closure) and intersubunit (i.e. dimer interface reorientation) rearrangements that mediate the initial stages of mGluR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Olofsson et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>). However, despite major progress on the inter-subunit interactions and conformational dynamics of the extracellular LBDs, the processes that govern TMD dimer assembly and activation are comparatively less well understood. It remains unclear if TMDs can form stable interactions with each other, whether any such interactions are state-dependent and if potential inter-TMD rearrangements are driven autonomously or depend on allosteric input from the LBDs. A recent breakthrough cryo-electron microscopy study of full-length mGluR5 showed clear inter-TMD interactions in a glutamate-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>), further motivating investigation of inter-subunit coordination.</p><p>From a pharmacological perspective, understanding mGluR activation at the TMD level is crucial because allosteric modulators that bind within the TMD are utilized as both basic research tools and as potential clinical leads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foster and Conn, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindsley et al., 2016</xref>). Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) are thought to primarily modulate agonist-induced activity, but have also been reported to directly elicit receptor activation in full-length receptors. It has also been established that isolated mGluR TMDs can initiate G protein signaling in responses to PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Moustaine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goudet et al., 2004</xref>). Negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) typically inhibit agonist-driven activation, but their mechanism of action and effects on basal activity remain unclear. Unambiguous functional interpretation of mGluR-targeting allosteric drugs, with physiological readouts, is needed to further resolve their precise effects. Furthermore, a direct readout of the conformational impact of allosteric modulators at the TMD in the context of the plasma membrane of living cells is lacking, limiting the ability to characterize the relative affinity, efficacy, and kinetics of different compounds at the level of the receptor itself. Ultimately, a detailed understanding of PAMs and NAMs on receptor conformation, assembly and function is needed to use and develop drugs for both mechanistic studies and therapeutic applications.</p><p>Here, we use a battery of electrophysiological and imaging-based assays to show that positive allosteric modulators of mGluR2 serve directly as agonists which can drive activation by reorienting TMD dimers independently of allosteric input from the LBDs. Using a single-molecule subunit counting assay, we find that this inter-TMD reorientation is underscored by a unique, high propensity for mGluR2 TMD dimerization that is not seen in other group I and II mGluR subtypes or in canonical class A GPCRs. Using a new inter-TMD FRET assay we find that mGluR2 PAMs show variable apparent affinity, efficacy, kinetics, and reversibility of mGluR2 modulation which should inform future applications and drug development. We also find that NAMs modulate inter-TMD arrangement and can either be neutral antagonists or serve as inverse agonists. Our observations lead to a model of mGluR gating at the level of the TMD that accounts for the complex effects of allosteric drugs and motivates further work aimed at unraveling the heterogeneity of GPCR-targeting drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Positive allosteric modulators directly activate mGluR2 with minimal contribution from the extracellular domains</title><p>A comprehensive understanding of class C GPCR activation and signaling requires a mechanistic description of the effects of both LBD-targeting âorthostericâ and TMD-targeting âallostericâ compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Classically, positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of GPCRs have been defined by their ability to amplify the effects of orthosteric compounds without directly activating the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindsley et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wacker et al., 2017</xref>). However, some studies have shown both modulation and direct activation of GPCRs by PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">May et al., 2007</xref>), including mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rovira et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Brien et al., 2018</xref>). Most previous studies, however, relied on end-point assays and thereby failed to provide dynamic information about the onset and reversibility of PAM effects. This issue is exacerbated when studying mGluRs because mammalian cells secrete amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tora et al., 2018</xref>), obscuring whether PAMs can autonomously activate the receptor or merely modulate endogenous glutamate-driven activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45116.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Positive allosteric modulators activate mGluR2 in a GIRK activation assay independently of ligand binding domains.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structural model of a full-length mGluR based on structures of isolated domains (mGluR2 Ligand Binding Domain in Closed-Closed/Active state with two bound glutamate moleculesÂ =Â PDB 5CNI; mGluR2 Cysteine-Rich DomainÂ =Â PDB 5KZQ; mGluR1 Transmembrane DomainÂ =Â PDB 4OR2) showing the locations of the orthosteric and allosteric binding sites.

In this system, activation of G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptors rapidly and reversibly produces potassium currents and constant perfusion of the bath prevents accumulation of endogenouslyÂ released glutamate. GIRK channels are common, native effectors of group II/III mGluRs throughout the mammalian nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dutar et al., 2000</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Watanabe and Nakanishi, 2003</xref>) and provide a physiologically relevant readout of receptor activation. We initially focused on the canonical mGluR2 PAM LY487379 (LY48) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Johnson et al., 2003</xref>). Application of only LY48 to cells expressing mGluR2 and GIRK produced large, reversible inward currents that were up toÂ ~70% in amplitude compared to those induced by saturating glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). LY48 responses were blocked by co-application of the mGluR2 negative allosteric modulator (NAM) MNI 137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). We also examined the LY48-induced effects on mGluR2 signaling using a calcium imaging assay, where a G-protein chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conklin et al., 1993</xref>) permits a G<sub>i/o</sub>-coupled receptor to signal via the Gq pathway to release calcium from intracellular stores. Consistent with the GIRK activation results, we saw clear agonism in response to LY48 application, which produced responses with a similar amplitude to glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C,D</xref>). To rule out any effects of ambient glutamate, we performed the GIRK measurements with mGluR2-R57A, a mutant with anÂ ~30 fold reduction in glutamate affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Malherbe et al., 2001</xref>). mGluR2-R57A displayed very similar responses to LY48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref>) and the LY48 doseâresponse curves for mGluR2-WT and mGluR2-R57A were identical with both showing maximal PAM-induced activation ofÂ ~70% relative to glutamate and an EC<sub>50</sub> ofÂ ~300 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The direct agonist effect of LY48 on mGluR2 prevented precise measurement of potential modulatory effects on glutamate responses at LY48 concentrationsÂ <underline>&gt;</underline>Â 100 nM. 50 nM LY48, the highest concentration that did not produce a response on its own, had no effect on the glutamate-sensitivity of mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that PAM activation and modulation likely occur over the same concentration range. Notably, two other PAMs, CBiPES and TASP 043386, also produced reversible, dose-dependent activation of mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To elucidate the role of the extracellular ligand binding domain (LBD) in PAM-driven agonism, we explored whether LBD closure, a key initial step in glutamate-mediated mGluR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kunishima et al., 2000</xref>), is required for LY48 activation. Co-application of a saturating concentration of LY341495 (LY34), a competitive antagonist that prevents LBD closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>) did not prevent mGluR2 activation by LY48 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Moustaine et al., 2012</xref>), complete removal of the extracellular domain did not prevent LY48-mediated activation, indicating that an intact LBD is not needed for mGluR2 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). We titrated LY48 in each construct and found subtle effects on LY48 agonism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). LY34 shifted the LY48 dose-response curve to the right, indicating that LBD closure weakly promotes PAM agonism. In contrast, removal of the extracellular domains shifted the doseâresponse curve to the left, consistent with a model where the LBD provides tonic inhibition of TMD activation by PAMs that is relieved either byÂ LBD closure or by removal of the ECD. Further supporting this model, binding studies have shown up to a 10-fold leftward shift in PAM binding to mGluR2 in the presence of glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Doornbos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Brien et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the modulatory effects of the LBD on PAM activation, saturating concentrations of LY48 were unable to directly induce LBD closure as assayed using an inter-LBD FRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Together these results show that PAMs are able to serve as direct allosteric agonists of mGluR2 and that this activation is only weakly modulated by the LBD.

Much less is known about interactions between mGluR TMDs and whether a stable interface, or interfaces, is formed and how this might change during activation. A cross-linking study on full-length mGluR2 found evidence for constitutive interaction between TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xue et al., 2015</xref>) and the crystal structure of the mGluR1 TMD was solved as a cholesterol-mediated dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, a FRET study showed no evidence for dimerization between mGluR2 TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">El Moustaine et al., 2012</xref>) and the mGluR5 TMD was crystallized as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DorÃ© et al., 2014</xref>). Most recently, cryo-electron microscopy structures of full-length mGluR5 showed an inter-TMD interface only in detergent micelles and in the presence of glutamate and a PAM, but not in lipid nanodiscs in the apo state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Given the weak, modulatory effects of the extracellular LBDs on mGluR2 activation by PAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1DâF</xref>) and the inconsistent information about inter-TMD interactions, we focused on isolated TMDs to probe the assembly and interactions between these domains using a single-molecule imaging-based approach termed âSiMPullâ (<underline>Si</underline>ngle-<underline>M</underline>olecule <underline>Pull</underline>down). This method allows detergent-solubilized receptor complexes to be immobilized from fresh cell lysate via antibodies on a glass coverslip to permit single-molecule imaging with TIRF microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jain et al., 2011</xref>). Photobleaching step analysis of individual complexes allows for precise determination of receptor stoichiometry and, unlike FRET or BRET-based methods, this assay is not sensitive to conformation or relative fluorophore orientation. We previously used SiMPull to show that mGluRs form strict dimers, and to map the major hotspots of inter-LBD interaction, which allowed us to conclude that inter-TMD interactions contribute to dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>). However, this work relied on GFP-tagged receptors which leads to a lysate that contains both surface-targeted and intracellular receptors, potentially including immature or partiallyÂ degraded protein that can confound analysis.</p><p>To restrict our analysis to surface-targeted receptors, we expressed N-terminally SNAP-tagged receptor variants and labeled them with membrane-impermeable fluorophores. Expression and labeling of SNAP-tagged full-length mGluR2 or mGluR2-TMD in HEK 293T cells with the benzylguanine-conjugated fluorophore BG-LD555 (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) showed surface labeling with minimal fluorescence inside the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with previous studies, following immobilization with a biotinylated anti-HA antibody, single SNAP-mGluR2 molecules photobleached primarily in one-step (~40%) or two-step (~60%) events with a small population showingÂ <underline>&gt;</underline>3 steps (5.5 Â± 0.61%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B,C</xref>), consistent with an obligatory dimer withÂ ~80% SNAP labeling efficiency (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). We next performed the same measurements with SNAP-mGluR2-TMD and observedÂ ~45% of spots bleaching in 2-steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâD</xref>), consistent with a population ofÂ ~60% dimers.

Importantly, the enhanced stability of the LD-555 fluorophore allowed us to improve signal-to-noise ratio and fluorophore lifetime, allowing for more accurate determination of photobleaching steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We next tested whether TMD dimerization is dependent on dilution of detergent, which in some cases induces assembly of GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jastrzebska et al., 2004</xref>). Our initial measurements were done in 0.1% IGEPAL, which is above the critical micelle concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ghosh et al., 2004</xref>) but substantially lower than the 1.2% used for cell lysis. SiMPull measurements of SNAP-mGluR2-TMD in 1.2% IGEPAL showed a very similar distribution of photobleaching steps withÂ ~40% of molecules bleaching in twoÂ steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).

Finally, to determine whether dimerization is influenced by protein expression level, we transfected cells with either a typical (0.7 Âµg) or very low (0.07 Âµg) amount of SNAP-mGluR2-TMD DNA; even when SNAP-mGluR2-TMD was expressed with only 0.07 Âµg of DNA,Â ~40% two-step photobleaching was still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45116.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Single-molecule photobleaching analysis shows that mGluR transmembrane domains dimerize in the absence or presence of allosteric drugs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative image showing expression and surface labeling of SNAP-mGluR2-TMD construct in HEK 293T cells prior to lysis.Â Scale barÂ =Â 10 Âµm (<bold>B</bold>) Single-molecule pulldown of SNAP-mGluR2-TMD reveals ECD-independent dimerization of surface-targeted TMDs.

Consistent with previous studies with GFP-tagged receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>), SNAP-mGluR3 and SNAP-mGluR5 showed photobleaching step distributions consistent with dimerization (48.9 Â± 1.3% for mGluR3 and 48.4 Â± 1.4% for mGluR5). Compared to SNAP-mGluR2-TMD, SNAP-mGluR1-TMD, SNAP-mGluR3-TMD and SNAP-mGluR5-TMD all exhibited a lower two-step photobleaching frequency (~30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests that the strength and extent of inter-TMD interaction is mGluR subtype-specific.</p><p>We also tested if a canonical class A GPCR would show a similar behavior under the same conditions.

We expressed HA- and SNAP-tagged Ã<sub>2</sub>AR (âSNAP-Ã<sub>2</sub>ARâ) and pulled down surface receptors from HEK 293T cell lysate via the same anti-HA antibody and under identical lysis conditions to the mGluRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We observedÂ ~10% two-step photobleaching which is consistent with a pure monomer (MaterialsÂ andÂ methods) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Importantly, expression was similar to mGluR2-TMD for all other GPCRs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we recently reported that GFP-tagged opsin also exists primarily as a monomer when expressed in HEK 293T cells and immobilized under similar conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pandey et al., 2017</xref>). Together this indicates that mGluR TMDs show a unique, high propensity for dimerization that is not seen across all GPCR subtypes.</p><p>Given the prominent, but incomplete, dimerization of SNAP-mGluR2-TMD, we wondered if altering TMD conformation with allosteric drugs would modify receptor stoichiometry. To test this, we incubated SNAP-mGluR2-TMD expressing cells and lysates with PAMs or NAMs during the SiMPull experiment. Previous work has shown that mGluR2 PAMs can bind and exert conformational effects on mGluR2 under identical detergent conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows isolated SNAP-mGluR2-TMD molecules in the presence of a saturating concentration of LY48 which did not produce a visible change in spot size or promote aggregate formation. We counted SNAP-mGluR2-TMD bleaching steps in the presence of eitherÂ two different mGluR2 PAMs (LY48 and BINA) or two different mGluR2 NAMs (MNI 137 and Ro 64â2259) and found that the photobleaching step distributions in all cases were similar, withÂ ~40â45% two-step bleaching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and no change in the proportion of higher order complexes withÂ &gt;3 bleaching steps (&lt;10%). Additionally, we tested if the addition of glutamate or a PAM would alter theÂ ~60% two-step bleaching events observed for SNAP-mGluR2, as a recent study suggested that higher order mGluR2 complexes can form under some conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MÃ¸ller et al., 2018</xref>), and found that two-step bleaching events remained atÂ ~60%, whether or not saturating concentrations of glutamate or glutamate plus LY48 were added to cells and lysate during SiMPull (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).</p><p>These results show that mGluR2 TMDs readily dimerize with an enhanced propensity compared to other mGluRs and canonical class A GPCRs.

Whereas mutagenesis and intersubunit FRET studies have shown that inter-LBD rearrangement is an important early step in receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>), less is known about inter-TMD rearrangement. Crucially, it remains unclear if inter-TMD motion is driven solely by inter-LBD conformational changes, which brings the lower lobes of the LBD closer together to produce a more extensive interface, or if TMD rearrangement is able to occur autonomously without the LBDs. In previous studies, fluorescent proteins were inserted into the intracellular loops or C-termini of mGluRs and glutamate-induced FRET changes, which were highly dependent on the precise insertion site for their directionality, were measured (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marcaggi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tateyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tateyama and Kubo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yanagawa et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grushevskyi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hlavackova et al., 2012</xref>). Taken together these studies suggest that inter-TMD reorientation is part of the activation process. Unfortunately, in all cases, G-protein activation was prevented by the modification to the construct, challenging the interpretation of the study since the receptor was likely unable to reach a fully active conformation. Furthermore, all previous studies focused on either orthosteric ligands or LBD-targeting trivalent ions without assessing the effects of allosteric drug binding to the TMD.</p><p>We therefore sought to develop a FRET sensor that reports on activation-associated motions driven by allosteric drugs and hypothesized that an N-terminal fluorophore on the isolated TMD should report on any inter-TMD rearrangement while allowing the receptor to maintain G-protein coupling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To test this, we co-expressed SNAP-mGluR2-TMD and CLIP-mGluR2-TMD in HEK 293T cells and labeled the cells with donor (CLIP-Surface 547) and acceptor (BG-LD655) fluorophores for CLIP and SNAP, respectively. The donor fluorophore was excited with a 561 nm laser and both donor and acceptor channels were imaged simultaneously using a dual camera imaging system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). As a control, we bleached the acceptor fluorophore and observed recovery of the donor fluorescence, confirming that substantial FRET can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with the enhanced dimerization of the mGluR2-TMD, a smaller donor recovery was observed with the Ã<sub>2</sub>AR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Strikingly, application of LY48 produced a readily detectable FRET increase, as determined by a simultaneous increase in acceptor fluorescence and decrease in donor fluorescence, which was reversed with drug washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). LY48-induced FRET responses were repeatable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), showed no desensitization over 5 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), were blocked by the NAM MNIÂ 137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and dose-dependent over the concentration range used for functional experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

Importantly, SNAP-tagged mGluR2 TMDs showed LY48-induced GIRK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), indicating that they remain capable of activating G proteins, as expected. To test if LBD-independent inter-TMD rearrangement is a feature of other mGluRs, we asked if donor and acceptor conjugation to SNAP-mGluR5-TMD would allow for the detection a FRET response to a PAM. Application of the mGluR5 PAM VU0360172 produced a reversible FRET response suggesting that, indeed, this conformational assay is generalizable across the mGluR family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45116.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>An inter-TMD FRET assay reveals LBD-independent reorientation in response to positive allosteric modulators.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Top, schematic showing SNAP- and CLIP-tagged mGluR2-TMD constructs labeled with donor and acceptor fluorophores.Â Bottom, images showing donor and acceptor channels following donor excitation with a 561 nm laser.

A classical model of GPCRs is the formation of a ternary complex with a G-protein heterotrimer that enhances the receptorâs affinity for agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stadel et al., 1980</xref>). Consistent with this model, when we co-expressed a dominant-negative GÎ± protein with reduced guanine nucleotide affinity to stabilize the receptorâG protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barren and Artemyev, 2007</xref>), there was a substantial left-shift in the inter-TMD FRET doseâresponse curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). A similar left-shift in inter-LBD FRET in the presence of this G-protein mutant was reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doumazane et al., 2013</xref>).

Structural and spectroscopic studies, primarily on class A GPCRs, have led to a general model of 7-TM domain activation involving inter-helix interactions that are modified by ligand binding and converge on an outward motion of TM6 which opens up a G protein binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weis and Kobilka, 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thal et al., 2018</xref>). A number of microswitches involving helices 3, 5, and 6 have been proposed to mediate the conformational rearrangements that drive receptor activation. How these microswitches contribute to PAM agonism in mGluRs is not well understood, especially in the context of intersubunit reorientation. Asp735 in helix 5 has been proposed as a central residue within a âtrigger switchâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) that mediates PAM binding-induced conformational changes for most, but not all, mGluR2 PAMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">O'Brien et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">PÃ©rez-Benito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffhauser et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with our prediction, mutation of asparagine 735 to aspartate (N735D) resulted in drastically reduced activation by LY48 in the GIRK assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3B,C</xref>). We next asked if our inter-TMD FRET response is also dependent on interactions involving N735.

Xanthurenic acid (XA), a metabolite in the kynurenic acid pathway, has been reported to be an allosteric activator of mGluR2 with nanomolar potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Copeland et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fazio et al., 2016</xref>). This observation has been controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fazio et al., 2017</xref>), motivating further analysis with more direct readouts. We applied XA at concentrations up to 50 ÂµM and observed neither inter-TMD FRET changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>) nor GIRK currents in full-length mGluR2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). These experiments highlight the potential of the inter-TMD FRET assay for drug screening and show that XA does not serve as an allosteric agonist of mGluR2; it likely exerts its effects indirectly on mGluR2 signaling in physiological settings.</p><p>We next sought to further probe the variation in PAM-induced inter-TMD FRET changes. While <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows that mGluR2 PAMs by themselves serve as potent agonists, they are also known to enhance the response to orthosteric agonists. We used an inter-LBD FRET assay to assess the relative strength of allosteric modulation by different mGluR2 PAMs. Agonists induce a decrease in FRET between fluorophore-conjugated N-terminal SNAP- and CLIP-tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Previous studies showed that LY48 primarily enhances the maximal FRET change induced by a partial agonist, such as DCG-IV, rather than the apparent affinity for the agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doumazane et al., 2013</xref>). We tested this effect for all PAMs by applying a saturating concentration of DCG-IV followed by co-application of a saturating concentration of each PAM, which produced further FRET decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). Similar to LY48, all the tested PAMs modulated the DCG-IV response, but did not alter LBD FRET in the absence of an orthosteric agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). This result demonstrates that mGluR2 PAMs are able to both modulate the response to agonists, as assessed with inter-LBD FRET measurements, and directly activate the receptor, as assessed with GIRK current measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Strikingly, the maximal inter-TMD FRET change produced by a given PAM is correlated with its ability to both modulate the agonist response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) and to directly produce G-protein activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Together these measurements reveal variations among PAMs with regard to both affinity and efficacy. This is reminiscent of what is observed with orthosteric agonists of mGluR2, which display a wide range of affinities and efficacies that are accurately reported by inter-LBD FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doumazane et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>). Importantly, in the case of PAMs both the efficacy of allosteric agonism and the modulation of orthosteric agonism are correlated with inter-TMD FRET changes, suggesting that the state stabilized by PAMs may be the same conformation stabilized by orthosteric agonists.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Different PAMs produce different kinetics of TMD FRET changes and receptor activation</title><p>Given the temporal sensitivity and direct nature of our inter-TMD FRET assay, we decided to characterize the kinetics of FRET changes associated with our panel of PAMs. We first compared the timing of LY48-induced inter-TMD FRET changes with the inter-LBD FRET changes induced by glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Across all concentrations, both the induction and the reversal of inter-LBD FRET in response to glutamate was faster than the PAM-induced changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Based on the expected wash-in and wash-out times of our system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>; see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), we believe that glutamate-induced FRET changes are limited only by the time course of drug exchange, but the LY48 responses are slower than expected based on a simple model of binding and unbinding and show weak dose-dependence. We found similar slow kinetics for LY48-induced FRET changes in the inter-LBD FRET assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest either that the accessibilities of orthosteric and allosteric binding sites or that the kinetics of the associated conformational changes differ, meaning that the kinetics of the downstream effects induced by agonists versus PAMs would differ.

To test this, we applied BINA followed by MNI 137, a NAM that blocks the LY48 FRET (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) and GIRK activation responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). MNI 137 clearly reversed the BINA-induced FRET increase back to baseline, implying that it indeed can rapidly compete with BINA for a common binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, following washout of MNI 137 a slow FRET increase was observed even though BINA was not reapplied. The results suggest that either there is a reservoir of BINA, and the FRET increase results from BINA rebinding from this reservoir, or that BINA and MNI bind at different sites and that MNI can reverse the BINA-induced conformational change even when BINA is bound to the receptor. To further probe this, we used a fluorescence quench assay for drug-induced changes of lipid bilayer properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">IngÃ³lfsson and Andersen, 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A</xref>; see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), in which changes in gramicidin channel function is used as a reporter of membrane modification. Of the four PAMs tested, BINA produced the greatest changes in gramicidin channel function (i.e. membrane properties) over a range of concentrations from 1 to 10 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3B,C</xref>). The persistent BINA response is thus consistent with a model where BINA readily partitions into the plasma membrane lipid bilayer (and possibly other lipidic compartments). This membrane binding would both limit BINAâs availability to the receptor (slow the BINA-induced FRET increase) and serve as a reservoir that could greatly slow the washout of BINA from the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Our results do not resolve whether BINA is able to bind directly to the TMD via the plasma membrane, as has been proposed for some class A GPCR ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bokoch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Piechnick et al., 2012</xref>), or if it needs to first exit the bilayer and then bind via the extracellular face of the TMD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Inter-TMD FRET reveals that mGluR2 NAMs serve as either neutral antagonists or inverse agonists which stabilize a high FRET state</title><p>Because analysis of PAMs using inter-TMD FRET changes revealed striking differences between compounds, we decided to also test commercially available NAMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Saturating concentrations of either MNI 137 or Ro 64 showed a similar level of partial antagonism of the FRET response to DCG-IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1DâF</xref>). These results indicate that, while both NAMs can fully block the functional orthosteric agonist response, they produce only a partial effect on LBD conformation and the extent of this effect is similar for both NAMs despite different effects at the level of the TMD.</p><p>Based on the strong effect of Ro 64 on inter-TMD FRET, we hypothesized that it may alter receptor function in the absence of glutamate. To test this, we applied both NAMs to HEK 293T cells expressing GIRK and full-length mGluR2. Whereas MNI 137 showed no effect on basal current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), Ro 64 produced a small but clear outward current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). These data show that Ro 64 acts as an inverse agonist while MNI 137 is a neutral antagonist. Despite the effect on basal GIRK activity, Ro 64 did not alter the basal inter-LBD FRET, indicating that it exerts its effects without altering LBD conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1G</xref>), as is also seen with MNI 137 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1H</xref>).

Together these results suggest a three-state model of activation where PAMs and inverse agonists stabilize different high FRET TMD arrangements and neutral NAMs merely inhibit the effect of other allosteric drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of inter-TMD interaction in mGluR modulation and activation</title><p>Together this work shows that the TMDs of mGluRs are able to directly interact with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and that this interaction is altered during the activation process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>), even in the absence of the extracellular domains. Based on the previously established constitutive dimerization of mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Levitz et al., 2016</xref>) and the inter-TMD affinity demonstrated here with SiMPull and subunit counting, it is reasonable to assume that the high local concentration of TMDs in the context of full-length receptors ensures that inter-TMD interactions contribute to receptor assembly and activation. Indeed, an inter-TMD interaction between full-length mGluR5 subunits was seen in a recent cryo-electron microscopy study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koehl et al., 2019</xref>). Although all mGluR TMDs tested in SiMPull showed a clear dimerization propensity, compared to the TMDs of mGluR1, mGluR3 and mGluR5 the TMD of mGluR2 showed a higher proportion of dimeric molecules. This suggests that the inter-TMD affinity is higher for mGluR2 and that there is heterogeneity within the mGluR family regarding inter-TMD interaction strength. Heterogeneity of this kind could indicate that there are intrinsic differences in the intersubunit interactions and related conformational changes that occur during the activation process between subtypes. Consistent with our observation of weaker inter-TMD interaction for mGluR5, Koehl et al did not observe a clear interface between TMDs in full-length mGluR5 when the receptor was imaged in the apo state in nanodiscs. Furthermore, the inability of prototypical class A GPCRs to form dimers in our assay suggests that the inter-TMD interactions of mGluRs are uniquely stable.</p><p>To decipher the conformational changes that occur at the level of TMD dimers, we report a new sensor for measuring inter-TMD FRET changes in response to allosteric drugs, which allowed us to detect a FRET change in response to PAM and NAM binding. Because inter-TMD dimerization of mGluR2 in SiMPull was not altered in the presence or absence of allosteric drugs, we interpret the PAM-induced inter-TMD FRET increase to report reorientation of existing TMD dimers rather than ligand-induced dimer formation. Furthermore, the ability of PAMs to serve as agonists in both full-length receptors and isolated TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), indicates that these conformational changes may represent a related activation pathway to that initiated by glutamate.</p><p>All the PAMs tested produced a FRET increase, suggesting a common conformational change, but the NAM Ro 64 also produced a FRET increase. Since the underlying conformations must be different between PAM and NAM-boundÂ states and both states produce an increase relative to baseline, the simplest model to describe this data requires threeÂ states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). In this model, there is a resting state that produces low levels of basal activity, which can be stabilized by classical, neutral NAMs such as MNI 137. From this resting state, PAMs can rearrange the TMDs to produce a high FRET state and allosteric inverse agonists can also rearrange the TMDs to produce a different high FRET state. While caution is required when interpreting these results structurally, an attractive interpretation is that each state corresponds to a distinct inter-TMD interface. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xue et al. (2015)</xref> used inter-subunit crosslinking in full-length mGluR2 to propose a dimer reorientation model where a TM4/5 interface at rest rotates to form a TM6/TM6 interface upon activation. Similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koehl et al. (2019)</xref>Â found that cross-linking between residues in TM6 led to constitutive activation of mGluR5. Such a rearrangement would indeed decrease the distance between the extracellular end of TM1 between subunits, potentially accounting for the FRET increase upon PAM application that we observe. Furthermore, the crystal structure of the mGluR1 TMD with a NAM shows a dimer mediated primarily by TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Such a state could explain the FRET increase seen upon inverse agonist application in our assay. While further structural and functional work is needed to test this model, similar ârollingâ dimer interface models have recently been proposed for dimeric GPCR systems, including CXCR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 2018</xref>) and the neurotensin receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dijkman et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Itâs worth mentioning that a recent study used fluorescence number and brightness analysis to infer the presence of ligand-dependent higher order oligomers of full-length mGluR2 in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">MÃ¸ller et al., 2018</xref>). While the formation of larger complexes could explain the ligand-induced FRET increases observed in our assay, this is contradicted by the observation that neither addition of PAM to mGluR2-TMDs or glutamate or glutamate and PAM to full-length mGluR2 led to changes in receptor stoichiometry in SiMPull. These results indicate that ligand-induced oligomer formation would not produce an interface as stable as the core dimeric interface.</p><p>Although there is clear evidence for inter-subunit rearrangement, it is important to note that intra-subunit conformational changes likely also contribute to changes in the FRET signal. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hlavackova et al. (2012)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grushevskyi et al., 2019</xref> used fluorescent proteins inserted into intracellular loops of mGluR1 to find that FRET changes observed with inter-TMD sensors occur faster than those observed with intra-TMD sensors, suggesting a complex interplay between dimer rearrangement and TMD activation, where dimer reorientation may precede receptor activation. Consistent with this view, we find that the mutation N735D, which is known to hinder the intrasubunit triggering of TMD activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schaffhauser et al., 2003</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">PÃ©rez-Benito et al., 2017</xref>), right-shifted the inter-TMD FRET doseâresponse curve by a factor of 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3D,E</xref>). Future work is needed to thoroughly address the relationship between intrasubunit and intersubunit conformational changes and to determine if TMDs exert cooperative, functional effects on each other.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conformational and functional diversity of mGluR allosteric modulators</title><p>Our functional experiments demonstrate that PAMs serve directly as mGluR2 agonists, removing ambiguity about the functional effects of these compounds. Using a GIRK readout allowed us to test a biologically relevant effector of mGluR2 activation and observe the onset and offset of functional effects. Reports of allosteric agonist activity also exist for mGluR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rovira et al., 2015</xref>), mGluR5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rook et al., 2013</xref>) and mGluR7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitsukawa et al., 2005</xref>) indicating that agonist activity via the TMD binding site is likely a common feature of all mGluRs. In addition, we uncovered basal activity of mGluR2 that is driven at the level of the TMD which can be unmasked by inverse agonists, as was seen with Ro 64. This extends our previous work that has shown, in contrast, minimal LBD-induced basal activity of mGluR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A key finding is that allosteric drug effects on mGluRs can occur independent of glutamate binding to the LBD, raising questions about the coupling mechanism between LBDs and TMDs. The inability of PAMs or NAMs to directly drive conformational changes at the LBD, the ability of PAMs to induce activation without concomitant LBD activation and, most importantly, the ability of isolated TMDs to rearrange autonomously together indicates that coupling between the LBDs and the TMDs is likely to be weak. Weak coupling, potentially in the form of flexible linkers between CRD and TMDs or flexibility within the CRDs, would, in principle, allow for significant rotation between TMDs as we and others propose. Importantly, there is evidence for various forms of coupling between LBDs and TMDs, and agonism at the LBD level is able to drive TMD activation. We show that LBD conformation modulates the apparent PAM affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) and that PAMs can modulate the efficacy of partial agonist-induced conformational changes at the LBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4EâG</xref>). These observations suggest a model where LBDs provide tonic inhibition of the TMDs, which can either be relieved by agonist binding or overcome by PAM binding. Finally, the close correlation between efficacy of PAM agonism and PAM modulation indicates that both PAMs and orthosteric agonists ultimately drive the same conformational state at the level of the TMDs.</p><p>Finally, the temporal precision and sensitivity of our inter-TMD FRET assay allowed us to uncover previously unappreciated diversity in mGluR2-targeting allosteric compounds. PAMs display a range of efficacies as determined by both the maximal FRET change and the maximal activation of GIRK channels. These differences in efficacy presumably reflects variable abilities to stabilize an active conformation as has been observed in single-molecule FRET studies of LBD-targeting mGluR2 agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vafabakhsh et al., 2015</xref>) and TMD-targeting Ã<sub>2</sub>AR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gregorio et al., 2017</xref>). Detailed structural information is needed to understand the molecular basis for differences between PAMs, which likely originates with the precise pose of each compound within the TMD binding site.</p><p>The FRET assay allows us to distinguish subtle differences between PAMs and NAMs, which allowed us to demonstrate the lack of effect of Xanthurenic acid, ruling out the possibility that it serves as an endogenous mGluR2 allosteric modulator. More generally, the sensitivity of the method suggests that it has potential in drug screening.</p><p>Our FRET assay revealed major differences in kinetics between different PAMs. CBiPES had faster ON and OFF kinetics compared to LY48, whereas TASP showed similar kinetics to LY48, indicating that variability between ligands is also seen with kinetics and is not correlated with relative efficacy or affinity. Importantly, all PAM responses were slower ON and OFF than those observed with glutamate. Formation of a ternary complex with G proteins accelerated both the ON and OFF kinetics of LY48, which is the opposite to what has been reported in the Ã<sub>2</sub>AR where G-protein coupling drastically slows agonist release through the engagement of a lid structure at the extracellular face of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">DeVree et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Most strikingly, BINA showed extremely slow ON kinetics and complete irreversibility which we attribute, at least partially, to partitioning within the plasma and organellar membranes. Given the relative hydrophobicity of all mGluR PAMs, such a partitioning model could also explain the weak dose-dependence of OFF kinetics observed for LY48, TASP and CBiPES. Analogously, slow wash-out from lipidic compartments has previously been shown to produce dose-dependent OFF kinetics for hydrophobic drugs targeting GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gingrich et al., 2009</xref>). Together these results show the potential importance of membrane effects on the action of GPCR-targeting drugs, especially hydrophobic TMD-targeting molecules. Finally, in contrast to BINA, the NAM Ro 64 showed fast ON and slow OFF kinetics despite the lack of membrane perturbation in an in vitro liposome assay. Itâs worth noting that while one would expect that very hydrophobic molecules, such as Ro 64, would be potent bilayer modifiers that is not always the case (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alejo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dockendorff et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Recent work has shown that the kinetics of GPCR-targeting drugs are important determinants of their cellular and physiological effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lane et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of D2 dopamine receptors, for example, variable dissociation rates are major determinants of biased agonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klein Herenbrink et al., 2016</xref>), whereas the association rates of D2 receptor-targeting antipsychotics strongly predicted their ability to induce extrapyramidal side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sykes et al., 2017</xref>). The conformational and kinetic variability of allosteric drugs are particularly important when assessing the in vivo effects of different drugs. Comparative in vivo studies of mGluR2 allosteric modulators have not been performed but our study argues that attention is needed to the relative affinity, efficacy and timing of different PAMs and NAMs, especially in the preclinical context where drugs with precisely tuned pharmacological properties hold promise for psychiatric disease treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> ).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK 293T</td><td>ATCC</td><td>ATCC Cat# CRL-3216, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0063">CVCL_0063</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Transfectedconstruct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR2-TMD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">Following SNAP tag, mGluR2 truncatd to position Q558.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR3-TMD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">Following SNAP tag, mGluR3 truncatd to position E567.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR5-TMD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">Following SNAP tag, mGluR5 truncatd to position V570.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR1-TMD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">Following SNAP tag, mGluR1 truncatd to position V583.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR2-R57A</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">R at position 57 replaced with A.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>EGFP-TM-GÎ±oA-G203T</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lober et al., 2006</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">G at position 203 replaced with T.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>CLIP-mGluR2-TMD</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">Following CLIP tag, mGluR2 truncatd to position Q558.</td></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>CLIP-mGluR2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref></td><td/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>SNAP-mGluR2-TMD-N735D</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doumazane et al., 2011</xref> <break/>(modified)</td><td/><td valign="top">Following SNAP tag, mGluR2 truncatd to position Q558.

Briefly, to prevent non-specific sticking of proteins, flow chambers were prepared with mPEG-passivated glass slides and coverslips doped withÂ ~1% biotinylated mPEG, as previously described. Prior to each experiment, chambers were incubated with 0.2 mg/mL NeutrAvidin (ThermoFisher) for 2 min followed by 10 nM of a biotinylated anti-HA antibody (abcam ab26228) for 20â30 min.

Clusters of cells were analyzed together using ImageJ and FRET was calculated as FRET=(I<sub>Acceptor</sub>)/(I<sub>Donor</sub>Â +I<sub>Acceptor</sub>) where I is fluorescence intensity. No corrections were made for bleed-through between channels or the contribution of donor-donor or acceptor-acceptor dimers as analysis was limited to relative FRET changes between drug treatments rather than absolute FRET values. A small artifact (decrease in fluorescence) in response to PAM application was observed in acceptor-only controls, but this response showed the same dose-dependence, relative amplitude and kinetics as FRET responses and were, thus, not corrected for. For individual traces, FRET was normalized to the basal FRET value observed before application of drugs. FRET changes calculated for doseâresponse curves were normalized to the response to saturating LY483739 applied within the same recording and doseâresponse curves were obtained from multiple cell clusters and averaged from at least three separate experiments. Doseâresponse curves were fit using Prism (Graphpad). All drugs were purchased from Tocris, prepared in EX solution, and delivered with a gravity-driven perfusion system. For kinetics measurements a pressurized perfusion system (Automate Scientific) was used to produce a flow rate of 0.5 mL/s. Kinetic analysis was performed in Microsoft Excel. The time between 10% and 90% FRET increase or decrease was determined manually. For photo-bleaching/donor-recovery experiments, images were taken in donor and acceptor channels at baseline and again followed by a 1 min exposure to 640 nm laser illumination at maximum intensity.

The size distribution was determined using dynamic light scattering using an Anton Paar Litesizer TM 500 instrument; the average diameter was 133 nm, with an average Polydispersity index of 7.6% indicating that the samples are monodisperse.

Samples were excited at 352 nm and the fluorescence signal above 455 nm was recorded in the absence (four successive trials) or presence (nine successive trials) of the quencher. All the NAM and PAM derivatives fluoresce to varying degrees and addition of these drugs to LUVs in control experiments without gA or Tl<sup>+</sup> increased the fluorescence signal, and each signal was normalized to account for the compound's fluorescence. The instrument has a dead time ofÂ &lt;2 ms, and the next 2â100 ms segment of each fluorescence quench trace was fitted to a stretched exponential, which is a computationally efficient way to represent a sum of exponentials with a distribution of time constants, reflecting the LUV size distribution as well the fluctuations in the number of gramicidin channels in the LUV membranes:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">â</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">â</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>{</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>â</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>Ï</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Î²</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>}</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>F</italic>(<italic>t</italic>) denotes the fluorescence intensity at time, <italic>t</italic>, Ï<sub>0</sub> is a parameter with units of time, and Î² (0 &lt; Î²Â â¤1, where Î²Â =Â 1 denotes a homogenous sample) provides a measure of the LUV dispersity.

Your article has been reviewed Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor, Kenton Swartz as the Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper uses a combination of cleverly designed probes inserted into isolated receptor domains and full-length mGluR2 for live cell FRET experiments and single molecule photobleaching. With these the authors investigate the mechanisms by which a battery of drugs modulate mGluR2 activity, focusing on movements in the extracellular ligand binding domains, and the transmembrane domain of the mGluR2 dimer assembly. This is a field in which work by multiple groups published over the past ten years had convincingly established that mGluRs, like other class C GPCRs, assemble as dimers, that allosteric modulators bind in a variety of sites to regulate receptor function, and that isolated mGluR2 transmembrane domains can be activated by allosteric modulators in the absence of the ligand binding domain. Most recently, cryo-EM and crystal structures for mGluR5 reveal in detail how the TMD domains interact in an intact dimer assembly. In the present study, the photo bleaching, FRET measurements, and electrophysiological data overlap with previously published work, but do add further insights into mGluR activation and modulation. The kinetics measurements of drug action are not convincing, and some of the quantitative analysis of the FRET data needs closer inspection. In the Introduction (and Abstract) the authors conspicuously ignore recent advances which answer some of the same questions their experiments address, and make some unwarranted statements, giving the false impression that less is known about mGluR assembly and function than is the case. We request that you address the following concerns, some of which will likely require reinterpretation, removing data from the manuscript and considerably rewriting.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The half maximum dose in the dose response is one order of magnitude different in the FRET (Figure 3F) than in the current dose response (Figure 1F), as if the two phenomena are not strongly related. What does this indicate?</p><p>2) The data in Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure 13, Figure 6âfigure supplement 3C and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1 are for the most part not convincing and it is hard to make mechanistic interpretations with respect to receptor modulation and gating. Although the authors measure a 10-90% rise time, the shape of individual responses differs substantially, and some of the data make no sense. What do the kinetics actually represent? Does mGluR2 activation really take minutes to reach equilibrium? Why are the off times concentration dependent for a soluble ligand like glutamate? The responses to glutamate are much slower than recorded at synapses. In Figure 6 âfigure supplement 1 the slope of the concentration response to CBiPES is nearly flat compared to other ligands. The authors also find it hard to washout BINA and suggest that BINA is sequestered into the membrane. This is also probably true for some of the other compounds used (or there must be some other factor that make washout slow and concentration dependent), since the Off rate is concentration dependent (which it shouldn't be if there is a simple washout of the compound). The authors should address these kinetic issues or remove the data from the manuscript.</p><p>3) The following statements are misleading and should be corrected in light of recent full-length mGluR structures cited in the Discussion section. Abstract: &quot;it remains unknown how mGluR activation proceeds at the level of the transmembrane domains (TMDs)&quot;.

A limitation of the study is that both positive and some negative allosteric modulators give the same FRET change in the TMD, which the authors model as reflecting two different but unknown conformations.

We have responded to each of the specific revision requests below, which included modifications to the manuscript as well as new experiments. We have taken the reviewersâ comments to heart and made an effort to more thoroughly place our work in the context of the broader mGluR field with revisions to the Abstract, Introduction and Discussion section. We have provided responses to specific points below.</p><p>Overall, we think that our study provides a valuable contribution to two major research areas. First, we provide new insight into the mechanisms of mGluR transmembrane domain (TMD) assembly, conformation and function. Understanding the TMD as an autonomous unit is a key step toward gaining a complete view of class C GPCR activation. Second, we report findings regarding the molecular pharmacology of mGluR allosteric modulators that reveal new forms of heterogeneity between related compounds. Weâd like to emphasize the following aspects of our study that either represent new findings or important clarifications to unresolved questions:</p><p>1) full-length mGluR2 can be activated by PAMs.</p><p>2) PAMs can activate mGluR2 without the need for orthosteric agonist binding or LBD closure.</p><p>3) mGluR TMDs interact with sufficient affinity to dimerize in the absence of LBDs.</p><p>4) mGluR2 TMDs show a higher propensity for dimerization than all other group I and II mGluRs.</p><p>5) inter-TMD rearrangement can occur independently of allosteric input from the LBDs.</p><p>6) PAMs have both variable affinity and variable efficacy relative to each other.</p><p>7) PAMs show slower onset and reversal of effects than glutamate.</p><p>8) PAMs have variable reversibility and OFF kinetics due, in part, to lipid bilayer interactions.</p><p>9) Xanthurenic acid, a proposed endogenous allosteric agonist, does not work directly on mGluR2 TMDs.</p><p>10) NAMs may be neutral or serve as inverse agonists.</p><p>11) At least 3 states are required to describe inter-TMD conformational dynamics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The half maximum dose in the dose response is one order of magnitude different in the FRET (Figure 3F) than in the current dose response (Fig1F), as if the two phenomena are not strongly related. What does this indicate?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for pointing out the lack of correspondence between the EC<sub>50</sub> values observed in the TMD FRET assay and the GIRK current assay. Itâs not unusual for functional and conformational or binding readouts of GPCRs, or any signaling protein, to differ because many factors contribute to the dose response curve shape and midpoint. For example, receptor reserve pools may contribute to a leftward shift of the EC<sub>50</sub> in a functional assay relative to the K<sub>d</sub> measured in binding assays (for examples see Adler et al., 1987 or Adham et al., 1993). In addition, non-linearity/amplification in the downstream signaling steps may also contribute to such discrepancies between binding, conformational and functional dose-response curves. For example, positive cooperativity in the relationship between G<sub>Ã</sub> binding and GIRK current (Berlin et al., 2010; Yakubovich et al., 2015) likely contributes to a leftward-shift in the dose-response. Along these lines, itâs worth noting that our prior measurements of inter-LBD FRET also show a quantitatively similar discrepancy between the EC<sub>50</sub> measured with FRET versus GIRK current measurements. In Levitz et al., (2016), we reported an EC<sub>50</sub> value for glutamate of ~20 ÂµM and ~3 ÂµM in inter-LBD FRET and GIRK function, respectively. This seven-fold ratio is in line with six-fold ratio reported here for inter-TMD FRET (EC<sub>50</sub> ~ 1.2 ÂµM) and GIRK function (EC<sub>50</sub> ~ 0.2 ÂµM).</p><p>To further probe the response to PAMs, we have performed new experiments with another functional readout. Figure 1âfigure supplement 1c-d shows a representative trace and an LY48 dose response curve produced from calcium imaging in HEK 293T cells, another commonly used GPCR readout. A widely used G protein chimera (Conklin et al., 1993) was co-transfected to allow mGluR2 to signal via the Gq pathway. In this system, we measured an EC<sub>50</sub> of 1.2 ÂµM, which is the same as measured with the TMD FRET readout, but right-shifted relative to GIRK. This confirms the agonism of PAMs reported in our study and further supports the notion that different GPCR readouts show subtle shifts in dose response curves.</p><p>Finally, it is also worth noting that the relative apparent affinity values reported here between different PAMs are consistent between assays and consistent with published values (Johnson et al., 2003; Bonnefous et al., 2005; Johnson et al., 2005; Hiyoshi et al., 2014). Furthermore, the relative efficacies of the three PAMs tested are in agreement between FRET and GIRK current assays (Figure 4H, I). Together, these observations support the connection between the conformational changes detected by the FRET signal and receptor activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The data in Figure 5B and Supplemental Figure 13, Figure 6âfigure supplement 3 and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1are for the most part not convincing and it is hard to make mechanistic interpretations with respect to receptor modulation and gating. Although the authors measure a 10-90% rise time, the shape of individual responses differs substantially, and some of the data make no sense. What do the kinetics actually represent? Does mGluR2 activation really take minutes to reach equilibrium? Why are the off times concentration dependent for a soluble ligand like glutamate? The responses to glutamate are much slower than recorded at synapses. In Figure 6 âfigure supplement 1 the slope of the concentration response to CBiPES is nearly flat compared to other ligands. The authors also find it hard to washout BINA and suggest that BINA is sequestered into the membrane. This is also probably true for some of the other compounds used (or there must be some other factor that make washout slow and concentration dependent), since the Off rate is concentration dependent (which it shouldn't be if there is a simple washout of the compound). The authors should address these kinetic issues or remove the data from the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for expressing their concerns about the kinetics data, which we have now improved with both more experiments and further analyses. The primary conclusions we would like to emphasize in this section are: (1) PAM responses exhibit slower ON and OFF kinetics than glutamate responses and (2) that BINA shows much slower ON kinetics and a lack of reversibility compared to other PAMs due, at least in part, to bilayer interactions.</p><p>Upon further inspection of our perfusion conditions, we decided to repeat these experiments with faster perfusion (25 mL/min versus 5 mL/min in a 0.5 mL chamber). Assuming a well-stirred chamber, the time constants for the perfusion is ~1.2 s. In the case of glutamate-induced LBD FRET responses, we believe that the kinetics likely are merely a reflection of drug wash-in and wash-out. As the referees pointed out, mGluRs should be poised to signal even more rapidly in response to glutamate than the ~1 s wash-in time observed in our measurements (see Reiner and Levitz, 2018). However, the significantly slower ON kinetics of LY48, which are maintained with fast perfusion, show that either binding or binding-induced conformational changes are indeed slower for TMD-targeting PAMs. Consistent with this interpretation, full-length mGluR2 responses in the GIRK assay are faster for saturating (1 mM) glutamate than for saturating (10 ÂµM) LY48 and LY48-induced changes in LBD FRET are also much slower than glutamate-induced FRET changes (see new Figure 5âfigure supplement 1C-D). To emphasize this comparison, we have now broken up the kinetics data into two main figures: Figure 5 shows a comparison between inter-LBD glutamate-induced kinetics and inter-TMD LY48-induced kinetics and Figure 6 shows a comparative analysis of different PAMs. Notably, the speed of different PAMs is only slightly enhanced with fast perfusion (see Figure 6A,B) and all PAMs, despite showing differences relative to each other, show slower kinetics than glutamate. In Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and B we show comparisons between a calculated time course for drug exchange into the bath, the expected binding curve for a concentration ten times the EC<sub>50</sub>, and the raw FRET responses for 100 ÂµM glutamate with LBD FRET (A) or for 10 ÂµM LY48 with TMD FRET (B).</p><p>Along the lines of this analysis, an important point we have added to the Discussion section is that the lack of a binding site for endogenous ligands within the TMD, suggests that there has been limited evolutionary constraints on this binding site. This, as previously suggested in many pharmacological contexts (see Niswender and Conn, 2010), could explain why subtype-specific ligands are easier to develop for this site, and also is consistent with the slow and variable kinetics observed.</p><p>A secondary observation is that PAM (LY48, CBiPES and TASP) OFF kinetics, but not glutamate OFF kinetics, are weakly dose-dependent (see Figure 5C and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A). Given our rapid perfusion conditions, this dose-dependence is unlikely to be due simply to re-binding as a consequence of slow wash-out. Slow wash-out from lipidic compartments, which has previously been shown to produce dose-dependent OFF kinetics for hydrophobic drugs targeting GABAA receptors (see Gingrich et al., 2009), is the likely explanation for this result, which we discuss in subsection âConformational and Functional Diversity of mGluR Allosteric Modulators<bold>â</bold>. An extreme case of such an interaction with the membrane is seen with BINA which is very hydrophobic (cLogP â 7.8). In contrast to the 3 other PAMs tested, BINA responses in both the TMD FRET (Figure 6A) and GIRK assays (Figure 6C) were completely irreversible, even under high speed perfusion. We believe this is an important result that can be explained by a membrane partitioning model. In figure 6D, we show that the NAM MNI 137 reverses the BINA-induced FRET increase, but that a BINA response returns following MNI washout. This result points to a population of BINA molecules that are unable to be washed out because they are partitioned either into the plasma membrane or intracellular membranes. In addition, we use a well-established in vitro liposome-based assay (Ingolfsson and Andersen, 2010) to show that BINA, to a greater extent than all other PAMs, alters the physical properties of the membrane. To clarify this measurement, we have provided a schematic and representative traces to more clearly describe this experiment (Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A,B). We have also added information on reported logP values for each PAM and NAM tested to the text to provide more context.</p><p>To further probe PAM kinetics, we have also reported the effects of a dominant negative G protein, which stabilizes the active state of the TMDs (Figure 6âfigure supplement 2). As reported in the original manuscript, G protein accelerated both the ON and OFF kinetics of the response to LY48. We now include data obtained with rapid perfusion where the general acceleration effect is maintained and dose-dependence of the OFF kinetic response is clear. The effect observed for ON kinetics is consistent with the enhanced apparent affinity that G protein enables. The counterintuitive effect on the OFF kinetics suggests, as we posited in the initial submission, that G protein stabilizes an active state with enhanced accessibility with the extracellular solution to enable more rapid reversal.</p><p>Finally, we also report updated kinetic data for Ro 64 obtained with fast perfusion. Consistent with the data in the original manuscript, Ro 64 shows ON kinetics that are comparable to LY48 (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B) but OFF kinetics that are much slower than those of LY48, TASP or CBiPES. Given the lack of clear effect on the membrane in our in vitro assay (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C) we suggest that this indicates that, in contrast to the G protein effect on the active state, the fully inactive state shows decreased ligand accessibility. As mentioned in the Discussion section, this is in line with recent work showing that the accessibility of GPCR ligands may be state-dependent (Devree et al., 2016). However, we also note in the discussion that the hydrophobic nature of Ro 64 (cLogP â 4.9) may also contribute to its slow reversal.</p><p>The aforementioned experimental and analytical modifications may be found highlighted throughout the Results section and Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The following statements are misleading and should be corrected in light of recent full-length mGluR structures cited in the Discussion section. Abstract: &quot;it remains unknown how mGluR activation proceeds at the level of the transmembrane domains (TMDs)&quot;. Introduction: &quot;It remains unclear if TMDs directly interact with each other&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize if these statements were perceived as dismissive of the progress made throughout the mGluR field on the crucial question of inter-TMD interaction and receptor activation; that was certainly not our intention. At the time of manuscript preparation and initial submission, the full-length mGluR5 structure was not yet reported.</p><p>Nonetheless, we maintain that the general message of our initial statements is valid. In brief, the general view of the field has been that mGluR dimerization is mediated primarily by inter-LBD interactions based on the presence of LBD dimer crystal structures for group I, II and III subtypes (Kunishima et al., 2010; Tsuchiya et al., 2002; Muto et al., 2007; Monn et al., 2015; Koehl et al., 2019), trFRET measurements of receptor constructs lacking the LBD (El Moustaine et al., 2012) and indications that GPCR transmembrane domains do not typically form stable dimers (see Sleno and Hebert, 2018). However, the relatively well-understood inter-LBD rearrangements that drive activation (Olofsson et al., 2014; Vafabakhsh et al., 2015; Levitz et al., 2016) have raised the question of inter-TMD interaction and rearrangement. A number of elegant FRET studies revealed inter-TMD rearrangement in full-length receptors following agonist binding based on the insertion of fluorescent proteins into intracellular loops or at the C-terminus (Tateyama et al., 2004; Tateyama and Kubo, 2006; Marcaggi et al., 2009; Hlavackova et al., 2012). These studies, which focused on group I mGluRs, only assessed the effects of orthosteric agonists, and were performed in constructs that were unable to couple to G proteins raising the need for further work in this area. At the same time, atomic resolution structures have provided further motivation for the study of inter-TMD interactions. More recently, a NAM-bound crystal structure of the mGluR1 TMD showed cholesterol-mediated dimerization (Wu et al., 2014) but NAM-bound structures of the mGluR5 TMD are monomeric (Dore et al., 2014; Christopher et al., 2015). Unfortunately, no structural information is available regarding group II or III transmembrane domains. However, a landmark study by Xue et al., (2015) showed inter-TMD cross-linking in both inactive and active receptor states. Crucially, all prior studies were not able to distinguish the relative contribution of LBD-driven TMD rearrangements versus those that are driven autonomously at the level of the TMDs, particularly in response to PAMs and NAMs. Most recently, full-length cryo-EM structures of mGluR5 further motivated the need to understand the nature of inter-TMD interactions and the mechanism of action of allosteric drugs. Koehl et al., (2019) found clear inter-TMD interaction between mGluR5 subunits via TM6 in a structure of a glutamate, nanobody and PAM-bound receptor in detergent micelles. Crucially, the TMDs remain in an inactive state in this structure. Interestingly, in the apo structure no clear interaction between TMDs is observed although TM4 and TM5 are positioned opposite each other. It is worth noting that, in contrast to the agonist-bound structure, this structure was solved in lipid nanodiscs rather than detergent. While undeniably a groundbreaking study, this work doesnât clearly decipher the modes of interaction and rearrangement of TMDs during the activation process in a biological membrane. Furthermore, it is highly likely that different receptor subtypes show differences in intra- and inter-subunit interactions that allow them to be tuned to their distinct physiological contexts in different synaptic localizations that sense different glutamate dynamics.</p><p>Together, we believe that this valuable body of work identified the need for further investigations into the ability of mGluR TMDs to interact in different functional states, their ability to rearrange independently of allosteric drive from the LBDs and the functional and conformational effects of allosteric drugs. We chose to focus on mGluR2 because it is the best understood subtype in terms of the initial conformational changes that occur at the LBD and because of the neurobiological and clinical motivation to understand allosteric drugs that target the TMDs of this receptor. The aforementioned open questions, and the associated literature, are explicitly mentioned in the introduction and throughout the Results section and Discussion section to allow the reader to place our study in the broader context of the field.</p><p>To clarify the language and more explicitly acknowledge the insight gained from the recent structures, we have modified these specific statements to read that âit remains unclear how mGluR activation proceeds at the level of the transmembrane domains (TMDs)â and âit remains unclear if TMDs can form stable interactions, whether any such interactions are state-dependent and if potential inter-TMD rearrangements are driven autonomously or depend on allosteric input from the LBDs.â</p><p>We initially aimed to keep the Introduction succinct and simple to avoid an unnecessarily detailed discussion and opted to include a more complete description of the relevant prior studies as they pertained to specific experiments throughout the Results section. However, in the revised version we have included more discussion of prior work, as well as the most recent structural study, in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors propose that Ro-64 works as a reverse agonist, since it deceases the baseline current. However, isn't this just antagonism of a basal activity of the mGLUR2? MNI-137 also decreases the baseline current, but the authors propose that MNI-137 works as a neutral antagonist. Please clarify?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for pointing out the need to clarify this point. By definition an inverse agonist decreases basal activation while a neutral antagonist merely competes for a binding site to inhibit the effects of other drugs (see Wacker et al., 2017 for a recent, comprehensive review of GPCR pharmacology). Mechanistically, this is thought to be a result of the relative affinity of the ligand for different receptor conformations (see Manglik et al., 2015; Staus et al., 2016). We propose that Ro 64 is an inverse agonist because it both shifts the conformation of the TMDs in the absence of any other drug (Figure 6B,C) and because it decreases basal activity of full-length mGluR2 (Figure 6E,F). In contrast, MNI-137 has no detectable effect on receptor conformation in our assay (Figure 6B,C) and also does not produce a substantial change in the basal current evoked by mGluR2 (Figure 6D,F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The fact that Ro-64 (a NAM) induce the same TMD FRET as LY-48 (a PAM) is of somewhat concern: doesn't this mean that the TMD FRET signal is not really a good reporter of activation?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a counter-intuitive result. Indeed, we initially expected NAMs to either have no direct effect on TMD FRET (as was seen with MNI 137) or to decrease FRET based on the increase in FRET observed with PAMs. Such a result would have supported a 2-state model of inter-TMD conformation. We agree that the increase in TMD FRET produced by Ro 64 lends itself to some complications if one were to use this assay naively to screen drugs. However, we also find that the conformational complexity that this FRET increase revealed is an important, unexpected aspect of this paper. We finally note that, because Ro 64 has minimal bilayer-modifying effects (Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C), we can exclude that the Ro 64-induced changes in FRET are due to a non-specific membrane-mediated TMD rearrangement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The FRET equation (subsection âLive Cell FRET Measurementsâ) is not correct for macroscopic FRET analysis. The Fdonor is 50% from dimers with two donor fluorophores. In addition, the Facceptor is a mixture of donor bleed through, direct excitation of acceptors, and FRET excitation of acceptors. Please make corrections to FRET efficiency calculations or, at least, make it clear what the shortcomings of the present calculations are.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the referees about the complexity of calculating reliable FRET values from ensemble measurements in live cells. For this reason, we did not report, or discuss, actual, corrected FRET values or the associated inter-fluorophore distances, but have focused instead on relative FRET changes in response to drug application. Because of the emphasis on relative FRET changes, we did not correct the FRET values. Instead, we have defined the basal FRET level (as determined by the equation efficiency=F<sub>A</sub>/[F<sub>D</sub> +F<sub>A</sub>]) as 1.0 and only analyzed relative FRET changes. Furthermore, all analysis of TMD FRET amplitude has been relative to saturating LY48. To further clarify this point, we have added a description of this to the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In Figure 4C-D: is the DCG-IV concentration saturating? In Figure 6D: what happens if the MNI-137 concentration is increased?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, 10 ÂµM is either saturating or very nearly saturating (~EC<sub>80</sub>-EC<sub>90</sub>) for DCG-IV in the LBD FRET assay as previously reported (Doumazane et al., 2013; Vafabakhsh et al., 2015). We chose this concentration because it has previously been shown by Doumazane et al., that the primary effect of PAM application is to increase the maximum inter-LBD FRET response, rather than to increase the apparent agonist affinity.</p><p>Similarly, 1 ÂµM is a saturating concentration for MNI-137. Initial characterization (Hemstapat et al., 2007) across a range of assays has shown an IC<sub>50</sub> in the 10-70 nM range. In addition, we found that 1 ÂµM fully blocked the functional response to LY48 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B). For comparison, Ro 64 has been reported to have a higher IC<sub>50</sub> of 100-500 nM (Cartmell et al., 1998; Kalczewski et al., 1999) which is why we used 10 ÂµM as a saturating dose. However, to confirm this result we have repeated the functional measurements of inverse agonism with 5 ÂµM MNI-137 and observed identical results. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> summarizes this new data set with 5 ÂµM MNI-137 and 10 ÂµM Ro 64.

However, we wanted to highlight that of all of the drugs tested, this is the only one that did not produce a FRET change on its own. This is consistent with a conformationally neutral response, but we canât rule out the possibility that a conformational change that our sensors are not sensitive to does actually occur. We have altered the sentence to read, ââ¦suggesting that the TMD conformation is not altered, although we recognize that our sensors may not be able to detect more localized conformational changesâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) Subsection âThe role of inter-TMD interaction in mGluR modulation and activationâ.&quot; indicates that these conformational changes likely represent a similar activation process to that initiated by glutamate.&quot; This seems like a stretch too, especially since the NAM induce the same FRET signal.</p></disp-quote><p>To avoid reaching beyond what the data shows, we have modified it to read: âindicates that these conformational changes may represent a related activation pathway to that initiated by glutamateâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) Introduction: &quot;mGluR2.â¦inter-TMD reorientation is underscored by a unique, high propensity for mGluR2 TMD dimerization that is not seen in other group I and II mGluR subtypes or in canonical class A GPCRs&quot;. No question that class A GPCRs are different, but given that class C GPCRs are functional dimers, the &quot;unique, high propensity&quot; for mGluR2 compared to other mGluRs is doubtful, and itâs not convincingly demonstrated that the differences observed are mechanistically significant.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. To clarify, when we discuss the unique dimerization propensities of mGluR2 we are referring strictly to the inter-TMD interaction. As previously reported by many groups, all full-length mGluRs form constitutive dimers to comparable degrees (Doumazane et al., 2011; Levitz et al., 2016), due in part to the conserved inter-subunit disulfide bond that likely renders the assembly irreversible. However, whether the TMDs directly interact with each other at rest and if this changes during activation has been controversial.</p><p>Here we find that the isolated TMDs of all mGluR subtypes tested show a propensity to dimerize above background levels, as defined by comparison to measurements with Î²-2 adrenergic receptors. However, the mGluR2-TMD showed a significantly higher fraction of 2-step photobleaching compared to the mGluR5-TMD and the mGluR3-TMD. This suggests that the nature of the inter-TMD interactions is different among mGluR subtypes. Though we donât anticipate that these differences alter the stoichiometry of full-length receptors, the relative strength of the interactions between TMDs may tune the activation properties for different dimer combinations. Furthermore, the increased TMD dimerization strength of mGluR2 may explain why inactive state cross-linking of mGluR2 was observed in Xue et al., (2015), but that TMD interface was only observed in an agonist-bound state in the mGluR5 cryo-EM study (Koehl et al., 2019).</p><p>To extend this analysis, we have performed the same experiment on the isolated, SNAP-tagged TMD of mGluR1 and observed ~30% 2-step photobleaching which was similar to the TMD of mGluR3 and mGluR5 but significantly less than mGluR2 and more than the Î²-2-adrenergic receptor (see updated Figure 2D). This result further supports the general dimerization propensity of mGluR TMDs and the uniqueness of the mGluR2 TMD dimer interface.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Subsection âPositive allosteric modulators directly activate mGluR2 with minimal contribution from the extracellular domainsâ: &quot;Application of LY48 to cells expressing mGluR2 and GIRK produced large, reversible inward currents that were similar in amplitude to those induced by saturating glutamate (Figure 1B, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A).&quot; This is not true; the data show the response is 70% to that of Glutamate.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this inaccuracy and have modified the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) Figure 6C: the fit to the data for MNI 137 is meaningless; both should be omitted, showing just Ro 64.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for pointing out this error. We did not mean to imply that a fit was possible to the MNI-137 data. We have chosen to keep the data points without any fit in the plot for comparison to Ro 64 as we would like to make it clear that Ro 64, but not MNI-137, produces a measurable FRET change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15) Figure 6 panels D-F: itâs unclear how inverse agonism in F was estimated, and how this relates to the raw data in D and E.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the referees for pointing out the need to clearly explain how inverse agonism was calculated. We have added a description of this to the Materials and methods section. In brief, inverse agonism was calculated as the absolute value of the amplitude of the response to NAM divided by the total current. The total current was defined as the sum of the amplitude of the NAM response plus the amplitude of the glutamate response.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>In this revised manuscript the authors do a much better job of presenting their work in the context of prior studies on mGluRs, explaining clearly how the combination of independent FRET measurements on both the LBD and TMD, in functionally active GPCRs under more controlled conditions, gives greater insight into the action of allosteric modulators and mGluR dimeric assemblies. A limitation of the study is that both positive and some negative allosteric modulators give the same FRET change in the TMD, which the authors model as reflecting two different but unknown conformations. Despite this limitation, the work makes advances that should be of interest to those working on type C GPCRs and perhaps a wider audience. While the manuscript is substantially improved, especially in the Abstract and Introduction, the revised Discussion section reads like a free association of highly speculative ideas, several of which go way beyond what the data can actually address. We encourage the authors to shorten the Discussion, especially the speculation on evolution, kinetics and studies</italic> in vivo.</p><p>We thank the referees for their positive assessment of the revised manuscript and their constructive suggestions for further improvement. As suggested, we have streamlined the discussion to remove passages that are overly speculative and stray from the data presented in this study. The modifications are highlighted in yellow in the revised manuscript and include the following:</p><p>-We removed a sentence challenging the interpretation of previous neurophysiological and behavioral studies with PAMs as our data does not directly address this point (Discussion section).</p><p>-We have removed discussion of potential differences in the allosteric binding site between ligands. Given the lack of reliable structural data in this area, we have chosen instead to simply state that differences in allosteric efficacy are likely a result of distinct poses within a common binding site.</p><p>-We deleted the short passage about the lack of evolutionary constraint on the allosteric binding site to avoid speculation (Discussion section).</p><p>-We removed conjecture about the potential role of membrane-drug interactions in receptor activation kinetics and discussion about possible state-dependent access of NAMs to the allosteric binding site (Materials and methods section).</p><p>-We removed the conjecture about the potential differences of mGluR2 PAMs in vivo and the potential for biased allosteric ligands for mGluRs (Materials and methods section). We now simply mention that our work motivates comparative studies of the efficacy and timing of different allosteric modulators.</p></body></sub-article></article>
