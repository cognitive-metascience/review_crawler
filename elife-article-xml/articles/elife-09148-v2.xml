Here, we show that texture discrimination can be artificially provided in human subjects by implementing a neuromorphic real-time mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT), which emulates to some extent the firing dynamics of SA1 cutaneous afferents. The MNT process was used to modulate the temporal pattern of electrical spikes delivered to the human median nerve via percutaneous microstimulation in four intact subjects and via implanted intrafascicular stimulation in one transradial amputee. Both approaches allowed the subjects to reliably discriminate spatial coarseness of surfaces as confirmed also by a hybrid neural model of the median nerve. Moreover, MNT-evoked EEG activity showed physiologically plausible responses that were superimposable in time and topography to the ones elicited by a natural mechanical tactile stimulation. These findings can open up novel opportunities for sensory restoration in the next generation of neuro-prosthetic hands.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09148.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09148.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09148.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our hands provide us with a wide variety of information about our surroundings, enabling us to detect pain, temperature and pressure. Our sense of touch also allows us to interact with objects by feeling their texture and solidity. However, completely reproducing a sense of touch in artificial or prosthetic hands has proven challenging. While commercial prostheses can mimic the range of movements of natural limbs, even the latest experimental prostheses have only a limited ability to ‘feel’ the objects being manipulated. Oddo, Raspopovic et al. have now brought this ability a step closer by exploiting an artificial fingertip and appropriate neural interfaces through which different textures can be identified.</p><p>The initial experiments were performed in four healthy volunteers with intact limbs. Oddo, Raspopovic et al. connected the artificial fingertip to the volunteers via an electrode inserted into a nerve in the arm. When moved over a rough surface, sensors in the fingertip produced patterns of electrical pulses that stimulated the nerve, causing the volunteers to feel like they were touching the surface. The volunteers were even able to tell the difference between the different surface textures the artificial fingertip moved across.</p><p>The temporary electrodes used in this group of volunteers are unsuitable for use with prosthetic limbs because they can easily be knocked out of position. Therefore, in a further experiment involving a volunteer who had undergone an arm amputation a number of years previously, Oddo, Raspopovic et al. tested an implanted electrode array that could, in principle, remain in place long-term. This volunteer could also identify the different textures the artificial fingertip touched, with a slightly higher degree of accuracy than the previous group of intact volunteers. Further studies are now required to explore the potential of this approach in larger groups of volunteers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

is its ability to gather a rich variety of sensory information about the external world. In particular, tactile information conveyed by the four classes of low-threshold mechanoreceptor afferent units in the fingertips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Johnson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abraira and Ginty, 2013</xref>) is fundamental for manipulation activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edin et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edin and Johansson, 1995</xref>). In addition, the biological sensors innervating the glabrous skin can provide complex types of information such as the onset of the contact with an object, the level of performed grasping force, and discrimination of textural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darian-Smith et al., 1980a</xref>).</p><p>The possibility of providing natural and rich sensory information to hand prosthesis users represents a major achievement. In fact, even though a significant research in biology, medicine and engineering has produced artificial hands that progressively approached the performance of a “natural hand”, it is a shared belief that providing a sense of touch is still the missing milestone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kwok, 2013</xref>). This achievement will allow the “symbiosis” between the user and interface to become more adaptive (to changing tasks and situations), more robust (beyond interfering stimuli), more effective (learn from the past to anticipate or predict the future), and more natural (rapidly becoming part of the body scheme). Therefore, the restoration of sensory perception is the crucial step to achieve in the development of next generation of artificial limbs and hand prostheses, in particular.</p><p>Thus far, promising results have been recently achieved to restore information about the touch of objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2014</xref>) and also the level of produced grasping force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raspopovic, 2014</xref>). The restoration of ability to judge textural features represents the next significant step towards the re-establishment of close-to-natural sensory skills of a natural hand.</p><p>Here, we sought to achieve this goal via an integrated approach to mimic natural coding using a neuromorphic, real-time, mechano-neuro-transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spigler et al., 2012</xref>) (MNT) process through a sensorized artificial finger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Oddo et al., 2011a</xref>) that integrates a Micro Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) tactile sensor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beccai et al., 2005</xref>). In this framework, the temporal coding of tactile information was based on the use of a biologically plausible neural model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Izhikevich, 2003</xref>) , which has shown promise as a versatile and computationally efficient framework for reproducing a wide range of phenomenological neural responses to stimuli.</p><p>In this study, the MNT process was first tested in intact subjects by delivering electrical stimulation to their sensory peripheral nerve fibers during microstimulation via tungsten needle microelectrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vallbo et al., 1984b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Torebjörk et al., 1987</xref>). Furthermore, the effects of natural mechanical stimulation at the fingertip and of the MNT-based electrical stimulation were qualitatively compared in terms of electrophysiological signals elicited in the contralateral sensory cortex of the subjects.</p><p>Moreover, we wanted to evaluate whether the results achieved during needle microstimulation could be translated into experiments, which would be related to the real-time and longer-term use of hand prostheses. In fact, percutaneous needle microstimulation of peripheral nerves cannot be used in amputees as part of an effective long-term assistive device because a stable needle-to-fibers spatial relationship cannot be maintained in a moving limb. Therefore, its use can only be limited to a single experimental session lasting a few hours at most (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vallbo et al., 2004</xref>). Instead, implantable neural interfaces, such as Transverse Intrafascicular Multichannel Electrodes (TIMEs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boretius et al., 2010</xref>) , are surgically positioned and firmly stabilized to adhere to nerve fascicles and do not require an arm rest compared with needle interfaces. Therefore, implantable neural interfaces are suitable for long-term implants. In this study, we developed a novel computational model to investigate the similarities between neural effects, such as in afferent nerve recruitment curves, achieved using microstimulation with percutaneous needles and with TIME neural interfaces. This comparison allowed verification of the possibility of extending the results achieved using percutaneous needle stimulation to TIMEs.</p><p>The MNT process was tested in acute conditions in four intact subjects and was validated in a TIMEs implanted subject with a transradial amputation. For the first time in human hand neuroprosthetics, these integrated approaches allowed to show that discrimination of textural features can be reliably provided to users in different experimental conditions using peripheral intraneural electrical stimulation. The range of tested tactile stimuli in the current work is on the order of millimeters (0.5–3.0 mm). Thus, these stimuli pertain to the lower boundary (towards the fine region) of stimuli that are typically classified as coarse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weber et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiments with intact subjects using needle microstimulation of the median nerve</title><p>The MNT process translates surface coarseness into the injection of current pulses into the nerve.

To understand how the very good surface discrimination, which was shown both by intact subjects with microstimulation and by DAS with the TIME implant, was achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>), we tested which neural features correlated with the difference of SPs. During the conditions of constant sliding velocity (10 mm/s) and regulated load force (400 mN), the periodic contact between the sensor and the texture ridges generated regular patterns in the sensor output. The spiking response was given by a sequence of bursts of reliable duration, time-locked to the alternation of ridges and grooves during the sliding motion of gratings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This suggested that the Inter Burst Interval (IBI, illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>), given by the temporal distance between the onset of consecutives bursts, might characterize the response to each texture. Indeed, the MNT process led to linear correlation between the stimulus SP of each texture and a highly specific IBI (ANOVA test, Tukey Kramer correction for multiple comparisons, p&lt;0.00001) reproducing neurophysiological findings in non-human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darian-Smith et al., 1980a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Phillips and Johnson, 1981</xref>) and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oddo et al., 2011b</xref>) primate studies with similar gratings. Consequently, the difference in IBI between the MNT output that was elicited by the two sides of each stimulus correlated almost perfectly (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.997) with the difference in SP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). Additionally, the behavioral responses of DAS were perfectly (R = 1) fit by a logistic function of the difference in IBI.</p><p>The abovementioned results show that DAS behavioral responses may be based on the temporal structure of stimulation. However, they do not rule out the possibility that the responses were based simply on the count of the total number of spikes injected during each stimulus. Then, we tested whether a rate code not taking into account the temporal structure of the response was able to lead to comparable discrimination of stimuli as the one observed behaviorally. A commonly accepted definition of a rate code is the count of spikes within the time frame of encoding window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Theunissen and Miller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Panzeri et al., 2010</xref>) which in our case is assumed to be the 2 s presentation of each stimulus. Then, the sensor response to each stimulus, based on which we performed the IBI-based analysis, was also quantified by measuring the overall average firing rate (AFR), i.e., the ratio between the total number of spikes emitted during the sliding and the (fixed) 2 s sliding duration. We found that the AFRs generated in response to different SPs were often similar because a larger IBI was associated with a more intense bursting activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). In particular, the AFRs of responses to 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 mm were not significantly different, and the AFRs of responses to 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm were not significantly different (p&lt;0.05 ANOVA test with multiple comparisons). Consequently, the difference ΔAFR in AFR between the two sides of a stimulus correlated very weakly with the difference between their SP (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.066 for ΔAFR vs R<sup>2</sup> = 0.997 for ΔIBI, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9e</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>). Note that no logistic function of the difference in AFR was able to fit DAS behavioral responses (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.04, p = 0.8), which was a significant contrast with the perfect fit achieved with ΔIBI. Therefore, because the total spike count was not able to encode differences between stimuli to a degree compatible with behavioral responses, we concluded that the rate code was not responsible for the subject perception of the presented textures. This further strengthens the hypothesis that the subject exploited the temporal structure of the response to discriminate the stimuli.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> shows the instantaneous firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lánský et al., 2004</xref>) of different responses computed as the inverse of the inter-spike interval. It is apparent that the temporal evolution of the instantaneous firing rate matches the alternation of ridges and grooves. Indeed, it is already known that, when sliding occurs at fixed velocity, the temporal structure of the sensor output is a linear transformation of the spatial structure of the texture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oddo et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">2011c</xref>) , at least for regular textures such as those considered here. Therefore, this is a case of temporal coding of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Theunissen and Miller, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borst and Theunissen, 1999</xref>) : the temporal evolution of the spiking response reflects the time evolution of the stimulus rather than internal dynamics of stimulus encoding. Because the spatial structure is highly regular and the textures primarily differ for a single spatial variable (the SP), it is possible to discriminate between them using the corresponding single temporal variable (the IBI). Then, this may be the feature of the injected spike trains that allows subjects to precisely decode the presented stimuli.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Recent neuroprosthetic studies showed that pressure sensation can be elicited by injecting a train of pulses with a fixed shape and different frequencies via intrafascicular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dhillon and Horch, 2005</xref>) or cuff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2014</xref>) interfaces. Additionally, reconstruction of tactile sensation of force levels and object shape was shown using multi-electrode stimulation via pulses with current amplitude linearly increasing with sensor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raspopovic, 2014</xref>). In contrast, this work focused on eliciting textural features by injecting a biomimetic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saal and Bensmaia, 2015</xref>) temporal structure of pulse trains with a fixed current amplitude in each experimental session. Discrimination of textural features is a remarkable skill of our somatosensory system, which is used in everyday activities to interact with a peri-personal space. The subjects that use hand prostheses will significantly benefit from the restoration of this sensory function, which represents the next desirable feature after recent achievements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raspopovic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ortiz-Catalan et al., 2014</xref>). The results of this study show that the texture discrimination skills can be artificially provided to users using both needle microstimulation in intact subjects and implantable intraneural interfaces in a transradial amputee. Both in needle and TIME-based experiments, the subjects were able to use our ‘artificial’ feedback to perform a 3AFC psychophysical test with very good and comparable performance.</p><p>The similarity between the needle and TIME-based stimulations was predicted by our hybrid FEM-biophysical model, which supported the transition from acute preparation towards chronically implanted electrodes. In addition, this result opens up interesting scientific and clinical opportunities. In the future, needle microstimulation can be used during translational experiments to test different types of peripheral neural coding strategies, which - if successful in this prototypal situation - would be implemented using implantable neural interfaces in disabled patients. Furthermore, model predictions were confirmed by the quasi-perfect discrimination (96% overall stimuli, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a,b</xref> for the analysis on a per-stimulus basis) that was achieved by DAS amputee with TIME stimulation.</p><p>The results of the present study showed that a temporal neuronal coding of spatial structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weber et al., 2013</xref>) can successfully elicit tactile cues in case of coarse surfaces that were explored under a passive- dynamic-touch protocol with a constant sliding velocity and a regulated load force, thus, involving controlled motion of the tactile stimulus while the fingertip was not moving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yoshioka et al., 2001</xref>). In such passive-touch framework there is a lack of voluntary movement. This allows decoupling of cutaneous information (which was our interest in this study) from the kinaesthetic afferent sensory feedback and efference copy associated with movement dynamics. Thus, it was possible to compare the EEG activities evoked by the substitutive neuromorphic electrical stimulation versus the natural mechanical tactile stimulation. No significant differences in topography or frequency modulation clustering were shown by the EEG signals in the two cases.</p><p>The behavioral results showed that injecting the sensor output via a single stimulation channel was sufficient to induce accurate responses (particularly from DAS) in the designed experimental protocol with locked indentation force and tangential velocity of stimulus pairs. Additionally, these experiments allowed us to investigate how the subjects were able to achieve these results in this specific case. In fact, the relationship between IBI and behavioral performance seems to indicate that responses of subject DAS were based on temporal structures of the injected stimuli (which, due to the linearity of our MNT process in mapping the geometry of stimuli, correspond to temporal modulation in the spiking activity captured by the IBI for regular textures), rather than on their average firing rate alone. IBI was previously shown to be given by the ratio between the surface spatial period SP and the sliding velocity V in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oddo et al., 2011b</xref>) and animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weber et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Darian-Smith et al., 1980a</xref>) neurophysiological investigations and in artificial touch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oddo et al., 2011c</xref>) studies. Because in our protocol the sliding velocity V was fixed (10 mm/s), the IBI was proportional to the SP, and so were their differences (∆IBI and ∆SP) between the two sides of the stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>).</p><p>Our results indicate that a temporal single-channel MNT-based intraneural stimulation allows gathering of textural features of medium-coarse surfaces with constant and slow sliding velocity.

The enrolment was subjected to signing a written Informed Consent, approved by the Campus Bio-Medico University Ethics Committee, where this set of experiments took place.</p><p>A neurologist trained in microneurography performed the procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hagbarth and Vallbo, 1967</xref>) , consisting of two phases of electrical stimulation, superficial and percutaneous, necessary to identify the correct site for electrodes insertion. The reference electrode was positioned just through the skin and the active one into the nerve.</p><p>Initially, we stimulated the skin of the right arm of the subject in an area centred 2–3 cm proximal and medial to the elbow. A 1 Hz cathodic biphasic balanced square current was delivered to the subject. Pulse duration was 0.2 ms, while amplitude was changed in the range 1–10 mA. The nerve area was identified whenever a hand muscle twitch occurred in correspondence of 1–2 mA amplitude. Reference and active electrodes were then inserted through subject’s skin, after cleaning.</p><p>A cathodic biphasic balanced square wave was injected through the needles with a frequency of 1 Hz. Pulse duration was 0.2 ms, while the current changed within the 1–100 μA range. The neurologist moved slightly the active electrode towards the inner of the arm seeking for a reported sensation or a muscular twitch over/of the hand. If one of those conditions occurred with amplitude of the injected current between 1–10 μA, the electrode impaled the nerve fiber. The neurologist then moved the needle in the area of insertion until the subject reported a distinct tactile sensation over one of the first four fingers.</p><p>As final evaluation of proper placement of the electrodes, the electroneurogram (ENG) was visualized and acoustically identified: afferent ENG from the median nerve had to be discriminated over the background nerve activity as some mechanical stimuli were exerted over the fingers. Acquisition was performed by means of a system comprising a single channel amplifier (15LT Bipolar, Grass Instrument, USA) and a 16-bit data acquisition board (PCI-6251, NI, USA) installed on a personal computer running a custom interface (Labview, NI, USA).</p><p>The subject was instructed to avoid any voluntary movement that could alter the needle placement once the nerve search procedure was completed. An experimenter-guided session of microstimulation was performed in order to identify appropriate parameters to use in the upcoming 3AFC psychophysical protocol: 500 ms trains of cathodic biphasic balanced squares were delivered while changing frequency, pulse duration (Ts) and amplitude (As) starting from 10 Hz, 5 μs and 2 μA, respectively. The tuning of stimulation parameters was operated heuristically among the subjects while performing pilot trials, such as: a) subject connected to the stimulator while the experimented touched manually the artificial fingertip, b) subject exploring the gratings with the non-stimulated hand and then c) perceiving the same surfaces via the artificial fingertip. An additional experimental session of recording somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunesch et al., 1995</xref>) at 1 Hz stimulation rate was performed with subjects M3 and M4 before starting the 3AFC psychophysical experimental protocol: the spike template was injected in the nerve through microstimulation. Stimulation was delivered as square pulses lasting 200 μs at 1 Hz with a number of repetitions (180 for M3 and 700 for M4) allowing a robust Independent Component Analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artoni et al., 2014</xref>) on EEG data (as detailed in the specific session). In order to allow a better comparison among subjects, stimulation amplitude was individually tailored and chosen as an amplitude that was clearly perceived by the subject, without producing any discomfort (between 5 and 10 μA).

After superficial disinfection of the medial aspect of the left upper limb, placed extrarotated, the skin was cut along the medial edge of the biceps muscle for about 15 centimetres, from few centimetres below the axilla to about 6 cm above the elbow. The ulnar and the medial nerves were exposed along their course, through careful smooth dissection of the dermal and hypodermic structures, fascial bands, and muscles. Following an epineurial microdissection, performed under a surgical microscope (Zeiss, Pentero) to visualize the fascicles, two TIME electrodes were inserted into the nerve trunk of each nerve (median and ulnar, only the former of which was used for electrical stimulation in the present work). Electrodes were pulled inside the nerve, until the embedded active contacts reached the targeted location, close in contact with the nerve fascicles. Cable segments were placed in subcutaneous pockets, while four holes were made in close proximity of the skin incision, two medially and two laterally for the electrode emission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Raspopovic, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Pino et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The electrodes were removed after 30 days, in accordance with EU guidelines.

The tactile stimuli were gratings, fabricated with 3D printing of plastic material (Project HD 3000, 3D Systems), consisting of a sequence of alternating ridges and grooves with spatial period (SP) from a minimum of 0.5 mm to a maximum of 3.0 mm depending on the stimulus and on the half portion of the surface under test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The sequence of presented stimuli was randomized within sessions of 16 trials composed of 4 presentations of the 4 surfaces ∆0.0, ∆1.0, ∆2.0 and ∆2.5. In each session, the 4 trials per each stimulus were composed of 2 trials with presentation of the two surface halves in the SP1-SP2 order (labeled +: ∆0.0+, ∆1.0+, ∆2.0+ and ∆2.5+), and 2 trials with reversed SP2-SP1 order (labeled 2: ∆0.0-, ∆1.0-, ∆2.0- and ∆2.5-). The first half-surface was indented at 400 mN on the artificial fingertip and, after 4 s of indentation without tangential movement, it was slid at 10 mm/s for 2 s under regulated load force. The sliding motion was followed by 2 s of indentation at 400 mN without stimulus movement, and then the surface was detached.

In order to optimize the dipolarity of the independent components (IC) extracted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Artoni et al., 2014</xref>) and to maximize the amount of data fed to the algorithm (while maintaining a sufficient density of information) the EEG continuous data were epoched.</p><p>Data were high-pass filtered using a zero-phase 1 Hz, 24<sup>th</sup> order, Chebyshev type II filter and low-pass filtered using a zero-phase, 45 Hz, 71<sup>th</sup> order, Chebyshev type II filter to remove slow drifts and high-frequency noise respectively, then resampled at 256 Hz. Channels with prolonged prominent artifacts (by visual inspection) or with probability more than five times the standard deviation from the mean across all channels were removed (in the end the remaining numbers of channels were 21, 40, 59, 61 respectively for the four subjects), then a common average reference was used for the remaining channels. Epochs containing high-amplitude artefactual potentials, high-frequency muscle noise and other irregular artifacts, as identified by visual inspection, were removed and remaining data were submitted to AMICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Palmer et al., 2007</xref>), a generalization of the Infomax algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Makeig et al., 1996</xref>) to multiple mixture approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee et al., 1999</xref>) under the hypothesis that the ICs are spatially static (general stationarity, e.g. recording environment). ICA decompositions were performed separately on each subject over all conditions. Stereotyped artifacts such as eye movements, eye blinks and muscle tension were removed by ICA. The ICA decomposition was then saved and reapplied to data, pre-processed using the same described procedure, but high-passed using a 0.5 Hz, 94<sup>th</sup> order, Chebyshev type II filter but using the pre-computed weights.

Similarly to the continuous data, the criteria for epoch removal were the presence of high amplitude artifacts (e.g., Jaw clenching).

Those two aspects were addressed by means of a finite element method (FEM) to solve the voltage distribution generated by injected currents, and by calculating the neuronal dynamics to estimate the axonal response to the electrical stimulation. The volume conductor model implemented via multiphysics FEM (COMSOL Multiphysics, Sweden) can solve Poisson’s equation provided by proper boundary conditions. To do so, an anatomically shaped geometrical model of the median nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jabaley et al., 1980</xref>) was generated by image segmentation (ImageJ, USA). Coordinates of the image segmentation were exported (livelink COMSOL-Matlab) to edit a 3D nerve model (procedure illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Perineurium had a thickness of 3% of the diameter of the fascicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grinberg et al., 2008</xref>) , and coordinates were interpolated. The nerve diameter had a maximum of 4.6 mm and minimum of 2.3 mm, as obtained from unpublished histological data provided by Dr. Xavier Navarro and from post-mortem human cadavers dissections at Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona, Spain. A cylinder, representing the nerve’s outer space, filled with saline, enclosed the nerve. Boundary optimal dimensions of cylinder were found to be 69 mm for the diameter and 140 mm for the height, using convergence calculations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raspopovic et al., 2011</xref>). Electrical ground was therefore fixed in this cylindrical boundary of the structure.</p><p>On the biophysical side, MRG model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>) was used to model the nerve tactile sensory fibers. This model represents the nonlinear modified Hodgkin-Huxley Equations for the active compartment of the axons (the nodes of Ranvier) and a detailed realistic representation of the myelinated tracts. The model (available in NEURON model repository) is capable of reproducing several experimental aspects of cells dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>). Then, a fiber with 21 segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raspopovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>) of nodes of Ranvier was built and extracellular stimulation procedure used to excite the cell. For a fiber of diameter D, a model had internodal spacing L = 100D. A fiber was considered recruited when a generated action potential travelled along its whole length (i.e., reached the last node of Ranvier). The total recruitment was calculated as the portion of the fibers activated for the specific charge injected with respect to the total number of fibers implemented. Furthermore, nodal length was fixed at 1 μm and nodal diameter scaled from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>). A list of plausible assumptions had to be taken, during the model construction. The sensory axon populations were constructed (NEURON, USA) by using a probabilistic distribution of fibers diameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vallbo and Johansson, 1984</xref>) for different tactile units of the human hand, resulting in two Gaussian distributions which differentiate nociceptive fibers from fibers responsible for pressure/touch sensation, and the latter was used. One of the assumptions constraining the model was that the stimulation of different fiber types, such as nociceptive fibers, was not induced, at used current range. A total amount of 100 modeled fibers for each fascicle were placed randomly in the specific target fascicle, for several placements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), as explained in continuation. As the fiber organization within different fascicles in the nerve is unknown, we assumed that fibers within one fascicle innervate the same hand area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jabaley et al., 1980</xref>) (i.e., the fibers in one fascicle are innervating a single finger tip and not many of them). Moreover, since there is an inherent anatomical uncertainty in placement and extension of fibers innervating a specific hand district, for every position of stimulating electrode/needle we implemented 9 populations having different extensions and centroids for the same large fascicle (i.e., spanning from having the whole fascicle uniformly populated, to the case of very concentrated population where the fibers are almost touching each-other, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Then the analysis has been performed for the range of significant fascicle sizes, defined as median size representatives of three groups: small (1 population implemented), medium (5 populations implemented) and large (9 populations). Different device placements were also studied: within, close, or far from fascicle, finally resulting in n = 90 simulations for TIME and n = 45 simulations cases for microneedle (this is because for every position of needle tip there are 2 corresponding positions of TIME: left and right).</p><p>The microstimulation needle (FHC UNP40GAS) was replicated as a cylinder with a cone-like ending (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>): the cylinder had 3 mm length, and cone (tip) with semi-angle 12.78° and shank diameter 250 μm. The whole structure was insulated and had electrical conductivity of 6.67 10–14 S/m and the tip was non-insulated with a conductivity of 1.89 10<sup>7</sup> S/m. Since in the case of microstimulation needle the tip was un-insulated by the neurologist, imminently before the insertion, the precise un-insulated cone dimension is not known. In order to account for this uncertainty, two models were implemented and the results analyzed for both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The TIME electrode was built as a rectangular structure where seven circled active sites were placed in each side of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Conductivity of the polyimide substrate was set to 6.67 10–14 S/m. The radius for the active sites was 40 μm and the thickness 300 nm. The overall structure had 4 mm length, 0.35 mm width and 20 μm thickness. The electrical conductivity values used for the FEM were [0.0826i 0.0826j 0.571k] S/m for the endoneurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raspopovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>) , 880 μS/m for perineurium, 0.0826 S/m for the epineurium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raspopovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>) , 2 S/m for saline.</p><p>Conductivity of perineurium was recalculated from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Weerasuriya et al., 1984</xref>) taking into account the thickness of the perineurium as 3% of diameter of the fascicle and the difference of temperature between frogs and humans. Although TIME electrode was implanted in vivo and no saline placed outside the nerve, this value was used as in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Raspopovic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McIntyre et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The similarity between needle and TIME is estimated by comparison of charges necessary for 10% of recruitment of fibers, for respectively 45 and 90 populations computed, by means of Kruskal-Wallis test, with significance level fixed at 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The Authors are deeply grateful to all the Participants, and in particular to DAS who freely donated six weeks of his life for the advancement of knowledge and for a better future of People with hand amputation.

All procedures were approved by the Institutional Ethics Committees of Policlinic A. Gemelli at Catholic University, where the surgery was performed, IRCCS S. Raffaele Pisana (Rome), where the experiments were performed, the Ethics Committee of Campus Bio-Medico University and the Italian Ministry of Health. Four intact subjects (2 males and 2 females, 25-26 years old) underwent the experiments of texture discrimination with tactile feedback elicited by a stimulation injected through two microneurographic electrodes (FHC UNP40GAS, shaped as needles). The enrolment was subjected to signing a written Informed Consent, approved by the Campus Bio-Medico University Ethics Committee, where this set of experiments took

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper reports further on the very good pioneering work by these authors (previously reported) regarding the sensory/tactile input into the peripheral nerve. This paper extends the previous work, with some different aspects, although there is also a considerable overlap (which must be explained). Specifically, the authors study the use of NMT and TIME, in volunteer studies, in the study of a transradial amputee and in a simulation investigation as a way to restore tactile sensation.</p><p>The main result of neuromorphic stimulation, and neural response are interesting first presentations.</p><p>The strength of the paper is the very detailed experimentation, involving microneurography and the sensory input provided in an amputee. These experiments are aided by giving a biomimetic or neuromorphic input. Further, modeling shows how microneurography and TIM electrodes work comparably. This type of modeling coupled to experiments shows that this paper represents thorough research. The cortical response further validates that sensory perception is observed – this is quite interesting and novel as well. Overall, the work has enormous promise for establishing a paradigm for restoring tactile sensation to patients with limb injuries.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>First, and most importantly, previous work by Raspopovic, more or less lays out the tactile stimulation. Also, the authors have published their sensors work. The new aspect seems to be the biologically plausible model. But the model selected – Izh ikevich is not a biological model of receptors – does not produce receptor-spiking activity and no transduction is built in.</p><p>In the subheading “Mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT) process”, sensor to spike output from Izhikevich is not an ideal receptor to neural activity transformation. The authors should point out this simplification – actually a limitation. The periodic rate output is also a significant simplification. The model produces bursts vs single spikes, but it's not clear it is biomimetic. This interpretation also needs some caution.</p><p>Second, the paper does not clearly and cleanly present what is novel here – and differentiate from many prior papers by the authors. What is novel – the stimulus pattern? The computational model? Comparison with 4 normal, amputee? Distinguish from the prior work by the same group. Please emphasize this point in your response letter and revised manuscript. The question of novelty will be critical in making a final decision on the publication of this work.</p><p>Third, the work presents tactile encoding – in particular coarse + geometric -&gt; shape sensing. This is not clear. Is it only the artifact of their stimulus (grating) or is this the result of perception by the subjects – having tested many stimuli. i.e. is the perceptual output of the given microneurographic access to nerves and penetrating electrodes' access to the fascicles? If so, how specific and representative is it?</p><p>Fourth, the statistical analysis of the data should be improved. The text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> discuss the results of the study in terms of the overall success rate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the breakdown of the responses by subject. There is a conspicuous lack of analysis of the data. The data should be analyzed not by lumping together all of the subjects and reporting an aggregate successful discrimination rate, but rather by individual subject as a function of stimulus type. The coarser the stimulus, the greater the discriminatory power and the weaker the stimulus the less the discriminatory power. There should be an analysis showing that the performance by individual is greater than what would be expected by chance, where chance here is 0.33. If there is an approximate monotone relation among the stimuli then a logistic regression analysis could be performed. The analysis should be conducted using confidence intervals or Bayesian methods and not just simply by reporting p-values. An advantage of a Bayesian hierarchical analysis or a random effects model across subjects is that they provide a formal way of pooling information across subjects. The latter is crucial for this problem because the authors which to establish that they have been able to provide neuromorphically tactile sensation. This statement should be made with an assessment of the accuracy of the discriminatory power of the MNT technique for each subject as a function of stimulus type. It is likely that the results will reveal that more trials will be required to show that there is truly discriminatory capability.</p><p>The authors state that they observed no difference in the natural EEG activity and evoked stimulation in source topography, response timing and clustering. How were these assessments made? They involve negative results and require a power analysis to establish their validity.</p><p>Although the data are more compelling for the TIME technique applied to the transradial amputee patient, a similar analysis should be performed for these data as well.</p><p>The authors wish to establish from their simulation analyses that the response patterns under MNT and TIME are similar if not effectively the same. It is unclear where the uncertainty comes from in these analyses since they are simulation models. Therefore how can statistical assessments of uncertainty and formal statistical inferences be made? Moreover, the authors wish to infer that the stimulation responses of the two modalities do not differ. They report a p-value without a specific statement about the statistical test being used in the analysis. Because the authors wish to establish a negative result of no difference between the two stimulations modalities, they should report a power analysis stating what types and magnitudes of differences their investigations were calibrated to detect.</p><p>The authors do not have to develop an ancillary classifier model to understand the performance characteristics of the MNT and the TIME paradigms. If they build statistical models to analyze the data from the subjects that include covariates that has IBI they will get their answer with the same model being used to analyze the data. This approach would obviate the current analyses which lead to multiple comparisons corrections.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Intraneural stimulation can restore discrimination of textural features by artificial fingertips in humans&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer. The manuscript has been improved but there are a few remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as described below.</p><p>General Comments:</p><p>This paper has been revised, and more importantly, careful and thoughtful rebuttal to all the questions has been provided. Supplementary figures and additional statistical analysis are also appreciated. Overall, the paper is acceptable. The authors should note a few salient points and revise their paper accordingly (no further review is needed).</p><p>This is an outstanding piece of work. The paper has many novel aspects, now better clarified as requested, to point out the texture discrimination capability in humans, different stimuli and temporal coding, comparison with needle vs intrafascicular, etc. The cortical, neural topographic map, and source localization strengthen the paper. The claim about neuromorphic/Izhikevich is now moderated, although the authors still argue that this is representation of tactile receptors, bur arguably this is still a significant approximation based on the Izhikevich model.</p><p>The paper's distinction from the previous, Raspopovic paper is now made and is acceptable. The comments made concerning this, from texture to encoding model, are acceptable.</p><p>The novelty aspect has been responded to: a) Texture discrimination (but not &quot;restoration&quot; – see below);</p><p>b) Hybrid FEM model is very useful and demonstrates TIME's utility and various fiber and recruiting; c) Perceptual studies, both psychophysical and cortical, strengthen the paper.</p><p>Suggested Revisions:</p><p>1) The claim in the Abstract is still too broad: &quot;Intraneural MNT-based stimulation restored discrimination of textural features, thus enhancing the user's tactile capabilities.&quot; The word &quot;restore&quot; is too strong.

Also, the authors have published their sensors work. The new aspect seems to be the biologically plausible model. But the model selected – Izhi kevich is not a biological model of receptors – does not produce receptor-spiking activity and no transduction is built in.</italic></p><p><italic>In the subheading “Mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT) process”, sensor to spike output from Izhikevich is not an ideal receptor to neural activity transformation. The authors should point out this simplification – actually a limitation. The periodic rate output is also a significant simplification. The model produces bursts vs single spikes, but it's not clear it is biomimetic. This interpretation also needs some caution.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment, which allows us to clarify how the mechano-neuro-transduction actually works in our experimental design:</p><p>1) We modified the Methods section in order to better point out the limitations of our model. We highlighted that our model:</p><p>– Is a modified version of the original Izhikevich model, which was conceived to emulate neuron-to-neuron signaling, whereas in our modified implementation its input is haptic rather than synaptic.</p><p>– Does not account for the fine details of the complex spatio-temporal mechanical interaction between physical stimuli, soft tissues and receptors (Hayward et al., 2014).</p><p>2) Notwithstanding these limitations, as discussed in the revised paper, our implementation captures the fundamental properties of the firing behavior of SA1 afferents associated to Merkel receptors, a functionally relevant class of tactile units able to encode medium-coarse textures (Darian-Smith and Oke, 1980, Phillips and Johnson, 1981, Yoshioka et al., 2001, Weber et al., 2013), such as the surfaces evaluated in the present study. Specifically:</p><p>– In the study by Darian-Smith and Oke (e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> of such prior work) the spatial structure of moving gratings characterized by a temporal frequency in the order of 20 Hz is encoded by SA1 afferents into a coherent temporal spiking activity with about one spike per ridge of the stimulus (Darian-Smith and Oke, 1980). Coherently with such previous neurophysiological data, in our study stimuli with 0.5 mm spatial period (resulting in a 20 Hz temporal frequency since the sliding velocity is 10 mm/s) induce about one spike per ridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref> of our manuscript).</p><p>– As shown in our manuscript in the raster plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, the encoding of our coarser surfaces (with 1.0 mm, 1.5 mm, 2.0 mm and 3.0 mm spatial period) reflects the physiological tendency of SA1 units to fire more than one spike per ridge for coarser spatial periods, with bursts properly modulated by the surface structure (towards longer IBI), as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> of the previous study previously by Phillips and Johnson (1981).</p><p>– To evaluate such evidences in a more quantitative way, we added Figure 9—figure supplement 1, that shows the spatial modulation index calculated on the spike patterns of our study, to be compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> of the previous study by Phillips and Johnson (1981). The modulation index shown in the spike patterns produced by our artificial touch system reflects the trend (monotonically growing with the spatial period) that was previously reported with physiological data.</p><p>3) In the revised manuscript we also clarify that the periodicity of the bursts of neural stimulation delivered to the subjects is not inherent to the model, which is able to fire any kind of spike train patterns including the highly irregular ones induced by the contact with complex surfaces. The periodicity is instead a direct consequence of the experimented stimuli, which are periodic gratings and explored with constant velocity. Hence, the spatial structure of gratings is transduced in a temporal sequence that maps the textural/geometrical features of the stimuli. The capability of the implemented model to generalize with daily life naturalistic stimuli (either macroscopically aperiodic, such as latex and velvet, or with a fine periodic structure such as textiles) was recently demonstrated in a fully-robotic artificial touch study (Rongala et al., 2015), and such set of stimuli will be evaluated in the future protocols with amputees and chronically-implanted neural interfaces.</p><p><italic>Second, the paper does not clearly and cleanly present what is novel here – and differentiate from many prior papers by the authors. What is novel – the stimulus pattern? The computational model? Comparison with 4 normal, amputee? Distinguish from the prior work by the same group. Please emphasize this point in your response letter and revised manuscript. The question of novelty will be critical in making a final decision on the publication of this work.</italic></p><p>The main novelties of this work are hereafter summarized (and better explained in the manuscript):</p><p>1) This paper shows for the first time the possibility to restore in amputees, and induce in intact subjects, the real-time texture perception of surfaces with medium-coarse geometries, using a biologically-inspired mechano-transduction approach (see previous reply). We are thus moving from contact and pressure information (presented in Raspopovic et al., 2014) to texture recognition, which is a more sophisticated kind of tactile information (Saal and Bensmaia, 2015). A detailed comparison with previous works is shown in this letter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>.</p><p>The feasibility of our method is shown during experiments involving both a transradial amputee with implanted TIME neural interface and intact subjects with electrical nerve fibers stimulation via percutaneous insertion of needle microelectrodes. Such parallel experimental study of an acute (percutaneous microstimulation) and a chronic (implanted TIME) neural stimulation technique is novel in neuroscientific and neuroprosthetic research.</p><p>2) The innovative hybrid FEM-neural model of human median nerve shows needle microstimulation and TIME stimulation similar outcomes, justifying the translation of the paradigm from acute to chronic implementation. As a consequence, microneedle experiments can be used in the future as a methodology to test new stimulation patterns and innovative artificial fingers/sensors, that afterwards are translated to amputees with implantable intraneural interfaces.</p><p>3) Together with subjective perception, the quantitative analysis of EEG activity allowed to identify the brain areas mainly targeted by the different stimuli, supporting the hypothesis that the electrical stimulation was biologically plausible (i.e., similar to mechanical stimulation of the intact fingertip).</p><p>The first and main goal listed above has been achieved by changing the experimental setup described in the previous study (Raspopovic et al., 2014), as follows:</p><p>– Improving the quality of the sensors embedded in the fingertip to gather more complex tactile patterns during the tasks. This is of course a “pre-condition” to provide the complex tactile information to the user. Several recent papers (Zang et al., 2015, Tee et al., 2015) even if extremely interesting are able to provide only one-dimensional pressure information. This paper will be the first one showing in neuroprosthetics the potentials of triaxial sensors, that can resolve the normal and shear components of mechanical interaction (with a focus on the shear component, in this study) applying a computational model to achieve neuromorphic spiking transduction. This transduction mechanism is successfully used with human subjects for the first time in this paper, whereas the feasibility only in artificial touch studies had been previously shown (as necessary from scientific and ethical viewpoints to avoid exposing the human subjects to unnecessary invasive procedures). Here, we show that the human nervous system can make use of such information as machine-learning methods could with fully robotic experiments not involving humans in the loop.</p><p>– In conclusion, as shown in the “Encoding variable” column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Author response image 1</xref>, the way the stimuli encode in the pulses here is complementary to the approach followed in the previous study (Raspopovic et al., 2014). There, the delivery of current pulses to the nerve had a fixed frequency and duration within each session and was modulated in amplitude, thus temporal coding had not been implemented. In such case the number of afferent fibers recruited grew monotonically with the stimulation charge and hence the perceived force modulates accordingly, as discussed in a recent review (Saal and Bensmaia, 2015). Conversely, in the present study percepts about textural features were induced modulating the temporal structure of the spiking activity delivered through the nerve without modulating the pulses amplitude (nor the pure firing rate as shown by the analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D-E</xref> in the manuscript).</p><p>– Overall, these are major hardware and computational differences with respect to our previous paper, and were introduced in this study in order to target different qualities of tactile perception, showing, for the first time, feasibility of restoration of texture recognition with “bionic” hand prostheses.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09148.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison of tactile neural sensory feedback techniques across literature.</title><p>Induced tactile sensations are classified as in a recent review (Saal and Bensmaia, 2015).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09148.022">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09148.022</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09148-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Third, the work presents tactile encoding – in particular coarse + geometric -&gt; shape sensing. This is not clear. Is it only the artifact of their stimulus (grating) or is this the result of perception by the subjects – having tested many stimuli. i.e. is the perceptual output of the given microneurographic access to nerves and penetrating electrodes' access to the fascicles? If so, how specific and representative is it?</italic></p><p>The goal of the study was to verify that using intraneural stimulation subjects can gather information about textural features of medium-coarse stimuli. As discussed before, the spiking activity is generated according to the type of mechanical stimuli presented and we expect generalization capability with different textures. The following points better clarify this aspect in details and discuss the changes made to the paper:</p><p>1) All the subjects were asked to qualitatively evaluate the experienced stimulation, and all could perceive the received electrical neural stimulation as similar to mechanical alternation between ridges and gaps. Such point was better clarified in the text.</p><p>2) To better clarify how we delivered the neural stimulation patterns to the subjects, we decided to change the labels of the experimented surfaces from the previous A1, A2, B1, B2, C1, C2, D1, D2 to ΔSP+/-, where ΔSP is the difference (in mm) in spatial period between the two halves of the surface and + or – indicates whether the spatial period is increasing or decreasing (with + or – for the constant stimulus having no effect, but being used because the surface was presented half times in one side and half of occurrences in the other side to avoid polarizing the experiment in case of fabrication asymmetries). Labeling of surfaces was then changed to: Δ2.5+, Δ2.0+, Δ1.0+, Δ0.0+, Δ0.0-, Δ1.0-, Δ2.0-, Δ2.5- (as shown in the revised manuscript in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>3) Furthermore, the stimuli are now sorted with respect to such difference (with sign) between the two halves of the stimulus, so that the raster plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) and confusion matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>) could now be more straightforward to read.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> of the manuscript, the raster plot represents the spikes that were generated while scanning the gratings on the sensorized region of the artificial fingertip, as represented by the mechano-neuro-transduction (MNT) process. Such spikes are delivered to the neural pathways to elicit artificial percepts by means of implanted TIME interface for the amputee subject or by means of the needle electrode for the intact subjects.</p><p><italic>Fourth, the statistical analysis of the data should be improved. The text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> discuss the results of the study in terms of the overall success rate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows the breakdown of the responses by subject. There is a conspicuous lack of analysis of the data. The data should be analyzed not by lumping together all of the subjects and reporting an aggregate successful discrimination rate, but rather by individual subject as a function of stimulus type. The coarser the stimulus, the greater the discriminatory power and the weaker the stimulus the less the discriminatory power. There should be an analysis showing that the performance by individual is greater than what would be expected by chance, where chance here is 0.33. If there is an approximate monotone relation among the stimuli then a logistic regression analysis could be performed. The analysis should be conducted using confidence intervals or Bayesian methods and not just simply by reporting p-values. An advantage of a Bayesian hierarchical analysis or a random effects model across subjects is that they provide a formal way of pooling information across subjects. The latter is crucial for this problem because the authors which to establish that they have been able to provide neuromorphically tactile sensation. This statement should be made with an assessment of the accuracy of the discriminatory power of the MNT technique for each subject as a function of stimulus type. It is likely that the results will reveal that more trials will be required to show that there is truly discriminatory capability.</italic></p><p>We carefully followed all such constructive comments made by the reviewers, as discussed below:</p><p>1) First, in the revised manuscript we computed a statistical analysis per individual subject, as a function of stimulus type, showing that the performance by individuals is greater than what would be expected by chance, conducted using confidence intervals. As shown in the new panels, added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> (illustrated below), for all four subjects involved in the percutaneous electrical microstimulation protocol, we found that the 95% confidence interval for the fraction of correct answers (Clopper Pearson exact interval) was entirely above chance level for the surfaces characterized by 2.5 mm and 2.0 mm differences in spatial period ∆SP between the two halves. For subject DAS implanted with TIME interface, the 95% confidence interval was largely above chance level for each single stimulus (see the new panels, added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10b</xref>, illustrated below). Significance is particularly evident in the results with the amputee subject, since the chronically-implanted interface allowed carrying out a quite high number of trials, whereas the percutaneous electrical microstimulation in intact subjects is a technique prone to interruption due to the possible sudden loss of contact between the electrode and the nerve. Hence, with acute microstimulation the number of trials could not be arbitrarily increased on a per-subject basis but still the current sets of trials provide evidence that the stimulations induced significant discriminatory capability in each subject.</p><p>2) We thank the reviewers for the constructive suggestion to perform a logistic regression analysis to investigate whether there was an approximate monotone relationship between the rate of correct response and the difference in spatial coarseness of the perceived stimuli. This analysis is shown in the new panels added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10c</xref>.</p><p><italic>The authors state that they observed no difference in the natural EEG activity and evoked stimulation in source topography, response timing and clustering. How were these assessments made? They involve negative results and require a power analysis to establish their validity.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for addressing this important issue. In the revised manuscript we now clearly specify each test applied to assess statistical significance. We also ran the requested power analysis for each comparison, to investigate the validity of the results.</p><p>More specifically, with respect to the response timing, the test used for the statistical comparison was a Montecarlo statistics with cluster correction for multiple comparisons. It is now specified in the Methods (in the section entitled EEG signal processing), as follows:</p><p>“Event-related potentials (ERPs) were time-locked to the onset of either the electrical microstimulation or of the sliding phase of the mechanical stimulation. ERPs were normalized for the standard deviation of the prestimulus (1000 ms). ERP’s statistical significance between conditions (electrical microstimulation vs. mechanical stimulation) was assessed using a Montecarlo statistics with cluster correction for multiple comparisons (triangulation and maxsum as clustered statistics)(Maris and Oostenveld, 2007), adapted from the FieldTrip toolbox (Oostenveld et al., 2011).”</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we computed a power analysis (GPower, Duesseldorf, Germany) on the ERPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of the manuscript, with the following comparisons:</p><p>1) Sample size computation based on the effect size of the prestimulus and the ERP evoked by electrical microstimulation;</p><p>2) Sample size computation based on the effect size of the prestimulus and the ERP evoked by mechanical stimulation;</p><p>3) Sample size computation based on the effect size of the prestimulus recorded during the sessions with electrical microstimulation and of the prestimulus recorded during the sessions with mechanical stimulation;</p><p>4) Sample size computation based on the effect size of the ERP evoked during the sessions with electrical microstimulation and of the ERP evoked during the sessions with mechanical stimulation.</p><p>For the above conditions 1 (prestimulus vs. ERP evoked during electrical microstimulation) and 2 (prestimulus vs. ERP evoked during mechanical stimulation), with our sample size of 4 subjects the power of the test was 0.75 and 0.79, respectively, as illustrated below in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p>Conversely, the sample size required to reach a comparable power was greater than 75 subjects for both the above conditions 3 (prestimulus recorded during electrical microstimulation sessions vs. prestimulus recorded during mechanical stimulation sessions) and 4 (ERP evoked during electrical microstimulation sessions vs. ERP evoked during mechanical stimulation sessions), as illustrated below in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>.</p><p>We therefore conclude that despite the small sample size, our data are sufficient to statistically highlight the activity evoked by both electrical and mechanical stimulations compared to the prestimulus baselines, and that the lack of significant differences in the ERP triggered by electrical and mechanical stimulations is as valid as it is the lack of differences between the corresponding baselines.</p><p><italic>Although the data are more compelling for the TIME technique applied to the transradial amputee patient, a similar analysis should be performed for these data as well.</italic></p><p>Unfortunately we do not have EEG recordings for the experiments with the amputee subject, but only those from the intact volunteers (a still completely original set of data). Furthermore, now the implanted electrodes have been removed from the stump of the amputee (though being still very well performing at the end of the experiments) as planned in the protocol approved by the ethical committee, preventing the possibility of further recordings with DAS subject.</p><p><italic>The authors wish to establish from their simulation analyses that the response patterns under MNT and TIME are similar if not effectively the same. It is unclear where the uncertainty comes from in these analyses since they are simulation models. Therefore how can statistical assessments of uncertainty and formal statistical inferences be made? Moreover, the authors wish to infer that the stimulation responses of the two modalities do not differ. They report a p-value without a specific statement about the statistical test being used in the analysis. Because the authors wish to establish a negative result of no difference between the two stimulations modalities, they should report a power analysis stating what types and magnitudes of differences their investigations were calibrated to detect.</italic></p><p>The present model is a realistic computational model of the human median nerve, implemented starting from the realistic anatomical picture and fiber distribution data (as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The uncertainty for the two simulated devices is explained in the continuation: a total amount of 100 modeled fibers for each fascicle were placed randomly in the specific target fascicle, for several placements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> of the manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> added to this letter). As the fiber organization within different fascicles in the nerve is unknown, we assumed that fibers within single fascicles belong to the same functionality. Moreover, since there is an inherent anatomical uncertainty in their placement and extension, for every position of stimulating electrode/needle we implemented nine populations having different extensions and centroids for the same fascicle (i.e., spanning from having the whole fascicle uniformly populated, to the case of very concentrated population where the fibers are almost touching each-other, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> of the manuscript, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This is carried out since a-priori it is unknown whether the population of interest is concentrated in the small portion of a fascicle, or possibly uniformly distributed over it, and by simulating different populations placement we are emulating the inherent biological variability. Then the analysis has been performed for wide range of cases (for small, medium and big fascicles, with devices placed within, close, or far away from it), finally resulting in n=90 simulations for TIME and n=45 simulations cases for microneedle (this difference is due to the fact that in every position implemented for one needle tip the TIME electrode had 2 sites: right and left ones, at the same position).</p><p>The stimulations effects achieved by using microneedle and TIME interfaces (an example for one TIME active site is shown in this letter in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Author response image 2</xref>) were simulated, in order to understand whether the results obtained with microneedle in intact subjects could be translated (in terms of recruited population and respective current necessary) to TIME interface in an amputee.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09148.023</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>An example of the simulated stimulation of neural fibers by means of TIME interface, with the active site of the electrode close to, but outside from, the fascicle of interest (different populations are under-represented for the sake of proper visualization).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09148.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09148.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-09148-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig></p><p>The model indicated that the stimulated portion of axonal population is similar for the two interfaces. In fact, we evaluated the statistical similarity between the injected charges necessary to reach the threshold of recruitment (defined at 10% of recruited fibers among the simulated population) for the two devices. The hypothesis of normality was studied for the groups resulting in non-parametric distributions. In order to compare non-parametric distributions we chose Kruskal-Wallis test (one-way analysis of variance by ranks). It is a non-parametric test, suitable for the case of populations with not equal number of samples, and we chose the threshold p-value of 0.05. Such information was now integrated in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Our statistical test is comparing the values of charge necessary to achieve a recruitment of 10% of fibers, and is tuned to take into account 5 nC as the magnitude of difference (that has been shown in the precedent stimulation studies to be the minimum range “differentiable”). For such a value, our sample of 135 overall simulations holds the power of test at 0.95 (G-Power, Dusseldorf, Germany).</p><p><italic>The authors do not have to develop an ancillary classifier model to understand the performance characteristics of the MNT and the TIME paradigms.

This approach would obviate the current analyses which lead to multiple comparisons corrections.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment that, jointly with the fourth point above, triggered us to complement the analysis of the psychophysical results and their correlation with electrophysiological data. As described in the reply to the fourth comment and figures therein we assessed the correlation between stimulus coarseness and the decoding performance for both microstimulation with intact subjects and implanted neural interface with transradial amputee. This is now shown in the revised version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, and discussed in the manuscript. In the manuscript we also report that a logistic fit of performance works for IBI but not for average firing rate since the latter does not correlate with coarseness.</p><p><italic>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</italic></p><p><italic>Suggested Revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) The claim in the Abstract is still too broad: &quot;Intraneural MNT-based stimulation restored discrimination of textural features, thus enhancing the user's tactile capabilities.&quot; The word &quot;restore&quot; is too strong.

Actually, the long-term restoration/recovery of tactile sensory skills for upper limb amputees is one of our next scientific and technological objectives. Hence, following the invitation to revise the wording, we changed “restore” to “elicit”. The changes were operated to the title, the Abstract and through all the manuscript when related to the specific findings of this work. Somewhere in the manuscript “restored” was left, particularly when referring to long-term objectives (e.g., “the restoration of sensory perception is the crucial step to achieve in the development of the next generation of artificial limbs and hand prostheses in particular”). The sentence “thus enhancing the user’s tactile capabilities” has been removed from the Abstract since it was an unnecessary comment.</p><p><italic>2) Paragraph two, subheading “Analysis of neural coding strategies”: This information pertains to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10 (e)</xref>. The message that the rate (in e, worse) vs temporal code (in d, good) is getting lost in this paragraph. This is an important observation and clarification would help. The figure caption could be more explanatory too.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for triggering the revision of such paragraph in the manuscript in order to point out the message that the temporal structure of the injected spike trains can explain behavioural results, whereas a rate code could not.

We also modified the title of the two panels to made their content clearer.</p><p><italic>3) Paragraph two, subheading “Hybrid electrical-biophysical model of the median nerve for the comparison between microstimulation needle and implanted TIME”</italic>: <italic>As the fiber organization within different fascicles in the nerve is unknown, we assumed that fibers within the fascicles belong to same functionality.</italic></p><p><italic>Please clarify how nociceptive fibers were separated from sensory (e.g. see the comment pertaining to the model). Indeed, this issue or not being able to separate different fiber types is quite critical and must be marked as a limitation.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for this very useful observation that triggered us to change the wording within the text accordingly. Indeed when stating that the fibers within the same fascicle belong to same functionality, we meant that they are innervating the same area (e.g. the tip of second finger), not that they are of the same type. Now this is corrected. While as regarding the nociceptive fibers, they are the ones with the smallest diameter and are therefore the last to be stimulated, as shown in previous studies (McNeal, 1976). Since in our study and model we were more interested about the recruitment at the threshold or at half-range of sensation, the nociceptive fibers stimulation is not induced. However, as suggested by reviewers, in the revised text we also introduced into the list of the limitations (called model assumptions), the one regarding the separation of the different fiber types. The related revised text is reported hereafter.</p><p>“A list of plausible assumptions had to be taken, during the model construction. […]One of the assumptions constraining the model was that the stimulation of different fiber types, such as nociceptive fibers, was not induced, at used current range.”</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: Traces and colors are not well explained.</italic></p><p>The caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> was revised.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> caption: The X marker represents the targeted fascicle where the fiber activation per 9 different populations was calculated. What does this mean (what populations?) for different locations of microneedle and TIME? This procedure is carried out analogously for medium and small fascicles, confirming results. Please could you also clarify the procedure.</italic></p><p>This point was now better explained within the revised manuscript, in the Materials and methods section, in the caption of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. Since there is an inherent uncertainty in the placement and extension of fibers innervating a specific hand district, for every position of stimulating electrode/needle we implemented 9 populations having different extensions and centroids for the same large fascicle (i.e., spanning from having the whole fascicle uniformly populated, to the case of very concentrated population where the fibers are almost touching each-other, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Then the analysis has been performed for the range of significant fascicle sizes, defined as median size representatives of three groups: small (1 population implemented), medium (5 populations implemented) and large (9 populations). Different placements of the electrodes were simulated as well as illustrated in the figure. The captions of all figures related to this topic were changed accordingly.</p><p><italic>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: outcomes.
