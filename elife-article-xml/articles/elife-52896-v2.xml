How specific mRNAs are recruited to cytoplasmic RNA granules is not known. Here, we characterize the transcriptome and assembly of P granules, RNA granules in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ plasm. We find that P granules recruit mRNAs by condensation with the disordered protein MEG-3. MEG-3 traps mRNAs into non-dynamic condensates in vitro and binds to ~500 mRNAs in vivo in a sequence-independent manner that favors embryonic mRNAs with low ribosome coverage. Translational stress causes additional mRNAs to localize to P granules and translational activation correlates with P granule exit for two mRNAs coding for germ cell fate regulators. Localization to P granules is not required for translational repression but is required to enrich mRNAs in the germ lineage for robust germline development. Our observations reveal similarities between P granules and stress granules and identify intrinsically-disordered proteins as drivers of RNA condensation during P granule assembly.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>RNA granules</kwd><kwd>germ line</kwd><kwd>phase transition</kwd><kwd>intrinsically-disordered proteins</kwd><kwd>germ granules</kwd><kwd>MEG-3</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 HD37047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seydoux</surname><given-names>Geraldine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007445</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ouyang</surname><given-names>John Paul T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3 recruits mRNAs to P granules by forming gel-like condensates with ribosome-depleted mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>RNA granules are RNA/protein condensates that assemble in the absence of limiting membranes. RNA granules form by phase separation, a de-mixing process that drives condensation of RNA and proteins into liquid or gel-like phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Weber and Brangwynne, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mittag and Parker, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alberti et al., 2019</xref>). Intrinsically-disordered domains in RNA-binding proteins mediate labile, multivalent protein-protein interactions that drive phase separation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shin and Brangwynne, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mittag and Parker, 2018</xref>). RNA also drives phase separation by acting as a scaffold for multivalent RNA-binding proteins or by participating in intermolecular RNA:RNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>). RNA:RNA interactions can be sequence-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Langdon et al., 2018</xref>) or non-sequence specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>). Total RNA extracted from yeast cells phase separates in vitro in the absence of any proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Treeck et al., 2018</xref>). Phase separation of ânaked RNAâ has been proposed to drive the assembly of stress granules, RNA granules that form under conditions of translational stress when thousands of mRNA molecules are released from polysomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bounedjah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van Treeck and Parker, 2018</xref>). Disordered domains in proteins interact with RNA and readily phase separate with RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zagrovic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hentze et al., 2018</xref>), but whether these domains participate directly in mRNA recruitment in vivo has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we report that intrinsically-disordered proteins play an essential role in RNA recruitment and condensation in the context of P granules.</p><p>The P granules of <italic>C. elegans</italic> are a well-studied model for cytoplasmic RNA granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Strome, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seydoux, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Marnik and Updike, 2019</xref>). P granules are present throughout germline development; in this study, we focus exclusively on embryonic P granules. Embryonic P granules are heterogeneous assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2014</xref>) that contain at least two phases with distinct dynamics: a liquid phase assembled by the RGG domain proteins PGL-1 and its paralog PGL-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Updike et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saha et al., 2016</xref>), and a supporting gel-like phase, assembled by the intrinsically-disordered protein MEG-3 and its paralog MEG-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). MEG-3 forms small, non-dynamic condensates (&lt;500 nanometers) that associate with the surface of larger, dynamic PGL condensates (&gt;500 nanometers). MEG condensates enrich in the posterior cytoplasm of zygotes where they recruit and stabilize PGL condensates inherited from the oocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). Preferential assembly of P granules in the zygote posterior ensures their preferential inheritance by germline blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). P granules contain polyadenylated mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Seydoux and Fire, 1994</xref>), but so far only four mRNAs have been reported to localize to P granules in embryos (<italic>pos-1</italic>, <italic>mex-1</italic>, <italic>gld-1</italic> and <italic>nos-2;</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schisa et al., 2001</xref>). <italic>nos-2</italic> codes for a homolog of the conserved germline determinant Nanos that specifies germ cell fate redundantly with <italic>nos-1</italic>, another Nanos homolog expressed later in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Subramaniam and Seydoux, 1999</xref>). The mechanisms that recruit <italic>nos-2</italic> and other maternal mRNAs to P granules are not known but could involve phase separation with PGL or MEG proteins since both have been reported to phase separate with RNA in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Saha et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>mRNAs are recruited into P granules by the MEG phase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Abbreviated embryonic lineage showing the somatic (AB, EMS, C, and D) and germline (P) blastomeres.Â Green dots represent P granules.

We chose these two proteins because MEG-3 and PGL-1 are essential (with their respective paralogs MEG-4 and PGL-3) to assemble the gel (MEG) and liquid (PGL) phases of embryonic P granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Updike et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanazawa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Putnam et al., 2019</xref>). Early embryos (1 to 100 cell stage) were exposed to ultraviolet light, lysed, and the cross-linked protein/RNA complexes were immunoprecipitated using an anti-GFP antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As a control, we also used embryos expressing GFP alone. The GFP immunoprecipitates were washed stringently, lightly treated with nuclease to trim the bound RNAs, extracted for RNA and deep-sequenced. Sequencing reads were mapped back to the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome (ws235) and used to determine read counts per locus. Read counts obtained in the control GFP iCLIP were used to define a background threshold. We identified 657 transcripts that were reproducibly recovered above the GFP background threshold in two independent MEG-3::GFP iCLIP experiments (âMEG-3-bound transcriptsâ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In contrast, we identified only 18 transcripts above background in the two PGL-1::GFP iCLIPs, despite abundant PGL-1::GFP protein in the immunoprecipitates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). 15/18 of the PGL-1-bound transcripts were also in the MEG-3-bound list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We compared the average normalized read count (RPKM) across the two iCLIPs to transcript abundance in P blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>) or in whole embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), and detected no strong correlation, suggesting that MEG-3 binds a specific subset of mRNAs. Low abundance mRNAs, however, were underrepresented in the iCLIPs and therefore could have been missed in our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>).</p><p>Among the MEG-3-bound transcripts were <italic>nos-2, pos-1, mex-1</italic> and <italic>gld-1</italic>, the four transcripts previously reported to localize to P granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To determine whether other MEG-3-bound transcripts localize to P granules, we used single molecule fluorescent in situ hybridization (smFISH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raj et al., 2008</xref>) to examine the distribution of various transcripts in embryos. We initially analyzed nine transcripts: <italic>nos-2</italic>, six other transcripts in the MEG-3-bound list, and two transcripts recovered in the MEG-3 iCLIPs that did not meet the GFP background cut off. For each transcript, we determined the average granule size in the P<sub>2</sub> blastomere and compared that to the average raw read count in the MEG-3::GFP iCLIPs and observed a strong correlation (RÂ =Â 0.92) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In this analysis, <italic>nos-2</italic> clustered with two other genes also in the MEG-3-bound list (<italic>F35G2.1 and F35C11.5</italic>). Extrapolating from this correlation, we predicted that transcripts that ranked higher than the <italic>nos-2</italic> cluster in the MEG-3-bound list should all localize to P granules. In total, we examined 18 transcripts among this 492-gene set and found that, as predicted, all localized robustly to P granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).

Several lines of evidence indicate that mRNAs are recruited to P granules by direct binding to MEG proteins.

As we report here for P granules, the stress granule transcriptome favors long mRNAs that are ribosome-depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kedersha et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aulas et al., 2017</xref>). Stress granule assembly is enhanced by treatments that release mRNAs from polysomes (heat-shock and puromycin), as we show here for P granules. Recruitment of mRNAs to stress granules is an inefficient process, with only a minority of molecules for most mRNA species localizing in the granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). Recruitment into P granules is also inefficient with onlyÂ ~30% of molecules localizing to granules for two of the most robust P granule transcripts described here. Translational repression is required for localization to P granules, but P granules are not required for translational repression or for mRNA stability, as is also true for stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kedersha et al., 2016</xref>). Finally, P granules contain proteins also found in stress granules (poly-A binding protein, TIA-1 and the DDX3/LAF-1 RNA helicase) and P granules interact with P bodies, as do stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shih et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>). Our findings suggest that, like stress granules, embryonic P granules function downstream of the translational regulation machinery to temporarily hold mRNAs not engaged with ribosomes until their degradation or translation in the germline blastomere P<sub>4</sub>. A recent pre-print (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Parker et al., 2020</xref>) also reports that translational repression is a prerequisite for RNA localization to P granules. Interestingly, P bodies also have been reported to favor translationally repressed mRNAs and to recruit additional mRNAs under translational stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hubstenberger et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Matheny et al., 2019</xref>). Low translation, therefore, may be a common requirement for entry into cytoplasmic granules. Our analyses indicate, however, that not all translationally-repressed mRNAs are recruited equally strongly to P granules. A key question for the future will be to understand what factors beyond low translation contribute to enrichment in P granules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>P granules enrich maternal mRNAs in the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub> to maximize robustness of germ cell fate specification</title><p>What is the function of P granules? A unique characteristic of P granules is their polarized assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Strome and Wood, 1982</xref>). P granules assemble preferentially in cytoplasm destined for germline blastomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Smith et al., 2016</xref>) and consequently mRNAs in P granules are preferentially segregated to germline blastomeres during the first embryonic cleavages. Because mRNA localization to P granules is inefficient, this enrichment is relatively weak but, over 4 cell divisions, boosts mRNAs levels in the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub> over what would have been achieved by equal segregation. <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> mutants, which lack P granules, segregate P granule mRNAs equally to germline and somatic blastomeres, leading to reduced levels in P<sub>4</sub> compared to wild-type. <italic>meg-3 meg-4</italic> mutants are 30% sterile and exquisitely sensitive to loss of germ cell fate regulators. These observations are consistent with previous studies, which showed that embryonic P granules, while non-essential, are required for robust germ cell fate specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gallo et al., 2010</xref>). Embryonic P granules are also required to maintain small RNA homeostasis across generations, likely via the PGL phase which contains Argonaute proteins and other epigenetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ouyang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dodson and Kennedy, 2019</xref>). We propose that embryonic P granules are two-phase, dual-cargo condensates whose main function is to maximize transmission of maternal mRNAs (MEG phase) and epigenetic factors (PGL phase) to the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub>. Importantly, our findings demonstrate that P granules are not essential for translational repression or preferential RNA stability in germline blastomeres.</p><p>What P granule mRNAs code for germ cell fate regulators? Our analyses identified 492 predicted âP granule transcriptsâ. This list is unlikely to be exhaustive, especially since low abundance mRNAs were not recovered efficiently in the MEG-3 iCLIP experiments. We surveyed 18 P granule transcripts by in situ hybridization and identified two that exit P granules and become translated in the germline founder cell P<sub>4</sub>: the known germ cell fate regulator <italic>nos-2</italic> and a previously uncharacterized transcript <italic>Y51F10.2. Y51F10.2</italic> codes for the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of human TRIM32, a member of the broadly conserved TRIM-NHL protein family implicated in protein ubiquitination and mRNA regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tocchini and Ciosk, 2015</xref>). Our genetic findings indicate that 1) <italic>Y51F10.2</italic> functions in germ cell fate specification redundantly with <italic>nos-2</italic> and 2) additional germ cell fate regulators likely exist among the other P granule mRNAs. It appears unlikely, however, that all P granule-enriched transcripts function in germ cell specification. Unlike <italic>nos-2</italic> and <italic>Y51F10.2</italic>, the other P granule mRNAs we surveyed by in situ hybridization turn over before ever releasing from P granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and at least some are known to function in unrelated processes (e.g. <italic>cbd-1;</italic> a chitin-binding protein required for egg shell biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnston et al., 2010</xref>). The MEG phase, therefore, may serve as a relatively non-specific repository for untranslated or low-translation mRNAs, many of which do not function in germ cell fate specification. It is interesting to note that the first step for mRNA selection in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> polar granules also has been proposed to rely on a relatively non-specific mechanism, in that case involving mRNA:piRNA interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vourekas et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, recruitment of mRNAs to stress granules is mostly non-specific with over 80% of mRNA species recruited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Khong et al., 2017</xref>). Sequence non-specific RNA condensation may therefore be a common strategy to spatially segregate mRNAs in cells and embryos.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

To quantify the ratio of smFISH signal in MEG-3::GFP granules, eight single Z planes were extracted and used for image analysis as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p>MEG-3::GFP granules were identified using the nucleus counter plugin as described above. The minimum threshold was set to the two times the mean intensity of the background signal of the image; and the maximum threshold was calculated by adding six standard deviations of the background intensity. A mask generated from objects identified by the nucleus counter plugin was applied to the raw image to extract RNA or GFP intensity. To remove background signal, the mean intensity of an object across the nucleus was measured, and subtracted from calculated RNA or GFP intensities. To calculate the ratio of RNA signal/MEG-3::GFP granule signal in each selected Z plane, the sum of intensities of RNA in identified objects (<italic>I</italic><sub>smFISHg</sub>) was divided by the total intensity of the MEG-3::GFP in the same objects (<italic>I<sub>meg3g</sub></italic>). The intensity ratio of RNA in MEG-3 granules (<italic>I</italic><sub>smFISHg</sub>/<italic>Imeg<sub>meg3g</sub></italic>) before and after heat shock was compared.

Minimum thresholds were set to the mean intensity of the background signal of the image plus 1â2 standard deviations. The maximum threshold was calculated by adding 3â4 times the standard deviation of the background. Using generated masks, the integrated intensity within each object was calculated.

After drug treatment, embryos were washed 3X with egg buffer without drug. Approximately 200â20 Âµm polysterene beads (Bangs Laboratories) suspended in egg buffer were added to prevent embryo compression, and placed on slides for imaging.

Only SYTO 14 granules also positive for MEG-3::Halo were quantified. MEG-3::Halo granules were identified using the nucleus counter plugin as described above. The total intensity of objects was quantified for both 488 (SYTO 14) and 647 (Halo) channels. Total fluorescence intensity was calculated before (I<sub>B</sub>) and after (I<sub>A</sub>) extrusion and used to calculate a fluorescence ratio (I<sub>A</sub>/I<sub>B</sub>). Photobleaching was minimal for MEG-3::Halo; however it was significant for SYTO 14. To correct for photobleaching, total fluorescence intensity was corrected for photobleaching using the average photobleaching rate calculated from the cytoplasm of intact embryos in the imaging area. For some embryos, granules left the field of view and could not be counted.

The work makes two main points. First, it demonstrates that P-granules are formed from untranslating mRNPs that interact in a sequence independent manner with the Meg proteins. This is a nice demonstration of the composition and assembly mechanisms of P-granules and synergizes well with what is known about the selectivity of RNA recruitment to other RNP granules. Second, the work demonstrates that the function of P-granules in development is to promote the localization of specific mRNAs into the P4 cell. This is a very significant contribution. Taken together, this work is an important manuscript and after addressing the comments below should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I think the most important contribution of the manuscript is the demonstration of a clear function for P-granules in the accumulation of mRNAs in the P4 cell. Given this, I suggest:a) Change the title to something like: &quot;P-granules function to drive cell-type specific accumulation of mRNAs&quot;.b) Rewrite the abstract to emphasize this point (or at least mention it).c) Add at least one paragraph in the discussion that makes this point, and supports it with the critical observations. Ideally, this would be followed by second paragraph discussing how the formation of a P-granule creates a localization sink by changing the diffusion rate of granules as compared to individual mRNAs.</p><p>2) Although the authors present convincing data that Meg3/4 are required for P-granule assembly in embryos and can form assemblies in vitro with Meg-3 protein, I would recommend the authors be cautious about their interpretation that &quot;P-granules from by gelation with intrinsically disordered proteins&quot; for a few reasons.a) How do the authors know the assembly is not driven by RNA interactions, and then that RNA assembly recruits Meg-3 to it? At a minimum, the authors should examine the assembly/&quot;gelation&quot; of RNA in their in vitro conditions in the absence of the Meg-3 protein to assure themselves that the RNA-Meg-3 assemblies they study require Meg-3 for assembly.b) Since Meg-3 forms &quot;aggregates&quot; by itself, which are solubilized by RNA, it seems that RNA is altering Meg-3 self-interactions. The manuscript would be improved if the authors could clarify if these Meg-3 aggregates are artifacts of the in vitro system, or do they have biological meaning?c) What is the difference between gelation and assembly in this context? As I see it, the authors show that the RNA and protein assemblies formed in vitro show slow rates of Meg-3 or RNA exchange in a manner affected by RNA length. Why not just call these non-dynamic assemblies since &quot;gels&quot; implies different things to different people. If they are defining an assembly as a gel if it has a slow exchange rate of a component, then they should be explicit about this point. If they are defining a gel as an assembly where every component is interconnected, then referring to these assemblies as gels seems premature.</p><p>3) The work in this manuscript is consistent with Meg3/4 playing a role in promoting RNP condensation when there is a limited amount of untranslating mRNAs. A prediction of this model is that when cells are heat shocked, the increase in untranslating mRNAs will correspondingly drive RNP granule formation. Thus, one predicts that in a meg3/4 mutant, heat shock would restore P-granules. (Similar results have been seen with P-bodies in mammalian cells, where lsm4 RNAi abolishes P-bodies, but when cells are then stressed, P-bodies rapidly reassemble (Kedersha et al., 2005). Given that this is a simple experiment, and if it worked would reveal a new property of P-granules, it would be nice to try, although it is not required for publication.</p><p>3b) A related issue is that it would improve the manuscript to clarify if separate stress granules form under heat shock, or those that form, merge with P-granules.</p><p>4) As I read it, the analysis of mRNAs in Figure 1D that are called as &quot;enriched&quot; in P-granules will also be strongly affected by their abundance. As such, this analysis could miss low abundance but highly enriched mRNAs. I suggest either a) clarify how the analysis was done such that this is not an issue, or b) acknowledge the limitations in the text with how this analysis is performed and the types of RNAs it will miss.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Seydoux and Fire, (1994) showed the enrichment of polyadenylated transcripts in the germline blastomeres of the early embryo; after, a handful of developmentally regulated mRNAs, but not rRNAs, were shown to be enriched in the P granules of early embryos (Subramaniam, 1999; Schisa, 2001). The identity of P-granule bound mRNAs is instrumental to understanding P-granule function in the early embryo, but in the intervening years, this small list of P-granule transcripts has not increased despite attempts from multiple labs.</p><p>In this report, Chih-Yung Lee and colleagues in the Seydoux lab break through this barrier by identifying P-granule transcripts through MEG-3 iCLIP. MEG-3 forms small non-dynamic condensates within P granules, in contrast to PGL protein condensates that are highly dynamic. The authors identify just 18 PGL-1-bound transcripts compared to 657 that bound to MEG-3. 18/18 transcripts from this list localize robustly to P granules, and this localization is MEG-3 dependent.</p><p>The authors show that MEG-3 transcripts demonstrate no apparent sequence conservation, but correlate with a low-occupancy of ribosomes, suggesting that untranslated transcripts have an affinity for P granules. They then show that translational inhibition recruits new transcripts to P granules. Upon translational activation in the germline precursor cell (P4) of nos-2 and Y51F10.2, these transcripts disperse from P granules to localize throughout the cytoplasm. The timing of nos-2 and Y51F10.2 translation is unaffected in meg-3 meg-4 mutants, suggesting that P-granule localization is a consequence of translational repression and that P granules have some role in delivering transcripts that encode germ cell fate regulators to the nascent germline. Recombinant MEG-3 was shown to interact with RNA through electrostatic interactions in a non-sequence specific, but length-dependent manner and these stable interactions persist in both in vitro and ex vivo conditions.</p><p>This paper presents several new and significant advances to the RNP phase-separation and germ-granule fields. Two crucial but addressable criticisms are discussed.</p><p>1) As a control for the MEG-3 iCLIP experiments, the authors perform iCLIP on GFP-expressing embryos. Information for the control (JH1094?) isn't given. The optimal control would express GFP in just the germline blastomeres where MEG-3 and PGL-1 are enriched to avoid identifying the most abundant transcripts in P blastomeres (compared to the whole embryo). Genes like cbd-1, cgh-1, and puf-5 are some of most abundant in the germline. Of the 657 MEG-3-bound transcripts, over half are in the top 1000 germline expressed (11-fold more than expected by chance), and most fall within the top 3000 germline-expressed genes. The statement on line 102 that MEG-3 binds to a specific subset of mRNAs instead of abundant P-blastomere mRNAs will need more supporting data than is currently provided.</p><p>Correlations provided in Figure 1C and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C may be erroneous and serve as a distraction at the beginning of an otherwise very significant study. Instead, the comparison should be with all ~ 15,000 germline-expressed transcripts. Despite a potential lack of MEG-3 specificity, results are still in line with the author's later and well-supported observations that untranslated transcripts in translationally quiescent P blastomeres have an affinity for MEG-3.</p><p>An apparent exception to the transcript abundance correlation is that MEG-3-bound transcripts lack those that encode ribosomal proteins. While not necessary to include in this manuscript, it may be interesting to consider why abundant RPL/RPS (RPG) transcripts do not bind MEG-3.</p><p>2) P blastomeres are translationally quiescent, so shouldn't lower ribosomal coverage of MEG-3 attached transcripts in P blastomeres be expected when the experiment was done on whole embryos? Specificity is not addressed and observations in Figure 2C may be a correlation artifact. While this isn't likely given the later in situ hybridization experiments following translational inhibition, the caveat should be discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52896.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I think the most important contribution of the manuscript is the demonstration of a clear function for P-granules in the accumulation of mRNAs in the P4 cell.
