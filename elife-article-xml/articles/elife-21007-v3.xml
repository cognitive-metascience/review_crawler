It requires recruitment of outer kinetochore microtubule binders by centromere proteins C and T (CENP-C and CENP-T). To study the molecular requirements of kinetochore formation, we reconstituted the binding of the MIS12 and NDC80 outer kinetochore subcomplexes to CENP-C and CENP-T. Whereas CENP-C recruits a single MIS12:NDC80 complex, we show here that CENP-T binds one MIS12:NDC80 and two NDC80 complexes upon phosphorylation by the mitotic CDK1:Cyclin B complex at three distinct CENP-T sites. Visualization of reconstituted complexes by electron microscopy supports this model. Binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12 is competitive, and therefore CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12 and up to four NDC80 complexes. Our observations provide a molecular explanation for the stoichiometry of kinetochore components and its cell cycle regulation, and highlight how outer kinetochore modules bridge distances of well over 100 nm.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21007.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21007.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>kinetochore</kwd><kwd>centromere</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AdG 669686 RECEPIANCE</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRC1093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Musacchio</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 262-2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jeganathan</surname><given-names>Sadasivam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The centromeric protein CENP-T assembles the microtubule-binding interface of kinetochores through direct recruitment of two Ndc80 complexes and indirect recruitment of a third one through the Mis12 complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate chromosome segregation in eukaryotes requires the coordinated action of hundreds of proteins. Subsets of these assemble on centromeric chromatin that is epigenetically specified by the enrichment of centromeric protein A (CENP-A), a variant of Histone H3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guse et al., 2011</xref>). These assemblies, named kinetochores, form the major point of attachment between centromeres and the mitotic or meiotic spindle and couple the force of depolymerizing microtubules to chromosome movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheeseman, 2014</xref>). Kinetochores also function as signaling platforms for the spindle assembly checkpoint and delay the onset of chromosome segregation in the presence of erroneous chromosome-spindle attachments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Musacchio, 2015</xref>).</p><p>The structural core of the kinetochore assembles from two large multi-subunit complexes, the CCAN (constitutive centromere associated network), and the KMN (KNL1 complex, MIS12 complex, NDC80 complex, abbreviated as KNL1C, MIS12C, and NDC80C), which are respectively proximal and distal to the centromeric chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pesenti et al., 2016</xref>). The affinity of the kinetochore for microtubules in the KMN is predominantly mediated by the NDC80 complex, a heterotetramer with an approximately 50 nm long coiled coil region that separates the microtubule-binding calponin homology (CH) domains of the NDC80 and NUF2 subunits from the SPC24 and SPC25 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Ciferri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>). NDC80C is essential to form stable regulated kinetochore-microtubule interactions and its localization at the outer kinetochore is thus a prerequisite for faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLuca et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>).

Studying the respective contribution of CENP-C and CENP-T to outer kinetochore assembly, however, has been complicated by their interdependent localization and their distinct regulation by post-translational modifications. Experiments that targeted either CENP-C or CENP-T to an ectopic chromatin array uncoupled these requirements and demonstrated the ability of both pathways to recruit outer kinetochore components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hori et al., 2013</xref>). An important conclusion from these previous studies is that CENP-C and CENP-T recruit NDC80C in distinct ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The CENP-C-dependent axis, which is now understood in detail, relies on a direct interaction of CENP-C with the MIS12 complex (MIS12C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Screpanti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Przewloka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dimitrova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petrovic et al., 2016</xref>), which further recruits NDC80C via a direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheeseman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrovic et al., 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylation of CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup> at T11 or T85 is sufficient for the binding of SPC24:SPC25.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of CENP-C and CENP-T recruiting MIS12C:NDC80C and NDC80C.

It is firmly established that CENP-T interacts directly with NDC80C, with (humans and chicken) or without (budding yeast) prior phosphorylation by CDK1:Cyclin B of sequence motifs in the CENP-T N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pekgöz Altunkaya et al., 2016</xref>). Complicating the picture, however, CENP-T also contributes to kinetochore recruitment of MIS12C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>). This may appear surprising, because MIS12C and CENP-T bind to NDC80C in a competitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that they can only recruit NDC80C independently from each other. Whether the interaction of CENP-T with MIS12C is direct, and compatible with CENP-T binding to NDC80C, is therefore currently unclear.</p><p>The ability of kinetochores to form multiple low-affinity linkages with microtubules is at the basis of popular models of kinetochore-microtubule attachment such as the Hill’s sleeve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill, 1985</xref>). It is also plausible that crucial regulatory aspects of kinetochore-microtubule attachment, such as the tension-dependent regulation required for correcting erroneous attachments or for stabilization of correct ones, depend on the effective number and distribution of linkages, as recently proposed in elegant modeling studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zaytsev et al., 2014</xref>). A detailed understanding of the stoichiometry of outer kinetochore composition and of its regulation is therefore crucial.</p><p>To address this question, we have embarked on an effort of biochemical reconstitution of kinetochores. This recently allowed us to report that the CENP-A nucleosome recruits two copies of the CCAN complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weir et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we address instead the composition and regulation of the interactions between CCAN and the outer kinetochore, focusing on the interactions of CENP-T, MIS12C, and NDC80C. CDK1:Cyclin B phosphorylation reactions with systematically mutated CENP-T substrates revealed that the phosphorylation of CENP-T at Thr11 and Thr85 results in the recruitment of two NDC80Cs. We also report that CENP-T interacts directly with MIS12C. This requires phosphorylation of CENP-T at Ser201, which is encompassed within a non-canonical CDK1 consensus sequence. This CENP-T-bound MIS12C recruits additional NDC80C and KNL1C complexes. Importantly, CENP-C and CENP-T bind MIS12C in a competitive manner and form separate outer kinetochore recruitment modules. Thus, we have reconstituted and visualized the molecular basis of CENP-T mediated assembly of the outer kinetochore and its phospho-regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Phosphorylation of CENP-T at Thr11 or Thr85 is sufficient to recruit SPC24:SPC25</title><p>To obtain insight into the molecular mechanism of CENP-T mediated recruitment of the human outer kinetochore, we set out to reconstitute this process using purified components. Previous studies identified multiple phosphorylation sites in CENP-T and showed that its phosphorylation contributes to the recruitment of NDC80C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kettenbach et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gascoigne and Cheeseman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>). Confirming this, we identified by mass spectrometry numerous residues in CENP-T that were in vitro phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). These included the CDK target sites Thr11, Thr27, Ser47, and Thr85 in the N-terminal region of CENP-T, a region known to interact with the SPC24:SPC25 subunits of NDC80C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We used isothermal titration calorimetry to test the ability of four short synthetic phosphopeptides encompassing these residues to bind SPC24:SPC25. Peptides containing phosphorylated Thr11 or Thr85 showed a binding affinity of 45 μM and 4 μM, respectively, whereas peptides containing phosphorylated Thr27 or Ser47 did not show an interaction with SPC24:SPC25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although the determined affinities are modest and unlikely to fully represent the binding affinities between full-length CENP-T and SPC24:SPC25, they distinguish <italic>bona fide</italic> binding sites from sites that do not interact.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Phospho-sites on CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> in vitro phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B.

We next generated a set of CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup> constructs in which three of the four CDK phosphorylation sites were mutated to Alanine. Constructs retaining either Thr11 or Thr85 bound to SPC24:SPC25 in a phosphorylation dependent manner, whereas constructs retaining either Thr27 or Ser47, or having all four sites mutated to Alanine, did not bind SPC24:SPC25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Phosphorylation of CENP-T at Thr11 or Thr85 is thus sufficient to bind SPC24:SPC25. These results are consistent with in vivo experiments showing that ectopic chromosome anchoring of a CENP-T<sup>1-250</sup> fragment results in the recruitment of NDC80C when either Thr11 or Thr85 were mutated to Alanine, but not when both were mutated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CENP-T coordinates two NDC80 complexes in a single complex</title><p>The finding that phosphorylation of CENP-T at either Thr11 or Thr85 is sufficient to recruit SPC24:SPC25, both in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>) and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), raises the question whether phosphorylated CENP-T can bind two SPC24:SPC25 units simultaneously. This possibility is supported by the change in retention volume and the apparent stoichiometry of the CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup>:SPC24:SPC25 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We set out to test the stoichiometry of CENP-T:SPC24:SPC25 complexes further using a CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fragment that we C-terminally labeled with a fluorescent dye to specifically follow CENP-T during chromatography and SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This is helpful because CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup>, which lacks Tryptophan and has only one Tyrosine, absorbs poorly at 280 nm. Fluorescently labeled CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> (hereafter CENP-T) was in vitro phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B and subsequently incubated with a threefold molar excess of SPC24:SPC25. CENP-T was part of a broad peak with two SPC24:SPC25-containing species with approximate retention volumes of 1.2 and 1.35 ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, green traces). Consistent with the idea that the complex eluting at 1.2 mL contained two SPC24:SPC25 molecules per CENP-T, this species was not observed for CENP-T containing the T11A or the T85A mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, orange traces). CENP-T that was mutated at both Thr11 and Thr85 or that was not phosphorylated, did not form a complex with SPC24:SPC25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, red and black traces).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>CENP-T phosphorylated at T11 and T85 binds two copies of SPC24:SPC25.</title><p>Analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200 5/150 increase) and SDS-PAGE show that CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B at positions T11 and T85 can bind two copies of SPC24:SPC25.

We next set out to visualize these assemblies directly by electron microscopy (EM) after low-angle metal shadowing. This technique enhances the contrast of the coiled-coil regions of NDC80C, enabling a characterization of the overall dimensions of complexes containing NDC80C. The coiled-coil of NDC80C spans 51 nm and the NDC80:NUF2 - SPC24:SPC25 end-to-end length is 62 nm (corrected for an estimated 3 nm shadow contribution at both ends) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This is slightly longer than the 57 nm of yeast NDC80C previously determined using the same technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wei et al., 2005</xref>). The difference might be explained by the use of full-length human NDC80C whereas the used yeast version lacked the N-terminal 100 residues of the Ndc80p subunit, although interspecies or technical differences cannot be excluded. The low-resolution and the flexible appearance of the NDC80C prevent unambiguous assignment of the SPC24:SPC25 and the NDC80:NUF2 modules of the complexes, although a clear kink in the coiled coil, previously attributed to a sequence insertion in NDC80 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciferri et al., 2008</xref>) marks NDC80:NUF2 in a number of cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Phosphorylated CENP-T recruits two full-length NDC80 complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analytical size-exclusion chromatography (Superose 6 5/150) and SDS-PAGE show that CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> phosphorylated by CDK1:Cyclin B at positions T11 and T85 can bind two full-length NDC80 complexes.

We were able to distinguish at least two different kinds of complexes, containing either one or two NDC80Cs. Though it is not possible to ascertain if complexes with one discernible NDC80 contain CENP-T, those containing two NDC80Cs are presumably assembled on phosphorylated CENP-T. This interpretation is further supported by the distance between the base of the complexes and the characteristic kinks in the coiled coil of NDC80:NUF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). The apparent orientation of the two CENP-T-bound NDC80Cs widely varies, presumably because the CENP-T<sup>11-85</sup> stretch spanning the two NDC80C binding sites is flexible. In brief, we visualized how CENP-T recruits two NDC80Cs. The SPC24:SPC25 modules of these complexes are coordinated by the relative proximity of the phosphorylated Thr11 and Thr85 of CENP-T, but the microtubule-binding CH domains can be well over 100 nm apart.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>CENP-T phosphorylated at Ser201 stoichiometrically binds the MIS12 complex</title><p>It had previously been shown that MIS12C and the N-terminal region of CENP-T bind SPC24:SPC25 in a competitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>). Consistent with these previous reports, MIS12C bound SPC24:SPC25, displacing CENP-T<sup>2-101</sup>, already at equimolar concentrations, indicative of higher binding affinity (unpublished data). In apparent contradiction with these observations, however, it has also been reported that the phosphorylation of human CENP-T on Thr195, within a weakly conserved CDK1 consensus motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), contributes to the recruitment of MIS12C to CENP-T in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>).

Both sites were effectively phosphorylated by CDK1 in vitro (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To assess if CENP-T binds directly to MIS12C, and if phosphorylation of Thr195 or Ser201 is important for this interaction, we generated synthetic fluorescent peptides encompassing residues CENP-T<sup>184-215</sup> and containing phosphorylated Thr195 or Ser201, incubated them with MIS12C, and analyzed the mixture by SEC. The peptide carrying phosphorylated Ser201 bound directly to MIS12C in vitro, whereas the equivalent peptide containing phosphorylated Thr195 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The importance of CENP-T phosphorylation at position Ser201 was recapitulated for the longer CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> construct, where mutation of this residue was shown to abrogate binding to MIS12C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Alanine mutation of the phospho-targets Thr11 and Thr85 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) or Thr195 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>) did not affect the binding between CENP-T and MIS12C. Phosphorylation of CENP-T at position Ser201 is thus both required and sufficient to mediate the MIS12C:CENP-T interaction in vitro. Although our results leave open the possibility that Ser201 is phosphorylated in vitro by a contaminating kinase, rather than by CDK1:Cyclin B, several factors contribute to mitigate this concern. First, the CDK1:Cyclin B sample we used is highly pure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>) and devoid of other Ser/Thr kinases, as judged by mass spectrometry (unpublished data). Second, phosphorylation of CENP-T Ser201 was also observed using a commercial CDK1:Cyclin B preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Third, the addition of the CDK1 specific inhibitor RO-3306 abolished the overall phosphorylation of CENP-T by CDK1:Cyclin B (as judged by the migration of CENP-T on SDS-PAGE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4B</xref>). Finally, RO-3306 prevented the specific phosphorylation of CENP-T at Ser201 and inhibited the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4C</xref>).</p><p>We further characterized the interaction between CENP-T and MIS12C using sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) experiments. Both MIS12C and CENP-T sedimented with relatively high frictional ratios, indicative of an elongated shape or of lack of a defined conformation, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). To analyze the sedimentation of the CENP-T:MIS12C mixture, we specifically monitored absorbance of the fluorescently labeled CENP-T and thus analyzed sedimentation of CENP-T:MIS12C without detecting MIS12C. The CENP-T:MIS12C complex sedimented with a frictional ratio of 2.4S and a determined mass (159 kDa), in close agreement with the theoretical mass of a 1:1 complex (162 kDa, unphosphorylated forms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Phosphorylation of CENP-T Ser201 is important for MIS12C recruitment in vivo</title><p>To analyze how CENP-T phosphorylation at various positions affects kinetochore recruitment of NDC80C and MIS12C in vivo, we adapted a previously established assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>) and tethered lac repressor (LacI)-EGFP-CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fusion proteins to an ectopically integrated lac operon (<italic>lacO</italic>) array in U2OS cells. As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>), NDC80C and MIS12C were recruited to CENP-T loci in prometaphase and not in interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), in agreement with the observed CDK1-dependent recruitment of these complexes to CENP-T in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). The NDC80C binding mutant CENP-T<sup>T11A-T85A</sup> binds MIS12C in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), but in the context of a LacI-EGFP fusion, it failed to recruit not only NDC80C, but also MIS12C, to the <italic>lacO</italic> locus, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

This result is consistent with the requirement for phosphorylation of Ser201 for MIS12C recruitment in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and with the previous identification of the CENP-T<sup>200-230</sup> region as a crucial determinant of the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>).

We therefore speculate that Thr195 contributes to the efficiency of phosphorylation or to the stability of CENP-T in vivo, an effect that is not recapitulated in vitro, where this residue appears to be dispensable for MIS12C binding. Overall, our data underline the importance of Ser201 of CENP-T as a MIS12C binding site both in vitro and in vivo.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>MIS12C and NDC80C are recruited to ectopically localized CENP-T in U2OS cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) U2OS cells that contain a lacO array recruit transiently expressed LacI-EGFP-CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fusion constructs throughout the cell cycle.

This association strictly depended on the phosphorylation of CENP-T at Ser201 because the CENP-T triple mutant (T11A, T85A, S201A) no longer formed a complex with MIS12C or NDC80C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, purple trace). Collectively, our results demonstrate that 1) CENP-T<sup>wt</sup> associates with MIS12C and NDC80C in 1:1:3 ratio; 2) CENP-T<sup>T11A</sup> or CENP-T<sup>T85A</sup> associate with MIS12C and NDC80C in 1:1:2 ratio; and 3) CENP-T<sup>T11A-T85A</sup> associates with MIS12C and NDC80C in 1:1:1 ratio.

Here, we have reported a thorough dissection of the role of CENP-T and its phosphorylation by CDK1 in this process.

This role is further illustrated by the observation that CENP-T depletion lowers NDC80C levels at mitotic kinetochores more than CENP-C depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2015a</xref>), and by experiments showing that replacement of the outer kinetochore binding domain of CENP-C with that of CENP-T supports chromosome segregation in cells depleted of CENP-C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>We reconstituted the assembly of outer kinetochore modules using purified components and determined how CDK-dependent phosphorylation of CENP-T controls the stoichiometry of NDC80C.

Because the binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12C is competitive, these findings support a model in which CENP-C and CENP-T act in parallel to recruit two MIS12Cs, two KNL1Cs, and up to four NDC80Cs in a CDK-regulated manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.025</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Molecular basis of stoichiometric assembly of microtubule binders in the outer kinetochore.</title><p>Schematic representation of the results presented here and their implications.

The molecular mechanism behind the contribution of CENP-T to MIS12C localization at the kinetochore, however, had remained unclear, and it appeared puzzling in view of observations that MIS12C and CENP-T bind to NDC80C in a competitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schleiffer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nishino et al., 2013</xref>). A role for the CENP-T<sup>200-230</sup> region in MIS12C recruitment was shown in experiments of ectopic chromatin targeting of CENP-T fragments, which revealed that MIS12C was recruited to CENP-T<sup>1-230</sup> but not to CENP-T<sup>1-200</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation that the phosphorylation of Ser201 is essential for the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vitro is consistent with these previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Phosphorylation of the weakly conserved CDK consensus site Thr195 is important for the CENP-T:MIS12C interaction in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>), but is not required in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). A possible explanation for these results is that the phosphorylation of kinetochore-associated CENP-T at Thr195 is required for the phosphorylation of Ser201 and the subsequent binding of MIS12C. Multisite phosphorylation networks are important for the regulation of mitosis by CDK1 kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kõivomägi et al., 2011</xref>) and future experiment will be required to understand the spatial and temporal regulation of CENP-T phosphorylation in vivo. Why the CENP-T T195A mutation also interfered with CENP-T:NDC80C recruitment to ectopic <italic>lacO</italic> loci in our hands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) but not in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>) is unclear, but is consistent with a role of this residue in the overall phosphorylation or stability of CENP-T. Our observation that the double mutant CENP-T<sup>T11A-T85A</sup> was unable to recruit MIS12C to <italic>lacO</italic> loci agrees with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rago et al., 2015</xref>), and indicates that binding of NDC80C to CENP-T facilitates further recruitment of MIS12C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The molecular basis for this phenomenon is currently unclear and will require further investigation. So far, we have been unable to recapitulate this effect with purified components.</p><p>Our reconstitution experiments provide a molecular explanation for the observed CDK-dependent recruitment of NDC80C to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gascoigne et al., 2011</xref>) and show that one CENP-T molecule can recruit one MIS12C and up to three NDC80Cs. Because the pseudo-symmetry of the CENP-A nucleosomes allows its binding to two CCAN modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Weir et al., 2016</xref>), we propose that mitotic phosphorylation events trigger the recruitment of four MIS12Cs (and KNL1C) and up to eight NDC80Cs per CENP-A mononucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This extrapolation of our reconstitution experiments is in line with a series of quantitative analyses of kinetochore subcomplexes by immunofluorescence microscopy. Copy numbers of CENP-C, CENP-T, MIS12C, and NDC80C were most accurately determined for metaphase kinetochores in a study that combined RNA interference, ectopic and endogenous kinetochore recruitment, and an elegant CENP-C/T chimera protein design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2015a</xref>). This analysis revealed that, on average, 215 copies of CENP-C and 72 copies of CENP-T recruit a total of 244 NDC80Cs and 151 MIS12Cs to a kinetochore. However, only 82 (of the 215) CENP-C proteins engage in binding MIS12C, whereas the remaining CENP-C does not contribute to outer kinetochore recruitment. CENP-T is responsible for the recruitment of the remaining MIS12Cs and NDC80Cs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Suzuki et al., 2015a</xref>). These results correlate well to our description of 1:1:1 CENP-C:MIS12C:NDC80C and 1:1:2 or 1:1:3 CENP-T:MIS12C:NDC80C assemblies.</p><p>As stated in the introduction, NDC80C multivalency may have profound implications for microtubule binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zaytsev et al., 2014</xref>). Our study paves the way to the reconstitution of synthetic kinetochores with controllable numbers of NDC80 complexes, which will in turn allow us to probe the importance of multivalency for force production by kinetochores. Whether the CDK-regulated localization of multiple NDC80Cs at the outer kinetochore has an effect on the function of kinetochores to signal the microtubule-attachment state through the spindle checkpoint control also remains to be addressed. In this perspective, it is interesting to note that NDC80C recruited by CENP-C:MIS12C or by CENP-T have been proposed to have different effects on the checkpoint response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim and Yu, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Samejima et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The visualization of the reconstituted 1:1:3 CENP-T:MIS12C:NDC80C complexes by electron microscopy after low-angle metal shadowing highlighted how outer kinetochores assembled on phosphorylated CENP-T can span distances of well over 100 nm. It also showed the varying orientation of the coordinated NDC80Cs relative to each other, presumably caused by the flexibility of the CENP-T regions between the NDC80C and MIS12C binding sites. The flexibility of CENP-T as well as the stretching of CENP-T upon kinetochore-microtubule contacts has been shown before: the N- and C-termini of tagged CENP-T were ~30 nm apart in the presence of tension (MG132 treated cells) but only ~4 nm apart in the absence of tension (nocodazole treated cells), as determined by immunofluorescence and immuno-electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, the N-terminal tail of CENP-T was seen as a 25 ± 13 nm long flexible extension of the CENP-TW histone-fold domain by high speed atomic force microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The likely interpretation of these results is that the intrinsically flexible N-terminal region of CENP-T stretches when the multiple NDC80Cs it coordinates bind microtubules, while its C-terminal HFD remains anchored at the inner kinetochore. In the future, it will be important to test how the observed CENP-T:MIS12C:KNL1:NDC80C<sub>3</sub> complexes structurally rearrange in the presence of microtubules and if the presence of multiple NDC80Cs contributes to the stabilization of the kinetochore-microtubule interface observed in the presence of tension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nicklas and Koch, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi et al., 2010</xref>).

Kops) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janicki et al., 2004</xref>) were maintained in DMEM (PAN Biotech) supplemented with 10% FBS (PAN Biotech), 2 mM L-glutamine (PAN Biotech) and 50 μg/ml Penicillin/Streptomycin (GIBCO). Cells were grown on coverslips pre-coated with 0.01% poly-L-lysine (Sigma-Aldrich) and transfected for 48 hr using a 3:1 ratio of X-tremeGENE (Roche) transfection reagent to pcDNA5/FRT/TO plasmids encoding LacI-EGFP-CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fusion constructs. Nocodazole (Sigma-Aldrich) was added at 330 nM for 14–16 hr before fixation. Cells were permeabilized with a 0.5% triton-X-100 solution in PHEM (Pipes, Hepes, EGTA, MgCl<sub>2</sub>) buffer for 2 min and fixed with 4% PFA in PHEM for 15 min. After blocking with 3% BSA in PHEM supplemented with 0.1% triton-X-100 (PHEM-T), cells were incubated at room temperature for 1–2 hr with the following primary antibodies diluted in blocking buffer: anti-Nsl1 (in-house generated, mouse monoclonal antibody clone QM 9–13 (27); 1:1000), anti-Hec1 (Gene-Tex GTX70268-100, mouse monoclonal antibody; 1:500), CREST/anticentromere antibody (human autoimmune serum, Antibodies, Inc., 1:100). After washing with PHEM-T, goat anti-human Alexa Fluor 647 (Invitrogen) and goat anti-mouse Rhodamine Red (Jackson Immuno Research) were used as secondary antibodies. DNA was stained with 0.5 μg/ml DAPI (Serva) and Mowiol (Calbiochem) was used as mounting media. Cells were imaged at room temperature using a spinning disk confocal device on a 3i Marianas system equipped with an Axio Observer Z1 microscope (Zeiss), a CSU-X1 confocal scanner unit (Yokogawa Electric Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), 100×/1.4NA Oil Objectives (Zeiss), and an Orca Flash 4.0 sCMOS Camera (Hamamatsu). Images were acquired as z-sections at 0.25 μm, Fluorescence signals were quantified on unmodified 16-bit z-series images using Imaris 7.3.4 32-bit software (Bitplane, Zurich, Switzerland). After background subtraction, the mean NSL1 or NDC80 intensity was normalized to the respective EGFP intensity mean signal. Converted 8-bit maximal intensity projections of representative cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to S Wohlgemuth and I Stender for help with NDC80C and MIS12C purifications and to O Hofnagel and F Müller for assistance with electron microscopy and mass spectrometry.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Jon Pines (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study the authors have investigated the binding between the CCAN components CENP-T and CENP-C and the outer kinetochore proteins, Ndc80 and Mis12. The authors used recombinant proteins to demonstrate that CENP-T will bind to Ndc80 and to Mis12-Ndc80 after phosphorylation in vitro using Cyclin B-Cdk1. They identify the phosphorylation sites and show which sites are responsible for binding Ndc80 and Mis12. They use a combination of biochemical and electron microscopy assays to estimate the stoichiometry of the complexes generated and present evidence that CENP-T can bind directly to two molecules of Ndc80 via phospho-threonines 11 and 85, and to one molecule of Mis12 via phospho-serine 201. CENP-C can compete for Mis12 binding to this latter site. Many of the main conclusions have been reported recently in other work. For example, two papers from the Westermann lab (PMIDs: 27524485 and 23334295) and a paper from the Fukagawa lab (PMID: 23334297) previously identified the N-terminal Ndc80 binding peptides in CENP-T and its budding yeast equivalent. Thus, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not new. The clear demonstration of the stoichiometry of binding of two Ndc80 molecules to CENP-T in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> is nice, but as these two binding peptides are in distinct regions of the molecule and are each sufficient for Ndc80 binding, this is not a particular surprise. We also note that the recent paper from the Westermann lab showed similar data for the budding yeast CENP-T protein, including similar EM images to show the multiple Ndc80 complexes bound (PMID: 27524485).</p><p>The most important new data in this paper relates to the interaction between CENP-T and the Mis12 complex. An interaction with the Mis12 complex had been suggested based on cellular experiments, but a direct interaction has not been shown biochemically. As this interaction appears to be central to building an appropriate outer kinetochore structure on CENP-T, it does have the potential to represent an important new advance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It should be investigated whether S201 is actually phosphorylated in vitro. The only evidence provided for this is a list of peptides identified by mass spectrometry with a designation of which phosphorylated residue was &quot;called&quot; by the search algorithm. For the peptide containing the SVQ site, there are three other residues that are identified as phosphorylated in distinct peptides (suggesting only singly phosphorylated peptide were identified). Based on the way that these searches work, there is potential uncertainty in identifying the specific residue.</p><p>2) The authors claim that S201 is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-Cdk1 even though the sequence does not conform to the consensus site. In particular S201 is followed by a valine and from the crystal structures of Cdk1 and Cdk2 it is difficult to envisage how this would bind since their active sites have a bulky residue that in almost all substrates requires a proline to for the peptide chain to fit. From the Materials and methods, it appears that the authors used insect cell produced cyclin B-Cdk1 raising the possibility that S201 was phosphorylated by a contaminated kinase. It will be important to eliminate this possibility before publication.</p><p>3) If this site is phosphorylated, what proportion of the protein is modified at this site in an in vitro reaction? Based on the presented biochemistry and binding assays, it looks like CDK phosphorylation is fully efficient for promoting the interaction with the Mis12 complex. However, as this would be a non-traditional consensus site for CDK, one would expect its phosphorylation to be substantially less efficient than the other sites in CENP-T. A labeling-based strategy to measure the efficiency of phosphorylation at this site would provide allow the authors to assess the potential relevance of this site.</p><p>4) Is this site phosphorylated in vivo? Multiple high throughput proteomics analyses have identified other phosphorylation sites in CENP-T. However, the serine 201 site that the authors focus on has only been identified in a single study, again suggesting that its phosphorylation is more rare (or possibly artefactual). Ideally, this would include a phospho-specific antibody or additional mass spectrometry analysis.</p><p>5) If this site is critically relevant, is CENP-T S210A defective in binding to Mis12C and in recruiting Mis12C to kinetochores in human cells? Moreover, what the authors data show is that the serine 201 residue is important for binding to the Mis12 complex. They do not show that the phospho-regulation of this site is key. For example, if they were instead to mutate the neighboring valine or glutamine, this could also block an interaction with the Mis12 complex as they may participate in mediating the interaction. In addition, it would be very useful if the authors could refine the requirements for this binding. All of the binding experiments use an extended portion of CENP-T. If Mis12 complex binding occurs in a limited region (and only requires phosphorylation at the serine 201 residue), they should be able to substantially narrow this binding region.</p><p>6) The authors show that CENP-C can disrupt the phospho-CENP-T-Mis12C interaction in vitro. Does CENP-T disrupt CENP-C-Mis12C? The authors should determine the affinity between phospho-CENP-T and Mis12C. If they cannot obtain enough phospho-CENP-T for this measurement, they should attempt to narrow down the Mis12C-binding region to a smaller region and perform the measurements with synthetic phospho-peptides as they did with Ndc80C. If CENP-T binds Mis12C with much weaker affinity than CENP-C, Mis12C will prefer to bind to CENP-C at the kinetochore, making it the major receptor for Mis12C.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Molecular basis of outer kinetochore assembly on CENP-T&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior editor and a Reviewing editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance:</p><p>The phosphorylation of S201 by Cyclin B-Cdk1 is a key point of the manuscript. This does not have a proline at position +1 which, according to the crystal structure of the active site, would be incompatible with binding. The evidence that this is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-Cdk1 relies on baculovirus-produced Cyclin B-Cdk1 that could be contaminated by another kinase. Therefore the authors were asked to use bacterial-expressed Cyclin B-Cdk1 to confirm phosphorylation. In the revised manuscript the authors cite the study by Nori Sagata (Suzuki et al., 2015) that showed phosphorylation at a non-SP consensus motif, to which S201 conforms. The problem with this is that the Suzuki et al. study also used baculovirus-expressed Cyclin B-Cdk1, thus the original problem remains unaddressed. As this is a key point of the manuscript the authors do need to show phosphorylation of S201 by bacterially-produced Cyclin B1-Cdk1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21007.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>In this study the authors have investigated the binding between the CCAN components CENP-T and CENP-C and the outer kinetochore proteins, Ndc80 and Mis12. The authors used recombinant proteins to demonstrate that CENP-T will bind to Ndc80 and to Mis12-Ndc80 after phosphorylation in vitro using Cyclin B-Cdk1. They identify the phosphorylation sites and show which sites are responsible for binding Ndc80 and Mis12. They use a combination of biochemical and electron microscopy assays to estimate the stoichiometry of the complexes generated and present evidence that CENP-T can bind directly to two molecules of Ndc80 via phospho-threonines 11 and 85, and to one molecule of Mis12 via phospho-serine 201. CENP-C can compete for Mis12 binding to this latter site. Many of the main conclusions have been reported recently in other work. For example, two papers from the Westermann lab (PMIDs: 27524485 and 23334295) and a paper from the Fukagawa lab (PMID: 23334297) previously identified the N-terminal Ndc80 binding peptides in CENP-T and its budding yeast equivalent. Thus, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is not new. The clear demonstration of the stoichiometry of binding of two Ndc80 molecules to CENP-T in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> is nice, but as these two binding peptides are in distinct regions of the molecule and are each sufficient for Ndc80 binding, this is not a particular surprise. We also note that the recent paper from the Westermann lab showed similar data for the budding yeast CENP-T protein, including similar EM images to show the multiple Ndc80 complexes bound (PMID: 27524485).</italic> </p><p>We agree with the referees that our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> build partly on recent literature. We also argue, however, that the data in these three figures provide a significantly more detailed overview of the recruitment of NDC80C to phosphorylated CENP-T than it was published in previous work. While the recent work of Stefan Westermann and colleagues (Pekgoz Altunkaya et al., 2016) shows the existence of a stable CENP-HIK:CENP-TW:NDC80C (Ctf3c:Cnn1p:Wip1p:Ndc80c) complex in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we emphasize that our micrographs of the entire human outer kinetochore capture the CENP-T induced oligomerization of NDC80C in an unequivocal manner (comparing our <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> with Pekgoz Altunkaya et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>).</p><p><italic>The most important new data in this paper relates to the interaction between CENP-T and the Mis12 complex. An interaction with the Mis12 complex had been suggested based on cellular experiments, but a direct interaction has not been shown biochemically. As this interaction appears to be central to building an appropriate outer kinetochore structure on CENP-T, it does have the potential to represent an important new advance.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewers’ main concerns, we have now performed several additional experiments (that resulted in several new figures) to characterize the role of CENP-T as a MIS12 complex binder in more detail. Major additions include:</p><p>– A comparison of the sequence surrounding CENP-T S201 with non-canonical CDK1 substrates revealed a conserved (P)xxT/SxxR pattern that was identified as a non- canonical CDK signature in a recent paper (Suzuki et al., Scientific Reports, 2015), which we now cite. The extended sequence alignment is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>.</p><p>– Synthetic peptides encompassing residues CENP-T<sup>184-215</sup>, CENP-T<sup>192-215</sup> and CENP- T<sup>195-215</sup> all bound to MIS12C in a S201 phospho-dependent manner and competed with CENP-C for the binding to MIS12C. This supports the conclusion that the loss of MIS12C binding by the CENPT<sup>2-373</sup> S201A mutant represents a direct effect. The binding of the peptides to MIS12C was studied by size-exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and by fluorescence polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and 7</xref>—figure supplement 1).</p><p>– We provide additional details on the identification of the CENP-T peptide containing phosphorylated T195 and/or S201 by mass spectrometry and show that S201 is phosphorylated in CENP-T when the latter is part of the CENP-T:MIS12C complex. This information is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>– We adopted a <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI system to recruit CENP-T constructs to an ectopic chromosome location. This allowed us to test different CENP-T mutants for their ability to recruit MIS12C and NDC80C in vivo. In addition to recapitulating previous findings (Rago et al., Current Biology, 2015), we find that the phosphorylation of CENP-T at position S201 is crucial for the recruitment of MIS12C. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.</p><p>– We now show that CENP- phosphorylated at residue S201 not only forms a complex with MIS12C and NDC80C, but also with KNL1C (KNL1 and ZWINT), thus indicating that P-S201 recruits an entire KMN network. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>– Our recent structure-function analysis of MIS12C revealed a MIS12C mutant that no longer binds to CENP-C (Petrovic et al., Cell, 2016). This MIS12C mutant does not bind CENP-T either, supporting the idea that CENP-C and CENP-T bind MIS12C with an at least partly overlapping site. In addition, we provide direct evidence that binding of CENP-T and CENP-C to MIS12 is competitive. These data are included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p>Below is a point-to-point answer of the referees’ concerns.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) It should be investigated whether S201 is actually phosphorylated in vitro. The only evidence provided for this is a list of peptides identified by mass spectrometry with a designation of which phosphorylated residue was &quot;called&quot; by the search algorithm. For the peptide containing the SVQ site, there are three other residues that are identified as phosphorylated in distinct peptides (suggesting only singly phosphorylated peptide were identified). Based on the way that these searches work, there is potential uncertainty in identifying the specific residue.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. The other phosphorylation sites within the relevant peptide that the reviewers refer to are T192 and T195. We do indeed observe a mixture of single, double and triply phosphorylated peptides. However, phosphorylation of T195 and S201 are the predominant post-translational modifications of this peptide. A clarification of the identification of single T195, single</p><p>S201 and double T195-S201 phosphorylation events is included as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. This figure also contains two annotated ms/ms spectra to illustrate that individual phospho-sites within this peptide are identified reliably both in vitro and (new information added in the revision, see below) in vivo.</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim that S201 is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-Cdk1 even though the sequence does not conform to the consensus site. In particular S201 is followed by a valine and from the crystal structures of Cdk1 and Cdk2 it is difficult to envisage how this would bind since their active sites have a bulky residue that in almost all substrates requires a proline to for the peptide chain to fit. From the Materials and methods, it appears that the authors used insect cell produced cyclin B-Cdk1 raising the possibility that S201 was phosphorylated by a contaminated kinase. It will be important to eliminate this possibility before publication.</italic> </p><p>The reviewer raises an important point that had also puzzled us. In the course of the revision, we realized that the CENP-T sequence encompassing CENP-T S201 contains an evolutionary conserved (P)xxT/SxxR pattern that perfectly matches a signature non- canonical CDK site identified in a nice and systematic recent study (Suzuki et al., Scientific Reports, 2015) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Thus, while it is true that S201 is an anomalous, non S/TP site, it is expected to be a good CDK1 substrate based on this previous study. We thus believe that this site represents a <italic>bona fide</italic> Cdk1 substrate. We have also included the phosphorylation control referred to by the reviewer in Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</p><p><italic>3) If this site is phosphorylated, what proportion of the protein is modified at this site in an</italic> in vitro <italic>reaction? Based on the presented biochemistry and binding assays, it looks like CDK phosphorylation is fully efficient for promoting the interaction with the Mis12 complex. However, as this would be a non-traditional consensus site for CDK, one would expect its phosphorylation to be substantially less efficient than the other sites in CENP-T. A labeling-based strategy to measure the efficiency of phosphorylation at this site would provide allow the authors to assess the potential relevance of this site.</italic> </p><p>As already pointed out in the response to the previous point, the site containing S201 is part of a non-canonical CDK1 site. In this revision, we analysed by mass spectrometry the phosphorylation status of CENP-T when it is part of a CENP-T:MIS12C complex. For this, we separated free CENP-T and CENP-T:MIS12C by size-exclusion chromatography and analysed different fractions by mass spectrometry. This revealed that peptides lacking the phosphorylation at residue S201 are present in the input sample and in free CENP-T, but not in the fraction containing CENP-T:MIS12C complex. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, our data seem at least consistent with the idea that all the shifted CENP-T molecules (i.e. those binding to MIS12) are modified on S201.</p><p><italic>4) Is this site phosphorylated</italic> in vivo<italic>? Multiple high throughput proteomics analyses have identified other phosphorylation sites in CENP-T. However, the serine 201 site that the authors focus on has only been identified in a single study, again suggesting that its phosphorylation is more rare (or possibly artefactual). Ideally, this would include a phospho-specific antibody or additional mass spectrometry analysis.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an important point. We pulled-down endogenous CENP-T from HeLa cells and carried out a mass spectrometry analysis. In data summarized and shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>, we report the identification of phosphorylated S201 or T195/S201 peptides. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, we also summarize overall evidence, from our study and previous studies, that CENP-T is phosphorylated at positions T195 and S201 in vivo.</p><p><italic>5) If this site is critically relevant, is CENP-T S210A defective in binding to Mis12C and in recruiting Mis12C to kinetochores in human cells? Moreover, what the authors data show is that the serine 201 residue is important for binding to the Mis12 complex. They do not show that the phospho-regulation of this site is key. For example, if they were instead to mutate the neighboring valine or glutamine, this could also block an interaction with the Mis12 complex as they may participate in mediating the interaction. In addition, it would be very useful if the authors could refine the requirements for this binding. All of the binding experiments use an extended portion of CENP-T. If Mis12 complex binding occurs in a limited region (and only requires phosphorylation at the serine 201 residue), they should be able to substantially narrow this binding region.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up these points. In the original manuscript, we had shown that the phosphorylation of CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> is required for the interaction with MIS12C and that a phosphorylated CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> S201A mutant does not bind MIS12C. We now show that synthetic peptides encompassing residues CENP-T<sup>184-215</sup>, CENP-T<sup>192-215</sup> and CENP-T<sup>195-215</sup> bind to MIS12C in a manner that depends on S201 phosphorylation. We also show that these peptides compete with CENP-C for the binding to MIS12C. The binding of the peptides to MIS12C was studied by size- exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and by fluorescence polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To address the in vivo relevance of CENP-T phosphorylation at position S201, we adopted a <italic>lacO</italic>-LacI system to tether CENP-T fragments to a non-centromeric region. This strategy enables a direct analysis of the role of CENP-T in MIS12C recruitment that would be harder to perform quantitatively at the endogenous kinetochore, where MIS12 is also recruited by CENP-C. We tethered transiently expressed LacI-GFP-CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fusion proteins to ectopic <italic>lacO</italic> loci and studied the subsequent recruitment of MIS12C</p><p>and NDC80C. The results are shown in a separate main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Lack of MIS12C recruitment in interphase cells is consistent with the dependency of MIS12C and NDC80C recruitment on CENP-T phosphorylation. Whereas a wild-type CENP-T<sup>2-373</sup> fragment recruits MIS12C, this recruitment is abolished by the S201A mutation in CENP-T. We also confirmed previously findings obtained using a comparable experimental setup (Rago et al., 2015) showing that the CENP-T T195A mutation, as well as mutations at T11 and T85 that prevent CENP-T:NDC80C interactions, also abolish the recruitment of MIS12C to CENP-T. The basis for this effect of NDC80C-mediated stabilization of MIS12 binding to CENP-T requires further scrutiny.</p><p><italic>6) The authors show that CENP-C can disrupt the phospho-CENP-T-Mis12C interaction</italic> in vitro<italic>. Does CENP-T disrupt CENP-C-Mis12C? The authors should determine the affinity between phospho-CENP-T and Mis12C. If they cannot obtain enough phospho-CENP-T for this measurement, they should attempt to narrow down the Mis12C-binding region to a smaller region and perform the measurements with synthetic phospho-peptides as they did with Ndc80C. If CENP-T binds Mis12C with much weaker affinity than CENP-C, Mis12C will prefer to bind to CENP-C at the kinetochore, making it the major receptor for Mis12C.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for raising this point. As mentioned above, we now performed a MIS12C binding experiment with CENP-T<sup>184-215</sup>, CENP-T<sup>192-215</sup> and CENP-T<sup>195-215</sup> peptides and show that the interaction of these peptides with MIS12C depends on the presence of phosphorylated S201. The MIS12C binding affinity of phosphorylated CENP-T<sup>192-215</sup> was determined by fluorescence polarization measurements. These data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>Our recently described structure-function analysis of MIS12C revealed three aromatic residues in the MIS12 subunit that are important for the orientation of MIS12C’s head1 to the stalk region of MIS12C (Petrovic et al., Cell, 2016). Mutation of these residues prevented binding of CENP-C and also prevented a MIS12C-CENP-T interaction. These data further support that CENP-T and CENP-C bind to MIS12C in a similar fashion and are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>. It would be interesting to figure out if the phosphorylation of CENP-T S201 directly contributes to the MIS12C:CENP-T binding interface, or if it e.g. results in a conformational change in CENP-T that is required for the recruitment of MIS12C. Since the sequence similarities between CENP-C and CENP-T do not go beyond a couple of conserved and clustered positively charged residues, a detailed MIS12C:CENP-T structural analysis would be required to reveal analogies and differences between the binding of CENP-C and CENP-T to MIS12C.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been substantially improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance:</italic></p><p><italic>The phosphorylation of S201 by Cyclin B-Cdk1 is a key point of the manuscript. This does not have a proline at position +1 which, according to the crystal structure of the active site, would be incompatible with binding. The evidence that this is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-Cdk1 relies on baculovirus-produced Cyclin B-Cdk1 that could be contaminated by another kinase. Therefore the authors were asked to use bacterial-expressed Cyclin B-Cdk1 to confirm phosphorylation. In the revised manuscript the authors cite the study by Nori Sagata (Suzuki et al., 2015) that showed phosphorylation at a non-SP consensus motif, to which S201 conforms. The problem with this is that the Suzuki et al. study also used baculovirus-expressed Cyclin B-Cdk1, thus the original problem remains unaddressed. As this is a key point of the manuscript the authors do need to show phosphorylation of S201 by bacterially-produced Cyclin B1-Cdk1.</italic> </p><p>The revised version of the manuscript was reviewed favourably, but the reviewers raised a residual concern related to the question whether Ser201 is a bona fide CDK1:Cyclin B substrate. The same issue had been raised already during the first round of review:</p><p>“2) The authors claim that S201 is phosphorylated by Cyclin B-Cdk1 even though the sequence does not conform to the consensus site. In particular S201 is followed by a valine and from the crystal structures of Cdk1 and Cdk2 it is difficult to envisage how this would bind since their active sites have a bulky residue that in almost all substrates requires a proline to for the peptide chain to fit. From the materials and methods it appears that the authors used insect cell produced cyclin B-Cdk1 raising the possibility that S201 was phosphorylated by a contaminating kinase. It will be important to eliminate this possibility before publication.”</p><p>In response to this concern, we referred to previous work showing that CDK1:Cyclin B can phosphorylate sequences that do not conform to the S/TP consensus provided other features are present, and we noted that these additional features are indeed present at the CENP-T Ser201 site. We also referred to previous work showing that replacement of Pro with Val is the least damaging substitution for the +1 position of the substrate.</p><p>We note that the reviewers’ argument that the preference for Pro at the +1 position is due to a bulky kinase residue is imprecise. The preference for Pro is determined by a very unusual main chain angle of the activation segment, typical of a left-handed helix. This peculiar conformation forces a main chain carbonyl of the activation segment to point away from the position that would allow it to establish a hydrogen bond with the main chain of the substrate, and specifically between the target S/T and the +1 residue. Pro is insensitive to this penalty, because it does not have a main chain amide, and becomes therefore selected through a “negative mechanism”. The implication is that phosphorylation of other sequences is energetically more costly, and not that it cannot take place due to steric hindrance, as implied by the reviewers. It follows that adequate energetic compensation with surrounding sequences might render other substrates more appealing.</p><p>In addition to discussing this previous evidence, we had also carried out an experiment showing that the migration shift of CENP-T caused by CDK1:Cyclin B phosphorylation is inhibited in presence of RO-3306, a specific CDK1 inhibitor. Regretfully, this experiment, which admittedly answered the reviewers’ concern only indirectly, had been included in a merged manuscript file that I had uploaded on the <italic>eLife</italic> web site. The editorial office contacted me to let me know that revisions require that individual text and figure files are uploaded and I inadvertently forgot to include this control. I apologize for that. However, in retrospect, I don’t think that the reviewers would have found this sufficient, because when the manuscript was re-reviewed the issue was identified for being central and the new request above was issued.</p><p>In response to this, we argue as follows:</p><p>First, while we also see that the issue of whether CDK1:Cyclin B is the CENP-T Ser201 kinase in vitro is interesting, we don’t see it as a “key point” of our manuscript, which clearly does not aim to address the issue of CDK1 target specificity in any depth. There are several key points in our manuscript, and certainly key in this context is that Ser201 mediates the interaction of CENP-T with the Mis12 complex when phosphorylated, which we prove beyond reasonable doubt. Key would also be to show that this site is a target of CDK1:Cyclin B in cells. We show that the interaction is suppressed before mitosis, arguing that a mitotic kinase does the job. Inhibiting CDK1 in vivo would not take us very far. So this truly important question will remain unanswered until some proper and complex in vivo sensor can be developed. To summarize, we see the question raised by the reviewers as rather marginal in the context of this manuscript.</p><p>Second, the specific request of using bacterially-produced CDK1:Cyclin B1 only appeared after the second review. During the first review, only a generic statement that the issue is given proper attention was raised. As I explained above, we tried to answer this concern by showing that there is substantial prior art. The reviewers did not find our answer sufficient and have now raised a specific suggestion. This may not be an <italic>eLife</italic> style request, in my opinion, unless the deficiency it addressed was at risk of invalidating the paper’s main conclusions or interpretation, which is clearly not the case here. We also note that we do not have this reagent in our laboratory. We are aware of a previously generated expression system – by Tim Hunt’s laboratory – that made use of the frog kinase (we use human reagents throughout). The paper is already gigantic and it reports a very large body of high quality work, none of which requires, for its interpretation, that the kinase is known with absolute accuracy.</p><p>Third, even if we failed to reproduce the phosphorylation with bacterial kinase, this would not prove our results with the insect cell kinase wrong, because there is no proof that the bacterially and insect cell expressed kinases behave in exactly the same way (regardless of possible contaminations). On the contrary, if we reproduced it, we would still be ignorant of the kinase that phosphorylates CENP-T at Ser201 in cells.</p><p>All this said, we understand that the reviewers put special meaning onto this question. We have therefore added a new figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>, in which we demonstrate the very high grade of the CDK1:Cyclin B sample we use (panel A). Mass spectrometry analysis of this sample failed to detect any S/T kinases (we have this result in a non-annotated list that I will be very happy to share if you wanted to see it, but this will require annotation, as we had to search a self-compiled insect cell database). All contaminants, with the exception of Hsp70, were detected in trace amounts (a single peptide). We also included the experiment with RO-3306 that I had forgotten to include in the revision (panel B). And finally, we also include a new experiment in which we demonstrate that RO-3306 inhibits the CDK1:Cyclin B mediated interaction of CENP-T with the MIS12 complex (panel C). Furthermore, we have modified the text to state that we cannot exclude the possibility that CENP-T is phosphorylated by a contaminating kinase, but that the evidence we provide makes this possibility rather slim (this statement introduces the description of this new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
