Closed-loop manipulations have the unique power to reveal direct and causal links between such patterns and their contribution to cognition. Current brain–computer interfaces, however, are not designed to interpret multi-neuronal spiking patterns at the millisecond timescale. To bridge this gap, we developed a system for classifying ensemble patterns in a closed-loop setting and demonstrated its application in the online identification of hippocampal neuronal replay sequences in the rat. Our system decodes multi-neuronal patterns at 10 ms resolution, identifies within 50 ms experience-related patterns with over 70% sensitivity and specificity, and classifies their content with 95% accuracy. This technology scales to high-count electrode arrays and will help to shed new light on the contribution of internally generated neural activity to coordinated neural assembly interactions and cognition.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neural decoding</kwd><kwd>hippocampal replay</kwd><kwd>memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0D7516N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kloosterman</surname><given-names>Fabian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A brain–computer interface for real-time identification of transient neural activity patterns enables causal inference of the role of these patterns in cognition through closed-loop manipulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Distributed and temporally organized patterns of spiking activity in cortical circuits reflect the processing of sensory information, the execution of cognitive tasks and the generation of motor commands. Large-scale recordings have revealed the presence of brief (50–200 ms) multi-neuronal spiking sequences in cortical networks. The brief sequences appear as rapid increases in the multi-unit firing rate and they are generated endogenously or in response to an external stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luczak et al., 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luczak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luczak et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pasquale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Riehle et al., 1997</xref>). The omnipresence of these activity patterns in the cortical mantle suggests that they constitute the basic elements of the cortical neural code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harris, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luczak, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Multi-neuronal sequential firing patterns have been extensively studied in the hippocampus, in large part because of the comprehensive characterization of a well-defined spatial code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>). In rodents, large-scale recordings revealed the occurrence of accelerated ‘replays’ of the spatial information encoded in the population activity during an experience (e.g. traversal of an arm in a maze), both during sleeping and when in a resting state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Karlsson and Frank, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee and Wilson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>).

Any causal link between replay content and behavior or physiology thus remains untested.</p><p>To provide a direct causal link between a specific transient neural activity pattern and its hypothesized contribution to cognition, correlational and computational studies are not sufficient and a closed-loop manipulation is necessary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hady, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Potter et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zrenner et al., 2016</xref>). A critical element for ‘closing the loop’ around a neural pattern of interest is the ability to detect such pattern in real-time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grosenick et al., 2015</xref>), but a complete methodology for detecting (re)expressed spike patterns within tens of milliseconds has not yet been demonstrated.</p><p>The rapid detection of multi-neuronal patterns in a closed-loop setting is challenging because offline identification algorithms generally require all data to be available or are otherwise not suitable for an online scenario. Moreover, the algorithms often have intensive computational demands that pose challenges for real-time execution at tens of millisecond latency. Such requirements are not present in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) and other neuroprostheses for motor control as they generally operate sufficiently with latencies of 120 – 200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ibáñez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Velliste et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2014</xref>), one order of magnitude greater than is required for the rapid detection of transient cortical multi-neuronal sequences.</p><p>To bridge this gap, we devised a system for online spike pattern detection with minimal computational time delays. The system builds on our previous work describing an efficient offline implementation of spike-sorting-less neural decoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kloosterman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sodkomkham et al., 2016</xref>) and a general software framework (Falcon) for complex online neural processing in closed-loop settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciliberti and Kloosterman, 2017</xref>). Here, we added parallelized neural decoding to Falcon and built on top a concrete implementation of a full real-time spike pattern identification and classification system.</p><p>Using this novel closed-loop system, we performed real-time population decoding of spatial information from CA1 assemblies at the stringent 10 ms temporal resolution and detected distinct classes of replay at a low 50 ms average latency. Real-time identification of population bursts with replay had more than 70% average sensitivity and specificity, whereas content classification accuracy was on average over 95%. We demonstrated this technology in a freely behaving rat during both resting and awake states using in vivo large-scale recordings. We also illustrated that detection algorithm parameters can be adjusted, depending on the requirements of the experiment, to trade off sensitivity and specificity or latency and accuracy. We further showed how detection performance is affected by the number of recording channels.</p><p>Our ready-to-use brain–computer interface will enable, for the first time, selective manipulation of specific hippocampal and extra-hippocampal ensemble firing sequences at a millisecond timescale and will thus pave the way towards a deeper understanding of their contribution to cognitive processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We built a fully functional closed-loop system for real-time detection and identification of replay patterns. Our system addressed three general major technical challenges. The first challenge derives from the desire to respond to an identified replay as soon as possible after the event has started (and well before it is over). Thus, the determination of replay content should be completed with minimal data, which inevitably introduces a trade-off between algorithmic detection latency and detection accuracy. Second, any approach for online detection of hippocampal replay content must be suitable for data arriving as a continuous live stream; in such a scenario, the exact start (and end) times of replay events are unknown and cannot be predicted. The constraints of the online scenario require the implementation to make use of past-observed information only. As a third challenge, the real-time computations needed to identify replay content in the continuous high-volume and high-rate stream should only minimally increase the overall detection latency, which should be dominated by its algorithmic contribution. The need for fast computations introduces another possible latency–accuracy trade-off, in which approximate algorithms may be required to meet real-time deadlines.</p><p>Built on top of the Falcon open source framework for closed-loop neuroscience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciliberti and Kloosterman, 2017</xref>), the system reads and processes a continuous stream of multi-channel neural signals, analyzes the signals to search for potential replay events and emits a digital output pulse upon the detection of a replay event containing target content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We defined the target as a replay trajectory of one of the tracks in a multi-arm maze (e.g. a Y-maze). To detect replay content, we applied neural population decoding followed by the characterization of the spatial-temporal structure in the decoded locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), similar to the approach that is often used for offline replay analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kloosterman, 2011</xref>). The incoming data stream is continuously decoded in 10 ms bins and, on the basis of the most recent 30 ms of decoded spiking activity, an assessment is made of whether or not a population burst with replay of one of the maze arms is present.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36275.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Online decoding and detection of hippocampal replay content for closed-loop scenarios.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic overview of a system for online identification and classification of hippocampal replay content.

Each box represents a processor node that ran in a separate thread of execution in the central processing unit (CPU). Black arrows indicate ring buffers for data sharing between two connected processors. The first three serially connected processor nodes are responsible respectively for reading the incoming User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packets from the data acquisition system, parsing from the packets the relevant information about the multi-channel signals and dispatching the signals to the downstream processors. The dispatcher processor node streams data to a set of parallel pipelines, each processing data recorded from a different tetrode. Each parallel pipeline has three serially connected processor nodes that are used for digital filtering, spike detection and on-the-fly kernel density estimation of the joint amplitude-position probability density of the spike-sorting-free decoder, which uses the pre-loaded offline-generated encoding models. The likelihoods generated by decoder nodes, each for a different tetrode, are fed into the 'population decoder' node, which produces the final posterior probability distribution of the animal’s real or replayed position. Posterior probability data is streamed to a 'run decoder' node for estimating the animal’s real position and to a 'replay content classifier' node for online detection of a replay content. The output of these nodes are fed to 'file serializer' nodes for data dump (used in post-hoc analysis) and to a 'digital output' node for triggering a closed-loop transistor–transistor logic (TTL) pulse via the dedicated hardware.

A replay event is identified if the burst, sharpness and consistency conditions are all met simultaneously.</p><p>The algorithms for neural decoding and replay content detection were adapted to fit the specific constraints of the online use case. In our approach, the most demanding computation is the online evaluation of the encoding model that directly relates spike waveform features to the animal’s position without the need for prior spike sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kloosterman et al., 2014</xref>). Modest compression of the encoding model reduced the computational costs, resulting in an online decode time below 1 ms per spike, without affecting the system's ability to decode the animal’s position during run epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). The effect of compression on the integrity of posterior probability distributions in candidate replay population bursts is small for low to moderate compression levels, in particular for posteriors that have a MAP estimate with high probability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the implementation of the algorithms, including the spike-by-spike construction of posterior probability distributions and parallel processing (see 'Materials and methods'), made sure that the determination of replay content and the triggering of a corresponding digital output pulse occurred within 2.2 ms of the time at which the neural data were acquired in over 95% of the cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>; median added latency: 1.1 ms). Stress tests of the system with artificially generated spikes showed that the added latency remains low for high per-tetrode spike rates and for a large number of tetrodes (up to 32) on a 32-core workstation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>), thus demonstrating the scalability of our solution. Additional tests on a 4-core workstation revealed that added latency has higher variability, especially in the case of 32 tetrodes and high spike rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>), but that performance is similar to that of the 32-core workstation for up to 24 tetrodes and per-tetrode spike rates that match our datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Real-time detection of replay content during resting and awake states</title><p>To test our closed-loop framework of online detection of replay content, we recorded hippocampal ensemble activity using tetrodes in a rat that repeatedly explored the arms of a 3-arm radial maze. In each of the three separate recording sessions, a first exposure to the maze (RUN1) was used to prepare the encoding model for online neural decoding. Cross-validation showed good decoding performance in RUN1 with a median error below 10 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>), which required only a few traversals of the maze (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Real-time closed-loop replay content detection was activated in a subsequent rest epoch (REST) and in a second exposure to the radial maze (RUN2). The encoding model built using data from RUN1 was also valid for decoding the animal’s position in RUN2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>), indicating that recordings were stable and spatial representations had not remapped (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Jeffery, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Latuske et al., 2017</xref>).

Detection latency is mainly dependent on the size of the integration window used to determine replay content, which was fixed to 30 ms (three 10 ms bins) in the live tests. The simulations show that detection latency varied with the size of the integration window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). As expected, the use of smaller bin size and/or a lower number of N<sub>bins</sub> decreases relative detection latency, at the expense of reduced detection accuracy (i.e. lower Matthews correlation coefficient).

Interestingly, Matthews correlation shows little variation for low number of tetrodes and improves most strongly from 10 tetrodes and up. This non-linear dependency is even more clearly present for content accuracy. It is conceivable that, given heterogeneity in spiking data across tetrodes, there is a critical subset of tetrodes that provide most of the information for accurate determination of replay content. The higher Matthews correlation was mainly due to an increased sensitivity and a reduction in false discovery and omission rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a,c</xref>).</p><p>Next, we asked to what extent run decoding performance, evaluated through cross-validation prior to closed-loop manipulation, is predictive of good performance of subsequent (online) replay content identification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maboudi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van der Meer et al., 2017</xref>). As expected, cross-validated run decoding improved with increasing number of tetrodes, as in-arm decoding error decreased and the fraction of arm-correct position estimates increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Run-decoding performance improved rapidly up to four tetrodes and more gradually for higher tetrode counts. As a result, replay detection performance and run decoding performance show a low and highly non-linear correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>), which suggests that a low run-decoding error (e.g. median error below 10 cm) is a necessary although not sufficient condition for accurate online replay detection.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We demonstrated a solution for real-time detection of hippocampal replay content in freely moving rodents that perform navigation tasks. Our solution provides rapid closed-loop feedback that is specifically triggered by replay of an experimenter-defined content, such as replay of a trajectory through one segment of a maze explored by the animal. This technical advance makes it possible to perform replay content-specific perturbations to address directly the causal link between specific replay events and memory consolidation/retrieval processes.</p><p>Our system goes beyond recent efforts to decode or respond to hippocampal activity online. Previous work described systems that provide real-time feedback stimulation in response to spiking activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nguyen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patel et al., 2017</xref>). These systems perform online decoding of a rat’s physical location from a limited number of hippocampal place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guger et al., 2011</xref>) or implement online spike-sorting with simultaneous detection of ripple oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sethi and Kemere, 2015</xref>). However, none of these prior studies addressed the combination of short timescale neural decoding and low-latency detection of replayed spike sequences. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Lavilléon et al. (2015)</xref> showed that coupling spikes of a single hippocampal place cell during rest to electrical stimulation of the medial forebrain bundle induced a subsequent preference of the animal for the cell’s place field. Still, the association with replay was only speculative as no multi-neuronal pattern was being detected. Finally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deng et al. (2016)</xref> developed an algorithm for rapid hippocampal replay content classification in the awake state using state-space models. Despite the low algorithmic latency and the solid mathematical framework of their strategy, the computational latency was still prohibitive and the algorithm's application to live data streams in an experiment was neither demonstrated nor fully conceptualized.</p><p>Our replay detection technology has similarities and differences with the large body of research in brain–computer interfaces (BCIs) and neuroprosthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lebedev and Nicolelis, 2006</xref>). In common with some prototypes of invasive BCIs used for controlling external devices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fraser et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li and Li, 2017</xref>), we applied online population decoding to unsorted large-scale single-unit recordings. The use of high-level signals that relate to cognitive processes such action planning or memory rather than to pure motor function is not new in neuroprosthetics (see cognitive neural prosthetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hampson et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to other BCI and neuroprosthetics applications, the development of a ‘replay BCI’ faced two unique challenges. First, while it is possible to test the accuracy of BCIs by measuring the difference between desired and actual output, the content of hippocampal replay does not have a ‘ground truth’ and requires assumptions and statistical analyses to quantify the goodness of the output. The second and most difficult challenge relates to the strict latency specifications in generating an online feedback. BCIs can operate with a processing latency of less than 50 ms when using slowly sampled (below 4800 Hz) EEG signals on few (8–32) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilson et al., 2010</xref>). BCIs using rapidly sampled signals for spike detection on larger electrode arrays can reach latencies as low as 120 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Velliste et al., 2008</xref>); lower latencies are however not necessary as the natural control of motor output has a natural delay of 150 – 200 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Velliste et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Xu et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we surpassed these limits by using more than 50 channels sampled at 32 kHz to generate estimates of brain state (animals’ position) every 10 ms and to classify hippocampal replay patterns with ~50 ms average latency.</p><p>As with any system that aims to provide on-time feedback, a trade-off was made between the earliest possible prediction of replay content in a population burst and the most accurate possible prediction. This trade-off is reflected in the numbers of incorrect detections and omissions, when compared to a reference replay content classification. Ultimately, the experimental goals determine how the best trade-off is made. For a balanced trade-off between true and false positives/negatives, we opted for the Matthews correlation coefficient as a measure of performance. For some experiments, however, it may be desirable to be more content-specific and a corresponding increase in false negatives (lower sensitivity) is deemed acceptable. On the other hand, it may be more important to detect as many events with target replay content as possible and an increased rate of false positives (lower specificity) is taken for granted. The two main parameters in our replay content detection algorithm, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf33"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf34"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, provide an intuitive means to tune the detection performance and to obtain the desired trade-off. While the exact parameter values depend on the data and optimal values are not known prior to the experiment, similar datasets collected beforehand (without disruptive closed-loop manipulations) are a guide to the actual parameter selection.</p><p>The trade-off between accuracy and latency is affected by the performance of neural decoding. A high cell yield in the recordings will improve decoding performance and hence is expected to lead to better online replay detection. The no-spike-sort decoding approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kloosterman et al., 2014</xref>), which is at the core of our solution, helps by utilizing the information from all available spikes, whether or not they are part of well-isolated cell clusters. Compression of the encoding model and software parallelization in Falcon provided the necessary computational speed-up, which in our system results in the availability of the animal’s replayed position within 2 ms of data arrival, with acceptable decoding accuracy loss.</p><p>A second factor that contributes to the latency-accuracy trade-off is the amount of recent data considered for classifying replay content online. In the content classification algorithm, a shorter window of integration (i.e. fewer bins and/or smaller bin sizes) results in lower detection latencies, and also in an increased focus on local, noisy features of the data that may not be consistent with replay content across the complete event. We settled on a window of 30 ms, which resulted in good replay content detection within short latencies. In future work, further decrease of false-positive and negative detection could be achieved by an extension of our algorithm that adaptively increases the time window to accumulate additional evidence until a certain level of confidence that the event under consideration does or does not represent the target replay content has been reached.</p><p>Further improvement of online replay detection is possible by increasing the sampling of spiking data (e.g. by increasing number of recording channels), as the performance in our tests with up to 14 tetrodes did not yet reach a plateau. The increased spiking data will improve both the MUA burst detection and replay content determination components of the online algorithm. This may also allow a further reduction of the integration window, as this is the main determinant of the detection latency. The system as presented will be able to handle the additional computational burden without increasing the computational latency significantly, as it scales to at least 128 recording channels (32 tetrodes) and probably more when run on a 32-core workstation. Scaling to several hundreds or thousands of recording channels in future implementations may require offloading the computationally intensive neural decoding steps to the graphics processing unit (GPU).</p><p>The detection of hippocampal replay events has to take into account that ground truth replay labels are unavailable. To evaluate the performance of online replay detection, we showed that detected events score higher on measures that correlate with replay content and that detections largely agree with an offline-defined reference. The quality of the offline reference – that is, how well it captures the desired target replay content – depends on the parameters of the offline detector and on sufficient sampling of spiking data. The offline detector has the advantage of access to all data and of not being bound by limited compute time, whereas the the online detector includes compromises to perform fast and early real-time detection. Hence, one would generally have a higher confidence in the offline reference and would accordingly tune the parameters of the online detector using either prior knowledge or training data. Still, depending on parameters, the offline reference may vary from being too inclusive (e.g. all population bursts are marked as replay) to overly exclusive (e.g. no population bursts are marked as replay) and reliance on an inappropriate reference without careful verification will make experiments that manipulate online detected replay events difficult to interpret. Another cautionary note should be made about using decoding performance during run to predict subsequent online replay detection performance: in our tests, run decoding was less sensitive to data degradation and although low run decoding error may be required for good decoding of replay content, it is not a sufficient condition.</p><p>Detection latency of online replay detection was on average ~50 ms. In our previous work, using the same hardware–software system, we demonstrated online burst detection (without replay content identification) at ~40 ms latency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ciliberti and Kloosterman, 2017</xref>). Here, by combining burst and replay content detection in the algorithm, on average we added only 10 ms to the time that is needed for a basic population burst detection in the same closed-loop system.</p><p>The rate of false-positive detections outside candidate replay population bursts were generally low in rest, but more prevalent when the rat was actively exploring the maze, probably due to a higher mean population firing rate during motion than during rest. In offline analyses, information about the animal’s behavior (e.g. running speed) or replay-associated electrophysiological markers (e.g. high-frequency ripple oscillation power) are often used to reduce this category of false positives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>). The integration of this additional information in a Falcon processing pipeline would be relative straightforward, but this strategy may increase detection latency and introduce new sources of errors.</p><p>The incorporation of our real-time replay detection solution in an experiment requires that an encoding model is built from spiking data recorded during an initial exploration of the maze. At present, the encoding model is constructed manually offline and uploaded into the Falcon software during a brief pause of 5 – 15 min between the end of the initial maze exploration and the start of the real-time replay detection. Future enhancements will enable the construction and validation of the encoding model online rather than offline: besides reducing experimental down-time, this will provide immediate feedback on the decoding performance and will enable content-specific closed-loop manipulation of awake replay events as soon as the quality of the encoding model is sufficient.</p><p>In our demonstration, the target replay content for online detection was the representation of one of three maze arms. The system can be trivially extended to environments that are composed of more than three arms (e.g. 8-arm radial mazes or set of linear tracks) and to target joint replay content that covers multiple maze arms in succession. For more strict detection of replay trajectories, a local spatial derivative criterion may be added to the replay classification algorithm. Together with an extension of the encoding model with running direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>), such a trajectory criterion would form the basis of a detector for forward and reverse replay events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>). By altering the encoding model, the system could also be used to target other types of replay content, including reactivation of immobility-associated place cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2017</xref>), non-spatial task-related replay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takahashi, 2015</xref>), sequence reactivation of time cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>) or spiking sequences in nested theta/gamma oscillations during active behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Our approach is not limited to hippocampal replay bursts and could be applied to cortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ji and Wilson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Peyrache et al., 2009</xref>) or subcortical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lansink et al., 2009</xref>) replay as long as it is possible to define a decodable and detectable content.</p><p>In conclusion, we successfully bridged the gap between the basic formulation of online replay identification algorithms and an actual experiment-ready system that addresses the challenges associated with the detection of replay content in live neural data streams. The approach presented here will pave the way for a new generation of closed-loop experiments aimed at elucidating the causal role of hippocampal and non-hippocampal internally generated neural activity in memory processes and cognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Neural decoding</title><p>We employed a Bayesian neural decoding approach that computes the posterior probability over position <italic>x</italic> given the unsorted spikes on <italic>K</italic> tetrodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kloosterman et al., 2014</xref>).

The use of a lock-out period is also consistent with closed-loop experiments that limit stimulation frequency to 4 – 5 Hz to avoid adverse side effects of over-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Girardeau et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jadhav et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Implementation of online replay detection</title><p>A live network stream of sample-by-sample (32 kHz) multi-channel data from a DigiLynx acquisition system (Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT) was fed into a workstation equipped with 256 GB of RAM, 40 MB of smart cache and two 16-core CPUs (Intel Xeon(R) CPU E5-2698 V3 @ 2.30 GHz) that support hardware-based simultaneous multi-threading for a total of 64 virtual cores.

One male Long Evans rat was chronically implanted with a custom micro-drive array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kloosterman et al., 2009</xref>) carrying up to 20 tetrodes. Each tetrode was constructed from four twisted 12 µm diameter polyimide coated nickel-chrome wires (Sandvik, Sweden) and gold-plated to an impedance of 300 kOhm using a nanoZ device (White Matter, Seattle, WA). For the surgical procedure, the rat was anesthetized with 5% isoflurane in an induction chamber and mounted in a stereotaxic frame. Throughout the surgery, body temperature, heart and respiratory rates were monitored and the anesthesia was maintained with 1–2% isoflurane delivered via a respiratory mask. The skull was exposed after an incision in the scalp and a hole centered above hippocampal area CA1 (2.5 mm lateral from the midline and 4 mm posterior to Bregma) was drilled to the size of the tetrode bundle. The implant was fixed to the skull using bone screws and light curable dental cement. A screw above the cerebellum served as animal ground. As part of another experiment, twisted bipolar stainless steel stimulation electrodes (60 µm diameter) were implanted in the ventral hippocampal commissure. During a 3 day post-surgical recovery, pain relief was provided through a daily subcutaneous injection of 1 ml/kg Metacam (Boehringer Ingelheim, Germany, 2 mg/ml).</p><p>Recordings were performed relative to a reference electrode in white matter above area CA1.

Simultaneously with recordings, a duplicate data stream from the Digilynx system was routed to a dedicated workstation for real-time analysis, as described above. The position of the rat was tracked using head-mounted light-emitting diodes and an overhead camera.</p><p>Prior to electrode implantation, the rat was kept on a restricted diet to reduce body weight to 85 – 90% of baseline and was trained to run back and forth on a 120 cm long linear track for food rewards at the ends. As part of an unrelated study, the rat was trained to perform a reward-place association task in a radial maze for three weeks after implantation and prior to tests of online replay identification. In three daily sessions, the rat explored a 3-arm maze for 15 – 20 min before (RUN1) and after (RUN2) a short 10 – 20 min rest period (REST). The maze was composed of three 90 cm long and 8 cm wide elevated linear tracks that were connected to a central platform (50 cm diameter) and ended in a distal 20 × 20 cm reward platform. The configuration of the maze (angles between arms and orientation in the room) were changed daily in order to enhance novelty-induced replay activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng and Frank, 2008</xref>). In RUN1, the rat could retrieve choco-rice treats at each reward platform, which were replenished every time all three arms had been visited. The rat traversed each arm at least 14 times, providing sufficient data for constructing and validating the encoding model. During REST, the rat was placed in a familiar sleep box that was located in the same room. Following REST, the rat again explored the same maze in RUN2 and was awarded a variable amount of choco-rice treats at the reward platforms (again, to enhance replay activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ambrose et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Singer and Frank, 2009</xref>]).

This setup ensured that the encoding model could be built with minimal delays and without interruption of data acquisition in Neuralynx’ Cheetah software.</p><p>For decoding purposes, we treated the maze arms as three separate linear tracks with position as a 1D variable that measured the distance from the central platform along the center line of the arms. Video tracked (x,y) coordinates of the animal’s location were first cleared of tracking errors (e.g. removal of positions outside the maze) and short lasting periods of missing data (e.g. due to tracking errors or occlusions of the LEDs) were interpolated, before projection of 2D coordinates to the center line of the nearest maze arm. Running velocity was computed as the Gaussian smoothed gradient of the 1D position variable (bandwidth of Gaussian kernel set to 0.2 s).</p><p>Building the encoding model entails the construction of compressed kernel density estimators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sodkomkham et al., 2016</xref>) for the spike count and occupancy probability distributions (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4 equ5">Equations 4 and 5)</xref>. These distributions, and hence the posterior distribution, were evaluated on a regular grid of positions in the maze arms with 2.15 cm grid spacing. The kernel bandwidths for the position and spike amplitude variables were set to 8 cm and 30 µV, respectively. We used a compression threshold in the range [1.8, 2] to speed up online computations at the expense of a small reduction in decoding accuracy.

This measure was linearly transformed to a bias<sub>max</sub> measure in the range [0, 1]. A null distribution was constructed from the bias<sub>max</sub> measures of 2000 shuffles created by a random circular shift of positions across the three arms (independently for each time bin).

For this reason, the replay content measures were computed both for the complete burst event and also separately for the two partial events that consist of the first and second half of the time bins in the event. When the number of time bins was odd, the central time bin contributed to both partial events. Given that the maze arms have equal lengths, the implicit assumption is that most joint replay events switch arm representation in the middle of the event. Only long duration burst events (&gt;100 ms) were considered as putative joint replay events.</p><p>Full and partial burst events were classified as containing replay content if their respective measures met the following criteria: bias<sub>max</sub> score &gt;3 and line fit score &gt;0.1. For long burst events with putative joint replay, if either of the partial events were classified as containing replay content and the full event had a bias<sub>max</sub> that was lower than that of the partial events, then the event was split in half and the two partial events were treated separately. In all, we defined three categories of burst events: short and long burst events without replay content, short and long burst events with a single replay content and long burst events that were split in two with the first, second or both partial events being classified as containing replay content.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Evaluation of detection performance</title><p>Online replay content identification events were matched to offline reference population bursts if the time of detection occurred inside the burst window. For the purpose of evaluating replay detection performance, only the first online detection in each reference burst was considered. Reference bursts with confirmed replay content were counted as either true positives (TP) or false negatives (FN), depending on whether an online detection was associated with the burst or not. TP detections were further classified as accurate (TP<sub>acc</sub>) if the online identified content matched the reference replay content (i.e. the specific maze arm).</p><p>We further defined two types of false-positive online detections: those that occurred during reference bursts without replay (FP<sub>burst</sub>) and those that occurred outside any reference burst (FP<sub>non_burst</sub>). True negatives (TN) were defined as reference bursts without replay content that were also correctly ignored online.</p><p>Special consideration was given to the putative joint replay events that were split into two partial events. If the first online detection occurred in the first partial event, it was either counted as TP or FP (depending on whether the partial event contained replay content). In this case, the second partial event was not taken into account. If the first online detection occurred in the second partial event, then a TN or FN was counted for the first partial event and a TP or FP was counted for the second partial event (again depending on whether or not the partial events contained replay content). If no online detection occurred, then one FN was counted.</p><p>To characterize the online detection and identification performance, the following metrics were computed:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Sensitivity, which measures the fraction of reference bursts with replay content that were detected as such online and is computed as TP/(TP +FN).</p></list-item><list-item><p>Specificity, which measures the fraction of reference bursts without replay content that were correctly ignored online and is computed as: TN/(TN +FP<sub>burst</sub>).

After attenuation by the testing boards, the amplitude of the square wave was 5 mV and the frequency was varied from 0 to 1000 Hz.</p><p>Falcon software ran a processing graph that was very similar to that used for live experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>), with a few modifications. First, file serializer nodes were removed and a separate dispatcher node for each group of 32 channels was used (to minimize chances of missed packets). Second, to simulate high tetrode numbers, the parallel per-tetrode processing pipelines (including encoding models built from the original data) were duplicated to test up to 32 tetrodes. Third, to replicate the computations performed during live tests, the neural decoding nodes used pre-recorded spike amplitudes instead of the amplitudes of the incoming artificial spikes. Finally, the replay content classifier node was programmed to generate a closed-loop feedback event every 100 ms (10 bins) for 5 min (for a total of 3000 test latencies). Added latency was computed as the difference between the recorded time-stamp of the closed-loop feedback event and the time-stamp that marked the end of a 100 ms test period.</p><p>Stress tests were performed on the same 32-core workstation used for live tests (see 'Implementation of online replay detection') and also on a 4-core machine (single CPU, Intel Core i7-4790 @ 3.60 GHz, 16 GB of RAM and 8 MB of smart cache).

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;Real-time classification of experience-related ensemble spiking patterns for closed-loop applications&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being reviewed by Sabine Kastner as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>Given the list of essential revisions, the editors and reviewers invite you to respond with an action plan for the completion of the additional work. We plan to share your responses with the reviewers and then issue a binding recommendation.</p><p>All reviewers were generally positive about your manuscript and saw the potential for the real-time decoding methods to permit experiments that are not currently possible. However, the reviewers engaged in a thoughtful discussion and agreed that there are five key issues that should be addressed to ensure that the study makes a substantial impact on the field. These five specific issues are listed below (and followed by the reviews in their entirety, which include other minor comments that should also be addressed prior to resubmission):</p><p>1) The authors should better define their parameter space in which their algorithm is effective (e.g., what are the minimum number of tetrodes and spikes per time bin required for effective online replay detection?). To assess this, the authors could subsample their data (or perhaps use others' datasets that are available online) and focus on how these parameters affect detection of false positives and false negatives.</p><p>2) The authors should make their dataset available for comparison with other datasets or future datasets. The authors should also make their code for online and offline detection available for comparison with others.</p><p>3) The authors should be sure to more clearly explain how the present paper provides valuable insights that were not provided in their previous report (e.g., parameters necessary for effective online detection of replay).</p><p>4) The authors should provide a better explanation of the differences between the new real-time algorithm and standard offline methods.</p><p>5) The authors should clarify how examples were selected. Are the presented examples representative or are they the best examples? Perhaps a supplemental figure could be added in which the authors show multiple detected replay events selected in an unbiased/less biased way (e.g., all detected replay events from one example episode of awake rest, or all detected replay episodes from all rest epochs from an example behavioral session).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In the current manuscript, Ciliberti et al., describe a novel closed-loop method for online detection of the spatial content encoded by ripple events to allow for near-real-time feedback during specific replay events. This method addresses an important technical problem for in vivo hippocampal research, namely that current work on hippocampal sequences is necessarily correlative. To demonstrate causal relationships between ripple-based reactivation (or other sequences, such as theta sequences) and behavior/memory, one must manipulate neural activity only during expression of specific sequences. As the authors note, one prior replay detection algorithm has been published, although the method described in the current manuscript is distinct from that described by Deng et al.</p><p>I have very few concerns regarding the methodology described in the manuscript. I think the authors have done an excellent job of quantifying the accuracy of their algorithm with the dataset they collected, and the authors have convinced me that their method is generally effective at identifying specific replay trajectories in one rat.

However, if the authors are attempting to provide this methodology as a general tool to the scientific community, it becomes much more important to establish the parameter space in which it works and in which it fails.

I also presume that more spikes might generally produce a more accurate representation of the current information representation in the hippocampus and thus increase the likelihood of true replay detection. Further, a higher average spike rate would likely serve to lower bin-to-bin spike density fluctuations, thereby reducing spurious <italic>θ<sub>mua</sub></italic> crossings. Finally, based on Figure 1C, it seems that more spikes slows the decoding algorithm. Thus, I wonder if there is an optimum number of spikes/ms for this method. In other words, would too many recording electrodes actually become detrimental to implementation of this method (by slowing the decoding too much or making the posterior probabilities too high)? Alternatively, are there a critical number of electrodes or spikes/ms that are required for this method to be effective (to avoid too many spurious <italic>θ<sub>mua</sub></italic> crossings or to ensure faithful decoding)? These questions could be addressed by subsampling the authors' datasets in order to test whether there is a minimum required spike rate. In addition, there are several publicly available datasets that may contain more spikes/ms or the authors could artificially add spikes to their existing dataset to test the effect of increasing total sampling on the algorithm's performance.</p><p>The second parameter is the effective 'coverage' of the environment by the spiking activity. While the authors report that there was sufficient coverage in order to faithfully decode the animal's location during exploration (these data should be shown), it was not reported whether the decoding was more/less accurate on specific arms or whether that accuracy impacted the performance of the algorithm in detecting replays of that arm. This would be important information for researchers to have in order to allow them to know when this method can be properly utilized and when it can't. Specifically, is there a critical decoding accuracy (during active behavior using a 200-300 ms decoding window) that must be met before the replay detection algorithm is effective? This could be examined by the authors by selectively subsampling the spikes detected on specific arms to reduce the effectiveness of the encoding model in order to correlate decoding accuracy with replay detection. This additionally addresses how long RUN1 needs to be for the algorithm to work (i.e., are five laps sufficient to build the encoding model or does it require 20 laps?).</p><p>These two parameters could also be tested, perhaps more convincingly, by obtaining data from additional rats, although I do not believe that this is strictly necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This Tools and Resources article is the first to demonstrate classification of hippocampal replay using real-time ensemble decoding.

However, the reviewers engaged in a thoughtful discussion and agreed that there are five key issues that should be addressed to ensure that the study makes a substantial impact on the field. These five specific issues are listed below (and followed by the reviews in their entirety, which include other minor comments that should also be addressed prior to resubmission):</p><p>1) The authors should better define their parameter space in which their algorithm is effective (e.g., what are the minimum number of tetrodes and spikes per time bin required for effective online replay detection?). To assess this, the authors could subsample their data (or perhaps use others' datasets that are available online) and focus on how these parameters affect detection of false positives and false negatives.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers requested and as detailed below in the replies, we have added analyses in which we subsampled the number of tetrodes and assessed the effect on replay detection performance. We further performed stress-tests of our system to evaluate how many spikes/bin and how many tetrodes can still be processed in real-time without increasing detection latency. Finally, we analyzed how two additional parameters (time bin size and number of bins) influence the trade-off between replay detection latency and accuracy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should make their dataset available for comparison with other datasets or future datasets. The authors should also make their code for online and offline detection available for comparison with others.</p></disp-quote><p>We are preparing the three the datasets that we collected for the manuscript for uploading to the “Collaborative Research in Computational Neuroscience” website (http://crcns.org). The code for online decoding is integrated into our Falcon software platform and the latest version will be made available on https://bitbucket.org/kloostermannerflab/falcon-server. The code for offline replay detection (and other analysis) will also be made available in a repository on our bitbucket website (https://bitbucket.org/kloostermannerflab). We are currently in the process of checking and cleaning the repositories and will make them public within the next weeks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should be sure to more clearly explain how the present paper provides valuable insights that were not provided in their previous report (e.g., parameters necessary for effective online detection of replay).</p></disp-quote><p>In our previously published work, we described an efficient offline implementation of spike-sorting-less neural decoding (Sodkomkham et al., 2016) and a general software framework for complex online neural processing in closed-loop settings (Ciliberti and Kloosterman, 2017). However, we did not previously address the full real-time replay identification problem with a concrete implementation that could be applied to streaming data. In the current work, we demonstrate that replay events can be identified in-time with a relatively straightforward algorithm and we show how the value of a number of critical parameters influence online replay detection performance. We have more clearly highlighted the novel contributions of the current manuscript in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should provide a better explanation of the differences between the new real-time algorithm and standard offline methods.</p></disp-quote><p>The main difference is that the online algorithm is designed with real-time streaming data in mind and the complexity is low on purpose such that parameter values are intuitive, which facilitates incorporation into experiments for which parameters need to be set ahead of time and cannot be optimized afterwards. Offline methods have an advantage in that all data is available and there is little computational constraint. We have added a more detailed explanation of the differences between the online and offline methods in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should clarify how examples were selected. Are the presented examples representative or are they the best examples? Perhaps a supplemental figure could be added in which the authors show multiple detected replay events selected in an unbiased/less biased way (e.g., all detected replay events from one example episode of awake rest, or all detected replay episodes from all rest epochs from an example behavioral session).</p></disp-quote><p>The examples were picked manually from the first 300 candidate replay events among all RUN2 and SLEEP sessions. The selected examples are not “the best” according to some metric, but certainly there is a bias because of the visual inspection. Selected examples were focused on showing relatively clear replay events with correct online detections. True negative events were selected randomly. We have added a description of how example selection was performed to the figure legend. Given the large number of events (see Table 1), it will be difficult to show all events in a dataset as suggested. However, as was suggested in a follow-up to this reviewer report, we have added a supplemental figure with examples of false positive/negative detections and describe in the legend the main causes of the incorrect detections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p></disp-quote><p> <italic>In the current manuscript, Ciliberti et al., describe a novel closed-loop method for online detection of the spatial content encoded by ripple events to allow for near-real-time feedback during specific replay events. This method addresses an important technical problem for</italic> in vivo <italic>hippocampal research, namely that current work on hippocampal sequences is necessarily correlative. To demonstrate causal relationships between ripple-based reactivation (or other sequences, such as theta sequences) and behavior/memory, one must manipulate neural activity only during expression of specific sequences. As the authors note, one prior replay detection algorithm has been published, although the method described in the current manuscript is distinct from that described by Deng et al.</italic></p><p>Before discussing the points below, we want to highlight that our algorithm is more complete than the on presented in Deng et al., 2016, as it is suitable for an online scenario with streaming data rather than on offline scenario in which the onset and offset of replay events are known. In addition – and in contrast to Deng et al., – we have demonstrated and characterized a real-time implementation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have very few concerns regarding the methodology described in the manuscript. I think the authors have done an excellent job of quantifying the accuracy of their algorithm with the dataset they collected, and the authors have convinced me that their method is generally effective at identifying specific replay trajectories in one rat. However, I do have concerns regarding the general applicability of this method beyond the single example recording described in this paper.</p><p>If the authors were using this methodology to address a specific scientific question, then it would be acceptable to demonstrate how well it works on their dataset and stop there.

The authors do explore some parameter tuning, but this is largely limited to adjusting θsharp and θmua. It seems to me that many additional parameters necessarily impact both the quality and the speed of this algorithm. While it is impractical for the authors to examine all possible parameters that may ever be encountered, there are two critical parameters that I feel should be examined by the authors to make this method generally useful to the broader scientific community. The first of these parameters is the total number of spikes that are entering the algorithm per time bin.

I also presume that more spikes might generally produce a more accurate representation of the current information representation in the hippocampus and thus increase the likelihood of true replay detection. Further, a higher average spike rate would likely serve to lower bin-to-bin spike density fluctuations, thereby reducing spurious θmua crossings.

At the same time, more spikes give a better estimate of instantaneous MUA rate. The downside of more spikes is an increase of the computational burden that may affect latency.</p><p>To address the reviewer's comment, we first performed a stress test to show what spike rate can be handled in our system with varying number of tetrodes. We performed the test on both a 32-core workstation and a more standard quad-core machine. The results (Figure 1—figure supplement 2) indicate that the added latency remains low even for high spike rates. The quad-core computer generally performs well but has increased median and worst case added latency for high tetrode counts and high spike rates.</p><p>Second, we followed the reviewer's suggestion and characterized the replay detection algorithm and its performance when less data is available (by subsampling the tetrodes). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>, the reviewer predicted correctly that higher tetrode number decreases the variability and hence increase the separability of the MUA rate distributions for non-burst periods, bursts without replay and bursts with replay. The reviewer was also correct that the maximum posterior probability (as measured by our sharpness measure) shifts to higher values with increasing number of tetrodes, without reaching a plateau in our dataset (panels b and d in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Still, sharpness distributions for non-burst periods and bursts with replay remain separable.</p><p>The quantification of the online replay detection performance after tetrode subsampling are described in a new section in the main text and shown in Figure 6 and its supplements. In brief, online replay detection performance increases with higher number of tetrodes, but the increase is strongest when the number of tetrodes is ten or more in our dataset. This suggests that a critical number of tetrodes (and a critical number of informative spikes on these tetrodes) are required for accurate replay detection. In contrast, run decoding error (in 200 ms time bins) during exploration appeared to be less sensitive to reduction of the number of tetrodes. As a consequence, although there is a (highly non-linear) correlation between the variables, a low run decoding error is not a sufficient condition for subsequent good online replay detection.</p><p>(We can include the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref> in the manuscript if the reviewer considers this desirable).</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36275.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Example distributions of MUA rate for time bins outside and inside (with or without identified replay content) candidate replay bursts.

Given the complexity of these experiments, we believe opening the technology to the larger experimental neuroscience community sooner (as a Tools and Resources article in <italic>eLife</italic> and by sharing the tools) provides the best way forward.</p><p>We are happy to hear that the reviewer considers the performance of our system “quite good”. The reviewer wonders if the performance level may be due to an inappropriate offline defined standard to which the online detections are compared. This comment touches on an important issue. Although the reviewer is concerned about an inflated online performance, the opposite may be true as well: an inappropriate offline standard that underestimates the online replay detection performance. Fundamentally, the problem is that no ground truth replay labels exist. For this reason, we sought to first characterize the online detection without a hard classification of events into bursts with or without replay content. As shown in Figure 2, positively detected events score higher in several measures that correlate with replay content.</p><p>For more in depth quantification of the performance, we did compare the online detections to an offline standard. In our view, an experimenter needs to first define what constitutes replay content and then constructs offline and online detectors that aim to identify the (unlabeled) replay events. The offline detector has access to all data and is not bound by limited compute time and the online detector is (generally) modeled after the offline detector but includes compromises to perform fast and early real-time detection. Hence, we have more confidence in the ability of the offline detector to correctly detect replay events and to provide the best possible reference for evaluation of the online detector performance. One would then try to adjust the parameters for the online detector (e.g. using prior knowledge or training data) to match its result to that of the offline detector.</p><p>If the offline standard is “inappropriate” with respect to the (unknown) ground truth (e.g. parameters of the offline detector are set incorrectly), then any (mis)match between the result of the online detector and the offline standard will be difficult to interpret. By changing the parameters of the offline detector, the resulting offline standard may vary all the way from being very inclusive (e.g. all population bursts are marked as replay) to very exclusive (e.g. no population bursts are marked as replay) – and the online detector will largely follow as parameters are adapted (to the extent that the offline and online algorithms are consistent). However, because ground truth is unknown, there is no direct way in which we can assess if the offline standard is appropriate. Indirect methods, such as visual inspection or independent replay assessment (e.g. separate replay measures that are not part of the offline detector), may be helpful and strengthen our belief that the offline standard is appropriate. In our manuscript, visual inspection of the offline defined replay events, as illustrated by the example (non)replay events shown in Figure 3 and the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1, give us confidence that the offline standard is appropriate and contains events with the desired replay structure. We have added some of the consideration above to the Discussion section.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The revised manuscript is much improved, and the authors have largely addressed my concerns.</p><p>I would have much preferred for Figure 6 to have examined the effect of spike or cell number rather than tetrode number, as one can put in 100 tetrodes and get no cells or put in 12 tetrodes and get 150 cells (Wilson and McNaughton, 1993).

The new analyses are important in delineating the tradeoffs involved in configuring the system, and the conditions that need to be met for adequate performance.</p><p>Among these additions is the subsampling analysis which suggests a nonlinear performance improvement around 10 tetrodes, and continued improvement as more tetrodes are added. Also useful is the analysis describing how much sampling of the environment is required to build a usable encoding model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> in the rebuttal). If the authors prefer to not include this figure as a supplement, I think a statement in the text along with some descriptive statistics would be helpful in making the point that for this data set, a few trials appear to be sufficient.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the figure as Figure 1—figure supplement 4.</p></body></sub-article></article>
