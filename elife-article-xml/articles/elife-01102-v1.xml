evolution of this phylum is enigmatic, as relatives have not been characterized. Here we use whole genome reconstruction of human fecal and subsurface aquifer metagenomic samples to obtain complete genomes for members of a new candidate phylum sibling to Cyanobacteria, for which we propose the designation ‘Melainabacteria’. Metabolic analysis suggests that the ancestors to both lineages were non-photosynthetic, anaerobic, motile, and obligately fermentative. Cyanobacterial light sensing may have been facilitated by regulators present in the ancestor of these lineages. The subsurface organism has the capacity for nitrogen fixation using a nitrogenase distinct from that in Cyanobacteria, suggesting nitrogen fixation evolved separately in the two lineages. We hypothesize that Cyanobacteria split from Melainabacteria prior or due to the acquisition of oxygenic photosynthesis. Melainabacteria remained in anoxic zones and differentiated by niche adaptation, including for symbiosis in the mammalian gut.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01102.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01102.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01102.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microbes are ubiquitous in the world and exist in complex communities called microbiomes that have colonized many environments, including the human gut. Until modern techniques for sequencing nucleic acids became available, many of the organisms found in these microbiomes could not be studied because they could not be cultured in the laboratory. However, advances in sequencing technology have made it possible to study the evolution and properties of these microbes, including their impact on human health.</p><p>Bacteria belonging to the phylum Cyanobacteria had a significant effect on the prehistoric Earth because they were the first organisms to produce gaseous oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis, and thus shaped the Earth’s oxygen-rich atmosphere. Early plants took up these bacteria in a symbiotic relationship, and plastids—the organelles in plant cells that perform photosynthesis and produce oxygen–are the descendants of Cyanobacteria.</p><p>Organisms evolutionarily related to Cyanobacteria have been found in the human gut and in various aquatic sources, but these bacteria have not been studied because it has not been possible to isolate or culture them. Now, Di Rienzi, Sharon et al. have used modern sequencing techniques to obtain complete genomes for some of these bacteria, which they assign to a new phylum called Melainabacteria.</p><p>By analyzing these genomes, Di Rienzi, Sharon et al. were able to make predictions about the cell structure and metabolic abilities of Melainabacteria. Like Cyanobacteria, they have two membranes surrounding the bacterial cell; unlike Cyanobacteria, however, they have flagella that propel them through liquid or across surfaces. Most interestingly, Melainabacteria are not able to perform photosynthesis, but instead produce energy through fermentation and release hydrogen gas that can be consumed by other microorganisms.</p><p>The genome of the bacteria isolated from water reveals that it has the capacity to fix nitrogen. Cyanobacteria can also fix atmospheric nitrogen, but the protein complexes used by the two phyla are not related, which suggests that nitrogen fixation evolved after the evolutionary divergence of Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria.</p><p>By exploring previously published datasets of bacterial communities, Di Rienzi, Sharon et al. found that Melainabacteria are common in aquatic habitats. They are also prevalent in the guts of herbivorous mammals and humans with a predominantly vegetarian diet. Melainabacteria from the human gut also synthesize several B and K vitamins, which suggests that these bacteria are beneficial to their host because in addition to aiding with the digestion of plant fibers, they are also a source of vitamins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01102.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01102.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Cyanobacteria</kwd><kwd>Melainabacteria</kwd><kwd>photosynthesis</kwd><kwd>nitrogen fixation</kwd><kwd>human gut</kwd><kwd>subsurface</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK093595</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ley</surname><given-names>Ruth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>David and Lucile Packard Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2010-35960</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ley</surname><given-names>Ruth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Hartwell Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ley</surname><given-names>Ruth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Arnold and Mabel Beckman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ley</surname><given-names>Ruth E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DOE IFRC, Subsurface Biogeochemical Research Program, Office of Science, Biological and Environmental Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-AC02-05CH11231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>Jillian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>EMBO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sharon</surname><given-names>Itai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Jordana T</given-names></name><name><surname>Spector</surname><given-names>Timothy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bell</surname><given-names>Jordana T</given-names></name><name><surname>Spector</surname><given-names>Timothy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DOE Knowledgebase Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DE-SC0004918</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banfield</surname><given-names>Jillian F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Melainabacteria, a candidate phylum related to Cyanobacteria, has been identified in gut and sediment samples by genomic analysis.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Among the geochemical changes that have occurred over the past few billion years, perhaps the most dramatic was the transformation of the Earth’s atmosphere and upper oceans into oxygen-rich environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekker et al., 2004</xref>). Cyanobacteria are presumed responsible for this geochemical revolution, as they comprise the sole lineage known to have innovated the production of oxygen as a byproduct of photosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</xref>). Further, nitrogen fixation by Cyanobacteria is central to the Earth’s nitrogen cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vitousek et al., 2002</xref>). Cyanobacteria are inferred to be one of the earliest branching bacterial lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altermann and Kazmierczak, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekker et al., 2004</xref>) and have diversified across environments—land, fresh, and salt water, and all levels of the photic zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dworkin, 2006</xref>). Via endosymbiosis, Cyanobacteria became the chloroplasts of plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sagan, 1967</xref>), a role that underlines their broad evolutionary importance.</p><p>The evolutionary history of the Cyanobacteria phylum is only partially resolved: no related taxa, from which a common ancestor could be inferred, have been described. However, recent culture-independent 16S rRNA gene surveys of microbial communities have revealed a novel clade sibling and basal to Cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ley et al., 2005</xref>). The presence of organisms related to Cyanobacteria in the gut is notable because they are widely shared across individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Consortium HMP, 2012</xref>), where members of this group can comprise up to 20% of the total sequences recovered from stool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dethlefsen and Relman, 2011</xref>), as well as shared across various mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ley et al., 2008</xref>). As Cyanobacteria are photosynthetic organisms, it has been assumed that these sequences represent genomic material derived from ingestion of chloroplasts or Cyanobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Turnbaugh et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Koenig et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Consortium HMP, 2012</xref>). However, given their large evolutionary separation from Cyanobacteria and the lack of cultured representatives, no conclusion as to the roles of these predominant organisms of the human gut has been possible.</p><p>Related bacteria deep-branching from the Cyanobacteria have also been detected in water and other anoxic environments including sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ley et al., 2005</xref>). An earlier phylogenetic reconstruction based on full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that this water-soil-sediment-derived clade is distinct from that made up entirely of gut-derived sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ley et al., 2005</xref>). This mapping of habitats onto the two clades suggested that niche adaptation had shaped the groups’ evolution and hence their phylogeny, but beyond this observation the lineage remained enigmatic.</p><p>New sequencing methods and bioinformatics advances provide a route for genomic analysis of uncultured organisms from complex microbial communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dick et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Iverson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wrighton et al., 2012</xref>). We show that these methods can yield complete and near-complete genomes from relatively low abundance organisms, without the need for single cell genomic approaches. Here, we analyze eight curated genomes from bacteria from intestinal samples and an aquifer sediment to evaluate their metabolisms and roles in their respective habitats. The analysis provides clues as to the ancestral state of the lineage that gave rise to these organisms and to the Cyanobacteria.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Reconstruction of genomes from metagenomic samples</title><p>We generated metagenomes from three fecal samples obtained from three healthy adult humans (termed A, B, and C; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Completeness was confirmed by validating assembly graph connectivity, and also by considering expected genome features such as single copy genes. Correctness was confirmed by re-assembly of potentially mis-assembled regions such as scaffold ends, and by considering the ‘phylogenetic profile’ of genes in each scaffold. Our curation method verified unique paired read placement throughout the reconstructed genomes, a requirement consistent with standard methods of isolate genomics.

Additional small scaffolds were identified and incorporated using paired read placement.

Three subgroups are revealed, one of which comprises sequences obtained from animal guts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The 16S rRNA gene sequences of the gut and aquifer bacteria share no more than 84% identity to Cyanobacterial sequences, consistent with placement of these organisms in a new candidate phylum (&lt;85% identity, as suggested previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hugenholtz et al., 1998</xref>]). The bacterial tree has been described as a polytomy due to the inability of 16S rRNA gene phylogenies to capture any specific branching order for the phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pace, 1997</xref>), so this phylum is unusual in its robustly supported relationship to Cyanobacteria. To further substantiate this evolutionary relationship, we constructed a phylogeny of concatenated ribosomal protein sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The result shows that the eight new genomes form a monophyletic lineage that branches deeply from the Cyanobacterial lineage, with ACD20 basal to the group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Importantly, a common ancestor for these organisms and photosynthetic Cyanobacteria is well supported (100/100 bootstrap bipartitions) in both trees.

Moreover, two of the gut genomes (MEL.B1 and MEL.B2) encode the A type of RnpB (E-values 5.676e-59, 2.235e-60 respectively), which is found in all Bacteria except the Firmicutes and Tenericutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Haas et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zwieb et al., 2011</xref>). Three of the four complete genomes also have homologs to the S-layer like COG, CyOG00138 (e.g., <italic>Anabaena variabilis</italic>: Q3MBT3), a protein found only in Cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</xref>). Although these genes are not exclusive to Cyanobacteria, they are important phylogenetic markers, support a shared ancestry with Cyanobacteria, and refute an ancestry with the Firmicutes, a possibility that arises when considering the metabolic genes of the Melainabacteria genomes (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Melainabacteria are non-photosynthetic and non-respiratory but contain homologs to genes encoding light response regulators in photosynthetic Cyanobacteria</title><p>Oxygenic photosynthesis is perhaps the most exceptional characteristic of Cyanobacteria, as all other bacterial photosyntheses are anoxygenic. The Melainabacteria genomes appear to entirely lack genes for photosynthesis (photosystem I and photosystem II, thylakoid membranes, succinate dehydrogenase, and the cytochrome b<sub>6</sub>f complex), indicating that none have the capacity for oxygenic or anoxygenic photosynthesis. Also absent are genes for soluble (e.g., plastocyanin or photosynthetic ferredoxin) and membrane-affiliated electron carrier proteins (e.g., cytochromes, quinones, Fe-S, or flavin). Additionally, we found no genes for aerobic respiration including terminal quinol and cytochrome <italic>c</italic> oxidases, terminal reductases involved in anaerobic respiration (e.g., fumarate, nitrate), or carbon fixation pathways. Together these findings suggest that these members of the Melainabacteria are not capable of phototrophy or respiratory metabolism.</p><p>Despite being non-photosynthetic, the melainabacterial genomes encode homologs of the circadian rhythm regulators RpaA and RpaB and the high intensity light sensor NblS. The histidine kinase NblS in Cyanobacteria preserves the photosynthetic machinery by regulating its expression and degradation under high and blue/UV-A conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Waasbergen et al., 2002</xref>). RpaA and RpaB are found in all Cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</xref>), where they regulate the circadian clock KaiABC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanaoka et al., 2012</xref>) and link energy transfer between the antennae and the photosystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashby and Mullineaux, 1999</xref>). The four complete genomes of Melainabacteria lack SasA, which typically functions as the sensor to the response regulators RpaA and RpaB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanaoka et al., 2012</xref>), as well as any photosynthetic machinery, which suggests that these proteins may have another function. Similarly, the NblS homolog in the gut and aquifer Melainabacteria most likely has a different function. The current KEGG database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kanehisa et al., 2012</xref>) indicates that RpaA and NblS are exclusive to Cyanobacteria. RpaB is likely also exclusive to Cyanobacteria; however, given this gene’s similarity to other response regulators it could be considered present in two other bacterial genomes, <italic>Variovorax paradoxus</italic> and <italic>Desulfomicrobium baculatum</italic>. In all cases, the three Melainabacteria genes have highest homology to those present in Cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Melainabacteria are encapsulated by a Cyanobacteria-like cell envelope</title><p>Like Cyanobacteria, Melainabacteria are inferred to have a Gram-negative cell envelope. This conclusion is based on the large number of genes for lipopolysaccharide (LPS), Lipid A biosynthesis, and O-antigen polymerases and transporters found in the curated genomes described here (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). LPS, Lipid A, and O-antigen are components of the Gram-negative outer membrane; in contrast, Gram-positive bacteria lack an outer membrane and therefore lack these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Purves et al., 2003</xref>). This finding is significant, because many genes in the newly reconstructed genomes share closest sequence similarity to Gram-positive members of the Firmicutes (see below). As previously mentioned, the genomes encode a homolog to an S-layer-like protein, suggesting that the cell envelope has an S-layer. S-layers and O-antigens have both been previously observed on photosynthetic Cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hoiczyk and Hansel, 2000</xref>). Taken together, the cell envelope is likely similar to that of Cyanobacteria, consistent with a shared vertical ancestry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Melainabacteria are obligate anaerobic fermenters</title><p>Based on the lack of a linked electron transport chain, aerobic or anaerobic respiratory complexes (see above), and a complete TCA cycle (see below), and the presence of fermentative and degradative enzymes, we infer that Melainabacteria are obligate anaerobic fermenters. We predict that Melainabacteria can use a wide variety of carbon compounds, including hemicellulosic compounds (only ACD20), polysaccharides, oligosaccharides, and simple sugars, as well as organic acids, amino acids, and fatty acids to yield hydrogen, lactate, acetate (ACD20), formate (Gut), hydrogen, possibly butyrate (ACD20) and ethanol (Gut) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Specific sugars predicted to be fermented are glucose, fructose, sorbitol, mannose, trehalose, starch, glycogen, hemicellulose, and amylose, and the relevant enzymes are α-galactosidase, β-galactosidase, α-glucosidase, β-glucosidase, β-glucuronidase, β-fructofranosidase (sucrase), α-mannosidase, pullulanase, α-amylase, and endo-1, 4-beta-xylanase. These enzymes facilitate the utilization of a variety of sugar compounds by degrading the compounds into simpler sugars that can enter the main Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas (EMP) glycolytic pathway. This pathway contains not the classical ATP-dependent enzyme, but a pyrophosphate-dependent phosphofructokinase, a gene found in diverse organisms capable of anaerobic glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mertens, 1991</xref>). This difference in phosphoryl donor specificity may confer an energetic advantage to the cell when glycolysis is the primary source of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, gene 3). The genomes have the genes necessary for hexose interconversion in the EMP pathway via the pentose phosphate pathway, such that ribose, arabinose, xylulose, and other five-carbon sugar or sugar-alcohols may be utilized. Unlike most Cyanobacteria, which use internal carbon pools for fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Stal and Moezelaar, 1997</xref>), Melainabacteria likely acquire sugars and sugar-alcohols from the environment via a variety of cytoplasmic membrane permeases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Overall, the cells are inferred to have a lifestyle analogous to anaerobic obligate fermentative bacteria known to play an important role in carbon transformation in gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mackie, 2002</xref>) and subsurface systems.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01102.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The physiological and metabolic landscape of Melainabacteria.</title><p>Metabolic predictions for Melainabacteria based on genes identified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>.

Names of pathways and fermentation end-products are bolded and ATP generated by substrate-level phosphorylation are noted. All Melainabacteria genomes sampled lack electron transport chain components (including cytochromes (Cyto), succinate dehydrogenase (sdh), flavins, quinones), terminal respiratory oxidases or reductases, and photosystem I or II (PS1, PS2). The genomes also lack a complete TCA cycle (absent enzymes noted by red boxes), with the TCA enzymes instead linked to the fermentation of amino acids and organic acids denoted (pathways, blue arrows). Ferredoxin (Fd, green text) is important for hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>) production via hydrogenases (yellow background box). Proton translocation mechanisms (green background box) may be achieved by the activity of trimeric oxaloacetate (OAA) decarboxylase and sodium-hydrogen antiporter, pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis with pyrophosphatases, 11 subunit NADH dehydrogenase, and an annotated NiFe hydrogenase (green enzyme).

We also confirmed that the genomes lack alternative enzymes first identified in <italic>Synechococcus</italic> species PCC 7002 that functionally complete the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang and Bryant, 2011</xref>). Moreover, the genomes have an NAD<sup>+</sup> not the NADP<sup>+</sup> dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase found in most Cyanobacteria. The absence of a complete TCA cycle necessitates an external requirement for dicarboxylic acids, which could be imported by the two dicarboxylic acid transporters found in each genome. This observation, along with the need for an H<sub>2</sub>-consuming partner, could guide development of growth media for future isolation efforts.</p><p>We infer that the TCA cycle enzymes in the genomes reported here function to link to nitrogen metabolism and energy generating pathways. Both the ACD20 and MEL.B2 genomes encode isocitrate dehydrogenase and fumarase, whose end-products are important intermediates in nitrogen assimilation and amino acid pathways. Unlike the genomes of the gut bacteria, ACD20 can augment glycolytic ATP substrate-level phosphorylation with additional ATP generation using TCA cycle intermediates. For example, unidirectional aspartate ammonia-lyase, fumarase, and malic enzyme can convert amino acids (alanine and aspartate) and organic acids to pyruvate and ultimately acetate with ATP generation. Also, like citrate fermentation in <italic>Klebsiella pneuemoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dimroth, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dimroth and Schink, 1998</xref>), ACD20 may use citrate lyase in conjunction with the combined action of membrane-bound oxaloacetate decarboxylase (EC 4.1.1.3) to pump sodium ions. Combined with a sodium-hydrogen antiporter, a hydrogen gradient can be generated and used to drive cellular processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, blue arrows). Hence, the TCA cycle does not appear to function as it does in most Cyanobacteria, where it generates reducing equivalents for oxidative phosphorylation, but rather links to nitrogen metabolism and organic acid fermentation for energy generation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Production of proton-motive force and H<sub>2</sub></title><p>In the absence of a complete electron transport chain (above), the gut and aquifer bacteria studied here appear to augment the ATP produced by substrate-level phosphorylation by membrane energization.

Given that the human gut associated Melainabacteria only produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation in glycolysis, these alternative modes of generating an energized membrane may be important to their overall energy balance.</p><p>The Melainabacteria can generate a membrane potential by four mechanisms: (i) a sodium gradient generated by decarboxylation of oxaloacetate (using an oxaloacetate decarboxylase and sodium-hydrogen antiporter, see TCA cycle); (ii) membrane bound H<sup>+</sup>-translocating pyrophosphatases, which use some of the energy liberated during inorganic pyrophosphate (PPi) hydrolysis to drive proton translocation across the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schocke and Schink, 1998</xref>); (iii) an 11-subunit complex I dehydrogenase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battchikova et al., 2011</xref>); and (iv) a putatively annotated six subunit NiFe membrane-bound hydrogenase that lacks required hydrogen binding motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vignais and Billoud, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Marreiros et al., 2013</xref>).

This approach has the potential to replace culture-based, single cell, and flow cytometry-based genomics methods, which are costlier and more laborious due to the requirement for cell manipulation.

Similarly, ACD20 should be assigned to the Melainabacteria candidate phylum. Both 16S rRNA and concatenated ribosomal protein phylogenetic trees support common ancestry for the Melainabacteria and the Cyanobacteria lineages. Melainabacteria are, therefore, not only important members of the human gut but their unique evolutionary placement also provides novel insight into the evolution of Cyanobacteria.</p><p>Our metabolic reconstruction indicates that the Melainabacteria are anaerobic, obligate fermenters capable of utilizing diverse carbon sources, which are imported as well as derived from internal carbon sources. Melainabacteria lack a linked electron transport chain but have multiple methods for generating a membrane potential, which can then produce ATP via an ATP synthase. Distinct from Cyanobacteria (which have NiFe hydrogenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tamagnini et al., 2007</xref>]), the Melainabacteria cells use FeFe hydrogenases for H<sub>2</sub> production and may require an H<sub>2</sub>-sink (e.g., a coexisting acetogen, methanogen, or other respiring partner) to maintain low partial H<sub>2</sub> pressures.</p><p>The metabolic profile and nutritional requirements of Melainabacteria uncovered here provide guidance into how these bacteria may be cultured. Efforts to culture Melainabacteria should focus on providing a diverse array of sugars and carbohydrates, dicarboxylic acids, and a complete set of amino acids in an anaerobic, dark environment. Moreover, given their production of H<sub>2</sub>, these strategies should include removal of hydrogen through use of an H<sub>2</sub>-consuming syntrophic partner.</p><p>We infer that the protein sequences of the flagellin genes of Melainabacteria are recognized by Toll-like receptor 5 (as are flagellins of some commensal Firmicutes in the mammalian gut) that mediates interaction with the host. The human gut Melainabacteria may provide their host with B and K vitamins and fill a niche based on carbon fermentation in the large intestine, analogous to that of the Firmicutes. Based on their distribution in animals and humans living on different continents and consuming different diets, we hypothesize that the gut Melainabacteria flourish in the presence of plant polysaccharides and may aid in the digestion of plant fibers.</p><p>Oxygenic photosynthesis, a unique form of photosynthesis that originated in the cyanobacterial lineage, was one of the most profound innovations of life on Earth as it induced planetary-scale geochemical changes and facilitated the evolution of plants via endosymbiosis of cyanobacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sagan, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bekker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</xref>). We infer that this capacity did not arise prior to the divergence of Melainabacteria from Cyanobacteria, based on the absence of remnants of photosynthetic machinery in the Melainabacteria genomes. This observation is in contrast to the symbiotic photoheterotroph UCYN-A, which is the sole representative of Cyanobacteria unable to perform oxygenic photosynthesis due to loss of photosystem II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tripp et al., 2010</xref>). A similar loss of photosynthesis appears to have occurred in the nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont of the algae <italic>Rhopalodia gibba</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kneip et al., 2008</xref>). The presence of a light stress response regulator (NblS) and circadian rhythm regulator (RpaA and RpaB) homologs in this sibling phylum suggests that the cyanobacterial ability to sense and use light was preceded and perhaps facilitated by response regulator systems present in the proto-Cyanobacteria.</p><p>The timing of the evolution of nitrogen fixation in Cyanobacteria has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez-Baracaldo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi and Falkowski, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Larsson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Latysheva et al., 2012</xref>). Like Cyanobacteria, the subsurface Melainabacteria (ACD20) is capable of nitrogen fixation but its nitrogenase genes appear to be unrelated. Though we cannot rule out the existence of an ancient nitrogenase common in both lineages, this finding suggests that acquisition of nitrogen fixation occurred after Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria diverged. This sequence of events is in agreement with other theories, which place the development of photosynthesis before nitrogen fixation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sanchez-Baracaldo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi and Falkowski, 2008</xref>). Thus, we speculate that Cyanobacteria gained the capacities for oxygenic photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation and lost or never gained flagella after diverging from Melainabacteria. Melainabacteria on the other hand, gained or maintained flagella, a fermentation system, and an array of carbon transporters. One environmental (non-gut) lineage of Melainabacteria acquired nitrogen fixation, whereas the gut lineage capitalized on its ability to ferment diverse carbon sources, including those recalcitrant to host digestion.</p><p>We conclude that the common ancestors of Cyanobacteria and Melainabacteria may have been Gram-negative flagellated bacteria active in the anaerobic carbon cycle, producing H<sub>2</sub>, but not fixing nitrogen. Although this characterization does not clarify the origins of photosynthesis, it is consistent with the idea that the ancestors of Cyanobacteria were anoxygenic photosynthetic organisms with a photosystem I-like reaction center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulkidjanian et al., 2006</xref>). The inferred lifestyle is consistent with the widely accepted hypothesis that the common ancestor of extant bacteria relied on anaerobic decomposition of organic material by substrate-level phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Egami, 1977</xref>) and was likely metabolically similar to the Firmicutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daubin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ciccarelli et al., 2006</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Prospectus</title><p>The reconstruction of genomes from uncultivated bacteria from human gut and subsurface environmental metagenomes has enabled us to describe Melainabacteria, a novel candidate phylum sibling to Cyanobacteria, and to further elucidate the evolutionary history of one of the Earth’s most important bacterial phyla.

The ability to fix nitrogen appears to have developed separately in Cyanobacteria and the water-soil-sediment clade of Melainabacteria. The role of the Melainabacteria in the human gut is one of an obligate fermenter, and its enrichment in human subjects and animals with a plant-rich diet likely relates to a prominent role of the Melainabacteria in the processing of plant fibers.

The two decision letters after peer review are shown below.]</p><p>Many thanks for submitting your work on the genome reconstruction and subsequent analyses of the several members of the previously only poor characterized ‘deep branching Cyanobacteria’ (The human gut and subsurface sediment harbor non-photosynthetic Cyanobacteria). In addition to myself (Roberto Kolter), two other individuals read and offered comments on the manuscript. Overall we found the analyses quite intriguing and have discussed our opinions extensively since providing our initial reviews. My sense is that we have come to a good consensus about the manuscript. We all see some important work here but have some serious concerns that can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) There is a major concern that there needs to be better support for the claim that these genomes, as constructed from metagenomic data, do indeed occur in nature (i.e., that they are ‘real’). We see two possibilities here. It may be that you can indeed develop an argument that from the bioinformatic analyses you have absolute confidence that the assembled sequences are true representations of extant genomes in nature. Alternatively, there are experimental ways to determine this. In the spirit of <italic>eLife</italic>, we do not wish to recommend “make work” types of experiments. The former solution should not necessitate bench work; the latter does and could take a lot of time. We recognize that. But you might already have some of those data.</p><p>2) A second major concern has to do with the designation of these organisms as Cyanobacteria to begin with. In fact, if anything, we would argue that your results make a very compelling argument that these bacteria need to be considered in a class (phylum?) all by themselves. In this regard, the paper would have to be revised greatly because it currently rests on the assertion that these are “truly non-photosynthetic Cyanobacteria”. This concern is a bit larger than it seems. After all, the main interest in this manuscript was the characterization of non-photosynthetic cyanos. But after reading the results, it is clear that the initial designation of these as Cyanobacteria was probably premature and off the mark. Nonetheless, we feel that this correction should be communicated.</p><p>Regarding the overall writing of manuscript (particularly as it pertains to the usage of inappropriate usage of the term ‘Cyanobacteria’) we had split reactions. One reviewer found the paper well written, I must confess that I did not. I marked the PDF extensively with suggested edits.</p><p>Considering these major concerns, and the possibility that additional experiments might be needed, I am recommending that the submission be rejected. That will free you and your colleagues to submit the work (perhaps editing it as a results of our comments) elsewhere. However, I want you to consider this a “soft reject” that leaves open the opportunity for a resubmission. If you can make a compelling case that this new phylum is intrinsically important and interesting and can provide a stronger case that the genomes are real, we would be glad to reconsider it. I, for one, would love to see how knowledge of the genomes might guide you and your colleagues to cultivate members of this group. Not that I would hold you to it, but some discussion of why they have not been cultivated based on genome knowledge would be welcome.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your resubmission to <italic>eLife</italic>, which is now entitled “The human gut and groundwater harbor non-photosynthetic bacteria belonging to a new phylum sibling to Cyanobacteria”. This new version of your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, myself as a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors, and two expert reviewers (one of them, Jon Zehr agreed to reveal his identity).</p><p>After our initial individual evaluation of the manuscript we discussed our comments and reached a consensus that by and large you and your co-authors have addressed our prior main concerns which were: (a) that this division was called “deep branching Cyanobacteria” when all evidence pointed to the bacteria not being cyanos and (b) that there was not enough description of how the genomes had been assembled. In addition, we feel that the revised manuscript is much improved in terms of its written style. Nonetheless, all of us felt that the manuscript could still use some revising before it can be accepted for publication. In short, the key changes still needed include:</p><p>1) Given the lack of cultured representatives, this should be still referred to as “candidate phylum”.</p><p>2) The discussion of the light sensing genes should be modified and streamlined because the direct evidence that the homologs are indeed involved in light sensing is somewhat weak.</p><p>3) The discussion of the evolution of nitrogenase may need to be re-pitched as there is no well-accepted view on the original evolution of nitrogenase. We feel some of your arguments could be used in favor of its being present in the last common ancestor of Cyanobacteria.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01102.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>1) There is a major concern that there needs to be better support for the claim that these genomes, as constructed from metagenomic data, do indeed occur in nature (i.e., that they are ‘real’).

But you might already have some of those data</italic>.</p><p>We have provided a very detailed description of the genome reconstruction process for one of the genomes reported in the study and this process is summarized in the main text of the paper. As you will see, the process is very well controlled and relies on information from multiple independent sources that were used for verifying the assembly. Our criteria for defining complete genomes are very stringent and include far more than the presence of all 57 single copy genes. Specifically, we resolved all connections between assembled scaffolds assigned to the genome. This last criterion makes it very unlikely that parts of the genome will be left out or that foreign fragments will be added to the genome. In fact, given the absence of genome amplification, it is likely that the genomes recovered using these methods are more complete and at least as accurate as genomes recovered by single cell genomics, the widely accepted method for studying uncultivated microbes. Further supporting the veracity of the assemblies, the identification of scaffolds that belong to these genomes was very simple. Beyond this step, the process is very similar to culture-based genomics. Please note that reconstructing genomes from metagenomic data is not a new approach and has a long history in both the Banfield Lab (e.g., Tyson et al., Nature, 2004; Lo et al. Nature, 2007; Aliaga Goltsman et al. Applied and Environmental Microbiology, 2009; Baker et al. PNAS, 2010; Wrighton et al., Science, 2012; Sharon et al., Genome Research, 2013) and other labs (e.g., Iverson et al., Science, 2012; Albertsen et al., Nature Biotechnology, 2013).</p><p>Testing the credibility of our methods using, for example, single cell genomics or cultivation is not only difficult but also probably impossible since there is no guarantee that the strain (or species) captured by one of the other methods will be the same as the one assembled from the metagenomic data. However we recently had the opportunity to validate the assembly of a genome recovered by us from subsurface sediment (Castelle et al., Nature Communications, in press) that was assembled using very similar methods to those used here. The validation was done using long reads (∼8 kbp) that were sequenced from the same sample using the Moleculo sequencing technology. 322 of the 340 reads (95%) belonging to the genome aligned perfectly to the assembled genome. Disagreements between the remaining 18 reads and the assembled genome were checked and found to be the result of 11 local mis-assemblies of a few hundred base pairs each (compared to a genome size of 2.2 Mbp). These localized mis-assemblies would also have arisen in an isolate genome assembly. Hence, this experiment provides independent verification of the reliability of our metagenomic genome recovery method.</p><p><italic>2) A second major concern has to do with the designation of these organisms as Cyanobacteria to begin with. In fact, if anything, we would argue that your results make a very compelling argument that these bacteria need to be considered in a class (phylum?) all by themselves. In this regard, the paper would have to be revised greatly because it currently rests on the assertion that these are “truly non-photosythetic Cyanobacteria”. This concern is a bit larger than it seems. After all, the main interest in this manuscript was the characterization of non-photosynthetic cyanos. But after reading the results, it is clear that the initial designation of these as Cyanobacteria was probably premature and off the mark. Nonetheless, we feel that this correction should be communicated</italic>.</p><p>We have now revised the manuscript extensively and defined the reported genomes as representing a new phylum. Following a suggestion from one of the reviewers we also propose the name “Melainabacteria” for the new phylum. This decision is supported by commonly accepted criteria for defining new phyla (16S rRNA similarity to known phyla – see text) and we thank the reviewers for raising this important issue. We do insist however that the new genomes are the closest relatives to Cyanobacteria that have been sequenced to date. This relies on both 16S rRNA phylogeny, which is the accepted gold standard for inferring phylogenetic relations, and also phylogeny that is based on concatenated ribosomal proteins, which have proved to be very reliable.</p><p>We agree that the message of the paper should not have been restricted to the discovery of “truly non-photosynthetic Cyanobacteria”. We revised the paper to highlight implications for the evolutionary history of Cyanobacteria.</p><p>The current study provides a first glimpse into a new group of organisms inhabiting the human gut that is prevalent in the West, appears to be more prevalent in non-Western countries, and may have had an important role in maintaining human health in the past. As an aside, we mention that the group of organisms reported in this study was included in the 200 “most wanted genomes” of the NIH Human Microbiome Project, which underscores the interest of the human microbiome community in these organisms. Taken together, we strongly believe that the results reported here are of interest for a wide range of researchers as expected from a paper submitted to a wide audience journal such as <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the re-review follow.</italic>]</p><p>With regards to the key changes requested:</p><p>1) We now refer to the Melainabacteria phylum as a candidate phylum throughout the paper.</p><p>2) We have carefully rewritten the light sensing discussion noting that these genes are not capable of sensing light but rather are regulator genes that may have been co-opted for regulating light responsive genes and thus may have aided the acquisition of light systems.</p><p>3) We have noted in our discussion of nitrogenase evolution that ambiguity still exists as we cannot exclude the possibility of an ancient shared nitrogenase existing prior to the present nitrogenase complexes in Melainabacteria and Cyanobacteria.</p><p>Furthermore, we have also clarified the flagellin TLR5 activation sequence figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) by rearranging the sequences according to similarity in the TLR5 activation region and by indicating which sequences we predict by sequence similarity to be recognized by TLR5. We have also removed the sentence from the Discussion that mentioned our attempts to culture this group. This is because one of us (Ruth) felt that our attempts had been somewhat haphazard, and since culturing anaerobes is not one of our core specialties, this information is not likely to be informative (i.e., another more specialized group may succeed using these methods).</p></body></sub-article></article>
