EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTOR1 (EPF1) is a founding member of the secreted peptide ligands enforcing stomatal patterning. Yet, its exact role remains unclear.

Development of stomata, turgor-driven cellular valves on the plant epidermis for optimal gas exchange while minimizing water loss, is coordinated by the intricate cell-cell signaling that impinges on the activity of cell-fate determinants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pillitteri and Dong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han and Torii, 2016</xref>). Stomatal development in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> occurs through stereotypical cell-state transition events: a stomatal initial cell on the protoderm called a meristemoid mother cell (MMC) undergoes an asymmetric entry division to give rise to a meristemoid, a transient amplifying cell of the stomatal lineage. The meristemoid reiterates asymmetric divisions and renews itself, while creating surrounding stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs). Eventually, the meristemoid loses its stem-cell-like property and differentiates into a guard mother cell (GMC). The GMC executes a single round of symmetric division to form paired guard cells (GCs) surrounding a pore, thereby completing stomatal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pillitteri and Torii, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han and Torii, 2016</xref>). These cell state transitions are directed by the sequential actions of three basic-helix-loop-helix (bHLH) proteins, SPEECHLESS (SPCH), MUTE, and FAMA, which determine the initiation and proliferation, meristemoid-to-GMC transition, and GMC-to-GC differentiation, respectively. These three bHLH proteins form heterodimers with the broadly expressed sister bHLH proteins SCREAM (SCRM: also known as ICE1) and SCRM2, both of which are absolutely required for the activities of SPCH-MUTE-FAMA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lau and Bergmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pillitteri and Dong, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Han and Torii, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The spatial control of stomatal differentiation processes is achieved by a family of secreted cysteine-rich peptides called EPIDERMAL PATTERNING FACTORS (EPFs) that are perceived by cell-surface receptors with extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain: three ERECTA-family receptor kinases and their signal modulator LRR receptor-like protein TOO MANY MOUTHS (TMM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shpak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunt and Gray, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torii, 2012</xref>). These modules are conserved down to basal land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caine et al., 2016</xref>). During the initiation of stomatal cell lineages, EPF2 peptide perception by ERECTA activates downstream intracellular signals mediated by the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) cascade, which inhibits the entry divisions of MMC by down-regulating SPCH protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lampard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2015</xref>). As such, application of bioactive EPF2 peptide confers an epidermis solely composed of pavement cells, phenotypically identical to loss-of-function <italic>spch</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Recent studies established that <italic>EPF2</italic> is a direct transcriptional target of SPCH and SCRM, therefore EPF2, ERECTAâ¢TMM, and SPCHâ¢SCRM modules constitute a negative feedback loop generating evenly distributed spatial patterns of stomatal initial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horst et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the decision of whether or not to enter the stomatal cell-lineage is fine-tuned by the competitive binding of EPF2 and its antagonistic peptide, EPF-LIKE9 (EPFL9), also known as Stomagen, to ERECTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kondo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sugano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Unlike EPF2, the direct binding of Stomagen to ERECTA leads to the inhibition of receptor activation and signal transduction, therefore resulting in excessive stomatal clusters like <italic>erecta</italic>-family mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The founding member of EPF/EPFL-family peptides, EPF1, enforces stomatal spacing and its loss-of-function mutation confers stomatal pairing and clustering (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2007</xref>). Both genetic and biochemical studies have placed ERECTA-LIKE1 (ERL1), a sister receptor of ERECTA, as well as TMM as a receptor module acting downstream of EPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). However, unlike EPF2, the exact action and function of EPF1 remain unclear. Early models predicted that the signal emanating from a meristemoid is perceived by the receptors in the neighboring cells to regulate stomatal patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nadeau and Sack, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Serna, 2004</xref>). However, both <italic>EPF1</italic> and <italic>ERL1</italic> promoter activities are the highest in the stomatal precursor cells, most notably in the late meristemoids and GMCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shpak et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2007</xref>). The inconsistency of their expression patterns and predicted functions adds to the conundrum as to how this ligand-receptor system operates. It is also unknown whether EPF1 signaling acts on any of the stomatal bHLH transcription factors. To address these questions, we investigated the in vivo dynamics and regulation of ERL1, the primary receptor of EPF1. We found that ERL1 and MUTE constitute a negative feedback loop, which, with co-expression of EPF1, elicits an autocrine inhibition of stomatal differentiation potential. Our study reveals the unexpected role of self-inhibition as a mechanism for ensuring timely transition of stomatal differentiation and proper stomatal patterning. Given that EPF1 peptide sources are shared by both autocrine and paracrine signaling, the intricate buffering mechanism may underpin proper stomatal patterning.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ERL1 exhibits dynamic accumulation during asymmetric divisions of stomatal precursors and meristemoid-to-GMC transition</title><p>To clarify the role of EPF1-ERL1 signaling during stomatal development, we first examined the in vivo dynamics of ERL1-YFP fusion protein driven by its promoter expressed in <italic>erl1-2</italic> null mutant background (<italic>ERL1pro::ERL1-YFP in erl1</italic>).

While this is consistent with the early stomatal-lineage expression of ERL1, it does not explain the rapid boost in accumulation of ERL1 during the meristemoid-to-GMC transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The transition from meristemoids to GMCs is specified by SPCHâs sister bHLH protein, MUTE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pillitteri et al., 2007</xref>). We thus hypothesized that MUTE is driving the rapid increase of ERL1 in the late meristemoids. To address this, we first examined the MUTE and ERL1 proteins in the stomatal lineage cells using <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> lines co-expressing <italic>MUTE-tagRFP</italic> and <italic>ERL1-YFP</italic> driven by their own respective endogenous promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

By 24 hr, MUTE-GFP signals were undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).

By five days after <italic>iEPF1</italic> overexpression, SPCH-GFP protein was no longer detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This likely reflects the developmental progression of all remaining stomatal-lineage cells beyond the SPCH-regulated steps. Further quantitative analysis of SPCH transcriptional and translational reporters showed that their signals are not changed by <italic>iEPF1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>).

Here, EPF1 secreted from a meristemoid is perceived by ERL1-TMM on a surface of the same meristemoid. The downstream signaling leads to expression of a yet unidentified peptide (X: orange), which will be perceived by a yet unidentified receptor (Y: brown) on a surface of the neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC). This triggers signal transduction regulating asymmetric spacing division. (<bold>C</bold>) Model based on the current study: Both <italic>ERL1</italic> and <italic>TMM</italic> are expressed in a meristemoid and a stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC), since they are both upregulated by SPCH at an earlier stageÂ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horst et al., 2015</xref>). During the meristemoid-to-GMC transition, MUTE upregulates <italic>ERL1</italic> expression and this causes high accumulation of ERL1 in the meristemoid over the stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC). Meanwhile, EPF1 is expressed and secreted from the late meristemoid by an independent mechanism. A perception of EPF1 by the meristemoid-expressed ERL1 and TMM triggers signal transduction leading to downregulation of MUTE, thereby restricting MUTE activity via an autocrine mechanism. The same pool of EPF1 is also perceived by ERL1 and TMM expressed in the neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC), which trigger downstream signal transduction to ensure asymmetric spacing division via a paracrine mechanism. Consequently, receptors in the meristemoids and stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) buffer the pool of EPF1 ligands. Note that our model does not exclude the possibility that yet another unknown signals (like X and Y) operate simultaneously during the stomatal differentiation process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24102.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24102.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-24102-fig7-v3"/></fig></p><p>The co-expression of EPF1 and ERL1 triggering autocrine signaling challenges a traditional view of plant secreted peptide hormones as intercellular signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2012</xref>). Known EPF/EPFL peptides function in a non-cell autonomous manner. For example, EPFL9/Stomagen secreted from internal mesophyll tissues is perceived by ERECTA in the protoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). EPFL4 and EPFL6 are inter cell-layer signals between the stem endodermis and phloem to promote inflorescence elongation via ERECTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uchida et al., 2012</xref>). Recently, we have reported that EPFL2 peptide promotes leaf serration as a ligand for ERECTA-family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tameshige et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, EPFL2 and its primary receptor, ERL2, exhibit inverse expression patterns: <italic>ERL2</italic> shows the highest expression at the leaf teeth tips where <italic>EPFL2</italic> expression is excluded. Therefore, EPF/EPFL-family peptides mediate signals both in autocrine and paracrine manners.</p><p>Both <italic>epf1</italic> mutation and a dominant-negative ERL1 receptor confer a violation of one-cell spacing rule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Based on this phenotype, a paracrine model was proposed initially, whereby a signal (EPF1) emanating from the meristemoids/GMCs will be perceived by receptors (ERL1 and TMM) in the neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) to orient asymmetric spacing division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, based on the high expression of EPF1, ERL1, and TMM in the meristemoids/GMCs, an alternative autocrine model has been described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette and Smith, 2012</xref>). Here, EPF1 peptide is perceived by ERL1/TMM in the meristemoids/GMCs. A subsequent downstream signal transduction promotes the expression of a yet unidentified ligand X, which will be secreted and perceived by a yet unidentified receptor Y on the surface of neighboring stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs). This eventually leads to the oriented asymmetric spacing division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Facette and Smith, 2012</xref>). Our findings revise these models and propose a buffered system, whereby the pool of EPF1 is shared by both the meristemoid and its neighboring stomatal lineage ground cell (SLGC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). ERL1 and TMM also accumulates at the plasma membrane of stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs), albeit in lesser amounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nadeau and Sack, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horst et al., 2015</xref>). ERL1 in the stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) most likely perceives the EPF1 peptides emitted from neighboring meristemoids, and this EPF1-ERL1 paracrine signaling orients the asymmetric spacing divisions. Based on this model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), the paracrine action of EPF1 also limits the inhibitory activity of EPF1-ERL1 autocrine signals in the meristemoids, since ERL1 in the meristemoids and in neighboring stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) both share the same source of EPF1 signals.</p><p>It is important to note that the absolute co-expression of ERL1 and MUTE conferred severe meristemoid arrests due to excessive activation of ERL1 signaling pathway, when all three endogenous ERECTA-family receptors are missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed, <italic>MUTEpro::ERL1-YFP</italic> does not confer any discernable phenotype if the wild-type copies of the three <italic>ERECTA-</italic>family genes are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). It is therefore most likely that, in addition to ERL1, ERECTA and ERL2 receptor population expressed in stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) buffer excessive EPF1 peptide ligands to ensure the proper and adequate level of MUTE inhibition. The idea of signal buffering by sister ERECTA-family receptors is supported by their known partial redundancy with complex genetic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shpak et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2005</xref>). Moreover, EPFL4/6 (CHAL/CLL1), which normally act as ligands for ERECTA-mediated inflorescence elongation, interfere with this buffering mechanism and confer stomatal clustering in the stemsÂ the absence of TMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrash and Bergmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abrash et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uchida et al., 2012</xref>). Very recently, a VST-family of membrane-associated proteins was reported as a modulator of ERECTA-family signaling, via specifically interacting with ERL2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ho et al., 2016</xref>). Such factors may contribute to fine-tuning the EPF1-ERL1 signaling.</p><p>Our work also revealed that, while two paralogous ligand-receptor pairs, EPF2-ERECTA and EPF1-ERL1, enforce stomatal development via acting on the core stomatal bHLH proteins, the architectures of their regulatory framework are different. EPF2, but not its main receptor ERECTA, is the direct SPCH target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horst et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, ERL1, but not its main ligand EPF1, is the direct MUTE target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The biochemical mechanism of MUTE downregulation is unknown, but lines of evidence suggest the involvement of a MAP kinase cascade. First, YODA, MKK4/5, and MPK3/6 are genetically acting downstream of the three ERECTA-family RKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lampard et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bemis et al., 2013</xref>). Second, the expression of constitutively-active MKK4/5 by the <italic>MUTE</italic> promoter led to arrested meristemoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lampard et al., 2009</xref>), thus phenocopying EPF1 peptide application or overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hara et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Unlike SPCH, however, MUTE does not possess a predicted MAP kinase target domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davies and Bergmann, 2014</xref>), raising a question of whether MUTE is a MPK3/6 substrate. In any event, functional specialization and re-wiring of regulatory circuits among the paralogs of EPF peptides, ERECTA-family receptor kinases, and stomatal bHLH transcription factors highlight the evolutionary mechanism underlying the sequential steps of stomatal differentiation steps.</p><p>Intrinsic polarity of meristemoids and asymmetric daughter cell fates are regulated by BASL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). Recent studies have revealed that polarized BASL in the stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs) enhances the MAP kinase activity, resulting in lowered SPCH abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2016</xref>). In the absence of <italic>EPF1</italic>, GFP-BASL occasionally exhibits improper polar localization to the 'wrong' site within a periphery of the stomatal lineage ground cells (SLGCs), which predicts the mis-oriented site of asymmetric spacing division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2009</xref>). It would be an interesting future question to address how theÂ EPF1-ERL1 signaling pathway influences the location of BASL polarization and stomatal-lineage cell polarity.</p><p>It has become evident that plants make use of a myriad of peptide signals to regulate diverse developmental processes. Accumulating evidence suggest that plant peptide signals mediate both local cell-cell communications and long-distance root-to-shoot signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Searle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirakawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Okamoto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tabata et al., 2014</xref>). In most cases, however, the exact source and recipient cells of signals remains unclear. Previously studies have identified ligand-receptor systems that share the same expression domains. For instance, the tomato cysteine-rich secreted protein LAT52 and its receptor LRR-RK, LePRK2, are both expressed in pollen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Muschietti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). It was speculated that pollen may monitor its germination state via LAT52-LePRKs autocrine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tang et al., 2002</xref>). Another example is CLE45-BAM3, a small secreted peptide ligand-LRR-RK pair: both CLE45 and BAM3 are expressed in protophloem tissue in roots, and their signal transduction leads to the inhibition of protophloem differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Depuydt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rodriguez-Villalon et al., 2014</xref>). It is not yet known whether these ligand-receptor signaling systems constitute feedback regulation with target transcription factors. In any event, the autocrine signaling may be a prevalent mode of peptide-receptor kinase signaling in plants. Here, focusing on stomatal development, where the differentiation potential of bipotent precursor cells can be monitored at a single cell resolution, one can decipher the contribution of autocrine peptide signaling and the buffering of autocrine vs. paracrine signals between two sister cells with different developmental fate. In animals, both paracrine and autocrine peptide signaling contributes to stem cell proliferation. For instance, Wnt, a key secreted cell-cell signal during animal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Logan and Nusse, 2004</xref>), participates in the autocrine regulation of epidermal stem cell renewal in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lim et al., 2013</xref>). A versatile use of peptide ligands for the maintenance and differentiation of adult stem cells may highlight yet another theme in the logic of development in multicellular organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plant materials and growth condition</title><p><italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> Columbia (Col) accession was used as a wild type.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Sheila McCormick (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

The authors present data supporting a negative feedback loop between ERL1 and MUTE. MUTE upregulates ERL1 expression and ERL1-mediated EPF1 signaling inhibits MUTE to specify the meristemoid-to-GMC transition switch. They further show that loss of EPF1-ERL1 signaling results in MUTE accumulation and stomatal development defects. The authors used an elegant combination of quantitative microscopy and genetic experiments to support this model. The work is novel, provides a function for EPF1 and is of interest to plant (and other) communities. Nonetheless, some aspects of the work are oversold. The authors need to improve the manuscript before publication in the following aspects:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Perform expression analyses to show that MUTE is induced after estradiol application and that this induction correlates with the increase and the decrease in expression of ERL1 and EPF1 respectively, hours after induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). The same for the control treatment. Regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; carry out expression analyses to show that EPF1 is induced after estradiol application. As in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, they should also quantify the expression of pSCRM-GFP and SCRM-GFP fusion proteins in the nuclei and for the data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>.</p><p>2) Provide information as to how the marker lines were generated (transformation or crossing), plant generation used, expression levels of the respective tagged proteins and background used (wild type, mutant). It is not always clear what was the genetic background used to express the tagged proteins, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, are ERL1-YFP and MUTE-tagRFP expressed in the Col-0 or erl1 background? Similarly for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>.</p><p>3) Fluorescently-tagged receptors are not always functional (sometimes they are only partially functional, for example BAK1, FLS2); therefore is important that the authors quantify the phenotypes of the rescued <italic>er erl1 erl2</italic> triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), in order to be more convincing that the ERL1-GFP fusion is functional (similar experiments were done for pMUTE::ERL1-YFP introduced in the <italic>er erl1 erl2</italic> triple mutant). Also, the expression levels should be close to the endogenous, as even when using an endogenous promoter, overexpression of the transgene is frequently observed. Is the MUTE-GFP fusion functional?</p><p>4) TagRFP is a slowly maturing protein (100 min, in contrast to 10 min for GFP) and this might affect the co-localization dynamics shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>.

We detected a slight (~1.25 fold) but not significant elevation of the transgene expression compared to the wild-type <italic>ERL1</italic> (p=0.074, Student's t-test). Since <italic>ERL1pro::ERL1-YFP</italic> rescues the stomatal clustering phenotype of <italic>er erl1 erl2</italic> to the same extent as the endogenous <italic>ERL1</italic> gene (p= 0.49, Tukey's HSD test.

Provide data or discuss this possibility.</italic> </p><p>We have performed a careful analysis of <italic>MUTEpro::MUTE-GFP</italic> and <italic>MUTEpro::MUTEtagRFP</italic> expression during stomatal development. As shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, their signal accumulation patterns are essentially identical. In addition, during the revision process we did genetic crosses, generated a double transgenic F1 seedlings carrying both <italic>MUTEpro::MUTE-GFP</italic> and <italic>MUTEpro::MUTEtagRFP</italic>, and analyzed their signals. Again, both GFP and RFP signals are co-detected during meristemoid-to-GMC transition (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Since we are analyzing their accumulation patterns during the merstemoid-to-GMC transition, which takes an average of 19 hours (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), we believe that the ~90 minute differences in the maturation time for GFP vs. tagRFP would not affect the co-localization dynamics or interpretation of our results within the time scale of our analysis.</p><p><italic>5) It is not clear why MUTE-GFP in the scrm-D background was used for the ChIP assays and not MUTE-GFP in wild type. Is SCRM required for MUTE binding? Explain or discuss.</italic> </p><p>As referenced in our original submission, the effective use of the <italic>scrm-D</italic> background for ChIP experiments was published previously (Horst et al., 2015 PLOS Genetics). The <italic>scrm-D</italic> mutation allows the entire protoderm to undergo stomatal cell-lineage transitions (Kanaoka et al., 2008 Plant Cell). Because nearly all epidermal cells follow the meristemoid-to-GMC transition, one could substantially increase the signals for MUTE-GFP ChIP assays. In the revised manuscript, we have explained rationales behind using the <italic>scrm-D</italic> background (subsection âERL1 is a direct MUTE targetâ, second paragraph).</p><p>We have in addition performed ChIP experiments using Arabidopsis seedlings carrying functional <italic>MUTEpro::MUTE-GFP</italic> in <italic>mute</italic> null mutant background. This line was published previously, and the seedlings are phenotypically wild type (Pillitteri et al., 2007 Nature). We were able to detect the binding of MUTE-GFP to the <italic>ERL1</italic> promoter region with lesser fold enrichment, owning to fewer cells undergoing meristemoid-to-GMC transition (Revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). The results further emphasize that MUTE binds to the <italic>ERL1</italic> promoter during normal stomatal development (and therefore it is not the artifact of the <italic>scrm-D</italic> mutation).</p></body></sub-article></article>
