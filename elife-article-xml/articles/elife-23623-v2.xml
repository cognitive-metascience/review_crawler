genomes. However, even in this well-studied model, it is unclear how homolog pairing in diploids or environmental conditions influence overall genome organization. Here, we performed high-throughput chromosome conformation capture on diverged <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> hybrid diploids to obtain the first global view of chromosome conformation in diploid yeasts. After controlling for the Rabl-like orientation using a polymer model, we observe significant homolog proximity that increases in saturated culture conditions. Surprisingly, we observe a localized increase in homologous interactions between the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles specifically under galactose induction and saturated growth. This pairing is accompanied by relocalization to the nuclear periphery and requires Nup2, suggesting a role for nuclear pore complexes. Together, these results reveal that the diploid yeast genome has a dynamic and complex 3D organization.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23623.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23623.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23623.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Most of the DNA in human, yeast and other eukaryotic cells is packaged into long thread-like structures called chromosomes within a compartment of the cell called the nucleus. The chromosomes are folded to fit inside the nucleus and this organization influences how the DNA is read, copied, and repaired. The folding of chromosomes must be robust in order to protect the organism’s genetic material and yet be flexible enough to allow different parts of the DNA to be accessed in response to different signals.</p><p>A biochemical technique called Hi-C can be used to detect the points of contact between different regions of a chromosome and between different chromosomes, thereby providing information on how the chromosomes are folded and arranged inside the nucleus. However, most animal cells contain two copies of each chromosome, and the Hi-C method is not able to distinguish between identical copies of chromosomes. As such, it remains unclear how much the chromosomes that can form pairs actually stick together in a cell’s nucleus.</p><p>Unlike humans and most organisms, two distantly related budding yeast species can mate to produce a “hybrid” in which the chromosome copies can easily be distinguished from each other. Kim et al. now use Hi-C to analyze how chromosomes are organized in hybrid budding yeast cells.</p><p>The experiments reveal that the copies of a chromosome contact each other more frequently than would be expected by chance. This is especially true for certain chromosomal regions and in hybrid yeast cells that are running out of their preferred nutrient, glucose. In these cells, the regions of both copies of chromosome 13 near a gene called <italic>TDA1</italic> are pulled to the edge of the nucleus, which helps the copies to pair up and the gene to become active. The protein encoded by <italic>TDA1</italic> then helps turn on other genes that allow the yeast to use nutrients other than glucose.</p><p>Many questions remain about how and why DNA is organized the way it is, both in yeast and in other organisms. These findings will help guide future experiments testing how the two copies of each chromosome pair, as well as what purpose, if any, this pairing might serve for the cell. A better understanding of the fundamental process of DNA organization and its implications may ultimately lead to improved treatments for genetic diseases including developmental disorders and cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23623.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23623.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

space and time, and this organization impacts fundamental biological processes like transcription, DNA repair, and recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taddei et al., 2010</xref>). The budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> has been a useful model for studying eukaryotic genome conformation and its functional implications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taddei et al., 2010</xref>). The predominant feature of yeast 3D genome organization is its Rabl-like orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jin et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): during interphase, the centromeres cluster at one end of the nucleus, attached to the spindle pole body, and chromosome arms extend outward toward the nuclear periphery where the telomeres associate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schober et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Therizols et al., 2010</xref>), like in anaphase. In addition, the ribosomal DNA array forms the nucleolus, opposite the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yang et al., 1989</xref>), splitting chromosome XII into two separate domains that behave as if they were separate chromosomes.

However, multiple studies have argued that a simple volume-exclusion polymer model of chromosomes in a Rabl-like orientation is sufficient to explain microscopy and Hi-C data of the budding yeast genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tjong et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wong et al., 2012</xref>), at least in haploids grown under standard lab conditions. These studies have argued that even the functional clustering that is observed may simply be a consequence of the Rabl-like orientation coupled with biases in the chromosomal positions of genomic elements, rather than active molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rutledge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tjong et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Although this simplicity is attractive, diploidy and variable environmental conditions may add complexity to yeast genome conformation. In diploid yeast, homologous chromosomes can pair not only in meiosis, but also during mitotic growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess and Kleckner, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dekker et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiner and Kleckner, 1994</xref>), as they do in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Metz, 1916</xref>). However, the extent of mitotic homolog pairing has been debated due to discrepancies between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barzel and Kupiec, 2008</xref>). One explanation for these discrepancies is potential artifacts in the microscopy methods used to detect pairing. In fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), signal loss can lead to false inference of colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenz et al., 2003</xref>). It has also been suggested that tagging of genomic loci with repetitive arrays of GFP for live-cell imaging can directly cause pairing via GFP dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mirkin et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the Rabl-like orientation alone can create the appearance of homolog pairing if not controlled for, by juxtaposing chromosomal loci at the same distance from centromeres, including homologous loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenz et al., 2003</xref>). Discrepancies in the extent of pairing between studies might be attributable to variation in pairing strength across the genome; however, mitotic homolog pairing has only been examined at a few loci.</p><p>In both haploid and diploid yeasts, genome conformation can also change in response to environmental conditions.

We utilize hybrid yeasts resulting from mating diverged yeast species to perform homolog-resolved Hi-C. Our genomic approach allows us to more fully account for the Rabl-like orientation in assessing the extent of homolog pairing, and to detect whether some regions of the genome pair more strongly than others. We find that the strength of pairing varies across both growth conditions and the genome. Notably, the homologous <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles on chromosome XIII pair specifically in galactose induction and saturated growth, but not during exponential growth in glucose.

This debate remains unresolved in part due to the targeted nature of previous studies, wherein each pair of homologous loci is only compared to a limited number of nonhomologous loci.</p><p>To systematically investigate whether homolog proximity can be explained by the Rabl-like orientation, we compared our experimental data from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> hybrids to simulated data from a volume-exclusion polymer model of the Rabl-like orientation. This model did not explicitly encode homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tjong et al., 2012</xref>) and served as a negative control. We quantified homolog proximity by comparing the frequency of each interaction between a pair of homologous loci to the set of nonhomologous interactions involving either locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This naive comparison appears to suggest strong homolog proximity in both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel), but in fact, the equally strong signal from the polymer model suggests that the apparent signal is a consequence of the Rabl-like orientation. We therefore controlled for the Rabl-like orientation by restricting comparisons to interactions with loci at a similar distance from the centromere (at a resolution of 32 kb), as previous studies have done (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lorenz et al., 2003</xref>). Using this approach, we find that the polymer simulation still predicts strong homolog proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, middle panel), suggesting that the long-used approach of comparing homologous interactions to nonhomologous interactions at the same centromeric distance may not fully account for the Rabl-like orientation. Polymer models of the Rabl-like orientation suggest that short chromosomes interact preferentially, due to their dual telomeric tethering at the nuclear periphery and centromeric tethering at the spindle pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tjong et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we further restricted comparisons to loci on chromosome arms of similar length (within 25%).

To test whether this enrichment for interactions is due to sequence-dependent homolog pairing, we generated a translocation that swapped most of the centromeric half of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosome XII with an equivalently sized portion of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosome V, thereby moving the rDNA array to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosome V.

We propose that the rDNA-carrying chromosomes are uniquely positioned within the nucleus due to their tethering at the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Duan et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This shared tethering would then cause enhanced interactions between the homologous proximal and distal segments of these chromosomes and inflate the signal for apparent homology-dependent pairing.</p><p>Based on these findings, we excluded the rDNA-carrying chromosomes from estimates of homolog proximity. Even with these stringent constraints, we find that the observed interaction between homologous alleles exceeds that predicted based on the Rabl-like orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Of note, the left arm of chromosome III and the right arm of chromosome IX exhibit particularly strong homolog proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>); proximity at chromosome III is possibly due to pairing of the silenced mating-type loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miele et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In all hybrids, homolog proximity is substantially greater in saturated cultures approaching stationary phase than in exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>). One explanation for this result is differences in the strength of sequence-dependent homolog pairing between growth conditions, perhaps mediated by differences in nucleosome positioning and DNA-bound proteins. However, this difference could also be a consequence of the reduced cell cycling coupled with loss of homolog proximity during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>) or smaller nuclear size in cells approaching stationary phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guidi et al., 2015</xref>). To test whether we also observe cell cycle dependence of homolog proximity, we performed Hi-C on nocodazole-arrested cells, which were previously reported to exhibit reduced homolog proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burgess et al., 1999</xref>). We find that nocodazole arrest does not substantially reduce homolog proximity in the diverged hybrid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). However, it remains possible that the lack of S-phase cells in saturated cultures contributes to the difference in homolog proximity between exponentially growing and saturated cultures.</p><p>We next sought to evaluate whether changes in nuclear size across growth conditions could explain the observed variation in homolog proximity. The nucleus is known to decrease in size in saturated cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guidi et al., 2015</xref>), so we created alternate versions of the polymer model of the Rabl-like orientation with proportionally smaller nuclei, at 80% and 64% of the original size. In these models, smaller nuclear size led to decreased, rather than increased, homolog proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These models suggest that the difference in homolog proximity between saturated and exponentially growing cultures cannot be explained by the effect of differences in nuclear size, and provide additional support for homolog pairing beyond the Rabl-like orientation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Relocalization of <italic>GAL1</italic> upon galactose induction alters genome conformation</title><p>We also searched our dataset for evidence of highly specific changes in genome conformation at the scale of individual genes.

Every deletion that included this intergenic region reduced the interaction frequency between <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> homologs in saturated growth conditions back to uninduced levels, indicating that this inducible pairing is sequence-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, deletion of the <italic>HAS1</italic> coding sequence had minimal impact, which shows that the deletion construct itself did not impede inducible pairing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). To test whether the <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> region is sufficient to produce inducible pairing, we moved the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> copy of this region to the left arm of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> chromosome XIV. The ectopic <italic>HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic> allele exhibited inducible interactions with the <italic>S. uvarum HAS1pr-TDA1pr</italic>, although not to the same extent as the endogenous allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The diminished extent of inducible pairing may reflect the contribution of chromosomal homolog pairing, which would be disrupted in the ectopic location, or of additional regions that are not sufficient to produce pairing on their own. To verify whether this pairing occurs in homozygous <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> diploids in addition to diverged hybrids, we labeled both <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> loci with integrated LacO arrays targeted by LacI-GFP and measured the distance between them in a population of cells by confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).

Therefore, we tested whether the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> loci are relocalized to the nuclear periphery in a condition-dependent manner. We tagged the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus with a LacO array as before and counted the proportion of cells in which <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> colocalized with the mCherry-labeled nuclear membrane, in haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Indeed, the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus shifted to the nuclear periphery upon galactose induction and in saturated culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). To confirm whether this inducible reorganization was dependent on association with nuclear pores, we repeated our analysis in strains with deletions of nuclear pore components <italic>NUP2</italic> or <italic>NUP100</italic>, or pore-associated protein <italic>MLP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). As in other cases of gene relocalization, Nup2 but not Nup100 was required for peripheral localization of the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus. However, unlike other relocalized genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luthra et al., 2007</xref>), <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus relocalization did not require Mlp2, suggesting that the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus may interact with nuclear pores via a distinct mechanism. We performed these initial analyses in haploids, to facilitate deletion of nuclear pore components, but pairing cannot occur in haploids. Thus, we confirmed that the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> loci are peripherally relocalized in diploids, by reanalyzing the images we used to measure distances between <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles in diploid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). We then asked whether pairing of the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles only occurs at the periphery, by determining the proportion of cells in each category of peripheral localization that have paired <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). In fact, <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles can remain paired in galactose in the nucleoplasm. However, this need not imply that the nuclear pores do not play a role in pairing. Previous studies of gene relocalization to nuclear pores have reported that the cell cycle affects when genes relocalize to the nuclear periphery; namely, genes tend to move to the nucleoplasm during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brickner and Brickner, 2010</xref>). Alleles can remain paired in the nucleoplasm, but cannot actively pair during S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner et al., 2012</xref>). In agreement with these studies, the peripheral localization of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> loci that we observe also exhibits cell cycle dependence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>), which may explain the presence of pairing in the nucleoplasm.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23623.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Inducible peripheral localization and pairing of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles involve nuclear pore interactions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proportions of haploid <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells exhibiting peripheral <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> localization in strains with and without deletions of nuclear pore components, in glucose (in blue), galactose (in purple), or saturated culture (in red).

However, whether and to what extent this mitotic homolog pairing occurs has remained controversial, in part due to the lack of genome-wide data and the apparent homolog pairing caused by the Rabl-like orientation. We performed Hi-C in diverged hybrid diploid yeast, which allowed us to resolve homologous chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and thus infer homolog pairing strength on a genome-wide basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). After using a polymer model of the Rabl-like orientation to calibrate our estimates, we find that even in hybrid diploids with homologs diverged to less than 80% nucleotide identity, homologous chromosomes do interact preferentially during mitotic growth, albeit subtly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). It would be interesting to compare the strength of pairing across hybrids with varying levels of divergence; however, our homolog pairing analysis requires filtering and stratifying genomic regions and thus may not be directly comparable across different reference genomes. Our data do not necessarily imply end-to-end chromosome alignment as occurs in meiosis. Instead, our data indicate an increased frequency of contact between homologous loci above the expectation based on random collisions, with substantial variation across the genome. Nevertheless, that such distant homology is sufficient for at least some homolog interactions is perhaps remarkable, and may hint at the role of DNA-bound proteins, which are more conserved than DNA, in mediating the interactions. Homolog pairing strength also depends on both growth conditions and genomic location, sometimes jointly: the homologous <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> loci on chromosome XIII pairs during saturated growth and galactose induction, but not exponential growth in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This region is not remarkably conserved, suggesting that homolog pairing is at least partly due to specific interactions mediated by proteins, rather than direct DNA-DNA homology interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Danilowicz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gladyshev and Kleckner, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In all tested hybrids, the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus exhibits surprisingly strong homolog proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). How does <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing occur, and why? The nuclear pore component Nup2 seems to play a role, although not exclusively, in mediating pairing. The <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus moves to the nuclear periphery under pairing conditions, and both this relocalization and pairing are Nup2-dependent in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). However, Nup2 is not required for <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing in saturated growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Together, the Nup2-independence of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing in saturated growth, the Mlp2-independence of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> peripheral localization, and the lack of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> enrichment in Nup60 ChIP suggest that <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> may interact with nuclear pores by a mechanism distinct from the previously studied <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic>, and possibly by different mechanisms in galactose and in saturated culture. However, more experiments are needed to fully elucidate the role and mechanism of the nuclear pore complex in <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> homolog pairing. Regardless of the molecular mechanism, nuclear pore interactions may confine the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles to the relatively small space near the nuclear periphery, thus speeding up the rate at which they randomly contact each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Once in physical proximity, additional mechanisms such as protein-protein interactions between DNA-binding proteins could prolong the duration of contact, even after the alleles are no longer at a nuclear pore. Indeed, the presence of paired <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles in the nucleoplasm suggests that such nuclear pore-independent pairing mechanisms may act at <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). Interestingly, a recent study showed that Nup2 is involved in meiotic homolog pairing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chu et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that Nup2 may more generally play a role in homolog pairing.</p><p>Why do the homologous <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles pair and relocalize to the periphery, and why does this interaction appear to be unique? Many genes associate with nuclear pores and relocalize to the nuclear periphery upon activation, including <italic>GAL1</italic>, but we do not observe strong pairing of <italic>GAL1</italic> homologs. It is possible that Hi-C may be failing to capture pairing at <italic>GAL1</italic> due to its pericentromeric location, but these data may also reflect particularly strong pairing at the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> loci. Divergence between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum</italic>, particularly in their galactose metabolism pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roop et al., 2016</xref>), may also contribute to the lack of pairing at the <italic>GAL1</italic> locus. Lack of <italic>GAL1</italic> pairing need not correspond to lack of peripheral localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>); in our hybrid, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. uvarum GAL1</italic>-binding proteins may be able to each interact with the nuclear pores but not with each other.</p><p>Which gene is driving <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> homolog pairing, <italic>HAS1</italic> or <italic>TDA1</italic>, or both? Given the association between nuclear pore interactions and transcriptional activation, transcriptional changes in growth conditions that induce pairing may provide a clue. The genes at the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> locus, <italic>HAS1</italic> and <italic>TDA1</italic>, demonstrate opposing changes in gene expression in galactose and saturated culture: <italic>HAS1</italic> is downregulated, whereas <italic>TDA1</italic> is upregulated. The upregulation of <italic>TDA1</italic>, athough not particularly strong in magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>) may be of functional importance. Tda1 is a kinase required for phosphorylation of Hxk2, the primary hexokinase in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaps et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kettner et al., 2012</xref>). Unphosphorylated Hxk2 can interact with Mig1 to repress various alternative carbon source metabolism genes in the presence of glucose. Phosphorylation of Hxk2 by Tda1 in low-glucose conditions prevents its interaction with Mig1 and thus leads to release from glucose repression. While we have not yet tested whether disrupting peripheral localization would affect <italic>TDA1</italic> or <italic>HAS1</italic> transcription, we hypothesize that nuclear pore interaction may aid the upregulation of <italic>TDA1</italic> in response to low-glucose concentrations, perhaps by facilitating efficient transcription or mRNA export from the nucleus.</p><p>Other questions remain about the mechanism and functional implications of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing and peripheral relocalization. Increased transcription may itself contribute to localization at nuclear pores via interactions between nascent mRNA and mRNA processing and export factors at nuclear pores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhtar and Gasser, 2007</xref>), and may be involved in establishment of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing as it is for <italic>GAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>). However, given the abundance of other genes with similar or greater changes in transcription that do not pair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), transcription alone likely cannot explain our data. For some genes, nuclear pore interactions mediate rapid reactivation in a phenomenon termed epigenetic transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">D'Urso and Brickner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Light et al., 2010</xref>); it is also possible that the nuclear pore interactions with <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> may be involved in epigenetic transcriptional memory. The pairing of the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles may also serve a distinct function, potentially including <italic>trans</italic> gene regulation like at <italic>GAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang and Bai, 2016</xref>), but further experiments are needed to test this possibility.</p><p>The principles and functional implications of genome conformation remain open questions. Although the budding yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is thought to have a simple genome organization, it serves as a versatile and relevant model system amenable to integrating multiple approaches to studying genome conformation, including Hi-C, polymer simulations, live-cell imaging, and genetic perturbations. While yeast nuclear organization may differ from that of other eukaryotes in some ways, our findings may, nevertheless, be applicable to other organisms: recent studies in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila</italic> have provided evidence for the generality of the role of nuclear pores in transcriptional regulation first observed in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>).

Nup60-TAP yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghaemmaghami et al., 2003</xref>) were grown overnight, diluted to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.125–0.15 in 50 ml medium, then grown to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.75–0.85 at 30°C in either YPD (for glucose samples) or YP +2% galactose (for galactose samples), then crosslinked with 1% formaldehyde (v/v) for 5 min at room temperature. Crosslinked cells were quenched in 150 mM glycine, washed twice in Tris-buffered saline, and then stored at −80°C.</p><p>Crosslinked cell pellets were resuspended in 500 µl lysis buffer with 1x cOmplete Protease Inhibitor tablet (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and then 700 µl of 500 µm acid-washed glass beads were added. The cells were vortexed for 12 min total, in cycles of 2 min shaking and 2 min resting on ice. The lysate was pelleted and resuspended in fresh lysis buffer, and then sonicated for 3 × 10 min runs on a Diagenode Bioruptor (Diagenode, Liège, Belgium), on high power with cycles of 30 s on and 30 s off, to an average of ~300 bp. The sonicate was cleared by centrifugation, and the resulting supernatant was split into an input aliquot (1/20 of IP volume) and two halves for the IP and mock-IP (BSA instead of antibody). For each sample, 5 µg of anti-TAP antibody (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA; #CAB1001, Lot #RL240352) was used with 10 µl Dynabeads Protein A (Thermo). The antibody or BSA was incubated with pre-washed beads for 2 hr and then washed twice in fresh lysis buffer before being added to the lysate and then incubated overnight. After washing the beads four times in lysis buffer and eluting, the eluate was reverse crosslinked and then treated with RNase A and Proteinase K. DNA was purified using Zymo ChIP DNA Clean &amp; Concentrator (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA) and eluted in 30 µl water.</p><p>IP/mock-IP samples were diluted 1:8 and inputs were diluted 1:320, and then 4 µl were used in each 10 µl qPCR reaction. qPCRs were performed in triplicate in 384-well plates on a ViiA7 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA), with Kapa Robust 2G Hot Start 2x master mix (thermocycling as recommended, with 20 s extension for 40 cycles) and 0.2x SYBR Green I dye. CT values were calculated and normalized to a genomic DNA standard curve using the ViiA7 software. IP/input ratios were normalized to those for the negative control <italic>PRM1</italic>.</p><p>ChIP-seq libraries were prepared using the Accel-NGS 2S Plus DNA Library Kit (Swift Biosciences, Ann Arbor, MI), from equal volume pools of the biological replicates, either 1 ng total from input samples or 21 µl of total IP sample. Input and IP libraries were amplified for six and seven cycles, respectively.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript from Dunham and co-authors is significantly improved. They have shown that homologous chromosomes in diploid interact along their lengths more frequently than would be expected due to the Rabl-like configuration, particularly in saturated cultures. Their work also highlights the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles that dramatically associate in galactose and upon saturated growth. The association of these loci with the nuclear membrane and its dependence on Nup2 suggests that <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing requires nuclear pore contact.</p><p>Major point</p><p>1) My only reservation is that the authors ought to include a sentence that acknowledges that association of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> with nuclear pores has not yet been pinned down. In fact, the bulk of the evidence is negative or ambiguous: 1) Nup60 does not contact the genes, 2) nuclear pore contact does not require Mlp2, and 3) the only requirement for perinuclear enrichment is Nup2, which is a mobile nucleoporin that equilibrates on and off nuclear pores. Capelson et al., Cell, 2010 showed that mobile nucleoporins can play important roles at genes even when they are not at nuclear pores. It is acceptable for the authors to suggest that <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> interact with nuclear pores by a unique mechanism but they should also acknowledge that proof of nuclear pore contact is not yet definitive.</p><p>In this light, the Abstract should avoid the statement that the interaction is &quot;dependent on interactions with nuclear pore complexes&quot; and the title of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> legend should not read, &quot;requires nuclear pore interactions&quot;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23623.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) There is general enthusiasm in this work, based on the innovative approach, the novel findings of sequence-dependent pairing of homologous chromosomes, and the rigorous experimental design.</italic> </p><p><italic>2) There are several concerns that need to be addressed by further discussion and experiments as outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>a) The evidence for HAS1 pairing due to interactions of both alleles with the nuclear pore complex is still indirect. It is recommended that the authors expand the</italic> in vivo <italic>imaging analysis to show how the pairing occurs in the 3D space of the nucleus, i.e. if the loci are only paired at the nuclear periphery.</italic> </p><p>We have performed the suggested analysis by classifying our diploid cells, originally imaged for measuring distances between <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> homologs, based on their <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> peripheral localization (ON-ON, ON-OFF, or OFF-OFF, for the number of alleles at the periphery) and then counting the proportion which have paired <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> alleles (distance &lt; 0.55 µm). Our results are shown in the new panel <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>. We find that <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing is not restricted to the periphery.</p><p>However, pairing due to interactions with the nuclear pore need not result in pairing only at the nuclear periphery. Our previous work on <italic>INO1</italic> and <italic>GAL1</italic> show that at least some genes that interact with the nuclear pore upon activation move back to the nucleoplasm during S-phase (Brickner and Brickner, 2010) but remain paired in the nucleoplasm (Brickner et al., 2012). We reanalyzed our microscopy data from haploids to show that this cell cycle-dependent localization is true of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Therefore, we believe that although the presence of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing in the nucleoplasm may suggest mechanisms for pairing in addition to nuclear pore interactions, this result does not rule out the role of nuclear pores in mediating pairing.</p><p>To clarify the role of nuclear pores in pairing, we have performed alternative analyses and experiments in addition to the cell cycle analysis described above, to provide additional evidence for the role of Nup2 in <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing.</p><p>We had previously performed all peripheral localization analyses in haploids, for ease of deletion analyses. Thus, we also reanalyzed our diploid images to demonstrate that inducible peripheral localization also occurs in diploids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>We also acknowledge that in our initial submission, we had not described any direct evidence that Nup2 is required for pairing. Thus, to directly test whether Nup2 is required for both peripheral localization and pairing, we performed Hi-C in a <italic>nup2Δ S. cerevisiae</italic> x <italic>S. uvarum</italic> hybrid strain. Nup2 is in fact required for <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing in galactose, but not in saturated culture. These results are illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. Given that <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> relocalizes to the nuclear periphery in saturated culture, <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> likely still interacts with nuclear pores, but may do so via alternative nuclear pore components. However, in light of these complicating results, we have revised our conclusions to weaken our claim that nuclear pores mediate <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> pairing.</p><p><italic>b) To further strengthen the conclusion that nuclear pore complex mediates the pairing of HAS1 or TDA1 upon transcriptional activation, either of the following two experiments should be performed – 1) ChIP with a non-mobile nucleoporin (e.g. Nup60), or 2) localization of TDA1/HAS1 in a mutant that clusters pores (a nup133 truncation that lacks its N-terminus).</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we have performed ChIP for Nup60 in glucose and galactose, followed by both sequencing and qPCR. Although we see a clear enrichment for the positive control <italic>GAL1</italic> in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,I</xref>), indicating that the experiment worked, we do not see any enrichment in the <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>). Although it is possible that the potentially indirect interaction of Nup60 with DNA is precluding detection of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> enrichment, our observation of enrichment at <italic>GAL1</italic> indicates that at least, <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> does not interact with NPCs in the way that <italic>GAL1</italic> does. We believe this is consistent with the Mlp2-independence of <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> peripheral localization, unlike that of <italic>GAL1</italic> and <italic>INO1</italic>, and that it suggests <italic>HAS1-TDA1</italic> interacts with nuclear pores by a novel mechanism.</p><p> <italic>c) There is a lack of discussion of significance and relevance of the sequence-dependent homolog pairing observed here. It is recommended that the authors provide in-depth discussion on how pairing occurs</italic> in vivo<italic>, how this processes is facilitated by the NPC, whether the observed high frequency of pairing between HAS1 implies non-random, sequence dependent colocalization of the locus and NPC, and how transcription influence this process.</italic> </p><p>We have significantly expanded the Discussion section to describe the implications of our findings of homolog pairing both at the global and local scales. We discuss how the NPC may help mediate pairing by limiting the search space for the two homologs to find each other, and how interactions between DNA-binding proteins may lead to frequent colocalization of the homologous loci. We have also added a discussion of the relationship between pairing/relocalization and transcription.</p><p><italic>d) The authors should address the question of whether there are transcriptional changes in HAS1/TDA1 that accompany pairing and relocation to the nuclear periphery. A reviewer points out that SPELL groups TDA1 with carbohydrate metabolism genes, including HXK1 that goes to the nuclear pores in galactose, and whose expression changes upon glucose depletion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion of investigating transcription of <italic>TDA1</italic>. We have performed RNA-seq to quantify transcriptional changes in galactose and saturated growth. As the reviewer suggested, we find that <italic>TDA1</italic> is upregulated in both galactose and saturated growth. This transcriptional pattern is consistent with the known biochemical function of Tda1 in phosphorylating Hxk2, the main hexokinase in yeast, and thereby leading to its export from the nucleus where it can interact with Mig1 to enact glucose repression. We have added <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> to illustrate these results, and we discuss them at the end of the Results and also in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Major point</italic> </p><p><italic>1) My only reservation is that the authors ought to include a sentence that acknowledges that association of HAS1-TDA1 with nuclear pores has not yet been pinned down.
