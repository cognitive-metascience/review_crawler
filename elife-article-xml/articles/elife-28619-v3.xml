Here, we report the crystal structures of SafD-<italic>dsc</italic> and SafD-SafA-SafA (SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>) in Saf pili. Cell adherence assays show that SafD and SafA are both required for host recognition, suggesting a poly-adhesive mechanism for Saf pili. Moreover, the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure, as well as SAXS characterization, reveals an unexpected inter-molecular oligomerization, prompting the investigation of Saf-driven self-association in biofilm formation. The bead/cell aggregation and biofilm formation assays are used to demonstrate the novel function of Saf pili. Structure-based mutants targeting the inter-molecular hydrogen bonds and complementary architecture/surfaces in SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> dimers significantly impaired the Saf self-association activity and biofilm formation. In summary, our results identify two novel functions of Saf pili: the poly-adhesive and self-associating activities. More importantly, Saf-Saf structures and functional characterizations help to define a pili-mediated inter-cellular oligomerizaiton mechanism for bacterial aggregation, colonization and ultimate biofilm formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>host recognition</kwd><kwd>biofilm formation</kwd><kwd>Salmonella atypical fimbriae</kwd><kwd>poly-adhesive activity</kwd><kwd>self-associating oligomerization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. enterica</italic> serovar Typhi</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81370620</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81570120</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31070645</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003395</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>The Program for Professor of Special Appointment (Eastern Scholar)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003395</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gaofeng Clinical Medicine Grant Support (20152504)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003395</institution-id><institution>Shanghai Municipal Education Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12ZZ109</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Shanghai Science and Technology Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11JC1407200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81770142</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meng</surname><given-names>Guoyu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SafDAA-SafDAA structure and functional characterizations reveal a pili-mediated inter-cellular oligomerization mechanism for bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biofilms are communities of microorganism embedded in a complex extracellular polymeric substance (EPS) matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costerton et al., 1995</xref>). Bacterial cells in a biofilm can become more resistant to most antimicrobial agents and host defenses than their planktonic counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burmølle et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mah and O'Toole, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prosser et al., 1987</xref>). Biofilm development is a dynamic progress, and it can be mainly described in three stages including attachment, maturation and dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rabin et al., 2015</xref>). For bacterial pathogenesis, the pili-mediated attachment to the mucosal epithelial layers in human is often thought to be the first step to enable initial contact, to form a microcolony, to carry out invasion and to evade the host immune system that lead to acute and chronicle infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Proft and Baker, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sauer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zavialov et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, it has been reported that bacterial pili can participate in cell-cell interaction, leading to bacterial aggregation and micro-colony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wright et al., 2007</xref>). As demonstrated in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, type I pili are necessary to establish initial attachment with the epithelium, while at least three other types of fimbriae (Lpf, Pef and Tafi) are required for cell-cell interaction, micro-colony growth and biofilm maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ledeboer et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, a Gram-negative and food-borne enteric pathogen, is a common cause of human and animal abdominal complications like typhoid fever and gastroenteritis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Silva et al., 2014</xref>). It can be subdivided into seven subspecies, designated as I, II, IIIa, IIIb, IV, VI and VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reeves et al., 1989</xref>).

The <italic>saf</italic> operon is located on <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> centisome seven genomic island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Folkesson et al., 2002</xref>), which consists of four contiguous genes encoding the major subunit (SafA), periplasmic chaperone (SafB), outer membrane usher (SafC) and minor subunit (SafD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Saf pili are assembled by the chaperone-usher (CU) secretion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Remaut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zavialov et al., 2007</xref>). The nascent SafA and SafD subunits are transported from the cytoplasm into the periplasm via the SEC machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stathopoulos et al., 2000</xref>). The periplasmic chaperone, SafB, donates its G1 strand to complete the correct folding of SafA or SafD. Hence, this process is also known as donor strand complementation (DSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choudhury et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sauer et al., 1999</xref>). The subunit-chaperone binary complexes migrate to the outer membrane usher, where subunits polymerize into a linear filament via a mechanism known as donor strand exchange (DSE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zavialov et al., 2003</xref>). In the DSE step of Saf pili assembly, the N-terminal extension (Nte) of an incoming SafA replaces the chaperone G1 strand (in SafB) via a zip-in-zip-out mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Remaut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2008</xref>), giving rise to a remarkable polymer of SafD-(SafA)<sub>n</sub> (n &gt; 100).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28619.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Recombinant expression strategy of SafD-<italic>dsc</italic> and SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>SafABCD</italic> gene cluster in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>.

SafD, a putative adhesin/invasin, was demonstrated to have vaccination potential in mice model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Strindelius et al., 2004</xref>). The structure of SafD has not been reported. As for biological functions of Saf pili, previous studies showed that Saf pili are required for <italic>Salmonella</italic> infection against pig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carnell et al., 2007</xref>). However, genetic knockout of <italic>SafA</italic> in <italic>S. typhimurium</italic> showed little difference in mouse virulence when compared to wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Folkesson et al., 1999</xref>). In this study, we aim to provide more structural and functional insights into this important pilus subtype. By X-ray crystallography, we firstly determined the crystal structures of SafD-<italic>dsc</italic> and SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> to the resolutions of 2.2 and 2.8 Å, respectively. The SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure and its unexpected oligomerization verified by SAXS analysis led to the investigation and discovery of the novel biofilm formation activity of Saf pili, supported by bead/cell aggregation and biofilm formation assays. Furthermore, the structure-based mutagenesis targeting the SafDAA-SafDAA dimers consistently disrupted SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> oligomerization activity and Saf-driven bacterial aggregation. All these have led to the proposal of a novel self-associating pili subclass, in which the flexible pili (from different bacteria) might interact/intertwine with each other in trans to enable micro-colony formation, aggregation, and further biofilm development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure of SafD-dsc</title><p>In order to obtain soluble SafD, we engineered a self-complemented SafD-<italic>dsc</italic>, in which the N-terminal extension of SafA (i.e. the G strand) is fused with the C-terminus of SafD via an artificial DNKQ linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The crystal structure of SafD-<italic>dsc</italic> was determined by molecular replacement using AfaD (PDB code: 2IXQ) as search model. The final model was refined to 2.2 Å resolution using program PHENIX.REFINE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The SafD-<italic>dsc</italic> structure reveals a classic immunoglobulin-like fold, in which A-G strands form a β-sandwich fold with two β sheets packed against each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2AB</xref>). Based on sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), SafD is thought to be a putative adhesin/invasin. Using Dali server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Holm and Rosenström, 2010</xref>), SafD is predicted to belong to the Afa/Dr poly-adhesin subfamily containing DraD (r.m.s.d. of 1.5 Å for 134 Cα atoms), HdaB (1.6 Å for 143 Cα atoms), AfaD (2.5 Å for 142 Cα atoms), AafB (1.1 Å for 129 Cα atoms) and AggB (1.5 Å for 133 Cα atoms) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In previous studies, it has been demonstrated that AfaD adhesin/invasin, which shares 30% sequence homology with SafD, can recognize host recetor integrin α5/β1 and α5/β3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cota et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Greve et al., 2007</xref>).

However, in P* position (a favored interaction that is thought to stabilize the exchanged product during DSE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rose et al., 2008</xref>), Phe3 is no longer in direct interaction with SafD. Instead, the sidechain of Leu4 could interact with the hydrophobic core of SafD (termed P** procket), mimicking the capping role of Phe3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistently, the bulky hydrophobic residues in the positions 3 and 4 are conserved in SafA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Another notable feature of SafD-<italic>dsc</italic> lies in the P5 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The superimposition of the SafD molecules shows interesting structural variations/flexibilities in Loop<sub>A-B</sub> on top of the P5 pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In line with this observation, the flexibility of Loop<sub>A-B</sub> is also frequently observed in other pilin-Nte complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The r.s.m.d. values between different SafD-SafA1 molecules range from 0.5 to 0.8 Å for 290 Cα atoms. The intra-molecular interactions between SafD and SafA1 are mainly mediated by hydrogen bonds formed between Thr111, Phe14, Ala16 of SafD, and Gln143, Ser18, Asn6 of SafA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>); (3) In marked contrast, there is no hydrogen bonding, electrostatic or hydrophobic interactions in between SafA1-SafA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The SafA2 appears to be quite isolated and has the ability to move significantly to engage inter-molecular interaction as observed in the crystal. Consistently, as demonstrated by EM single-particle analysis, SafA-SafA is indeed flexible and different SafA-SafA orientations can be observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salih et al., 2008</xref>). (4) The isomerization and torsion angles of Pro20 are important for the overall architecture and the flexibility of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>. It has been reported that the isomerization of proline residue is important for protein folding and diversity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicholson and De, 2011</xref>). This is also the case in pili assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009</xref>). In between SafD and SafA1, Pro20 adopts a <italic>cis</italic>-configuration, enabling a kink in the subunit-subunit linker loop that, in turn, allows the formation of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This appears to shape the SafD-SafA1 into a conserved orientation, in which the G strand in SafD forms a 120° angle with the central axis of SafA1. In comparison, Pro20 in between SafA1-SafA2 adopts a <italic>trans</italic> configuration, allowing SafA2 moving freely away from SafA1 as observed in ‘I’- or ‘L’-like architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Next we want to know whether and how the flexible, thread-like SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> mediates host recognition. It has been reported that Saf pili are required for intestinal colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carnell et al., 2007</xref>). In order to check whether the recombinant SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> still had adhesive activity, cell adherence assay with porcine intestinal columnar epithelial IPEC-J2 cells was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In this experiment, 3 μM His-SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> was added onto the plates coated with IPEC-J2 cells. The binding was monitored by anti-His antibody at different time points using ELISA approach. Compared to control (i.e. the His-SH3 protein derived from human c-SRC that is exclusively expressed in cytoplasm, and hence is a good reference for non-specific interaction against IPEC-J2 cells), the cell adherence assay showed that the recombinant SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> was functional and preserved the adhesive function of the Saf pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Based on sequence and structural alignment, Saf pili are predicted to belong to a FGL pili subgroup, which is often associated with poly-adhesive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zavialov et al., 2007</xref>). In order to check whether SafD and SafA are required for binding, SafDAA was progressively truncated into SafDA, SafAA, SafD and SafA, followed by cell adherence characterization. When SafAA, SafD or SafA was incubated with IPEC-J2 cells, very little binding was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In marked contrast, SafDAA yielded a strong binding signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, the removal of SafA subunit (SafDA) reduced host recognition. Altogether, these data have led to the proposal of a poly-adhesive activity for Saf pili, in which SafD and SafA subunits can bind concertedly to the unknown host cell receptors to enable intimate host:bacterium interaction and colonization via a zip-in mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28619.009</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Host recognition by <italic>Salmonella</italic> Saf pili.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell adherence assay. 3 μM SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> was incubated with IPEC-J2 cells and the relative biniding of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> was monitored at different time points up to 2 hr. 3 μM recombinant protein His-SH3 was used as control.

Until now, although pili are increasingly recognized as an important contributor in biofilm development, it is not yet clear how the thread-like structure chained with repetitive Ig-fold subunits can mediate cell-cell interaction. In this report, unexpectedly, the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structures reveal two types of self-associating oligomerization in the crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BC</xref>). In Type I dimerization, SafD and SafA1 interact with each other in a head-to-tail configuration mainly via inter-molecular hydrogen bonding involving residues Arg9, Thr7, Asn94 from SafD, and Glu8, Gln10 from SafA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Consistently, when comparing SafA1 and different SafA2s (that do not form direct hydrogen bonds with SafD), a local side-chain reshuffle involving Glu8 could be observed in Type I dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The second SafA2s that are not involved in inter-molecular interaction ‘float’ freely away from the dimeric interface. Consistently, ‘I’- and ‘L’-like architecture are both observed in Type I dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In Type II dimerization, the SafD, SafA1 and SafA2 subuits make extensive interactions with the neighbour SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> via a ‘6–9’-like self-complementary architecture/surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In particular, the last SafA2 subunits have shifted up significantly to interact with the incoming SafD molecules. As result, the morphologies of SafDAAs in this dimer are restricted to ‘L’-like architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In marked contrast to Type I dimer, Type II dimerization displays few hydrogen bonds. The SafDAA-SafDAA appears to engage each other via self-complementary sufaces controled by Pro20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). The residues Pro20, as described before, could influence the overall architecutre/surface, and hence self-self interaction. Taken together, these two types of head-to-tail-like engagements could give rise to a remarkable SafDAA trimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28619.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Self-associating SafDAA-SafDAA interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The superimposition between ‘I'- and ‘L’-like SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>.

As for Type II Saf pili dimerization, P20K mutation, which was engineered to restrict the proline flexibility and to disrupt the complementary architecture/surface in Type II dimerization, also displayed disruptive effect on Saf-driven biofilm development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

In SafD-<italic>dsc</italic>, a conserved Leu4 in SafA<sub>Nte</sub> was used to mimic Phe3, and the corresponding hydrophobic pocket is termed the P** pocket. The analysis with sequence alignment shows that Phe3 and Leu4, which are not conserved in other pilin subunits, are conserved among <italic>Salmonella</italic> SafAs (i.e. these two positions are often decorated with bulky hydrophobic residues) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This seems to imply a unique structural signature in Saf pili. Further investigation should be carried out to test whether Phe3-Leu4 double safety capping in Saf pili assembly will affect its biological functions. Besides, another protein diversity lies in Tyr13 in SafD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). As previously characterized, the initial interaction between subunit and the incoming Nte peptide in P5 pocket is thought to be the starting point of DSE process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Remaut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verger et al., 2008</xref>). MD simulation of in PapD-PapGII complex suggested a regulatory role of Loop<sub>A-B</sub>. Based on these observations, it is reasonable to speculate that the Try13 sidechain of SafD might act as a molecular ‘switch’, regulating the access of incoming Nte peptide.</p><p>Another interesting protein diversity in Saf pili can be observed in Pro20 (located immediately after SafA<sub>Nte</sub>). As revealed by SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure, Pro20 appears to play crucial roles in shaping the overall architecture and controlling the flexibility of Saf pili. In between SafD-SafA1, the proline adopts a <italic>cis</italic> configuration, and hence brings a minor structural variation in this region by introducing a hairpin-like Loop<sub>G-A</sub>, which in turn enables the inter-molecular hydrogen bonding between subunits. In marked contrast, Loop<sub>G-A</sub> in between SafA1-SafA2 adopts an extended configuration, accompanied with the <italic>trans</italic> isomerization of Pro20. As a result, the SafA2 subunit is highly flexible and isolated, making no inter-molecular contact with the rest of the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure. The movement of SafA2 gives rise to ‘I’- or ‘L’-like SafDAA architectures. It is reasonable to believe that the further variation of Pro20 isomerization and torsion angles will no doubt allow much versatile architecture of Saf pili that is necessary for the adherence and survival in different surfaces and environments. Consistently, as observed elsewhere, the isomerization of proline residue is frequently associated with protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nicholson and De, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yuan et al., 1998</xref>). Even within pilin protein families, the intrinsic flexibility of the proline can bring interesting structural diversities into subunit-subunit orientation/interaction, giving rise to different pili architecture and function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In <italic>E. coli</italic> Cfa pili, the isomerization switch of proline in Loop<sub>G-A</sub> allows CfaB-CafB to coil into a supra helical filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Consistently, similar proline isomerization can be observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> PapA-PapA and its supra helical oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hospenthal et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Even when the proline is in trans-isomerization, the minor difference/variation in the torsion angles of X-Pro-X (X for adjacent amino acid) can introduce significant movement/rotations of the subsequent pilin subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). In summary, the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure, together with previous observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–E</xref>), might highlight a structural/functional role of proline residue in Loop<sub>G-A</sub>, by the movement of which bacterial pili can assemble into diversified morphologies for adaptation of different enviroments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hung et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zav'yalov et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Host recognition by Saf pili</title><p>The SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure confirms the overall assembly of Saf pili, in which the major pilin SafA subunits, connected by the Nte peptides, is capped by a minor pilin SafD subunit. Previous studies showed Saf pili can mediate host regconition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carnell et al., 2007</xref>). However, the exact host recognition mechanism remains elusive. In this report, the bindings were quantified by ELISA using antibody against recombinant Saf proteins with His-tag. Compared to the control SH3 protein, SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> displayed binding activity against host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AB</xref>).

Until now, the host receptor of Saf pili is not yet defined. However, the host receptors of <italic>E.coli</italic> AfaD/DraD adhesin/invasins, which shares ~30% identity with <italic>Salmonella</italic> SafD, have been reported. It has been shown that DraD and AfaD invasin subunits recognize the membrane bound integrins, possibly via the electrostatic protein:protein interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guignot et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zalewska-Piatek et al., 2008</xref>).

Unexpectedly, the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structures revealed remarkable Saf-Saf inter-cellular oligomerizations in the crystal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Three SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> molecules form two sets of dimers (i.e. the Type I and Type II dimers) in a parallel head-to-tail configuration. The further intertwining of these dimers could give rise to a novel intercellular SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> trimerization. The SAXS scattering further verified the presence of multiple oligomerizations in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5EF</xref>). This is further supported by SEC-MALS characterization. The WT SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>, although mainly eluted as monomer, displayed a strong tendency of oligomerization/aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Consistently, the structure-based mutations, which target the dimeric interface and the proline reisdue (Pro20) in Loop<sub>G-A</sub>, consistently disrupted the self-associating activity of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This has led to the design of the latex beads assay to demonstrate the self-associating activity in aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). In this system, the beads, mimicking bacteria in solution, were coated with WT SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>, mutants and BSA (the latter as control).

Similar to Hap-Hap interaction, the weak interacting nature of SafDAA-SafDAA could be utilized by bacterium to adapt different environments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Scott Hultgren (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Han Remaut (Reviewer #2); Steve Matthews (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Zheng and co-workers report the X-ray structures of the <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Saf pilus subunits and describe their role in cell adhesion and self-aggregation. The two reported structures are that of the SafD tip subunit complemented with the SafA donor strand, and a concatenated construct comprising SafD-SafA-Saf-SafNte. The structural information is novel and of high quality. Two alternative conformations are seen for the SafD-A-A polymer and this minimal pilus structure is seen to align longitudinally in the crystals, which the authors suggest to hint at a possible role in bacterial self-interaction and biofilm formation. This hypothesis is evaluated by an in vitro bead agglutination assay and a crystal violet biofilm formation assay in <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinantly expressing the saf operon.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relative contribution / requirement of SafD needs to be established in the cell-based adhesion assay. This can be done by repeating the assay with a SafAA construct.</p><p>2) The authors need to demonstrate recombinant Saf pili are expressed in their <italic>E. coli</italic>-based assays. The flow cytometry is flawed as done now because of the presence of the 50 mM EDTA. Saf pilus formation also needs confirmation by electron microscopy.</p><p>3) The bead assay needs to be made quantitative. How representative are the current images? Why use a bead assay if the authors can look at bacterial clustering directly using light microscopy?</p><p>I agree with reviewer 3 that a better alternative to the bead assay is solution-based affinity measurements for SafAAD self-association. By BLI, ITC or SPR and possibly supplemented with SAXS.</p><p>4) If using the biofilm assay to compare point mutants, the authors need to evaluate whether the mutants do not alter Saf expression on the cell surface.</p><p>5) The authors need to address whether these observations are artifacts of crystallography. By definition, crystals are built using intermolecular contacts, including from hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, conformational changes can be induced in order to propagate an ordered crystal. Are the contacts and observations artifacts or real?</p><p>6) The authors describe biological biofilm-formation assays that fits with their structural work and proposed function roles, but the manuscript lacks solution-based, biophysical characterisation that might support the effects of the proline peptide bond and the Saf-Saf contacts i.e. NMR, SAXS, native MS for example.</p><p>Below are the verbatim comments of the reviewers from which the above were distilled. We reproduce these here for your benefit although the most critical comments for your attention are those listed about under &quot;essential&quot;.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Meng and colleagues present new structural and functional data outlining the structural basis for Saf pilus self-association. They first present an X-ray crystal structure of a self-complemented SafD single-domain adhesin which, like other members of the Afa/Dr poly-adhesin subfamily to which SafD belongs, reveals a classic Ig-like fold and a small negatively-charged patch that they hypothesize may correspond to a receptor binding site. Most notably, they observe that the Leu4 residue in the N-terminal donor strand may rest within the P** pocket of SafD, interacting with the hydrophobic core in a similar manner to the previously-characterized Phe3 residue.</p><p>The authors next present a structure of the SafDAA tip-like structure, which adopts two distinct conformations within the crystallographic asymmetric unit defined by a 120-degree shift in the orientation of the proximal SafA subunit relative to the penultimate SafA subunit. The authors posit that the SafDAA isomerization state of Pro20 within the A-A linker regulates access to these two conformational states. The authors also demonstrate that the SafD-A interaction is likely fairly rigid due to a series of hydrophobic interactions between the two subunits.</p><p>The authors demonstrate that both SafD and SafA are both required for cell adherence, and that the binding affinity of SafDAA is greater than that of SafD alone. The authors thus conclude that the Saf pilus utilizes a polyadhesive mechanism to interact with host receptors.</p><p>Finally, the authors probe the role of the two observed SafDAA structures in pilus self-association and biofilm formation. In the so-called Type I dimerization, the authors demonstrate that a series of hydrogen bonds between SafA and SafD are required to mediate dimerization, while in Type II dimerization, close approximation of complementary surfaces between all three Saf subunits lead to an interaction. This Type II dimerization can be abrogated by restricting the torsion angles of residue 20 to prevent the large conformation changes required for this approximation to take place.</p><p>Originality and Significance</p><p>While the authors do not attempt to identify the molecular receptor or tissue tropism of the Saf pilus, their structural and functional insights into the mechanism of self-association are both interesting and novel. The significance of this work could be augmented by further discussion of the generalizability of these findings to other pilus systems by comparing the sequences and structures of SafD and A to sequences and structures of similar pilus types. Additionally, the contribution of the Leu4 residue to the DSE interaction could be interesting if found in other pilus systems.</p><p>1) There are many grammatical errors throughout the manuscript that should be corrected before publication.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that the SafD binding site is located at an electronegative patch on the side of the SafD molecule, but fail to discuss this further. These residues could be highlighted on Figure 2E to allow for comparison to the known binding residues of other members of the AfaD family. There was no attempt to mutate any of the residues making up this surface to probe their role in binding to IPEC-J2 cells assessed.</p><p>3) The increase in binding affinity of the SafDAA construct vs, the SafDA construct could either mean that the second SafA subunit interacts with the host receptor directly, or that its presence results in subtle conformation changes that alter the affinity of the two terminal Saf subunits for its ligand. The superposition of the two SafD structures is found in Figure 2D; however, this analysis is limited to the conformation of Tyr13. Are there other structural changes in SafD? Similarly, are there any SafA side chains whose positions differ significantly in the I and L forms, either within each conformation or between the two conformations that may indicate structural changes underlying the affinity difference?</p><p>4) The I/ for the outer resolution shell of the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> structure is only 0.8. Without seeing the density or knowing the CC1/2 in this shell, a resolution cutoff of 2.6 Å may not be appropriate. The B-factors and high R<sub>free</sub> in the outer shell are also concerning.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Zheng and co-workers report the X-ray structures of the <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> Saf pilus subunits and describe their role in cell adhesion and self-aggregation. The two reported structures are that of the SafD tip subunit complemented with the SafA donor strand, and a concatenated construct comprising SafD-SafA-Saf-SafNte. The structural information is novel and of high quality. Two alternative conformations are seen for the SafD-A-A polymer and this minimal pilus structure is seen to align longitudinally in the crystals, which the authors suggest to hint at a possible role in bacterial self-interaction and biofilm formation. This hypothesis is evaluated by an in vitro bead agglutination assay and a crystal violet biofilm formation assay in <italic>E. coli</italic> recombinantly expressing the saf operon.</p><p>The study is of potential broad interest, but needs attention in a number of points. The weak point of the study is that the role of Saf pili is not directly studied in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> itself and that the current data on the bead agglutination and <italic>E. coli</italic> biofilm formation are inconclusive.</p><p>Hence, a more modest discussion and representation is needed where extrapolating in vitro and structure-based findings to the in vivo context of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> infections. This begins with a more precise representation of the available literature on previous studies on the role of saf and other fimbriae in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> pathogenesis and biofilm formation. To confirm the claims on the Saf pilus adherence and self-aggregation, additional data would be needed as detailed in the point-by-point review.</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>&quot;Although Saf pilus is ubiquitously expressed in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, its structure and function remain poorly understood&quot; – this is a strong claim without reference, are Saf pili ubiquitously expressed? Presence in the genome does not equal expression. In general, the available literature on Saf biology and previous functional studies on fimbriae in <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis need to be better described in the introduction. The claim is repeated in the Introduction, again without any reference.</p><p>&quot;More importantly, Saf-Saf oligomerization helps to define a universal, inter-cellular self-associating mechanism in bacterial aggregation/colonization.&quot; What is the universal self-association mechanism that is proposed?</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>&quot;Although Saf pili are ubiquitously expressed in <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic>, it is not clear how Saf pili mediate host recognition, and whether they participate in cell-cell interaction and biofilm development. In this study, we aim to provide more structural and functional insights into this important pilus subtype.&quot; Any claims on the role or importance of Saf pili in <italic>Salmonella</italic> need references or new experimental data.</p><p>Results:</p><p>&quot;Furthermore, based on sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), SafD is thought to be adhesive.&quot; This is a non-logical claim as currently presented. If referring to sequence homology with <italic>E. coli</italic> AfaD, is it expected that SafD acts as an invasin? This should then be specified and included in the Discussion.</p><p>&quot;However, in P* position (a favored interaction that catalyze/stabilizes the exchanged product during DSE), Fhe3 is no longer in direct interaction with SafD.&quot; &quot;Fhe3&quot; should be corrected to &quot;Phe3&quot; throughout manuscript. What is the &quot;catalytic&quot; role the authors are referring to?</p><p>&quot;The superimposition of the SafD molecules shows interesting structural variations/flexibilities in LoopA-B on top of the P5 pocket, implying this loop might play a regulatory role in DSE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).&quot; Why does the presence of two conformations in the LoopA-B imply a regulatory role? What kind of regulatory role do the authors have in mind and evidence is there to invoke such role?</p><p>&quot;The SafD, SafA1, SafA2 and SafA3Nte have assembled into a thread-like shape with 26 Å in diameter and 136 Å in length/height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).&quot; Why are linker sequences not shown and are N- and C-termini labelled in the Saf subunits? In the supplementary figure the linkers are shown.</p><p>&quot;In between SafD and SafA1, Pro20 adopts a cis-configuration, enabling a kink in the subunit-subunit linker loop that, in turn, allows the formation of intra-molecular hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).&quot; Do the authors mean &quot;intermolecular&quot;? Also, what is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>? The labelled residues do not make sense. T111 looks like an Ile, or did the authors include the -OH hydrogen? Q134 and N6 do not make sense as Q or N, or again were the -NH2 hydrogens included? If including hydrogens, that should be done for all residues and all atoms in a residue; or clearly specified in the legend. If they are hydrogens, the Q134 side chain amide needs a 180 degree rotation.</p><p>&quot;Collectively, these data have suggested a poly-adhesive activity of Saf pili, in which SafD and SafA subunits can bind concertedly to the unknown host cell receptors to enable intimate host:bacterium interaction and colonization via a zip-in mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).&quot; What is the contribution of SafD in the polyadhesive binding? Does a SafA polymer or SafAA bind the IPEC-J2 cells?</p><p>&quot;As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, the beads coated with the recombinant SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> protein aggregated together to form clusters.&quot; The authors use a bead agglutination assay to evaluate the self-association of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>. The experiments as shown are not conclusive. How representative are the images? A more quantitative assay or representation of the bead assay is required to draw conclusions.</p><p>For the <italic>E. coli</italic> cell sorting and biofilm assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B and C</xref>), it is not currently demonstrated that surface-exposed Saf pili are indeed expressed (see below comments in the Materials and methods) and for the evaluation of the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), how do the authors differentiate whether reduced biofilm titers stem from reduced self-association versus reduced Saf pilus expression? If surface-exposed Saf pili are formed, are the amounts obtained from recombinant plasmid-based expression representative for those seen under native conditions in <italic>Salmonella</italic>? Is the N-terminal Strep tag on SafA in the recombinant saf operon compatible with Saf pilus formation?</p><p>&quot;At the initial stage, Saf pili might interact with each via Type I dimerization. As biofilm develops, the Saf pili can proceed into Type II dimerization, by each step of which the two adjacent cells move ~40 Å towards each other, giving rise to further intimate association and aggregation, leading to the ultimate micro-colony and biofilm formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).&quot; It is not clear what the sequential model is based on. Why would type I interactions take priority on Type II interactions?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>&quot;The movement of LoopA-B and Try13 sidechain appears to act as a molecular &quot;switch&quot;, allowing or precluding the access of incoming Nte peptide&quot; There is no experimental basis for this claim – see also comment above.</p><p>&quot;It is reasonable to believe that the further variation of Pro20 isomerization and torsion angles will no doubt allow much versatile architecture of Saf pili that is necessary for the adherence and survival in different surfaces and environments.&quot; It is not clear what is meant here. Pro will be <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic>, no further variation, and the dihedral angles of X-Pro-X bounds have reduced conformational freedom compared to that of other residues. Also what is meant with the concluding remark on the previously unrecognized role of proline in the G-A loop is unclear.</p><p>&quot;The cell adherence assay presented in this report showed that both SafA and SafD subunits are important for the binding of host cell receptors.&quot; The current data do not proof the involvement of SafD in the adherence – see comment above. Also the claim &quot;The mini Saf pilus, SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>, appeared to mimic the role of Saf pili&quot; should be reworded. There is no data on the Saf pilus presented, or referred to in the Introduction.</p><p>&quot;Based on sequence alignment, the host receptors integrin beta3 and fibronectin of AfaD (~30% sequence indentity with SafD) might be possible targets for Saf pili that should be further investigated in future studies (Cota et al., 2006).&quot; The reference shows AfaD binding to integrin beta1. Also, there is several studies showing that pilus adhesins with seq. ID's well above 50% percent can have unrelated receptors. Is there evidence that SafD acts as invasion similar to <italic>E. coli</italic> AfaD?</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>Flow cytometry analysis is used to evaluate the surface expression of Saf pili on <italic>E. coli</italic>. The Materials and methods describe use of 50mM EDTA for fixing and antibody based staining of the cells. EDTA treatment permeabilizes the outer membrane. How can the authors ensure that surface-localized Saf pili were formed? Also, if Saf pili induce self-aggregation, is the flow-cytometry experiment looking at single cells or cell clusters? This should be apparent from the scattering levels.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The paper describes the high resolution structural insight into a biopolymer of the Saf pilus from <italic>S. enterica</italic>. The Saf pilus is a member of the chaperone-usher pathway which is probably one the best characterised pilus assembly systems. The authors use the self-complementing approach, which has been previously been adopted to create single molecule mimics of the polymer. The crystal structures are described for the SafD tip adhesin and a three-subunit polymer of SafD-SafA-SafA. A conserved proline is seen in both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> conformations depending on whether it is between two SafA subunits or SafA and the SafD tip. Interestingly, the <italic>cis</italic> proline alters the overall architecture of the pilus and introduced a pronounced bend. They also reveal an interesting network of intermolecular contacts within the crystal that suggest a new mode of bacteria-bacteria interactions. These novel features are probed with mutagenesis and biofilms assays.</p><p>The paper is reasonably well written, and the figures are clear and professionally prepared. With a further proof read and review of the figures, the quality of the presentation would fit with the high calibre of this journal and other papers in this field. The structures of the pilus subunits are known and therefore this aspect does not add new insight. However, the molecular detail of the proline peptide bond and the Saf-Saf contacts are potential novel and of interest to the chaperone-usher field and those interested in bacterial-host recognition and biofilms.</p><p>One major question the authors need to address is whether these observations are artefacts of crystallography.

The thickness and relative straightness and rigidity of the pili indicates they are helically wound rods, which is in contradiction with the thin fibrillary nature of Saf seen by Salih et al. and also seen for the related Afa fibers, as well as with the structural data on the SafA-SafA contact as shown in this report. It would be necessary to perform the experiment in a fim knockout background, to rule out the fibers shown are not type 1 pili. Since recombinant Saf are produced using the pASK-IBA4-Saf construct, can the fibers be stained with anti-strep immunogold?</p><p>Western analysis of SafA-Strep expression levels.</p><p>The blot shows similar expression levels of SafA, but it is not confirmed whether these are surface localized or periplasmic since the OM prep protocol is not clarified.

I could not find reference to the exact kit based on the provided information.</p><p>We also remain puzzled by the flow cytometry data. Why do the induced <italic>E. coli</italic> pASK-IBA4-Saf cells not show an altered FSC compared to the vector control? If the cells start to clump, that should be readily seen in the forward scatter profile.</p><p>2) SafDAA – SafDAA contact.</p><p>The SAXS experiments still are not convincing. The theoretical and observed scattering curves differ markedly. What is the chi-squared value for the fit? The authors mention &quot;recombinant SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> might not be monodisperse in solution. Indeed, gel filtration characterization showed that SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> can undergo high-order oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).&quot; Monodispersity is a prerequisite to calculate meaningful scattering envelopes. The Guinier analysis of the SAXS data at different concentrations should inform on the dispersity of the analysed sample.</p><p>How do the authors explain that the SafDAA-SafDAA contact cannot be seen by SPR?</p><p>The cell aggregation data for the structure-based mutants (T7A/R9A/N94A and E8A/Q10A) are not in support of the claimed importance of the SafDAA-SafDAA contact seen in the crystals.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28619.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The relative contribution / requirement of SafD needs to be established in the cell-based adhesion assay.

Firstly, the new flow cytometry experiment is repeated in the absence of EDTA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Secondly, the overexpression and surfacing of Saf pili and mutants are confirmed by electron microscopy and outer membrane extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The bead assay needs to be made quantitative.

Furthermore, light microcopy is used to monitor the bacterial clustering mediated by WT Saf pili and mutants. The representative visualization and quantitative analysis are shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D</xref>. Moreover, in order to demonstrate the presence of Saf-Saf self-association in solution, SAXS technique is used to characterize the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> oligomerization. As shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>, SAXS analysis revealed an elongated envelope, supportive of crystallographic SafDAA-SafDAA dimer. More importantly, SEC-MALS characterization of T7A/R9A/N94A, E8A/Q10A and P20A showed that, when mutations were introduced to the crystal contact or the proline residue, the perturbation consistently disrupted the oligomerization activity of SafDAA in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). All these results, together with the observations in cell aggregation and biofilm formation assays, support a biological relevant of Saf-Saf oligomerization in cell-cell interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). However, we failed to measure the binding affinity of SafDAA-SafDAA using SPR technique. Consistently, at low concentration, the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> displayed mainly as monomer as characterized by gel filtration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This, however not surprising, makes senses in the context of the biofilm development (because the tight and rigid intermolecular interaction might prevent the dynamic association and disassociation between bacterium and biofilm community during bacterial pathogenesis). In line with this observation, similar dynamic oligomerizations are also observed in other bacterial self-association such as Hap-Hap, Ag43-Ag43 etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) If using the biofilm assay to compare point mutants, the authors need to evaluate whether the mutants do not alter Saf expression on the cell surface.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the expression and surfacing of the mutants are quantified by outer membrane extraction and western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

In this report, a variety of techniques including SAXS, SEC-MALS, bead/cell aggregation assay and biofilm formation assay (in which Saf/mutants expression are monitored by flow cytometry, EM and outer membrane extraction) are used to verify the crystallographic observation. In order to verify the crystallographic observation in crystal, the SAXS technique was to use characterize the recombinant SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> in solution. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D, E</xref>, the molecular shape derived from SAXS scattering fits well with the crystallographic SafDAASafDAA dimer. Moreover, the structure-based mutations targeting the Type I and Type II dimerizations consistently impaired SafDAA-SafDAA self-association activity in SEC-MALS assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) further support the discovery of this report. More importantly, when the mutations are characterized in the context of full-length Saf pili in <italic>E. coli</italic>, similar disruptive results are observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C-E</xref>). All these results have led to the proposal of physiological Saf-Saf association in bacterial aggregation, colony formation and ultimate biofilm formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors describe biological biofilm-formation assays that fits with their structural work and proposed function roles, but the manuscript lacks solution-based, biophysical characterisation that might support the effects of the proline peptide bond and the Saf-Saf contacts i.e. NMR, SAXS, native MS for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewers’ kind and critical advice. As suggested, in order to verify the presence of SafDAA-SafDAA dimer in solution, SAXS characterization is used. The SAXS scattering suggests an elongated shape of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> in solution. This molecular envelope significantly exceeds the length of SafDAA monomer, but fits well with the crystallographic dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, as implied by the variation/differences in crystal fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), the recombinant SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> might not be monodisperse in solution. Indeed, gel filtration characterization showed that SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> can undergo high-order oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In order to check the crystal contact and proline residue in the context of self-association, SEC-MALS technique is used. Consistent with SAXS characterization, WT SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> displays great tendency of high-order oligomerization/aggregation. In marked contrast, structure-based mutants significantly disrupt the self-associating activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Also, see above, we also discuss the observation of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> monomer in gel filtration in the context of other self-associating adhesins in the revised manuscript. In summary, these biophysical observations, together with other validations presented in this report, suggest that 1) the proline residue in Loop<sub>G-A</sub> is an interesting structural determinant in pili assembly and function; 2) the Saf-Saf intermolecular oligomerization is physiological relevant, underpinning the process of bacterial aggregation and colony formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below are the verbatim comments of the reviewers from which the above were distilled.

These residues could be highlighted on Figure 2E to allow for comparison to the known binding residues of other members of the AfaD family. There was no attempt to mutate any of the residues making up this surface to probe their role in binding to IPEC-J2 cells assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, the putative SafD binding site is subjected to mutagenesis and cell adherence assay. Thus far, single point mutations failed to abolish the interaction between SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> and IPEC-J2 cells (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Although the results are less supportive, we still want to draw reader/colleagues’ attention to this interesting structural feature in SafD.

Furthermore, as suggested by reviewer, the residues, Glu8 and Gln10 engaging inter-molecular interaction are compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

This should be apparent from the scattering levels.</p></disp-quote><p>Please also see our reply to editor (Essential revisions). In brief, the new flow cytometry assay is performed in the absence of EDTA.

In order to ensure the analysis of single cells (not cell clusters) in flow cytometry, 2 µm fluorescent blue polystyrene latex beads were used as a search temple.

By definition, crystals are built using intermolecular contacts, including from hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions. Furthermore, conformational changes can be induced in order to propagate an ordered crystal. Are their contacts and observations artefacts or real?</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our reply to editor (Essential revisions).

The thickness and relative straightness and rigidity of the pili indicates they are helically wound rods, which is in contradiction with the thin fibrillary nature of Saf seen by Salih et al. and also seen for the related Afa fibers, as well as with the structural data on the SafA-SafA contact as shown in this report. It would be necessary to perform the experiment in a fim knockout background, to rule out the fibers shown are not type 1 pili. Since recombinant Saf are produced using the pASK-IBA4-Saf construct, can the fibers be stained with anti-strep immunogold?</p></disp-quote><p>We really appreciate editor/reviewers’ critical comments. In the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, anti-strep immunogold staining and EM visualization were used to monitor the surfacing of Saf pili. This, together with the results observed in the experiments of flow cytometry and outer membrane extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and 7F</xref>), should give sufficient evidences to confirm the expression/secretion of Saf pili in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Western analysis of SafA-Strep expression levels.</p><p>The blot shows similar expression levels of SafA, but it is not confirmed whether these are surface localized or periplasmic since the OM prep protocol is not clarified. Is it clear that the &quot;outer membrane protein extraction kit (BestBio, China)&quot; used selectively extracts OM fractions whilst not also retaining the soluble protein fraction? I could not find reference to the exact kit based on the provided information.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, the protocol and references describing the preparation of outer membrane fractions are detailed in the Materials and methods section. Besides, in order to validate the feasibility and selectivity of western analysis, a negative control pASK-IBA4-SafABD (i.e. the ∆SafC mutation that was designed to abolish the surfacing/assembly of Saf pili in the outer membrane) was included to estimate the expression levels of WT Saf pili and mutants. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>We also remain puzzled by the flow cytometry data. Why do the induced E. coli pASK-IBA4-Saf cells not show an altered FSC compared to the vector control? If the cells start to clump, that should be readily seen in the forward scatter profile.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks to reviewers’ suggestion, we have revisited the flow cytometry experiment using DMEM, a medium often used in the studies of bacterial aggregation and biofilm formation. As reported before (MacKenzie et al., 2010; Torrent et al., 2012), FSC signal derived from flow cytometry analysis could be used to monitor the size of the object, and hence cell aggregation. In order to check the biofilm formation activity, the cells of pASK-IBA4-Saf were grown in the minimum medium DMEM before they were subjected to the analysis of flow cytometry. As shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, the cells expressing Saf displayed stronger preference to undergo cell-cell aggregation than control cells. The FCS signal showed that 13.8% Saf-expressing cells clumped together. In control cells (i.e. without Saf pili), only ~1.9% aggregated. This is in good agreement with the observation reported in cell aggregation and biofilm formation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, D, E, F</xref>), supportive of an important role of Saf pili in bacterial aggregation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) SafDAA – SafDAA contact.</p><p>The SAXS experiments still are not convincing. The theoretical and observed scattering curves differ markedly. What is the chi-squared value for the fit? The authors mention &quot;recombinant SafDAA-dsc might not be monodisperse in solution. Indeed, gel filtration characterization showed that SafDAA-dsc can undergo high-order oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).&quot; Monodispersity is a prerequisite to calculate meaningful scattering envelopes. The Guinier analysis of the SAXS data at different concentrations should inform on the dispersity of the analysed sample.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by reviewers, we have performed more SAXS characterizations of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> at different concentrations (i.e. 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/ml). As shown below, the Guinier analysis of these data showed that the samples were mono-dispersive and suitable for SAXS analysis (Figure below, 1A). In addition, the Kraky plots of distinct peaks suggested that SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> molecules might have multiple oligomerization stages in solution (Figure below, 1B). This has led to the OLIGOMER analysis by program CRYSOL. Under this approach, the SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> monomers, dimers and trimer (observed in crystallography) were all used to fit the experimental SAXS data. The result are shown in the revised Figure 5EF and the Figure below. Compared to the previous fitting, the Chi<sup>2</sup> values has dropped significantly to the level of 2.74 (for 1 mg/ml sample), suggesting a dynamic multimeric assembly in solution containing monomer (~79.7%), dimer (~2.1%) and trimer (~18.2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28619.028</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>SAXS characterization of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> at concentrations of 1, 2.5 and 5 mg/ml.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Guinier analysis.

However, this is not surprising. Similar weak interacting nature were also reported in other inter-cellular cross-linkers such as <italic>H.influenzae</italic> Hap, <italic>E. coli</italic> Ag43 etc. (Meng et al., 2011; Heras et al., 2014). In previous study, it has been proposed that the polymerization of inter-molecular Haps and Ag43s might be a formidable force for cell-cell interaction. Under the same principle, we could envisage a similar approach by Saf pili: the progressive inter-cellular oligomerization between multiple Saf polymers might be sufficient to trigger bacterial aggregation (as demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For now, based on the data in hand, we could speculate that the weak SafDAA-SafDAA might be biological relevant and a necessary structural determinant/factor, enabling the polymerization/depolymerization of Saf pili and the association/disassociation between single cell and biofilm community, in turn regulating the bacterial life cycles of staying with other cell (to seek protection), or leaving from the cell community (to seek further colonization and infection). Again, this is purely speculative and should demand more investigation in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cell aggregation data for the structure-based mutants (T7A/R9A/N94A and E8A/Q10A) are not in support of the claimed importance of the SafDAA-SafDAA contact seen in the crystals.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand reviewers’ concern, and have acknowledged the weak interacting nature of SafDAA-SafDAA in the revised manuscript. Supported by the new SAXS analysis, the SafDAA-SafDAA multimers revealed by crystallography seem plausible in solution. In addition, the SEC-MALS characterization of WT SafDAA and mutants showed that the mutation targeting the SafDAA-SafDAA contact arrested the SafDAA interaction/oligomerization in a dimeric stage. This, together with SAXS data, supports the idea of self-associating activity of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic>. More important, flow cytometry, beads/cells aggregation assays and biofilm formation assays all in good agreement with each other, supporting the self-associating activity of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> and Saf-Saf interaction in bacterial aggregation. This has not been reported before. However, we appreciate reviewers’ concern that, in cell-aggregation assay, the structure-based mutants still formed colonies, but with less quantity and different morphology. Interestingly, similar mutants also displayed less biofilm activity, suggestive of certain degree of disruptive impact on Saf-Saf contact and bacterial aggregation. Based on these observations and the results in biophysical characterizations, we have rephrased the discussion and make clear to readers that Saf pili might adopt multiple configurations in inter-molecular interactions that will include, but not restricted to, the intertwining/oligomerization unveiled by the crystal structures of SafDAA-<italic>dsc</italic> multimers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
