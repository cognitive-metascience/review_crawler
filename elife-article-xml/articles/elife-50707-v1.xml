Under the section entitled &quot;Preparation of EM samples related to SYNJ2BP overexpression in wild type or RRBP1 knockout cells with or without protein translation inhibitors&quot;, we incorrectly stated the reagent used to reduce OsO<sub>4</sub> .</p><p>Below is the original text:</p><p>&quot;Each well was then overlaid with 1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% K<sub>3</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] in sodium cacodylate buffer:2% OsO<sub>4</sub> (Electron Microscopy Sciences) solution in cold sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 hr.&quot;</p><p>And the corrected version:</p><p>&quot;Each well was then overlaid with 1 ml of a 1:1 mixture of 2% K<sub>4</sub>[Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>] · 3H<sub>2</sub>O in sodium cacodylate buffer:2% OsO<sub>4</sub> (Electron Microscopy Sciences) solution in cold sodium cacodylate buffer for 2 hr.&quot;</p><p>Additionally, in the methods section entitled &quot;Western blot analysis of SYNJ2BP-V5 pull downs in the presence of translation inhibitors&quot;, we incorrectly recorded the western blot protocol for detecting endogenous anti-SYNJ2BP rather than the correct protocol used to detect the V5 epitope-tagged recombinant SYNJ2BP as clearly denoted in Figure 4A.</p><p>Below is the original text:</p><p>&quot;The bottom halves were blocked in 3% BSA in 1x TBST, and the top halves were blocked in 5% milk in 1x TBST for 1 hr at room temperature. The top halves were incubated face down on 500 µl of 1:3000 rabbit anti-RRBP1 (Abcam, catalog no. ab95983) in 1% milk in 1x TBST for 1 hr, and the bottom halves were incubated face down on 500 µl of 1:500 rabbit anti-SYNJ2BP (Sigma Aldrich, catalog no. HPA000866) for 1 hr. The membranes were then washed four times with 1x TBST for 5 min each time. Each membrane was rocked in 10 ml of 1:2000 anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-rad) in 3% BSA in 1x TBST each for 1 hr at room temperature.&quot;</p><p>And the corrected version:</p><p>&quot;The bottom halves were blocked in 3% BSA in 1x TBST, and the top halves were blocked in 5% milk in 1x TBST for 1 hr at room temperature. The top halves were incubated face down on 500 µl of 1:3000 rabbit anti-RRBP1 (Abcam, catalog no. ab95983) in 1% milk in 1x TBST for 1 hr.

The membranes were then washed four times with 1x TBST for 5 min each time. Each membrane was rocked in 10 ml of either 1:2000 anti-rabbit HRP (Bio-rad) or 1:2000 anti-mouse HRP (Bio-rad) in 3% BSA in 1x TBST for 1 hr at room temperature.&quot;</p><p>These corrections do not affect any of the scientific findings or conclusions of the original paper, but we hope they will increase clarity.
