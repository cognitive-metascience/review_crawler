In some cases, these neurites interact with those of neighboring neurons, a phenomenon called self/non-self discrimination. The functional roles of these processes remain unknown. In this study, we used retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs), critical components of a direction-selective circuit, to address this issue. In SACs, both processes are mediated by the gamma-protocadherins (Pcdhgs), a family of 22 recognition molecules. We manipulated Pcdhg expression in SACs and recorded from them and their targets, direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs). SACs form autapses when self-avoidance is disrupted and fail to form connections with other SACs when self/non-self discrimination is perturbed. Pcdhgs are also required to prune connections between closely spaced SACs. These alterations degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs. Thus, self-avoidance, self/non-self discrimination, and synapse elimination are essential for proper function of a circuit that computes directional motion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08964.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08964.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08964.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells (or neurons) connect to one another to form circuits that control the animal's behavior. Typically, each neuron receives signals from other cells via branch-like structures called dendrites. Each specific type of neuron has a characteristic pattern of branched dendrites, which is different from the pattern of other types of neuron. Therefore, it is reasonable to imagine that the shape of these branches can influence how the neuron works; however, this idea has rarely been tested experimentally.</p><p>Different processes are known to act together to control the pattern of the branched dendrites. For example, dendrites in some neurons avoid other dendrites from the same neuron. This phenomenon is referred to as ‘self-avoidance’. In some of these cases, the same dendrites freely interact with the dendrites of neighboring neurons of the same type; this is called ‘self/non-self discrimination’. It is not clear, however, how these two processes influence the activity of neural circuits.</p><p>Both self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination rely on the expression of genes that encode so-called recognition molecules. Kostadinov and Sanes have now altered the expression of these genes in mice to see the effect that disrupting these two phenomena has on a set of neurons called ‘starburst amacrine cells’ that are found at the back the eye. The dendrites of starburst amacrine cells generate signals when objects move across the animal's field of vision. These dendrites then signal to other starburst amacrine cells and to so-called ‘direction-selective ganglion cells’, which in turn send this information to the brain for further processing. The experiments revealed that these disruptions affected the connections between the dendrites. Starburst amacrine cells that lacked self-avoidance mistakenly formed connections with themselves—as if they mistook their own dendrites for those of other starburst cells. In contrast, neurons that lacked self/non-self discrimination made the opposite mistake, and rarely formed connections with each other—as if they mistook the dendrites of other starbursts for their own. Disruptions to either phenomenon interfered with the activity of the direction-selective ganglion cells.</p><p>Following on from the work of Kostadinov and Sanes, the next challenges include uncovering how the recognition molecules help with self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination. It will also be important to examine whether the conclusions based on one type of neurons can be generalized to others that also exhibit these two phenomena.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08964.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08964.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>starburst amacrine cell</kwd><kwd>synapse elimination</kwd><kwd>self-recognition</kwd><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY022073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanes</surname><given-names>Joshua R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 EY007110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kostadinov</surname><given-names>Dimitar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS078893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kostadinov</surname><given-names>Dimitar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Patterning of dendrites by protocadherin-dependent self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination is required for proper function of a retinal circuit that computes the direction of motion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The geometry of a neuron's dendritic and axonal arbors is believed to be a major determinant of the neuron's role within a circuit. In some cases, the relationship is clear: in sensory systems, for example, the size and shape of a dendritic arbor determine the size and shape of the neuron's receptive field, and the degree of branching within the arbor determines how densely the field is sampled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>). Other cases are more conjectural, and in very few cases have experiments attempted to make a causal link between particular dendritic geometries and neuronal function. Here, we address this issue by analyzing a retinal direction-selective circuit.</p><p>The phenomena we investigate are self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination (S/NSD). In self-avoidance, sibling dendritic branches do not contact each other. Although not all neurons exhibit self-avoidance, this phenomenon has been observed in a variety of systems including sensory neurons of leech (<italic>Hirudo medicinalis</italic>; in which the process was first described), moth (<italic>Manduca sexta</italic>), fruit fly (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>), worms (<italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>), and zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nicholls and Baylor, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yau, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer and Kuwada, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer and Stent, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grueber et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu and Halloran, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sagasti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Dendrites of olfactory projection neurons and axons of mushroom body neurons also exhibit self-avoidance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hattori et al., 2007</xref>). In mammals, self-avoidance has been documented in cerebellar Purkinje cells and some types of retinal horizontal, bipolar, amacrine, and ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montague and Friedlander, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wassle et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsuoka et al., 2012</xref>). Several cell-surface proteins have been implicated in self-avoidance, including Dscam1, Turtle, Flamingo, LAR-like receptor tyrosine phosphatase, Unc-5, Unc-6 (Netrin), and Unc-40 (DCC) in invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Macagno, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Long et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smith et al., 2012</xref>) and Dscam, DscamL1, Slit, Robo, Sema6A, PlexA4, PlexA2, and gamma-Protocadherins (Pcdhgs) in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fuerst et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsuoka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gibson et al., 2014</xref>). In each case, they appear to act through contact-dependent repellent mechanisms.</p><p>In some instances, processes of neurons that exhibit self-avoidance do not avoid other neurons of the same type; rather, they overlap extensively with and sometimes even form synapses on each other. Thus, these neurons appear to discriminate between their own processes, which they repel, and those of their neighbors, with which they interact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This puzzling observation suggests that processes of nominally identical neurons are immune to the repellent forces that act within each other's arbors, a phenomenon that has been called S/NSD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zipursky and Grueber, 2013</xref>). Of the molecules that mediate self-avoidance, two have also been shown to mediate S/NSD: fly Dscam1 and mouse Pcdhgs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hattori et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hughes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matthews et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soba et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>). While Dscam1 and Pcdhg proteins are not structurally related, they have three properties that allow them to mediate both self-avoidance and S/NSD. First, both are transmembrane recognition molecules with remarkable extracellular diversity. Alternative splicing of the Dscam1 transcripts and alternative promoter choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) plus isoform multimerization of Pcdhgs lead to &gt;10,000 recognition units (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schmucker et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tasic et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Murata et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thu et al., 2014</xref>). Second, each Dscam1 and Pcdhg isoform binds homophilically, but does not bind appreciably to other, closely related isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wojtowicz et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schreiner and Weiner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Thu et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, in those cases where tests have been made, each neuron in a population expresses a small randomly selected subset of isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Neves et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miura et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Toyoda et al., 2014</xref>), leading to molecular diversification that, in the case of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Dscam1, has been demonstrated to be important for proper patterning of neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hattori et al., 2009</xref>). Together, these observations have led to a model for self-avoidance and S/NSD in which Dscam1- and Pcdhg-mediated homophilic interactions generate signals leading to repulsion. Because all dendrites (or axons) of a single neuron display the same set of Dscam1 or Pcdhg isoforms, they exhibit self-avoidance. On the other hand, any individual neuron is unlikely to encounter a neighbor that displays the same combination of isoforms, so the neurons do not repel each other and thus display S/NSD.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08964.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Pcdhg-dependent self-avoidance and self/non-self discrimination in SACs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Self-avoiding neurites lack isoneuronal contacts (repulsion) but adhere to and can form synapses with neurites of other cells of the same type, displaying self/non-self discrimination (adhesion).

To our knowledge, however, none of these hypotheses has been tested experimentally. Here, we report such tests, focusing on retinal starburst amacrine cells (SACs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These neurons have planar, radially symmetric dendritic arbors that exhibit striking self-avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), but they fasciculate and form synapses with neighboring SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>), and thus exhibit S/NSD. SACs also provide the principal inhibitory input to ON and ON-OFF direction-selective retinal ganglion cells (DSGCs) and are essential for their direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Elegant structural and functional studies have revealed the principal elements of the underlying mechanism: individual SAC dendrites are inhibitory direction-selective subunits that wire asymmetrically to DSGCs and inhibit these ganglion cells when visual motion is presented along their proximo–distal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the preferred direction of motion for the DSGC is opposite, the preferred direction of motion for the SAC dendrites that innervate it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In addition, SACs form inhibitory synapses onto each other, and it has been suggested that these connections sharpen the directional preference of SAC dendrites and thus the directional preference of the DSGCs that they innervate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enciso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>).</p><p>We showed recently that Pcdhgs mediate self-avoidance and S/NSD in SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>). Pcdhg-deficient SACs exhibit a dramatic loss of self-avoidance but maintain overlap with neighboring SACs, as if they mistake their own dendrites for those of their neighbors and fail to repel them. In contrast, forcing all SACs to express the same single Pcdhg isoform restores self-avoidance to individual cells but decreases the overlap between neighboring cells, as if they mistake dendrites of these neighbors for their own and repel them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–H</xref>). These results lead to three specific hypotheses about circuit function: (1) in the absence of self-avoidance, SACs will form synapses with themselves (autapses), (2) when S/NSD fails, SACs will form few synapses with each other, and (3) loss of self-avoidance or S/NSD will degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs. Here, we present evidence in support of these hypotheses, thereby providing insights into the functional roles of self-avoidance and S/NSD. We also demonstrate an unexpected role of Pcdhgs in control of synapse elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SACs are connected by inhibitory synapses</title><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al.

Currents occurred with a latency of ∼7 ms and averaged ∼15 pA in connected cells at both ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). They were blocked by 50 µM picrotoxin and reversed at the chloride reversal potential for our recording solutions (∼–70 mV), indicating that they were GABAergic and inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Although SAC–SAC connections have a cholinergic component before eye-opening in both rabbits and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ford et al., 2012</xref>), they exhibited no significant cholinergic component after eye opening (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Synapses between closely spaced SACs are eliminated after eye-opening</title><p>The frequency with which SACs were interconnected varied systematically with the distance between their somata and with age. At P15-24, pairs were over twice as likely to be connected if they were separated by 35–100 µm than if they were separated by 100–175 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,K</xref>, left). This difference mirrors the inverse relationship of the distance between SACs and the overlap of their dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, connections were seldom detectable between pairs separated by &lt;100 µm in adults. The frequency of connections between pairs &gt;100 µm apart did not change significantly with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,K</xref>, right), indicating that the decline did not reflect decreased ability to detect connections in older mice. The most parsimonious explanation for this difference is that synapses between closely spaced SACs are eliminated as SACs mature.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pcdhgs drive elimination of connections between closely spaced SACs</title><p>Next, we asked whether Pcdhgs are required for formation of SAC–SAC synapses. For this purpose, we inactivated all 22 Pcdhgs in SACs using a conditional Pcdhg allele (Pcdhg<sup>flox</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lefebvre et al., 2008</xref>) and the Chat<sup>cre</sup> line. We refer to Pcdhg<sup>flox/flox</sup>; Chat<sup>cre</sup> mice as Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and controls (Pcdhg<sup>flox/+</sup> or Pcdhg<sup>+/+</sup>; Chat<sup>cre</sup>) as Pcdhg<sup>22</sup>. Restricting mutation to SACs allowed us to analyze roles of Pcdhgs in SACs without the complication of directly affecting other synaptic partners. Moreover, deletion of Pcdhgs leads to excessive cell death in many retinal neuronal populations, but not in SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lefebvre et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>). As expected, we observed no alterations in the density of SACs or of other retinal cells in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas. We further verified that the laminar position and mosaic spacing of SACs, as well as overall retinal structure, did not differ detectably between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3 fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplements 3, 4</xref>).</p><p>At P15-24, the number and strength of SAC–SAC connections were similar in Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas: in both genotypes, connections were over twice as common in closely spaced pairs than in pairs separated by &gt;100 µm and current sizes did not differ significantly between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,H,J</xref>). Thus, Pcdhgs are dispensable for formation of SAC–SAC synapses. In adults, in contrast, the pattern of SAC–SAC connectivity differed between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> mice. Synapses between closely spaced SACs were retained in mutants during the period that they were lost from controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G,I,K</xref>). This loss of proximal connections was selective in that the frequency and size of connections between SACs separated by &gt;100 µm did not differ significantly between Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J,K</xref>). These results reveal a requirement of Pcdhgs for synapse elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Pcdhgs prevent formation of SAC autapses</title><p>If Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SAC dendrites treat other dendrites of the same SAC as if they are dendrites of other SACs, they might form autapses. To test this hypothesis, we adapted a protocol that had been used to elicit autaptic currents in cultured neurons and cortical slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkers and Stevens, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci et al., 2003</xref>). We stimulated SACs with brief voltage steps to very positive potentials (V = +60 mV, 2–4 ms), then returned to more negative potentials (V = −20 mV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We confirmed that this stimulation was able to elicit synaptic release in paired recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These stimuli elicited autaptic currents in ∼75% of Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs at P21-24, but in no Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> SACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Autaptic currents resembled SAC–SAC connections in their latencies and rise times, were blockable by application of 50 µM picrotoxin, and averaged ∼20 pA in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). We also asked whether autapses are present in adult Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs or whether, like synapses between closely spaced SACs in wild-type retina (see previous section), they are progressively eliminated. Autapses persisted into adulthood in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs with sizes and frequency similar to those observed at P21-24 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–G</xref>).

Their physiological properties other than preferred direction are similar, but they exhibit molecular differences that allow them to be marked selectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kay et al., 2011</xref>). To assess SAC input to DSGCs, we used a transgenic line in which DSGCs that prefer motion in the ventral direction express GFP (HB9-GFP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Trenholm et al., 2011</xref>). We introduced this transgene into the Pcdhg<sup>22</sup>, Pcdhg<sup>0</sup>, and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> backgrounds, and recorded inhibitory currents (V<sub>h</sub> = 0 mV) from GFP-labeled DSGCs, which we call vDSGCs here. Sizes of both ON and OFF inhibitory responses to spot flashes were indistinguishable across the three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Similarly, excitatory spot flash responses in vDSGCs were unaffected by manipulation of Pcdhgs in SACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>). Thus, Pcdhg expression in SACs is dispensable for their ability to form and maintain synapses with other cell types.</p><p>We also assessed the structure of vDSGCs in Pcdhg<sup>22</sup>, Pcdhg<sup>0</sup>, and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> mice. We filled single cells with fluorescent dye, stained SACs with antibodies to ChAT, and imaged the two cell types. In all conditions, the ON and OFF dendrites of these DSGCs stratified in the ON and OFF SAC plexus, fasciculated with SAC dendrites, and maintained their modest structural asymmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>). Thus, altering Pcdhg expression in SACs had no detectable effect on the morphology of vDSGCs.

Direction selectivity of vDSGCs was diminished in both Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas but in different ways.

In contrast, responses of vDSGCs in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas exhibited a significantly greater scatter around the ventral axis than those in wild-type retinas, whereas vDSGCs in Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas were as precisely tuned to ventral motion as controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This gave us a ventral DSI that combined the degree of directional preference and the fidelity of ventral preference for ON and OFF responses together. vDSGCs in Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> (control) retinas were most ventrally selective, followed by those in Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas; vDSGCs in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas were the least selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that manipulating Pcdhg expression in SACs, and thereby attenuating self-avoidance or S/NSD, degrades the direction selectivity of DSGCs. Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sun et al. (2013)</xref> also showed that morphological alterations of SACs disrupt directional tuning of DSGCs.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that direction-selective responses are already present at eye opening in mice but become more selective with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elstrott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yonehara et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Chiao, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). We wondered whether this improvement of direction selectivity with age was related to the loss of proximal SAC–SAC connections. To assess this possibility, we recorded from direction-selective responses from vDSGCs at P15-24 in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> mice, which do not go through a developmental change in SAC–SAC connectivity. We confirmed the improved age-dependent directional tuning of DSGCs in control retinas. In contrast, direction selectivity of vDSGCs did not improve in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To this end, we recorded inhibitory and excitatory currents from vDSGCs in the three genotypes in response to bars moving in the null and preferred directions (dorsal and ventral, respectively). As noted previously, the inhibitory currents arise predominantly from SACs, which are genetically altered in mutants, while the excitatory currents arise predominantly from bipolar cells, which are not altered.</p><p>Studies in mice and rabbits have revealed two key aspects of SAC–DSGC connectivity that lead to direction selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fried et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yonehara et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Park et al., 2014</xref>), both of which we confirmed in vDSGCs from Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> retinas. First, inhibitory input to DSGCs is greater for movement in the null direction (dorsal for vDSGCs) than for movement in the preferred direction (ventral for vDSGCs), whereas excitatory input is similar for movement in both directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,J,K</xref>). Second, excitatory and inhibitory currents recorded from DSGCs arise at the same time when motion is in the null direction, whereas inhibitory currents lag with respect to excitatory currents when motion is in the preferred direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,L,M</xref>). Together, these features allow inhibition to veto excitation in DSGCs more strongly for null motion than for preferred motion. Consequently, net depolarization in DSGCs is largest for motion in the preferred direction.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08964.017</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Synaptic basis of degraded direction selectivity in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example excitatory (black, V<sub>h</sub> = −70 mV) and inhibitory (gray, V<sub>h</sub> = 0 mV) currents evoked by leading edge (ON response) of bar moving in ventral (left) and dorsal (right) directions in vDSGC from Pcdhg<sup>22</sup> retina.

In the Discussion, we suggest a possible explanation for these alterations in terms of perturbations in SAC self-avoidance, S/NSD, and synapse elimination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Dendritic arbors of many neuronal types in both vertebrates and invertebrates exhibit self-avoidance and S/NSD (references in Introduction). In this study, we used SACs to assess the functional consequences of perturbing these processes. SACs were uniquely suited for this study for several reasons. First, they exhibit robust self-avoidance and S/NSD. Second, Pcdhgs are necessary for both processes, providing a means to manipulate them. Moreover, our genetic methods allowed us to manipulate Pcdhgs selectively in SACs, without directly affecting other neuronal types to which they connect. Third, removal or replacement of Pcdhgs in SACs allowed us to perturb self-avoidance and S/NSD independently. Finally, the role of SACs in retinal circuit function is remarkably well understood. By exploiting these features, we elucidated roles of self-avoidance and S/NSD in SAC connectivity, discovered a previously undescribed phase of synapse elimination between SACs, and showed that alterations in these processes decrease the ability of the retina to compute direction of motion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Linking Pcdhg expression to SAC connectivity</title><p>Loss of Pcdhgs has been shown to have several effects on developing neurons including decreased neuronal survival in retina and spinal cord, decreased synaptic maintenance in spinal cord, decreased dendritic branching in neocortex, and decreased self-avoidance in retina and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weiner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lefebvre et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prasad et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garrett et al., 2012</xref>). Any of these phenotypes would complicate our attempt to assess roles of self-avoidance and S/NSD in SAC and circuit function. We therefore manipulated Pcdhg expression selectively in SACs and performed a variety of control experiments to assess whether our manipulations affected other aspects of retinal development or function. Our results are as follows:</p><p>First, SACs are unusual among retinal neurons in that their survival does not depend on Pcdhg expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>), and we confirmed that SAC number was unaltered in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retina. Second, we confirmed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>) that alteration of Pcdhg expression in SACs had no effect on their dendritic length or mosaic spacing. Third, basic electrical properties (resting membrane potential and input resistance) of SACs were preserved in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas (data not shown). Fourth, manipulation of Pcdhgs in SACs had no detectable effect on the strength of the inputs they receive from bipolar cells or deliver to DSGCs. Fifth, removing or replacing Pcdhgs in SACs had no detectable effect on cell number or general organization of the retina. Finally, we detected no alteration in the number, spacing, dendritic arbors, molecular markers or electrical properties of ventrally-preferring DSGCs. Thus, although we cannot completely exclude the possibility that Pcdhg manipulation had additional effects, we favor the explanation that alterations in SAC connectivity and circuit function documented here result from perturbation of Pcdhg-dependent self-avoidance, S/NSD, and synapse elimination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Self-avoidance, self/non-self discrimination, and SAC connectivity</title><p>Morphological studies led to the idea that self-avoidance serves to optimize coverage of a receptive field by a dendritic arbor, minimizing gaps, and clumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer and Kuwada, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kramer and Stent, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>). Our physiological studies revealed an additional role of self-avoidance in SACs: it prevents formation of autapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). In many neuronal types, autapses cannot form because pre- and postsynaptic machinery are confined to axons and dendrites, respectively, which are physically segregated. SACs, in contrast, form dendro-dendritic synapses, and therefore have pre- and postsynaptic specializations intermingled. This situation is not uncommon in the retina and elsewhere in the central nervous system, such as the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Murthy, 2011</xref>). We suggest that self-avoidance may play similar roles in other such cells.</p><p>S/NSD is generally viewed as a means of limiting inter-dendritic repulsion to sibling processes, so that neurons of a single type can share territory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grueber and Sagasti, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zipursky and Grueber, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>). In the retina, it additionally allows formation of synapses between SACs. Several types of neurons have been shown to form homotypic connections in cortex and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rieubland et al., 2014</xref>). Since most molecules described to date that mediate self-avoidance are ill-suited to mediate S/NSD, additional mechanisms likely remain to be discovered. In addition, some cell types that connect homotypically may lack robust mechanisms for self-avoidance. Indeed, cortical fast-spiking interneurons, which form homotypic connections, also form autapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacci et al., 2003</xref>). It is unclear whether these autapses are beneficial to the circuit or whether they are an acceptable cost of homotypic connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Age- and distance-dependent elimination of SAC–SAC connections</title><p>Zhou and colleagues previously demonstrated inhibitory SAC–SAC synaptic connections in rabbit retina soon after eye opening, a result we confirmed here for mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zheng et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>). We also discovered two additional features of these connections. First, in mature retina (&gt;P40), SACs separated by less than 100 µm seldom formed synapses with each other, whereas SACs separated by &gt; 100 µm were connected frequently. Since dendritic overlap is inversely proportional to the distance between SACs, this distance-dependence is not a passive consequence of proximity but instead implies spatial selectivity to SAC–SAC connections. Second, we found that this distance-dependence was absent in immature retinas (P15-24; eye opening occurs at P14). Thus, connections between closely spaced SACs are selectively lost as the retina matures.</p><p>We view the loss of proximal SAC–SAC connections as synapse elimination, a process that occurs in many and perhaps most neuronal types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kano and Hashimoto, 2009</xref>) but has not previously been described for SACs. In most cases, synapse elimination was first described physiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Redfern, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crepel et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Purves and Lichtman, 1980</xref>) as we have done here. For these cases, morphological confirmation was obtained many years later. We expect this will be the case for SACs as well. Such demonstration will be difficult, however, because SAC dendrites are so thin and densely packed that it is infeasible to map synapses on them by light microscopic methods. Ultrastructural studies using genetic tags or extensive reconstruction at several developmental time points will therefore be needed to decide this issue.</p><p>Why might connections between closely spaced SACs be counterproductive? Inhibitory connections between nearby SACs would frequently be made between dendrites with similar directional preferences. The ability of a SAC dendrite to respond to centrifugal motion along its dendrite would thereby decrease, because this motion would lead to inhibition of the dendrite by other SACs. This, in turn, would degrade the direction selectivity of DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>). In contrast, connections of distant SACs will most frequently be made between dendrites with opposite directional preference; as discussed in the next section, this enhances directional computation.</p><p>Conversely, might there be a role for connections between closely spaced SACs early in development? In fact, strong SAC–SAC connectivity is critical for the developing visual system, because it underlies propagation of the retinal waves that pattern the segregation of binocular input in retinorecipient areas such as the superior colliculus and lateral geniculate nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burbridge et al., 2014</xref>). Because waves occur before eye-opening, directional selectivity is unimportant. Thus, we suggest that postponing distance-dependent elimination of SAC–SAC connections until after eye-opening allows both the dense connectivity needed for wave propagation and the selective anti-parallel connectivity needed for direction selectivity. Consistent with this view, the direction selectivity of DSGCs increases during the period in which connections between closely spaced SACs are being eliminated.</p><p>We also found that connections between closely spaced SACs are not eliminated in the absence of Pcdhgs, revealing a novel role for these molecules in neural development. The mechanism of this effect remains to be determined. One attractive possibility is that an uneven distribution of Pcdhgs within SACs might confine synapses to distal portions of dendrites.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Roles of SAC–SAC inhibition in directional computation</title><p>We have argued that alterations in SAC connectivity in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> and Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas documented in the first part of this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig4">Figures 2–4</xref>) result from defects in self-avoidance, S/NSD, and synapse elimination. We now argue that these defects largely explain the degradation in direction selectivity in vDSGCs documented in the second part (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6, 7</xref>).</p><p>As described above, SACs contribute to the direction selectivity of DSCGs in two ways. First, inhibitory currents are larger during null motion than preferred motion. The difference in inhibitory currents arises in large part from the geometric arrangement of SAC–DSGC connections: vDGSCs, for example, receive most SAC input from dendrites that respond preferentially to dorsal (null) motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, anti-parallel inhibitory connections between SACs decrease the currents that these dendrites would otherwise provide during preferred motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Together, these processes result in greater net depolarization and therefore spiking for preferred motion than null motion. The number of SAC–SAC connections is markedly decreased in Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). These connections persist in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas, but their efficacy is decreased because parallel SAC dendrites remain connected and inhibit each other, resulting in decreased inhibitory input from SACs to DSCGs for null motion and decreased antiparallel SAC–SAC inhibition (and thus increased SAC–DSCG inhibition) for preferred motion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>). The autapses in Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retina would act similarly to synapses between parallel dendrites, since autapsing dendrites are likely to point in similar directions (see Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SAC image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Second, inhibitory and excitatory currents in DSGCs are nearly simultaneous during null motion, allowing inhibition to veto excitation, whereas inhibition is delayed with respect to excitation during preferred motion, decreasing the power of the veto. A recent computational model argues that the delayed inhibition for preferred motion arises in part because anti-parallel SAC–SAC connections transiently suppress transmitter release from SACs to DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>). Decreased inhibition, from loss of SAC–SAC connections in Pcdhg<sup>1</sup> retinas and decreased efficacy of SAC–SAC synapses Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> retinas, would thus be expected to decrease the delay, thereby blunting the response to preferred motion.</p><p>In summary, the spatial organization of SAC–SAC inhibition and SAC–DSGC inhibition work together to generate a direction-selective output from the retina. When self-avoidance, S/NSD, or synapse elimination is perturbed, SAC–SAC inhibition is rendered less effective and direction selectivity is degraded. Thus, our results demonstrate roles for these Pcdhg-dependent processes in computation of direction selectivity and provide new evidence in support of the hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Enciso et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Smith, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vaney et al., 2012</xref>) that SAC–SAC connections play important roles in this computation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Animals were used in accordance with NIH guidelines and protocols approved by Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee at Harvard University.

Retinas were rapidly dissected under infrared illumination into room temperature, oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) Ames medium and placed in a recording chamber on the stage of a custom built electrophysiology set up. Recordings were carried out in the same medium heated to 32–34°C. Fluorescent cells were identified with a brief (&lt;40 ms) LED flash, overlaid onto infrared images, and targeted with electrodes. Recordings were made from SACs and vDSGCs using patch electrodes with resistance of 6–8 MΩ and 4–6 MΩ, respectively. For loose patch recordings, electrodes were filled with Ames medium. For intracellular recordings, electrodes were filled with intracellular solution containing the following (in mM): 120 Cs-Methanesulfonate, 10 Na-Acetate, 0.2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 EGTA, 5 CsCl, 2 Mg-GTP, and 0.5 Na<sub>2</sub>-GTP (pH 7.3). Intracellular recording solutions were supplemented with 5 mM QX314-Br for vDSGC voltage clamp recordings and 5 mM TEA-Br for SAC autapse recordings.</p><p>Paired connections were tested with 200 ms voltage steps from V<sub>h</sub> = −70 mV to +20 mV in presynaptic SACs while postsynaptic SACs were held at +30 mV for all current size measurements and at potentials between −70 and +30 in 20 mV increments to establish I–V relationships. Approximately 10 voltage step repetitions were acquired for each pre-post pair and bidirectional measurements were made if recordings were sufficiently stable. Cells were analyzed in a semi-automated fashion and deemed connected using the following criteria: (1) Average traces had a peak in the first 30 ms after presynaptic stimulus onset that was &gt;2 standard deviations from the baseline established in the 50 ms before stimulus onset, (2) current deflection was present in ≥ 80% of trials, (3) peak current had short latency (&lt;12 ms) and fast rise time (10–90% rise time &lt;4 ms). Each recording was checked after the fact for large baseline deviations or other anomalous signals.</p><p>Autapse recordings were evoked using a brief voltage step from V<sub>h</sub> = −70 to +60 mV (2–4 ms) followed by a return to −20 mV. This stimulus activated some intrinsic currents in SAC that decayed in &lt;100 ms. During this decay phase, a large fraction Pcdhg<sup>0</sup> SACs exhibited outward currents with synaptic latencies, rise times, and amplitudes that were blockable by the addition of 50 µM picrotoxin and thus autaptic currents. To analyze these recordings, we (1) fit the first 30 ms of each trace after returning to our holding potential of −20 mV with a double exponential curve, (2) looked for residuals of the fit &gt;2 standard deviations of the pre-stimulus baseline in order to identify SACs that potentially made autapses, and (3) applied criteria used to find connected SAC pairs. We could not make reliable measurements of autapses in SACs from retinas younger than P21 due to large inward calcium currents evoked by depolarization. These currents were also apparent at even younger ages (P8) and may therefore be residually present from the ages at which SACs initiate and propagate retinal waves (see ‘Discussion’).</p><p>In loose patch spike recordings, action potentials were detected and analyzed using a simple thresholding criterion in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA).

We agree that it remains unproven for SACs, but that is not for lack of effort. First, as part of his work on the preceding paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lefebvre et al., 2012</xref>), Dimitar applied to SACs the “split single cell RT-PCR” protocols that Yagi and colleagues had devised to analyze Pcdhg expression in Purkinje cells (Esumi, Nature Genetics, 2005; Kaneko et al., JBC, 2006). He detected Pcdhg expression in groups of ∼10 cells but was unable to obtain consistent results from single cells. Although we cannot rule out ineptitude as a factor, we believe a major problem is that the volume of SAC is ∼3% that of Purkinje cells, so copy number is correspondingly decreased. Second, in experiments done for another purpose, we recently profiled 96 isolated SACs using a MALBAC protocol (Chapman, PLoS One, 2015). We detected 18 of the 22 Pcdhgs. Each was expressed by a subset of the 96 cells, ranging from 3 to 26 with an average of around 15. This is consistent with the combinatorial expression that Yagi showed in Purkinje cells and that we propose for SACs. At face value, we could conclude that around 3 isoforms were expressed per cell (15x22/96). However, we do not feel comfortable reporting these data in a formal way because we have no way of knowing whether apparently negative cells represent true negatives or insufficient capture efficiency or sequencing depth. The beauty of Yagi's method is that the “split cell” strategy provided assurance on this point – but as I already said, we were unable to get this method to work on SACs. Finally, as the reviewer points out, we recently used Drop-Seq to obtain transcriptomic data from around 33,000 unsorted retinal cells, of which 289 were identifiable as SACs (Macosko, Cell, 2015). Here Pcdhg detection was hampered by the low sequence depth and the fact that reads were heavily biased to the 3' end, which is shared by all of the Pcdhgs. (That is, only reads from the 5' half of the transcript are diagnostic.) In fact, we detected almost no Pcdhgs in SACs. Pcdhbs (which have unique 3’ ends) were detected, consistent with the 3’ bias. In short, we have worked hard to test the idea of sparse, combinatorial expression of Pcdhgs in SACs and although the data we have obtained are consistent with this model, we are unable to make any definitive statement at this time.</p></body></sub-article></article>
