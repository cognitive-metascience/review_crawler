Here, we show the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, which are required for memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, are sleep-promoting inhibitory neurons. DPMs increase sleep via release of GABA onto wake-promoting mushroom body (MB) α'/β' neurons. Functional imaging demonstrates that DPM activation evokes robust increases in chloride in MB neurons, but is unable to cause detectable increases in calcium or cAMP. Downregulation of α'/β' GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub>R3 receptors results in sleep loss, suggesting these receptors are the sleep-relevant targets of DPM-mediated inhibition. Regulation of sleep by neurons necessary for consolidation suggests that these brain processes may be functionally interrelated via their shared anatomy. These findings have important implications for the mechanistic relationship between sleep and memory consolidation, arguing for a significant role of inhibitory neurotransmission in regulating these processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03868.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03868.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03868.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Sleep affects memory: if you do not sleep well after a learning task, chances are you will not be able to recall whatever you tried to learn earlier. This is seen in almost all animals ranging from the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila,</italic> to mice and humans. However, the precise details of how memory and sleep are connected remain unclear.</p><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> is an excellent model for teasing out the connections between memory and sleep. This is because its brain has a simple and well-studied memory region that contains a pair of nerve cells called the dorsal paired medial neurons. These neurons enable memories to be stored for the long term. Here, Haynes et al. asked whether these neurons can also affect sleep, and if so, how.</p><p>The experiments show that the dorsal paired medial neurons promote sleep in fruit flies. The neurons release a signaling molecule called GABA, which is detected by a type of neighboring ‘mushroom body’ neuron that usually promotes wakefulness. This leads to increases in the levels of chloride ions in the mushroom body neurons, but no change in the levels of calcium ions and a molecule called cAMP, which indicates that GABA inhibits these cells. Flies that have lower levels of two receptor proteins that detect GABA sleep less than normal flies.</p><p>Haynes et al.'s findings suggest that dorsal paired medial neurons deactivate their neighbors to promote sleep in fruit flies. This result was unexpected because current models of memory formation propose that dorsal paired medial neurons can activate the mushroom body neurons. Understanding how inhibiting mushroom body neurons influences memory will require researchers to reassess these models.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03868.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03868.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>learning and memory</kwd><kwd>circuit</kwd><kwd>sleep</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 MH067284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Griffith</surname><given-names>Leslie C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32 NS045713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Christmann</surname><given-names>Bethany L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dorsal paired medial neurons, which are required for memory consolidation, promote sleep by inhibiting the excitation of mushroom body neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accumulating evidence suggests that sleep plays a role in promoting the consolidation of memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stickgold, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Diekelmann and Born, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mednick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>). Sleep deprivation following an associative learning task impairs consolidated memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, rodents, and humans whereas sleep immediately after a learning task actually improves consolidated memory across the same broad range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ganguly-Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Donlea et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rasch and Born, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diekelmann, 2014</xref>). It is not, however, clear exactly how sleep promotes memory consolidation: it may simply be a permissive state generated by other brain regions that prevents sensory interference with memory circuits, or alternatively the memory circuitry itself may actively participate in sleep promotion as an integral aspect of the consolidation process. To begin to probe these issues, we have investigated the role of the dorsal paired medial (DPM) neurons, which are critical to memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, in the regulation of sleep.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> learning and memory circuitry has been well characterized and provides an excellent system in which to study cellular interactions between sleep and memory consolidation. The mushroom bodies (MBs) are a set of ca. 5000 neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, organized into five distinct lobular neuropils, which are required for odor memory acquisition, consolidation, and retrieval. Although the anatomy involved in memory consolidation in mammals is highly complex and distributed, in the fly it is quite compact: the DPM neurons, a single pair of neurons innervating all of the MB lobes, are the mediators of consolidation for odor memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Waddell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keene et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>). Like mammals, <italic>Drosophila</italic> consolidates memories at the systems level. Critical memory information is transferred from short-term storage in neurons required for initial acquisition to anatomically and physiologically distinct long-term storage sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dubnau and Chiang, 2013</xref>). DPM neurons, along with the α’/β’ subset of MB neurons, are required for early phases of this memory information transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keene et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>).</p><p>The MB memory circuit has also been implicated in the regulation of sleep by a number of studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). Loss of MB 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>) as well as alterations in MB PKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>) and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>) have been shown to affect sleep in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in a lobe-specific manner. Mutation of the <italic>amnesiac (amn)</italic> gene, which encodes a putative neuropeptide expressed in DPM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Waddell et al., 2000</xref>), results in fragmented sleep and impaired sleep rebound following deprivation, suggesting a role for these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2008</xref>). While the molecular and cellular requirements for sleep and memory clearly overlap, whether the circuit that regulates sleep is identical to that required for memory is not clear and this is a question that bears directly on the functional interrelationship between sleep and memory consolidation.</p><p>The primary question addressed in this study is the role of the DPM neurons and their outputs in regulation of sleep. The DPM contribution to memory consolidation had been suggested to occur due to the release of acetylcholine (ACh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keene et al., 2004</xref>) and the product of the <italic>amn</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Waddell et al., 2000</xref>) enhancing MB potentiation via an excitatory feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>) similar to what has been proposed to occur in the mammalian hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hebb, 1949</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hopfield, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amit, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Treves and Rolls, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battaglia and Treves, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lisman, 1999</xref>). Recently, however, DPM release of serotonin (5HT) has been shown to promote anesthesia resistant memory, a form of consolidated memory, by acting on Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors in the α/β lobes of the MBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). The involvement of a potentially inhibitory receptor, 5HT<sub>1A</sub>, in consolidation suggests that a simple positive feedback model for consolidation is unlikely to be completely correct, and it highlights the fact that there is currently no information on the functional nature of the synapses between DPM neurons and MBs. An understanding of this synapse is critical for elucidating DPM's role in sleep. To address this aspect of DPM function, we have investigated the nature of their connection to the MBs.</p><p>Here, we show that the DPM neurons promote sleep via the release of 5HT and the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA. We find that DPM activation results in inhibitory chloride influx into post-synaptic MB neurons and find no evidence that DPM neuron activation has an excitatory effect on post-synaptic MB neurons. We suggest a model in which post-synaptic MB α’/β’ neurons are wake-promoting, and inhibition by DPM neuron GABA and 5HT release during memory consolidation results in increased sleep. These findings provide new insight into the functional relationship between sleep and memory consolidation, and suggest an important role for inhibitory neurotransmission in regulating these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DPM activity promotes sleep</title><p>In order to determine whether DPMs play a role in regulating sleep, we acutely activated these neurons by driving the warmth-sensitive cation channel, dTrpA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hamada et al., 2008</xref>) with <italic>NP2721-GAL4</italic>, a driver with relatively specific and strong DPM expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). A temperature shift at ZT0 from 22°C, a temperature at which dTrpA1 is inactive, to 31°C, where it is open and can depolarize DPMs, produced an immediate and dramatic increase in sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). dTrpA1 activation with a weaker, but even more specific DPM driver line, <italic>VT64246-GAL4</italic>, also resulted in immediate and significant increases in sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,C</xref>) indicating the effect is due to activation of DPM neurons and not other neurons in the <italic>NP2721-GAL4</italic> expression pattern. Activating DPMs with dTrpA1 did not alter the level of locomotor activity during waking periods (light period of first day: P<sub>GAL4</sub> = 0.57, P<sub>UAS</sub>&lt;0.0001 and for the dark period of first day: P<sub>GAL4</sub> = 0.5, P<sub>UAS</sub> = 0.13), suggesting that this treatment does not cause locomotor impairment. Additionally, video recordings at 0-2 min and &gt;2 hr after DPM activation at 31–32°C show that flies are immediately arousable by gentle tapping and have normal geotaxis and locomotion, consistent with DPM activation inducing a sleep state rather than paralysis or locomotor dysfunction (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03868.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>DPM activity and synaptic release are sleep promoting in a cell-autonomous manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flies exhibit large gains in sleep when DPM neurons are activated with dTrpA1 at 31°C (<italic>w-; NP2721-GAL4/ UAS-dTrpA1-II</italic>).

The negative sleep rebound after release is consistent with the presence of strong compensatory homeostatic mechanisms counteracting excessive sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Shang et al., 2013</xref>) and/or excessive DPM activity. Since DPM neurons are normally activated in the first 0–3 hr following training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cervantes-Sandoval and Davis, 2012</xref>), it is unlikely that these neurons would ever naturally exhibit such high levels of activity for the length of time we have imposed artificially. The immediate increase in sleep upon dTrpA1 activation is most likely to be indicative of normal DPM function. The idea that DPMs can act acutely is in agreement with the literature that shows there is a temporally circumscribed window during which they are required for consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keene et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>) and with the finding that a short period (45 min) of TrpM8 activation of DPM neurons following a learning task rescues age-induced memory impairment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tonoki and Davis, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Since activation of DPM neurons acutely induces sleep in flies, we wanted to determine if DPM activity also played a role in the maintenance of baseline sleep. In order to assess this, we used the <italic>NP2721-GAL4</italic> line to drive expression of a temperature-sensitive, dominant negative Dynamin, Shibire<sup>ts</sup> (Shi<sup>ts</sup>) to block vesicle recycling in DPMs. Following a shift at ZT0 from the permissive temperature of 18°C, to the restrictive temperature of 31°C, flies showed a small but significant decrease in levels of nighttime sleep relative to the baseline sleep of each genotype at 18°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B1</xref>). Because the temperature shift protocol induced changes in the baseline nighttime sleep of control flies (compare ‘baseline’ and ‘recovery’ days in panel B1) we asked if the ability of DPM inhibition to decrease nighttime sleep was independent of baseline by doing a second round of temperature shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2</xref>). We found that DPM inhibition decreased sleep regardless of the starting baseline. We obtained a similar result using another DPM line, <italic>C316-GAL4</italic> to drive Shi<sup>ts</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, when the weaker, but cleaner, <italic>VT64246-GAL4</italic> driver line was used with the temperature-sensitive repressor, <italic>Tubulin-GAL80</italic><sup><italic>ts</italic></sup>, to produce acute expression of the hyperpolarizing potassium channel Kir2.1 in DPM neurons nighttime sleep was also reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,D</xref>).</p><p>These data demonstrate that sleep loss after inhibition of DPM activity is both cell-specific and independent of the particular method used to suppress DPM activity. The limitation of the DPM loss-of-function phenotype to nighttime sleep implies there is a baseline function of DPM activity that occurs even in isolated animals in a relatively stimulus-poor environment, but the small magnitude of these changes suggests that DPMs are not the major driver of baseline sleep. The DPM-dependent gain-of-function experiments with dTrpA1, however, indicate that significant changes in both nighttime and daytime sleep can be produced with acute activation of DPM neurons, as might perhaps naturally occur secondary to some type of experience.</p><p>The DPM neurons are coupled via gap junctions to second pair of neurons innervating the MB, the anterior paired lateral (APL) neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). It was possible that sleep gains resulting from dTrpA1-mediated activation of DPMs were not due to neurotransmitter release from DPMs themselves, but instead were a secondary result of gap–junction coupled APL activation and neurotransmitter release. In order to distinguish between these possibilities, we coexpressed dTrpA1 and the temperature-sensitive Dynamin mutant, Shi<sup>ts</sup>, in DPM neurons. Since Shi<sup>ts</sup> protein and mRNA are unlikely to pass through gap junctions, DPM-Shi<sup>ts</sup> expression should prevent neurotransmitter release in a cell-autonomous manner from DPM, but not affect APL neurons. Thus, if dTrpA1-mediated sleep gains are the result of DPM, but not APL neurotransmitter release, they should be blocked by the coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPMs at high temperature. Conversely, if APL neurotransmitter release is responsible for sleep gains resulting from DPM activation, DPM expression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> should have no effect on dTrpA1-evoked sleep. We found that coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> completely blocked activity-induced sleep gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This was not due to dilution of GAL4-mediated expression since the coexpression of a neutral second UAS transgene (UAS-GCaMP6) did not block dTrpA1-stimulated sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). This suggests that sleep from dTrpA1-mediated DPM activation is the result of release of neurotransmitter from DPMs, not APLs.</p><p>Thus, we find that DPMs are capable of acutely promoting sleep and have an additional role in mediating baseline sleep during the night in stimulus-poor conditions (single flies in sleep tubes). How this function of DPMs is regulated is unknown. Given their role in memory consolidation, however, it is likely DPMs are chiefly active in acute sleep regulation when they are recruited to promote sleep following stimulus-rich experiences such as learning.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>α'/β’ activity promotes wakefulness</title><p>MB α’/β’ neurons are thought to be a key postsynaptic target of DPM neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Keene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krashes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pitman et al., 2011</xref>). Both DPM and α’/β’ activity are required during the memory consolidation period 0–3 hr after training for the storage of subsequent 24 hr long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Krashes and Waddell, 2008</xref>). Recently, multiple groups have posited that <italic>Drosophila</italic> experiences a form of systems consolidation, similar to that of mammals, in which memories are transferred from a set of neurons serving as a short-term storage site (e.g., the hippocampus in mammals, and γ and α’/β’ lobes in flies) to a different set of neurons which store the memory in a more stable long-term state (e.g., the cortex in mammals, α/β lobes and MB output neurons in flies) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dubnau and Chiang, 2013</xref>). Since systems consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires DPM and α’/β’ activity and is known to be promoted by sleep in other organisms, we reasoned that α’/β’ activity may also play a role in promoting sleep. While it has been shown previously that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MB can promote sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pitman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yi et al., 2013</xref>), a specific role for the α’/β’ lobes has not been reported.</p><p>To address this issue, we acutely activated these neurons with an MB-restricted version of the α’/β’ driver line <italic>c305a-GAL4</italic> and the warmth-sensitive cation channel, dTrpA1. If DPM neurons act to excite α’/β’, as postulated by models of consolidation, we would expect this manipulation to increase sleep. Instead, we see a strong decrease in nighttime sleep. This α’/β’–dependent nighttime sleep loss remained stable throughout 48 hr of dTrpA1 activation and was accompanied by increasing daytime sleep loss which continued even after release from dTrpA1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). This unusual pattern exactly matches the phenotype seen in flies expressing Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPM neurons. Thus, DPM and α’/β’ activity have opposing roles in the regulation of sleep: DPM activity promotes sleep whereas α’/β’ activity is wake-promoting. These data suggest that DPM neurons may inhibit MB neurons.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03868.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MB α’β’ neuron activity promotes wakefulness.</title><p>The α’β’ <italic>c305a-GAL4</italic> driver line was crossed to <italic>UAS-dTrpA1-II</italic> (with <italic>c305a</italic> expression restricted to the MB) to determine effects on sleep of α’β’ activation.

We also did a separate set of experiments using dTrpA1 and a temperature step to activate DPM neurons, but failed to see any MB calcium responses (data not shown).</p><p>Although we demonstrated that P2X2 is capable of activating DPM neurons and causing vesicle fusion, we needed to rule out the possibility that MBs were simply incapable of responding to excitatory synaptic inputs. We first examined the response of the MBs to bath-applied carbachol (CCh), a cholinergic agonist. Tetrodotoxin (TTX) was present to block action potentials so that we could isolate direct effects on MBs. We observed robust increases in calcium and cAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that MB neurons are capable of responding to ACh in an excitatory manner.</p><p>To show that MBs could respond to activation of upstream stimulatory neurons using the P2X2 technique, we expressed P2X2 receptors in the PAM cluster of dopaminergic neurons using <italic>R58E02-lexA</italic> and EPAC in the MBs using <italic>MB247-GAL4</italic>. Previous reports have demonstrated that the PAM cluster of dopamine neurons signals to the MBs by activation of Gα<sub>s</sub>-coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Liu et al., 2012</xref>).

Small molecules including neurotransmitters can pass through gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vaney et al., 1998</xref>) and, for some subtypes of mammalian connexins, even RNAi fragments can pass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Valiunas et al., 2005</xref>). This raised the possibility that DPM sleep phenotypes could be dependent on APL-synthesized GABA and that manipulation of VGAT in DPMs might be indirectly acting by inhibition of APL GABA packaging. In order to assess this, we expressed <italic>VGAT-RNAi</italic> using three different APL <italic>GAL4</italic> lines: <italic>GH146, NP5288, NP2631</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We never saw sleep loss with <italic>NP2631-GAL4</italic>. With <italic>GH146</italic>- and <italic>NP5288-GAL4</italic>, we saw weak nighttime sleep loss. When it was observed, nighttime sleep loss due to APL-driven expression of VGAT-RNAi was generally accompanied by an increase in activity while awake indicating an effect on locomotion; this is never seen with VGAT-RNAi in DPMs. Thus while APL GABA may be weakly sleep-promoting, its effects are qualitatively and quantitatively distinct from GABA released from DPMs. This also implies that the contribution of APLs to phenotypes seen after DPM activation or hyperpolarization is likely to be minimal. Along these lines it is also important to note that driving Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPMs reduces baseline sleep and completely blocks dTrpA1-induced sleep gains. These manipulations, using DPM-expressed Shi<sup>ts</sup>, would not be expected to influence APL activity in any way, again supporting the idea that DPMs promote sleep in a distinct and cell-autonomous manner.</p><p>While there are two known types of GABAergic neurons innervating the MB, DPMs are likely the sole source of MB lobe 5HT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). MB expression of inhibitory, Gα<sub>i</sub>-coupled 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors are necessary for anesthesia-resistant memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lee et al., 2011</xref>), and are also known to promote sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Yuan et al., 2006</xref>). 5HT from DPMs, however, has not actually been shown to promote sleep. Knockdown of 5HT synthesis in DPM neurons with RNAi targeted against tryptophan hydroxylase (Trh) using the most strongly expressing DPM line, <italic>c316-GAL4</italic>, results in a significant loss of nighttime sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). This nighttime sleep loss is also apparent, but milder, with <italic>Trh-RNAi</italic> being driven by the somewhat weaker <italic>NP2721-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). No difference is seen in nighttime activity during waking periods vs controls (for <italic>c316-GAL4</italic> with <italic>Trh-RNAi</italic> P<sub>GAL4</sub> = 0.09, P<sub>UAS</sub> = 0.17) indicating the sleep loss is not an artifact of hyperactivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DPM GABA acts on α’/β’ lobes to promote sleep</title><p>GCaMP, EPAC and Arclight experiments demonstrate a lack of excitatory transmission from DPM neurons to the MBs and SuperClomeleon experiments demonstrate that the DPMs are capable of inhibiting MB neurons. The wake-promoting phenotype of MB α’/β’ neurons as well as a shared temporal role in memory consolidation suggest these neurons could be the targets of sleep-promoting DPM GABA release. In order to test this possibility, we expressed RNAi against <italic>Drosophila</italic> GABA receptors in MB α’/β’ neurons. It has previously been shown that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ionotropic GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor, Rdl, is highly expressed in all lobes of the MBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2007</xref>). Consistent with the phenotype of DPM VGAT knockdown, we observe decreased nighttime sleep with knockdown of either Rdl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), or GABA<sub>B</sub>-R3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) in MB α’/β’ neurons. In both cases sleep loss is the result of a decrease in the duration of nighttime sleep episodes. Knockdown of Rdl results in less total sleep loss since an increase in the total number of nighttime sleep episodes partially compensates for the decrease in mean sleep episode duration. Importantly, concurrent expression of the <italic>MB-GAL80</italic> transgene, which blocks GAL4-mediated expression of receptor RNAis, greatly suppresses sleep loss and fragmentation phenotypes showing that the effects are specific to the MB α’/β’ lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, experiments to determine the lobe-specific role of 5HT<sub>1A</sub> receptors suggest that 5HT acts generally in the MB, not just on the α’/β’ lobes (data not shown), suggesting that these two transmitters may play somewhat different roles at the circuit level in sleep and memory consolidation.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03868.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>MB α’β’ GABA receptors promote nighttime sleep.</title><p><italic>c305a-GAL4</italic> was used to drive expression of <italic>Rdl-RNAi</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) or <italic>GABA</italic><sub><italic>BR3</italic></sub><italic>-RNAi</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) in the α’β’ neurons.

The specific involvement of neurons required for memory consolidation (and their memory-relevant post-synaptic targets) in the regulation of sleep suggests that generation of sleep by activation of learning circuits is an intrinsic property of the circuit, not an extrinsically imposed phenomenon. Further, our finding that the memory-consolidation specific DPM neurons are inhibitory suggests that inhibitory neurotransmitters may play an as-of-yet uncharacterized role in memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of DPM vs APL neurons in regulation of sleep</title><p>Previous studies on the role of GABA in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> learning circuit have focused on the role of the APLs, a pair of GABAergic neurons which densely innervate the MBs and are coupled to DPMs by gap junctions. APL GABA has been shown to inhibit acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Davis, 2009</xref>), perhaps by acting at the level of olfactory coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). APLs have also been shown to be critical for a labile component of anesthesia-sensitive intermediate-term memory but not for consolidation to long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pitman et al., 2011</xref>). Because of the gap junction coupling, it was formally possible that GABA found in DPMs could be coming from APLs and that sleep loss due to DPM VGAT-RNAi expression was the result of reductions in APL VGAT levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Vaney et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Valiunas et al., 2005</xref>). It was also possible that phenotypes seen after manipulation of DPM electrical activity were secondary to changes in APL activity. However, a number of lines of evidence suggest that DPM neurons are intrinsically GABAergic and sleep-promoting independent of APLs. First, we find that DPMs stain positively for the GABAergic markers Gad1 and VGAT, meaning that DPMs intrinsically possess the ability to synthesize and release GABA. Second, we find that direct expression of <italic>VGAT-RNAi</italic> in APL neurons has a relatively minor effect on sleep as compared to phenotypes seen with expression in DPMs, indicating that GABA endogenous to DPMs is a more significant regulator of sleep than GABA from APLs. Third, we find that sleep loss due to VGAT-RNAi expression in APLs, when it is seen, is accompanied by increases in nighttime activity while awake, which is never seen with DPM-driven VGAT-RNAi expression. This indicates that although APL GABA may promote sleep in its own right, the APL VGAT-RNAi sleep loss phenotype is distinct from that of DPMs. Fourth, expression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> in DPMs, a manipulation that should have no effect on APL activity since it does not alter the electrical properties of DPMs, results in the same nighttime sleep loss as DPM-driven <italic>VGAT-RNAi</italic> and Kir2.1. Fifth, coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> along with dTrpA1 in DPMs, a manipulation that should not affect APL neurotransmitter release, results in a complete blockade of activation-induced sleep gains. The most parsimonious explanation for all of these data is that the relevant effect of these manipulations is a change in transmitter release specifically from DPMs and that this bidirectionally modulates sleep. Thus, while it remains possible that APL neurons are modestly sleep-promoting in their own right, we find strong evidence for an independent and significant role in regulation of sleep by DPM neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Evidence for DPM inhibition, but not excitation of α’/β’ lobes</title><p>Our finding that DPM neuron activation has an inhibitory effect on post-synaptic MB neurons is in apparent disagreement with models of memory consolidation that posit recurrent excitatory feedback between DPM and α’/β’ neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>). Our observations using SuperClomeleon demonstrate that DPMs evoke a chloride increase in MB neurons, but we did not see decreases in calcium, membrane voltage or cAMP after DPM activation using fluorescent sensors specific for those cellular parameters. This failure is not surprising for two reasons. First, in order to see an inhibitory response it is likely that there has to be some activity or tone in the system. In cases where MB inhibition has been seen with GCaMP it is always in context of a temporally controlled acute activation of the system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lei et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Masuda-Nakagawa et al., 2014</xref>). Second, the nature of our DPM activation (bath application of ATP) would make it difficult to see small inhibitory changes over noise in averaged data since our activation of cells is not cleanly time-locked due to differences in diffusion of ATP into the brain between experiments. This is particularly critical with a sensor like Arclight where the expected hyperpolarization induced by inhibition might only be a few millivolts as opposed to 10–40 mV for depolarization by an action potential.</p><p>An additional critical test of the sign of this synapse is to ask if there is evidence of inhibition in the functional output of the circuit. Our finding that DPM and α’/β’ activity have opposite roles in the regulation of sleep to the extent that suppression of DPMs with either Shi<sup>ts</sup> or Kir2.1 almost exactly phenocopies the increasing levels of nighttime sleep loss that results from dTrpA1 activation of α’/β’ strongly suggests an inhibitory connection. Further, we find that decreases in DPM VGAT result in similar nighttime sleep loss phenotypes as α’/β’ Rdl or GABA<sub>B</sub>R3 knockdown. Thus, suppression of DPM synaptic release (Shi<sup>ts</sup>), DPM electrical activity (Kir2.1) and DPM GABA release (<italic>VGAT-RNAi</italic>) all result in nighttime sleep loss phenotypes nearly identical to dTrpA1 activation of α’/β’ or loss of α’/β’ GABA receptors. All of these results are consistent with a model in which DPMs act to inhibit α’/β’ neurons by release of GABA.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Inhibition of MBs and sleep</title><p>MBs are a sensory integration center in the insect brain. They have been shown, using many different behavioral paradigms, to be critical nodes for attention and arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Xi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">van Swinderen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chow et al., 2011</xref>). Paying attention to the right features of one's environment, whether naively or as a learned response, has high survival value. The fact that MBs are important sites of plasticity is likely related to this role in attention. The linkage of attention and arousal to MB output is consistent with our finding that suppression of arousal-promoting MB subsets increases sleep.</p><p>The involvement of DPMs, a neuron type previously believed to function exclusively as a regulator of memory consolidation, in control of sleep raises several interesting questions. First, are DPMs the only sleep-inducing regulators of MB activity? This seems unlikely, since memory consolidation is but one function of the MBs and there are other behavioral situations in which an animal might want to modulate MB-regulated arousal such as during courtship/aggressive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baier et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Sakai and Kitamoto, 2006</xref>), or more generally during the integration of internal and external cues and decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Neckameyer and Matsuo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Krashes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Donlea et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bracker et al., 2013</xref>). A second question is whether DPMs might also have a role in regulating MB output in contexts other than during memory storage. Our data suggest a role for DPMs in maintaining basal levels of nighttime sleep indicating that they may be responsive to other types of input. An understanding of the regulation of DPMs and their in vivo activity patterns will be required to gain insight into these issues.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Inhibition in memory consolidation</title><p>A potential role for GABA-mediated inhibition in memory consolidation is novel. Long-term memory storage in mammals is believed to involve a transfer of information from one brain region to another. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is associated with sequential potentiation of activity in specific MB neuropils. Elegant studies using conditional inhibition of transmitter release have provided a temporal ordering of transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Keene and Waddell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Dubnau and Chiang, 2013</xref>) leading to the idea that the role of DPM neurons is to facilitate the movement of memory from α’/β’ lobes, one initial site of memory storage, to a more permanent home in α/β lobes and perhaps other neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Given the clear requirements for molecular pathways associated with synaptic potentiation, and the need for synaptic transmission from both DPMs and α’/β’ neurons after acquisition, the view that information transfer involves a positive feedback loop between these cell types makes sense.</p><p>The data presented here, however, strongly suggest that the DPM neurons are inhibitory. It is clear that potentiated output from α’/β’ neurons is required for consolidation, so how could their inhibition facilitate this process? Our findings suggest DPMs are unlikely to participate directly in the excitatory arm of a recurrent feedback loop. However, both models and physiological data related to mammalian cortical/hippocampal recurrent feedback circuits involved in the maintenance of stable memory states also require the presence of inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsaki and Chrobak, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hasselmo et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battaglia and Treves, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chance and Abbott, 2000</xref>). Interestingly, the coordination of excitatory activity amongst diverse functional sub-circuits in the mammalian hippocampus and neocortex is regulated by the activity of broadly-projecting, gap-junction coupled inhibitory neurons/networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Freund and Antal, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gibson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tamas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baude et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jinno et al., 2007</xref>) which have been proposed to potentially control the timing of memory replay events during sleep/memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Viney et al., 2013</xref>). The DPM-APL network may represent an analogous set of neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> which function to coordinate the temporal stabilization, gating and transfer of different memory stages between different sub-circuits within the MBs. While APL neurons have been shown to broadly inhibit recurrent feedback from all MB Kenyon cells to all MB Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lin et al., 2014</xref>), it has been proposed that DPMs may impose a directionality on internal MB feedback which would allow for memory transfer and consolidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Yu et al., 2005</xref>). Although, inhibition was not previously considered for such a role, it may be capable of coordinating the timing of prime lobe output in a way that is not possible via excitation. Thus, our data are not inconsistent with the presence of an excitatory recurrent feedback loop within the MB α’/β’ lobes, but rather provide information that constrains future models in a new way and suggests new possibilities for the role of DPMs that may not have been considered previously.</p><p>What kind of role could inhibitory neurons play? While α’/β’ neurons need to be active during acquisition, DPMs do not and this temporal difference suggests some testable possibilities for the role of DPM-mediated inhibition in consolidation. One idea is that temporally-regulated inhibition of potentiated α’/β’ output could serve as a way of sharpening the transition of memory from one neuropil to another by suppressing activity in the brain area from which information has already been transferred. A second possibility is that a period of inhibition during consolidation is a way of preventing new, potentially interfering, information from being encoded in α’/β’ before the first memory is transferred to α/β. A third possibility is that the function of inhibition is actually to provide precisely timed rebound excitation to α’/β’. This would not have been seen in our imaging experiments due to the slow kinetics of ATP washout, but could actually result in feedback excitation of MB neurons.</p><p>All of these models imply that there is a very tight temporal ordering of activity within the circuit, with DPM neurons suppressing α’/β’ neuron activity in a narrow window either before or after their output function has been completed. It is important to note that none of these ideas is inconsistent with the demonstrated requirement for α’/β’ activity during the post-training consolidation period. GABA- and 5HT-mediated inhibition is not equivalent to the action of Shi<sup>ts</sup>, which completely shuts off neurotransmission. Inhibition is often modulatory rather than switch-like and can even be compartment-specific—for example, it could serve to alter the ratio of activity in α’/β’ to that in α/β. More precise mapping of the connectivity and branch-specific activity in the MB neuropil will be required to develop a more detailed model.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Coupling sleep and memory consolidation at the cellular level</title><p>Although investigators have speculated that memory consolidation and sleep interact, an actual understanding of how they are related at the circuit level has been elusive.

For the images presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, Intensity Correlation Analysis (ICA) was also performed to assess spatial colocalization of staining between channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2004</xref>). Rather than only comparing visible overlap of the absolute fluorescence intensity in each channel (red plus green equals yellow), which is subject to viewer bias and differences in staining intensity between channels, this method determines whether changes in staining intensity covary or are correlated between channels. This provides an objective and spatially specific representation of colocalization. ICA analysis generates a correlation/colocalization value for each pixel defined by the Product of the Differences from the Mean (PDM) that is, PDM= (red intensity- mean red intensity) × (green intensity – mean green intensity). PDM values for each pixel can then be visualized as an image showing positive intensity correlation (PDM&gt;0) and negative intensity correlation (PDM&lt;0). Relative PDM value scales are shown on each figure generated from ICA analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Functional fluorescence imaging</title><p>Adult hemolymph-like saline (AHL) consisting of (in mM) 108 NaCl, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 8.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>-H<sub>2</sub>O, 5 trehalose, 10 sucrose, 5 HEPES; pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang, 2003</xref>) was used to bathe the brain, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shang et al., 2011</xref>). For SuperClomeleon experiments, the AHL pH was increased to 7.7 to optimize response magnitude. Test compounds adenosine 5′-triphosphate magnesium salt (ATP), carbamoylcholine chloride (CCh), picrotoxin (PTX), and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were purchased from Sigma–Aldrich (St Louis, MO), serotonin hydrochloride (5HT) was purchased from Tocris Bioscience (Minneapolis, MN), and tetrodotoxin (TTX) was purchased from Abcam Biochemicals (Cambridge, England). ATP, CCh, and TTX were dissolved in milliQ water and frozen as aliquot stocks, which were then prepared for experiments by dilution in AHL. PTX was dissolved and frozen in DMSO aliquots, which were diluted in AHL for experiments. All solutions used in experiments with PTX were prepared with the same percentage of DMSO. GABA and 5HT were dissolved directly in AHL immediately prior to the experiment, and 5HT was kept in light-shielded containers to prevent degradation.</p><p>Imaging experiments were performed using a naked brain preparation. Flies were anesthetized on ice, and brains were dissected into cool AHL. Dissected brains were then pinned to a layer of Sylgard (Dow Corning, Midland, MI) silicone under a small bath of AHL contained within a recording/perfusion chamber (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT). Brains expressing GCaMP3.0, Arclight, and SpH were allowed to settle for 5 min after dissection to reduce movement. These brains were then exposed to fluorescent light for approximately 30 s before imaging to allow for baseline fluorescence stabilization, while brains expressing the FRET sensors Epac1-camps or SuperClomeleon were exposed an extra 5 min to minimize differences in photobleaching rates between the CFP and YFP fluorophores, as YFP has been described to photobleach more slowly than CFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shafer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pirez et al., 2013</xref>). Perfusion flow was established over the brain with a gravity-fed ValveLink perfusion system (Automate Scientific, Berkeley, CA). ATP, CCh, GABA, or 5HT were delivered by switching perfusion flow from the main AHL line to another channel containing diluted compound after 30 s of baseline recording for desired durations followed by a return to AHL flow. To control for the effects of switching channels, a vehicle control trial was performed by switching to another line containing AHL for the same duration as the experimental trial.</p><p>Imaging was performed using an Olympus BX51WI fluorescence microscope (Olympus, Center Valley, PA) under an Olympus x40 (0.80W, LUMPlanFl) or x60 (0.90W, LUMPlanFI) water-immersion objective, and all recordings were captured using a charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu ORCA C472-80-12AG). For GCaMP3.0, Arclight, and SpH imaging, we used the following filter set (Chroma Technology, Bellows Falls, VT): excitation, HQ470/x40; dichroic, Q495LP; emission, HQ525/50m. For EPAC and SuperClomeleon, a 86002v1 JP4 (436; Chroma Technology) excitation filter was used, and emitted light from the CFP and YFP flurophores was separated using a splitter (Photometrics DV<sup>2</sup> column) with the emissions filters D480/30m and D535/40m (Photometrics, Tucson, AZ), which allowed for simultaneous collection from both fluorescence channels. Frames were captured at 2 Hz with 4× binning for either 2 min or 4 min using <italic>µ</italic>Manager acquisition software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>). Neutral density filters (Chroma Technology) were used for all experiments to reduce light intensity to limit photobleaching.</p><p>Although there are tools for temporally controlled activation such as dTrpA1 or Channelrhodopsin (ChR2) that are well-characterized, we utilized P2X2 receptors for the majority of our experiments. Activation wavelengths for ChR2 overlap with those of many fluorescent sensors such as GCaMP and EPAC, so ChR2 could not be used in this circuit due to the close proximity of the cells and processes. Applying heat to activate dTrpA1 causes changes in refractive index, which disrupt focus, necessitating manual focus correction in the cases where we used this technique.</p><p>Regions of interest (ROIs) were selected within the horizontal or vertical lobes of the MBs or, in the case of DPM neurons, over the horizontal projections to the MBs. Figures depict responses in horizontal lobes or projections; however, similar results were observed in the vertical lobes when noted in the figure captions. For recordings using GCaMP3.0, Arclight, and SpH, ROIs were analyzed using custom software developed in ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref> and National Institute of Health, Bethesda, MD). Briefly, the percent change in fluorescence over time was calculated using the following formula: ΔF/F = (F<sub>n</sub> – F<sub>0</sub>)/F<sub>0</sub> × 100%, where F<sub>n</sub> is the fluorescence at time point n, and F<sub>0</sub> is the fluorescence at time 0. For GCaMP3.0 and SpH, maximum fluorescence change values were determined as the maximum percentage change observed for each trace over the entire duration of each imaging experiment. For Arclight, because increases in voltage are represented as decreases in fluorescence, maximum fluorescence change values were determined as the minimum percentage change. Maximum values for each group were then averaged to calculate the mean maximum change from baseline.</p><p>For recordings using EPAC or SuperClomeleon, ROIs were analyzed using custom software developed in MATLAB (The MathWorks, Natick, MA). This analysis package is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source Code 1</xref>. Briefly, identical ROIs were selected from both the CFP and YFP emissions channels, and the fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) signal (YFP/CFP ratio) was calculated for each time point and normalized to the ratio of the first time point. The relative cAMP changes were determined by plotting the normalized CFP/YFP ratio (percentage) over time. As with GCaMP3.0 and SpH, the average maximum percent change values were determined as the mean maximum values for each group.</p><p>Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB (The MathWorks). A Kruskal–Wallis one-way ANOVA was used to determine statistical significance between the experimental group and the two negative controls. In cases in which there was significance in the ANOVA, a Mann–Whitney U test (also known as Wilcoxon rank-sum test) was used to determine the significance between the experimental group and each negative control. In all figures only the most conservative/numerically greatest p value is reported. Results are expressed as means <underline>+</underline> standard error of the mean (SEM).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH grants R01 MH067284 (to LCG) and F31 NS086764 (to BLC).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K. VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), Graeme Davis (Reviewing editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Amita Sehgal, has agreed to reveal her identity.</p><p>Three reviewers have read and discussed your manuscript in detail. All are well-established investigators with expertise in this area of research. All agree that this is an interesting and important area of research and that your manuscript has the potential to make a significant advance that would appeal to the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. In general, there is agreement that the data are nicely presented and the manuscript is well written. There are a few major concerns that the reviewers have identified that require attention as well as several minor concerns that you can address at your discretion.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The title of the manuscript emphasizes a single anatomical locus, but this is not clearly demonstrated. Perhaps the authors can restate the major finding in the title in some other way. A more accurate concept to emphasize is that the authors have identified an anatomical substrate for the control of both processes.</p><p>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> need to be revisited. This is critical to the success of the manuscript. Silencing of DPM neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> produces a very weak effect, which could reasonably be the result of manipulating a small number of neurons. However, there is a concern that the reported significant change is due to two issues: A) an atypical method used to calculate sleep loss and B) the comparison that is being made. Specifically, it is difficult to accept the claim that sleep is reduced when the experimental curves completely overlap with one or both controls at 31 degrees (except for the tiny effect on the second night of silencing). The experimental genotype is more affected by the temperature change, but only if you accept that sleep in the GAL4 control is lower than the experimental at baseline. Given that sleep in the two genotypes is the same following recovery, the lower sleep in the control is not a consistent phenotype. If anything, following recovery the control should be even lower than the experimental because the experimental has lost sleep and may be undergoing rebound. The fact that they're the same means there's something strange going on with that control. Ideally, the control and experiments would have the same sleep at baseline, and then one could compare sleep between genotypes at the higher temperature. One possibility to help address this issue would be for the authors to include another shift to 31 degrees following a night of equal sleep between the controls and experimental animals at 18.</p><p>3) The staining in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> looks very nice, but as many of these antibodies can be problematic, the authors should show controls for the antibodies used (positive control for ChaT and negative for GABA and GAD). See also comment 6 below.</p><p>4) The absence of direct physiological evidence for an inhibitory connection between the DPM and the α' and β' neurons is unfortunate, but it seems clear that this is a shortcoming of the available tools for measuring inhibition deep in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain rather than a technical shortcoming of this study. In the Results section, describing the negative physiological results, the authors state: “Unfortunately, these fluorescent sensors are often not effective at reporting inhibition unless there is some basal level of activity in the circuit.” The authors should cite instances where this has been shown here in the Results section or direct the reader to the citations present in the Discussion.</p><p>5) It would be nice to see a more detailed description of where the various GAL4 lines are expressed outside the DMP neurons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>. It would also be useful for the non-specialist reader if the DPM neurons were indicated in each of the micrographs in this supplementary figure.</p><p>6) The data regarding synaptic localization of VGAT and Bruchpilot is a concern. These are broadly overlapping, relatively weak, immunostaining profiles in complex neuropil. Related to control for antibody staining, could the authors knock down VGAT and provide a control for this overlap?</p><p>7) The decisions to include data in the primary text versus the supplementary data seem a bit arbitrary in some cases. As a consequence, the reader can be lead to speculate why these decisions were made. For example, the authors dismiss the APL &gt; <italic>vGAT-RNAi</italic> data as having a weak effect (Figure 5–figure supplement 1), but this effect seems at least as strong as what is seen with their other manipulations that they consider significant. I don't think that their argument—that because they also see an increase in activity in this experiment means the effect on sleep is irrelevant—is a valid one. Sleep could be affected in a meaningful way even if locomotor activity is also affected. As another example, the RNAi mediated knockdown of 5HT synthesis and GABA vesicle loading provide very strong evidence for this manuscript's conclusion that the DPM neurons inhibit the MBs. It would be appropriate for the authors to show the data for the milder behavioral effects of <italic>TRH-RNAi</italic> knockdown using <italic>NP2721-GAL4</italic>, since, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>, this line is significantly more specific to the DPM neurons.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled “A single pair of neurons links sleep to memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by K. VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and 2 of the original reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>All of the reviewers and the Reviewing editor agree that the authors have responded to the reviewers’ criticism effectively with considerable inclusion of new data and thoughtful revision. However, one major point regarding the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> remains an unresolved issue that the reviewers feel could be easily addressed and would largely resolve any remaining concerns. After addressing this remaining issue, the reviewers agree that the manuscript is acceptable for publication at <italic>eLife</italic> without necessitating further review. The reviewers and Reviewing editor have discussed this remaining issue extensively and suggest the following solution:</p><p>The new data that were provided in the response to the reviewer criticism regarding <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> seem to show that there is no baseline sleep defect on day/night 2, the first experimental night. The effect on day/night 2 should be quantified and shown in the main figure in the body of the manuscript. Further, the data for day/night 4 and 5 suggest a very small effect. All these data need to be shown in the main body of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (instead of the current version of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and the magnitude of this effect should be noted and discussed in the text. Further, it is very important that the statistical significance of the proposed effect in these new data can be evaluated and reported.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03868.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The title of the manuscript emphasizes a single anatomical locus, but this is not clearly demonstrated. Perhaps the authors can restate the major finding in the title in some other way. A more accurate concept to emphasize is that the authors have identified an anatomical substrate for the control of both processes</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the title to the more descriptive “A single pair of neurons links sleep to memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>”. We hope this addresses the concerns of the reviewers.</p><p><italic>2) The data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>need to be revisited. This is critical to the success of the manuscript. Silencing of DPM neurons in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>produces a very weak effect, which could reasonably be the result of manipulating a small number of neurons. However, there is a concern that the reported significant change is due to two issues: A) an atypical method used to calculate sleep loss and B) the comparison that is being made. Specifically, it is difficult to accept the claim that sleep is reduced when the experimental curves completely overlap with one or both controls at 31 degrees (except for the tiny effect on the second night of silencing). The experimental genotype is more affected by the temperature change, but only if you accept that sleep in the GAL4 control is lower than the experimental at baseline. Given that sleep in the two genotypes is the same following recovery, the lower sleep in the control is not a consistent phenotype. If anything, following recovery the control should be even lower than the experimental because the experimental has lost sleep and may be undergoing rebound. The fact that they're the same means there's something strange going on with that control. Ideally, the control and experiments would have the same sleep at baseline, and then one could compare sleep between genotypes at the higher temperature. One possibility to help address this issue would be for the authors to include another shift to 31 degrees following a night of equal sleep between the controls and experimental animals at 18</italic>.</p><p>The first issue is our analysis method. We actually developed this because we were dissatisfied with the commonly used “% change” method used in previous papers from our lab since when the baseline is small, really minor changes in sleep can be exaggerated. Our method avoids this pitfall, and we believe it is a more accurate representation of the changes that occur after a temperature shift. This method is not all that unusual. In fact, our analysis method is identical to what has been published by others (including <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Joiner et al., 2006</xref>) except that in our case, sleep changes are expressed as minutes of sleep gained or lost vs. controls rather than as a percent change from controls. The final step of dividing the sleep of the experimental group by that of each control group used by other groups does not change the control or experimental data distributions or relative differences between them since both the experimental and control groups are divided by the control group values. It is simply an additional scaling step that converts minutes of sleep lost or gained into a net percentage. We feel that our analysis method is in line with the field but is a more accurate report of changes in sleep.</p><p>The second issue is the data set shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Firstly we completely agree that the <italic>NP2721-GAL4/+</italic> control in this experiment is not normal. It appears to be changed in a lasting way by the 31<sup>o</sup> C heat treatment so that it does not return to its relative pre-heat baseline. Unfortunately, we have outcrossed this line 6 generations to <italic>Canton S</italic> without much change in this baseline behavior.</p><p>To demonstrate that this is not affecting our results, we have carried out the double heat treatment experiment suggested by the reviewers, and it is shown below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). As you can see, the GAL4 control once again gains sleep after a day of heating and becomes almost the same as the experimental line and the UAS control in the first recovery day (Day3). Importantly however, if you apply a second heat treatment, you still get a relative sleep loss in the experimental line if you now use that first recovery day (Day 3) as the baseline for the second heating period (Day 4/5). We find that this particular double heating treatment also appears to result in daytime sleep gains, but this is likely due to the sleep loss occurring during the daytime on the day used as a baseline (Day 3). This sleep loss likely reflects an ongoing suppression of the DPMs (note it is also seen in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is unusual and interesting, but its investigation is beyond the scope of this paper.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-03868-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>While this does not really resolve the nature of this behavior of this control strain, we feel that it does demonstrate that it is not relevant to the DPM phenotype since dTrpA1-dependent night-time sleep loss is seen no matter what the GAL4 control baseline is doing. The overall case for DPMs having a role in production of baseline night-time sleep is very strong and does not rest solely on any one experiment. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2B</xref> show that acute induction of Kir by a temperature shift produces a clean reduction in sleep compared to both GAL4 and UAS controls. This experiment was done with a third DPM-<italic>GAL4</italic> (<italic>VT64246</italic>), a line that does not have the same baseline sleep phenotype as <italic>NP2721</italic>. This demonstrates that with two distinct GAL4s and two distinct activity-reducing manipulations, we can see a qualitatively similar reduction in sleep when we inhibit DPM output.</p><p><italic>3) The staining in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>looks very nice, but as many of these antibodies can be problematic, the authors should show controls for the antibodies used (positive control for ChaT and negative for GABA and GAD). See also comment 6 below</italic>.</p><p>We have updated the image shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> to show that our staining, although it does not detect significant ChAT signals in the DPMS, is able to detect ChAT in a large population of neurons in the brain, consistent with published reports of this Ab being specific for cholinergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Takagawa et al., 1996</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Yasuyama et al., 1996</xref>). The negative control for the anti-GABA antibody we used is shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu and Davis (2009)</xref> where they demonstrate that expression of GAD-RNAi reduced anti-GABA staining in a cell-specific manner. The anti-GAD antibody we used was verified by showing that there was no staining of homozygous null embryos (Featherstone et al., 2000).</p><p><italic>4) The absence of direct physiological evidence for an inhibitory connection between the DPM and the α' and β' neurons is unfortunate, but it seems clear that this is a shortcoming of the available tools for measuring inhibition deep in the</italic> Drosophila <italic>brain rather than a technical shortcoming of this study. In the Results section, describing the negative physiological results, the authors state: “Unfortunately, these fluorescent sensors are often not effective at reporting inhibition unless there is some basal level of activity in the circuit.” The authors should cite instances where this has been shown here in the Results section or direct the reader to the citations present in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>Since the initial submission of this paper we have been able to develop a method to visualize changes in intracellular chloride in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using SuperClomeleon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grimley et al., 2013</xref>). The new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows that both bath application of GABA and activation of DPMs result in an increase in intracellular chloride which are decreased by concurrent application of picrotoxin. We have modified the text and the discussion of other sensors accordingly. This result substantially strengthens the paper.</p><p>As for citations showing no effect of inhibition with calcium and cAMP sensors, we were not able to come up with any. What we can (and do) cite is that all the studies in which inhibition was successfully documented used some stimulus to activate the system before the “inhibitory” manipulation. We have therefore modified our wording in that section to indicate that it is “likely” that there has to be some basal activity. Because we do not see an inhibitory response using calcium and cAMP, despite our finding that DPM activation causes MB chloride influx, we believe that this itself provides decent evidence that these reporters can fail to show a negative response in the context of documented inhibition.</p><p><italic>5) It would be nice to see a more detailed description of where the various GAL4 lines are expressed outside the DMP neurons in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>. It would also be useful for the non-specialist reader if the DPM neurons were indicated in each of the micrographs in this supplementary figure</italic>.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> has been annotated to label major regions of ectopic expression, and an asterisk has been added to denote the DPM neurons in each panel.</p><p><italic>6) The data regarding synaptic localization of VGAT and Bruchpilot is a concern. These are broadly overlapping, relatively weak, immunostaining profiles in complex neuropil</italic>. <italic>Related to control for antibody staining, could the authors knock down VGAT and provide a control for this overlap?</italic></p><p>The reviewers are correct that believable colocalization can be difficult when the antigens are broadly expressed in a complex neuropil. This is why we chose to use a correlation algorithm as opposed to looking at overlap as most studies do. Rather than comparing visible overlap of the absolute fluorescence intensity in each channel (e.g. red plus green equals yellow), which is subject to viewer bias and differences in staining intensity between channels, this method determines whether changes in staining intensity co-vary or are correlated between channels.</p><p>This provides an objective and spatially specific representation of colocalization. ICA analysis generates a correlation/colocalization value for each pixel defined by the <underline>P</underline>roduct of the <underline>D</underline>ifferences from the <underline>M</underline>ean (PDM). PDM= (red intensity - mean red intensity)×(green intensity – mean green intensity). PDM values for each pixel can then be visualized as an image showing positive intensity correlation (PDM&gt;0) and negative intensity correlation (PDM&lt;0). Relative PDM value scales are shown on each figure generated with ICA analysis.</p><p>This method produces an image with a higher confidence of colocalization than standard overlap methods. The ability of this method to discriminate true colocalization on a diffuse background is highlighted by the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>. In the presence of diffuse local ChAT staining, we see no evidence of colocalization to DPMs. This is the most rigorous control that you could ask for in terms of validation of the technique. This, and the consistency of the VGAT data set with the validated GABA and GAD antibodies, gives us confidence that this VGAT/Brp colocalization result is correct and we feel comfortable leaving it in the paper.</p><p><italic>7) The decisions to include data in the primary text versus the supplementary data seem a bit arbitrary in some cases. As a consequence, the reader can be lead to speculate why these decisions were made. For example, the authors dismiss the APL &gt;</italic> vGAT-RNAi <italic>data as having a weak effect (Figure 5–figure supplement 1), but this effect seems at least as strong as what is seen with their other manipulations that they consider significant. I don't think that their argument—that because they also see an increase in activity in this experiment means the effect on sleep is irrelevant—is a valid one. Sleep could be affected in a meaningful way even if locomotor activity is also affected. As another example, the RNAi mediated knockdown of 5HT synthesis and GABA vesicle loading provide very strong evidence for this manuscript's conclusion that the DPM neurons inhibit the MBs. It would be appropriate for the authors to show the data for the milder behavioral effects of</italic> TRH-RNAi <italic>knockdown using</italic> NP2721-GAL4<italic>, since, based on</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1"><italic>Figure 1–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, this line is significantly more specific to the DPM neurons.</italic></p><p>The first question here is the role of APLs. We did not mean to imply that the locomotor phenotype made APL sleep effects irrelevant. What we were trying to convey is that the sleep effects of down regulating GABA in these cells is qualitatively different from what happens when you decrease GABA in DPMs, indicating that the two cells are functioning independently. We have tried to make this clearer in the revised text.</p><p>We have also provided additional data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (new panel C) that more definitively exclude APL as a cause of sleep effects after activation of DPMs. We show in the new data that coexpression of Shi<sup>ts</sup> with dTrpA1 in DPMs completely blocks neuronal activation-dependent sleep increases. Because the effects of Shi<sup>ts</sup> are limited to DPM, this strongly suggests that APL sleep phenotypes are separate from those of DPMs and not relevant to the DPM story. We have amended the text to make this distinction clearer.</p><p>The second issue was relegation of part of the 5HT data to supplement. We have taken the reviewers’ suggestion and moved it into <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>All of the reviewers and the Reviewing editor agree that the authors have responded to the reviewers’ criticism effectively with considerable inclusion of new data and thoughtful revision. However, one major point regarding the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>remains an unresolved issue that the reviewers feel could be easily addressed and would largely resolve any remaining concerns. After addressing this remaining issue the reviewers agree that the manuscript is acceptable for publication at</italic> eLife <italic>without necessitating further review</italic>. <italic>The reviewers and Reviewing editor have discussed this remaining issue extensively and suggest the following solution:</italic></p><p><italic>The new data that were provided in the response to the reviewer criticism regarding</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref> <italic>seem to show that there is no baseline sleep defect on day/night 2, the first experimental night. The effect on day/night 2 should be quantified and shown in the main figure in the body of the manuscript. Further, the data for day/night 4 and 5 suggest a very small effect. All these data need to be shown in the main body of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref> <italic>(instead of the current version of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1B</italic></xref><italic>), and the magnitude of this effect should be noted and discussed in the text. Further, it is very important that the statistical significance of the proposed effect in these new data can be evaluated and reported</italic>.</p><p>We have included the control “two cycle” experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, with statistical analysis as requested, and a commentary in the Results section. It turns out that both the first and second temperature shifts caused small but statistically significant sleep loss, indicating that the aberrant behaviour of the GAL4 control’s baseline was immaterial to the original finding.</p><p>We have also added a supplementary figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) that shows the same result as old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> with an independent DPM GAL4 driving Shi<sup>ts</sup>, further supporting the finding that inactivation of DPMs causes small losses in night-time sleep.</p><p>In putting this revision together, we became very concerned that the substitution of the experiment with multiple cycles for the original data was going to be very confusing to the reader since there was no a priori reason for us to have done the experiment with that kind of protocol. In the end, we decided that, for the sake of clarity, we would deviate from your request in one respect: we left the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> data in as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>1 with the control experiment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B2</xref>. This allowed us to explain in text the rationale for the two heat cycles and make a stronger point that while the night-time sleep changes with DPM inactivation are very small, they are independent of pre-inactivation baseline (first vs. second heat cycle with <italic>NP2721</italic>), GAL4 driver (<italic>NP2721-GAL4</italic> in original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and new c316 data), and activity manipulation (Shi<sup>ts</sup> and Kir, which was in the previous version of the paper as a <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>I think that, given the multiple approaches we have used to flesh out this relatively minor point, I would still prefer to leave <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> as it was (or substitute in the c316-GAL4 data in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1–figure supplement 3</xref>) and put the cycling experiment into a supplementary figure. I believe it would be clearer for the reader. But given the insistence of the reviewers, the new version conforms (mostly!) to the instructions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
