understood. We show by structural and biochemical analyses that Prp3 contains a bipartite U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region comprising an expanded ferredoxin-like fold, which recognizes a 3′-overhang of U6 snRNA, and a preceding peptide, which binds U4/U6 stem II. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that the single-stranded RNA-binding domain is exclusively found in Prp3 orthologs, thus qualifying as a spliceosome-specific RNA interaction module. The composite double-stranded/single-stranded RNA-binding region assembles cooperatively with Snu13 and Prp31 on U4/U6 di-snRNAs and inhibits Brr2-mediated U4/U6 di-snRNA unwinding in vitro. RNP-disrupting mutations in Prp3 lead to U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP assembly and splicing defects in vivo. Our results reveal how Prp3 acts as an important bridge between U4/U6 and U5 in the tri-snRNP and comparison with a Prp24-U6 snRNA recycling complex suggests how Prp3 may be involved in U4/U6 reassembly after splicing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07320.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07320.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07320.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins are built following instructions contained within the DNA of gene sequences. This genetic information is copied into short-lived molecules, called messenger RNAs (or mRNAs), which move away from the DNA and are then decoded by the molecular machines that build proteins. However, mRNA sequences often have to be edited before they are used. Another molecular machine, called a spliceosome, carries out some of this editing.</p><p>A spliceosome is formed from a number of smaller subunits, including three RNA-protein particles that each contain one RNA molecule (called U1, U2 and U5), and one particle that contains two RNA molecules (called U4 and U6). These subunits must assemble around an unedited mRNA in a particular order so that the spliceosome can work correctly. Once the mRNA has been edited, and the spliceosome has performed its job, these complexes need to disassemble so that they are ready to be reassembled around a new mRNA molecule. A protein called Prp3 is known to be involved in these assembly, disassembly and reassembly steps. However, it is unclear how this protein performs these activities.</p><p>Liu et al. have now used structural biology and biochemical techniques to determine the three-dimensional structure of Prp3, and have shown that this protein has a “two-part” binding site that binds to the RNA molecules in the U4/U6 subunit of the spliceosome. Further analyses revealed that one of these features is only found in Prp3 and not in other types of RNA-binding proteins.</p><p>Together with previous work, Liu et al. also reveal that Prp3 can serve as a ‘bridge’ between the U4/U6 and U5 subunits of the spliceosome, and suggest how these features allow the two subunits to group together before they are incorporated into a spliceosome.</p><p>Notably, certain mutations in the gene for the Prp3 protein lead to a human eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa. In the future it will be important to investigate if the above activities are affected in the mutant variants of the Prp3 protein.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07320.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07320.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particle</kwd><kwd>pre-mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>protein–RNA interaction</kwd><kwd>X-ray crystallography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 740</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahl</surname><given-names>Markus C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002347</institution-id><institution>Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung (Federal Ministry of Education and Research)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>05K10KEC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wahl</surname><given-names>Markus C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council (ERC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RNA+P=123D</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bujnicki</surname><given-names>Janusz M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001870</institution-id><institution>Foundation For Polish Science (Fundacja na rzecz Nauki Polskiej)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>“Ideas for Poland” fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bujnicki</surname><given-names>Janusz M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds (BIF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>None</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theuser</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 860</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lührmann</surname><given-names>Reinhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural and functional analyses show how the spliceosomal Prp3 protein concomitantly binds double- and single- stranded regions in U4/U6 di-snRNAs and serves to stabilize the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP for splicing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Pre-mRNA splicing is catalyzed by a multi-subunit RNA-protein (RNP) enzyme, the spliceosome, which facilitates two successive <italic>trans</italic>esterification reactions (steps 1 and 2) that lead to the removal of an intron and the ligation of its flanking exons. For each splicing event, a spliceosome is newly formed via the stepwise recruitment of small nuclear (sn) RNPs (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 in the case of the major spliceosome) and numerous non-snRNP proteins to a pre-mRNA substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wahl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>). During canonical cross-intron spliceosome assembly, U1 and U2 snRNPs bind the 5′-splice site (5′SS) and the branch point region of an intron, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mount et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kramer et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parker et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu and Manley, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhuang and Weiner, 1989</xref>). Formation of this A complex is followed by the recruitment of a preformed U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP, yielding the pre-catalytic B complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bindereif and Green, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng and Abelson, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konarska and Sharp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deckert et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>), which requires extensive conformational and compositional rearrangements to form a catalytically active spliceosome. Catalytic activation includes the disruption of the U1/5′SS interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konforti et al., 1993</xref>) and the separation of U4 snRNA from U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Konarska and Sharp, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yean and Lin, 1991</xref>), which are extensively base-paired in the tri-snRNP and in the B complex, leading to the dissociation of U1 snRNP, U4 snRNA and all U4/U6-associated proteins. These rearrangements give rise to the B<sup>act</sup> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bessonov et al., 2010</xref>) and, upon further remodeling, to the B* complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Warkocki et al., 2009</xref>), in which U6 snRNA forms a central part of the spliceosome's active site. The B* complex facilitates the first step of splicing, the ensuing C complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Konarska et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bessonov et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fabrizio et al., 2009</xref>) catalyzes the second step of splicing, after which the spliceosome releases its products and the remaining snRNPs and non-snRNP factors are recycled.</p><p>To participate in further rounds of splicing, the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP must be reassembled by initial dimerization of U4 and U6 snRNPs followed by association with U5 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stanek and Neugebauer, 2006</xref>). Association of U4 and U6 snRNPs is mediated in part by base pairing between their respective snRNAs, which form two inter-molecular helices (stems I and II) that are separated by a U4 5′-stem-loop (5′SL; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). U4/U6 base pairing is mutually exclusive with the U6 snRNA conformation in the activated spliceosome. Reannealing of U4 and U6 snRNAs after splicing thus requires the Prp24 assembly chaperone in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Raghunathan and Guthrie, 1998</xref>) or its SART3 ortholog in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bell et al., 2002</xref>), which transiently bind U6 snRNA, as well as the LSm proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achsel et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rader and Guthrie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Verdone et al., 2004</xref>), which bind and remain at the 3′-end of U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beggs, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>).

Recent homology modeling has predicted a ferredoxin-like fold for the human Prp3 DUF1115 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korneta et al., 2012</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that C-terminal regions of Prp3, including DUF1115, bind U4/U6 di-snRNA fragments containing stem II and a U6 3′-overhang and elucidated crystal structures of a yPrp3 C-terminal region alone and in complex with a U4/U6 di-snRNA fragment. Structure-guided mutations that led to reduced U4/U6 interaction in vitro and to reduced cell viability also reduced U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP levels and splicing in vivo. Our results indicate how Prp3 functionally bridges U4/U6 and U5 in the tri-snRNP by Prp3-RNA interactions on one side and Prp3-protein interactions on the other. Moreover, a comparison with the structure of a Prp24-U6 snRNA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montemayor et al., 2014</xref>) suggests how Prp3 may initiate the handover of U6 snRNA from the Prp24 recycling factor to U4 snRNP during U4/U6 reassembly.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of a conserved C-terminal U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region in Prp3</title><p>Previous studies have shown that human (h) Prp3 in the context of a hPrp3-hPrp4-hCypH complex contacts U6 snRNA in a region that forms stem II and a U6 single-stranded 3′-overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nottrott et al., 2002</xref>). To test whether hPrp3 alone is sufficient for stable RNA binding and to delineate hPrp3 elements required for complex formation, we produced full-length hPrp3 (hPrp3<sup>FL</sup>) and fragments lacking ca. 200–250 residues from either end (hPrp3<sup>N</sup>—residues 1–442; hPrp3<sup>C</sup>—residues 195–683) as N-terminal maltose-binding protein [MBP] fusion proteins. We then tested binding of these proteins to a hU4/U6 construct containing stem II (fused by a GAAA tetraloop) and a 13 nucleotide [nt] U6 3′-overhang (hU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup>) in electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). Only the full-length protein and hPrp3<sup>C</sup>, but not hPrp3<sup>N</sup>, bound hU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lanes 2–4). Trypsin treatment of the hPrp3<sup>C</sup>-hU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup> complex gave rise to a protein fragment containing residues 484–683 (hPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>) as shown by mass spectrometric fingerprinting and N-terminal sequencing. hPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> contains the predicted DUF1115 domain (residues 540–683) and a conserved, preceding peptide rich in basic amino acid residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Binding of recombinant hPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (as a glutathione S-transferase [GST] fusion) to hU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup> was comparable to hPrp3<sup>FL</sup> or hPrp3<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lane 5). These results show that the C-terminal ca. 200 amino acids of hPrp3 encompass the protein elements that mediate stable U4/U6 binding.</p><p>All following experiments were performed with yeast (y) factors. To test whether the C-terminal U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding region is conserved in yPrp3, we produced a protein comprising the 177 C-terminal residues of yPrp3 (residue 296–469; yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>). yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> bound a yU4/U6 duplex containing the complete stem II and a 13-nt yU6 3′-overhang (yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup>) with an apparent dissociation constant (K<sub>d,app</sub>) of 0.92 µM as determined by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, first gel and quantification) and with a K<sub>d</sub> of 110 nM as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top left). The lower apparent affinity estimated by EMSA is likely due to the presence of non-specific tRNA competitor in this assay. The yPrp3 DUF1115 domain (residues 325–469; yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup>) lacking the preceding basic peptide showed ca. twofold reduced affinity for yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup> in EMSA (K<sub>d,app</sub> 1.83 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, second gel and quantification) and a ca. 3.5-fold lower affinity in ITC (K<sub>d</sub> 380 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, top right).

Furthermore, the thermodynamic signatures of the interactions involving yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup>, yPrp3<sup>CTF,R304A</sup> and yPrp3<sup>CTF,R322A</sup> changed considerably compared to yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>. The DUF1115 domain as well as both arginine-to-alanine variants (in particular yPrp3<sup>CTF,R304A</sup>) exhibited significantly less favorable interaction enthalpies and more favorable (or less unfavorable) interaction entropies compared to yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). One explanation for these observations could be that the N-terminal peptide is a flexible element in yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>, which becomes immobilized (loss in conformational entropy) by RNA contacts (gain in interaction enthalpy) upon binding of yU4/U6<sup>stem II+13nt</sup>. In any case, these observations show that both the DUF1115 domain and the preceding basic peptide contribute to the RNA binding.</p><p>Next, we further probed the RNA requirements for stable binding. yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> efficiently bound a yU4/U6 constructs bearing full-length stem II and yU6 3′-overhangs of at least eight nts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 1–8), while further shortening of the yU6 3′-overhang led to progressively reduced binding (lanes 9–14). Removal of the first two A-U base pairs from the 5′-end of stem II had no consequence for binding of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lanes 15–18), but reduced binding was seen when seven base pairs, including a non-canonical C69<sup>U6</sup>-C12<sup>U4</sup> pair, were removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, lane 20). A non-canonical pyrimidine–pyrimidine base pair is conserved in the corresponding stem II regions of U4/U6 from other organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). When we converted yU6 C69 or yU4 C12 of the non-canonical C-C pair in stem II to G’s to allow Watson-Crick base pairing at these positions, the affinity of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> was reduced about twofold in EMSA titrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, first and third gels and quantification). In contrast, the DUF1115 domain alone did not exhibit reduced affinity to the mutant RNAs compared to the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, second and fourth gels and quantification). These findings suggest that yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> recognizes portions of the U6 3′-overhang as well as parts of yU4/U6 stem II, including the non-canonical C69<sup>U6</sup>-C12<sup>U4</sup> pair.</p><p>Binding of Prp3 to U4/U6 stem II would be expected to stabilize the U4/U6 duplex, which is unwound by the Brr2 helicase during spliceosome catalytic activation.

Addition of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> reduced the rate of yBrr2-mediated yU4/U6 unwinding about fivefold, while yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup> showed almost no effect (ca. 1.2-fold reduction; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07320.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effects on Brr2-mediated U4/U6 unwinding and interplay with other U4/U6 proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Native gels monitoring yU4/U6 di-snRNA unwinding by yBrr2 in the absence of other proteins (top), in the presence of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (middle) or yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup> (bottom).

The electron density for the yU4/U6 stem II regions was less well defined, in particular in the part of stem II distal to the duplex-to-single strand junction in one of the complexes. The electron density was consistent with the stem II regions adopting standard A-form geometry in both complexes but did not allow us to model in detail possible local deviations, for example, around a non-canonical C69<sup>U6</sup>-C12<sup>U4</sup> base pair.</p><p>Protein–RNA interactions in the well-defined portions of the two crystallographically independent complexes were largely identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In both complexes, the single-stranded (ss) yU6 3′-overhang arches across helix α1 and strand β5 of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>, running below the long β3a/β3b hairpin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Its binding surface on the protein is carpeted by an electropositive surface potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The yU6 3′-overhang can be divided into three sections, between which its backbone changes directions on the surface of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Nts G81-A83 (section 1) stack on the terminal U80<sup>U6</sup>-A1<sup>U4</sup> base pair of stem II and run diagonally from the N-terminus of helix α2 to the N-terminus of helix α1; nts C84-G86 (section 2) are positioned perpendicular across the N-terminal end of helix α1; nts U87-U90 (section 3) run along the exposed edge of strand β5 and the C-terminus of helix α1. As a consequence, the end of the U6 3′-overhang is directed via two ca. 90 ° kinks back towards stem II. A RNA structural similarity search using the RNA Bricks database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chojnowski et al., 2014</xref>) failed to uncover a case of a similar RNA redirection on the surface of a single protein domain. Notably, the unusual doubly-kinked RNA conformation is stabilized by protein elements that expand the core ferredoxin fold in yPrp3, that is, the β3a/β3b hairpin, strand β5 and helix α3 (details below).</p><p>All nts of the yU6 3′-overhang (G81-U90) contained in the present structure, except the first G81 residue, directly contact yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> in one or both complexes, consistent with the important role of this part of U6 for stable Prp3 binding in yeast and human. In one yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>-yU4/U6<sup>stem II+10nt</sup> complex, the guanidinium group of R399 (helix α2) forms ionic interactions to the backbone phosphate of A82 and the side chain amino group of K355 (helix α1) binds to the A83 phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the complex lacking these interactions, the corresponding backbone regions of yU6 and the stem II duplex are slightly pulled away from the protein, presumably by crystal packing interactions. The exocyclic N6 group of A83 approaches the side chain carboxyl of E362 (helix α1) and its base stacks on the side chain of F354 (helix α1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The extracyclic amino group (N4) of C84 is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of E407 (β3a/β3b hairpin) and the base is thereby held sandwiched between H409 (β3a/β3b hairpin) and P350 (helix α1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The A83 and C84 backbone phosphates approach the side chain of K351 (helix α1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These interactions splay out A83 and C84, stabilizing the first kink in the yU6 3′-overhang. The guanidinium group of R353 (helix α1) engages in hydrogen bonds to the Watson-Crick face of C85 (atoms O2 and N3) and to the Hoogsteen face of G86 (atoms O6 and N7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, N1 of G86 is contacted by the side chain carboxyl of D374 (β1-β2 loop), its base engages in cation-π stacking to the guanidium group of R371 (strand β2) and its 2′-hydroxyl group is hydrogen bonded to the backbone carbonyl of M442 (strand β5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). O4 of U87 is hydrogen bonded to the side chain amide of Q457 (helix α3) and its base stacks on F441 (strand β5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The O2 atom of U88 hydrogen bonds with the backbone NH of W440 (strand β5), positioning the base laterally on the F441 side chain. The U87-U88 backbone region encircles the side chain of K357 (helix α1), which contacts the anionic phosphate oxygens of U87 and the O3 atom of U88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The interactions involving K357, W440, F441 and Q457 stabilize the second kink in the yU6 3′-overhang. The side chain amino group of K361 (helix α1) contacts the U89 anionic phosphate oxygens in one complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and interacts with O2, O2′ and O3′ of U88 as well as the phosphate and O5′ of U89 in the other complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The last nt, U90, adopts two different conformations in the two complexes; in one case, its N3, O2 and O4 atoms are hydrogen bonded to the side chain hydroxyl of S364 (α3-β2 loop; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), while in the other case it interacts with the N1 and N6 positions of nt A82 at the beginning of the yU6 3′-overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07320.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Details of the yPrp3-yU4/U6 di-snRNA interaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>H</bold>) Close-up views of yPrp3–RNA contacts.

Previous bioinformatics analyses indicated that within the superfamily the Prp3 DUF1115 domain is most homologous to acylphosphatase (AcyP) and BLUF domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Korneta et al., 2012</xref>), which do not recognize nucleic acids. However, the sequence comparison did not reveal the evolutionary relationship between the Prp3 ssRNA-binding domain and other members of the ferredoxin superfamily. We therefore calculated a phylogenetic tree based on pairwise structural comparisons with representative ferredoxin fold structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The tree is in agreement with sequence analyses, showing that the Prp3 ssRNA-binding domain is most similar to AcyP and BLUF domains. For example, residues 335–467 of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>) spatially align with cow AcyP (PDB ID <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rcsb.org/pdb/search/structidSearch.do?structureId=2ACY">2ACY</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>) with a RMSD of 2.5 Å over 90 common Cα atoms (Z-score 10.1) and show a comparable similarity to the BLUF domain of the BlrB photoreceptor from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> (PDB ID 2BYC; RMSD of 2.0 Å for 84 common Cα atoms; Z-score of 10.0; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2D</xref>). On the other hand, the Prp3 domain is only distantly related to other ferredoxin fold proteins that bind RNAs, such as RRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>) or ribosomal proteins S6, S10, and L10.

A R399A/F441A double mutant strongly exacerbated this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These observations are consistent with the mutated residues contributing to functionally important yPrp3-yU4/U6 interactions, as seen in our binding assays and yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> -yU4/U6<sup>stem II+10nt</sup> crystal structure. To trace the origin of the growth defects, we monitored the effects of the mutations on splicing in vivo at 37°C, using endogenous U3 (pre-)snoRNA as a reporter. Slight accumulation of unspliced U3 pre-snoRNAs was seen in strains producing the R304A, R399A, R304A/R322A or R399A/F441A variants of yPrp3 compared to the wt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicating that the observed growth defects likely root in inefficient splicing. Finally, monitoring snRNP levels by Northern blotting of cellular extracts spread out on a glycerol gradient showed that the levels of U4/U6 di-snRNP and of isolated U5 snRNP were increased at the expense of U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP in strains producing Prp3 variants R304A/R322A and R399A/F441A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>).

Our crystal structure and targeted mutational analyses demonstrate that the DUF1115 domain acts as a ssRNA-binding domain that specifically recognizes the first 10 nts of the U6 3′-overhang. While our structural analysis did not reveal how the preceding peptide is involved in U4/U6 binding, several pieces of evidence indicate that it binds along U4/U6 stem II: The peptide is important for full binding of Prp3 C-terminal portions to U4/U6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>) but it is not a structural element of the DUF1115 domain and thus does not act via stabilizing the RNA-binding fold of DUF1115. Single Arg-to-Ala exchanges in the peptide lead to reduced RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), indicating that these residues may directly contact the RNA. RNA constructs with shortened stem II or in which a conserved non-canonical base pair was converted to a Watson-Crick pair show reduced binding to Prp3<sup>CTF</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>), which cannot be explained by the observed DUF1115 domain contacts (exclusively to the U6 3′-overhang).

DUF1115 exhibits a ferredoxin-like core similar to AcyP/BLUF proteins but evolutionarily remote from other nucleic acid-binding domains in the ferredoxin superfamily. As we failed to detect a DUF1115-like domain by sequence comparisons in hundreds of other RNA-binding proteins recently identified in transcriptome-wide screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Castello et al., 2012</xref>), DUF1115 most likely represents a spliceosome-specific ssRNA-binding domain. Due to the pronounced reorientation that the U6 3′-overhang experiences on the surface of the Prp3 DUF1115 domain, the domain likely is an important architectural element in the U4/U6 di-snRNP and/or the U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Prp3 binding helps explain defects associated with U6 snRNA variants</title><p>The mode of Prp3 binding to U4/U6 di-snRNAs revealed herein helps to rationalize a large body of mutational analyses on U6 snRNAs in yeast and human.

We showed that a yU4/U6 stem II construct bearing the C69G mutation exhibits reduced binding to yPrp3 and according to our structural model this region of the U4/U6 di-snRNAs is recognized by the peptide preceding the Prp3 DUF1115 domain.

Deletion of nts U74-G75-A76 in hU6 snRNA (corresponding to residues U80-G81-A82 in yU6) reduced the levels of U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP and assembled spliceosomes to less than 10% of wt and abrogated splicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wolff and Bindereif, 1992</xref>). An A76C variant of hU6 snRNA showed reduced interaction with U4 snRNA, concomitant with reduced spliceosome assembly and low splicing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolff and Bindereif, 1995</xref>). Furthermore, yU6 snRNA bearing a U80G exchange almost completely abolished formation of U4/U6 di-snRNPs and U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNPs and was defective in splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fabrizio et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryan and Abelson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryan et al., 2002</xref>). The G81C point mutation in yU6 snRNA strongly blocked splicing in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Madhani et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryan and Abelson, 2002</xref>) and caused a substantial accumulation of free U6 snRNP deficient in U4/U6 di-snRNP assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryan and Abelson, 2002</xref>). The effects of some of these mutations were suggested to root in a stabilization of intra-molecular base pairing in U6 snRNA. However, our observation that G81C and A82C exchanges in yU6 snRNA led to weak binding of yPrp3 in vitro suggests that aberrant Prp3 binding may also contribute to these phenotypes. The continuous stacking of nts in the transition region between stem II and the U6 3′-overhang seen in our structure may properly orient these elements for stable Prp3 binding.</p><p>3′-truncated yU6 snRNAs containing residues 1–94, 1–91 or 1–88 allowed reconstitution of 35–40 % of wt splicing activity, while only 20% and 4% of the wt splicing activity were regained with yU6 snRNA molecules further shortened to residues 1–86 or 1–85, respectively, and yU6 snRNAs containing only residues 1–81 or 1–80 fully blocked splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Madhani et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ryan et al., 2002</xref>). The phenotypes associated with the deletion of distal yU6 3′-overhang residues likely originate from the removal of binding sites for the Prp24 assembly chaperone and the LSm protein complex. However, the exacerbated effects when yU6 snRNA was shortened to 86 nts or less correlate very well with our finding of reduced yPrp3 binding to yU4/U6 constructs bearing sequentially shortened U6 3′-overhangs or the C85A and G86C point mutations. Reduced Prp3 binding may also contribute to the reduced hU4/U6 di-snRNP levels seen previously in the presence of hU6 snRNA bearing a C79U exchange in the 3′-overhang (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wolff and Bindereif, 1995</xref>), as we observed weak yPrp3 interaction with a yU4/U6 bearing a variant residue at the analogous position (C85A).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Mechanism of Prp3-dependent U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP stability</title><p>The binding of the U4/U6-specific proteins Snu13, Prp31 and the Prp3-Prp4(-CypH) complex to U4/U6 di-snRNAs is highly interdependent.

An explanation for the ordered binding of Snu13 and Prp31 was provided by structural studies that showed how hSnu13 and the hU4 5′SL provide a composite binding platform for the hPrp31 Nop domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2011</xref>), while the mechanism by which hSnu13 leads to enhanced interaction of hPrp3 with U4/U6 di-snRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nottrott et al., 2002</xref>) remained enigmatic. Our results indicate that Prp3 contacts RNA elements along stem II, that is, in the vicinity of the U4/U6 3-way junction. Snu13 binds one branch of the 3-way junction (the U4 5′SL), which could exert a stabilizing effect on the 3-way junction and stem II and lead to improved binding of Prp3. This effect could be further enhanced by Prp31, whose U4/U6 contacts extend into the lower part of stem II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schultz et al., 2006</xref>). It is also conceivable that the Prp3 stem II-binding peptide directly contacts Snu13 and/or Prp31 on the RNAs and that the latter two proteins even modulate how the peptide interacts with stem II.</p><p>Our in vivo analyses of the effects of yPrp3 mutations that interfere with stable yU4/U6 binding in vitro, show that the yPrp3-yU4/U6 interactions we observe in our complex structure are important for U4/U6•U5 tri-snRNP stability and, likely as a consequence, for pre-mRNA splicing. The role of Prp3 in mediating tri-snRNP stability can be understood from our present data, showing that the C-terminal portions of Prp3 maintain interactions with the U4/U6 di-snRNAs, and previous yeast 2-hybrid (Y2H) analyses, showing that Prp3 contacts the U5 snRNP proteins Prp6 and Snu66 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2006</xref>). By combining these functions, Prp3 apparently acts as a bridge, linking the U4/U6 di-snRNP and the U5 snRNP via Prp3-RNA interactions on the U4/U6 side and Prp3-protein interactions on the U5 side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07320.013</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Models for splicing-associated functions of Prp3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Function of Prp3 as a bridge in the U4/U6•U5 tri snRNP.

This recycling requires the Prp24 protein in yeast and the related SART3 protein in human. Recently, a crystal structure of near full-length Prp24 in complex with a large portion of U6 snRNA was elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Montemayor et al., 2014</xref>). While not contained in the Prp24-U6 structure, the distal 3′-end of U6 snRNA is available in that complex for binding the LSm proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), consistent with the observation of a stable Prp24-LSm-U6 snRNA complex in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vidal et al., 1999</xref>). In contrast, U6 regions that form stem I, stem II and the U6 3′-overhang in the assembled U4/U6 di-snRNP are sequestered in an internal U6 stem loop (ISL) and by Prp24-U6 interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). As Prp24 does not harbor an NTP-dependent RNA helicase activity, the question arises how the U6 ISL can be unwound and U6 handed over from Prp24 to U4 snRNP. Notably, regions of U6 snRNA that form stem II and the U6 3′-overhang in the U4/U6 di-snRNP (i.e., Prp3-binding elements) are largely exposed on the surface of the Prp24-U6 snRNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Furthermore, the Prp24-U6 structure represents an artificially stabilized situation, obtained after introducing a cold-sensitive A62G mutation in U6, which impedes unwinding of the U6 ISL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fortner et al., 1994</xref>) by sequestering C85 in a non-natural Watson–Crick base pair (magenta in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We have shown here that C85 is a crucial contact residue of Prp3, which also latches onto the surrounding nts in the context of U4/U6 di-snRNP via its DUF1115 domain. Thus in the wt situation, the U6 ISL on Prp24 can most likely “breathe” in the region surrounding C85, whereby this region could become available for Prp3 binding. Consistent with this idea, chemical probing studies showed that these Prp3-binding nts are only weakly protected in the Prp24-LSm-U6 snRNA particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karaduman et al., 2006</xref>). We therefore suggest that binding of Prp3 to its cognate U6 3′-overhang region traps and subsequently extends and stabilizes spontaneous local unwinding of the internal stem loop (ISL) on the Prp24-LSm-U6 snRNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).</p><p>We envision that Prp24 displacement is completed by entry of a pre-assembled U4 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Prp3 could also support this step by stabilizing the emerging U4/U6 stem II via its stem II-binding peptide. Furthermore, the cooperativity we detect in binding of Snu13, Prp31 and Prp3 to U4/U6 di-snRNA may help to complete assembly of the U4/U6 di-snRNP. Taken together, our results support an important role of Prp3 in the handover of U6 snRNA from Prp24 to U4 snRNP during U4/U6 di-snRNP reassembly after splicing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein production and purification</title><p>DNA encoding full-length hPrp3 or the hPrp3<sup>C</sup> fragment (residues 195–683) with C-terminal His<sub>6</sub>-tags were PCR-amplified from pGADT7-<italic>hPRP3</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) and subcloned into vector pMAL-c2t, in which the Factor Xa cleavage site following the N-terminal MBP tag of pMAL-c2x (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA) was replaced by a TEV cleavage site.

Crystals were grown by mixing 1 μl of complex solution with 0.2 µl of 0.5 M sodium fluoride and 0.8 μl of reservoir solution (0.22 M DL-malic acid, pH 6.8, 16.5% PEG 3350). For diffraction data collection, crystals were transferred to a 1:1 mixture of Paratone-N and paraffin oil as a cryoprotectant and flash-cooled in liquid nitrogen.</p><p>All X-ray diffraction data were collected at 100 K on beamline BL14.2 at the BESSY II storage ring (Berlin, Germany). Data were processed with the HKL package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Minor et al., 2006</xref>) or XDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kabsch, 2010</xref>). The structure of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> was solved by a praseodymium (III) multiple anomalous dispersion experiment as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Puehringer et al., 2012</xref>) and refined against the higher resolution data from an yttrium (III)-derivatized crystal. The structures of yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup> and of a yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>-yU4/U6<sup>stem II+10nt</sup> complex were solved by molecular replacement using structure coordinates of yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup> as search models with the programs MOLREP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vagin and Teplyakov, 2010</xref>) and PHASER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McCoy, 2007</xref>), respectively. Models were manually completed and adjusted with COOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>) and the structures were refined using REFMAC5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murshudov et al., 2011</xref>) and phenix.refine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Afonine et al., 2012</xref>). To preserve A-form geometry in the stem II portion of the yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>-yU4/U6<sup>stem II+10nt</sup> structure, an A-form duplex was used as a reference model and the A-form geometry was restrained during the refinement. Electrostatic surface potentials were calculated with APBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Unni et al., 2011</xref>). All structure figures were created using PyMOL (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pymol.org/">http://www.pymol.org/</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Phylogenetic analyses</title><p>For phylogenetic analyses, a representative set of protein structures containing ferredoxin-like folds was assembled using the SCOP database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Murzin et al., 1995</xref>). Pairwise structural similarity Z-scores were calculated for all structures and the yPrp3 ssRNA-binding domain using DaliLite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Holm and Park, 2000</xref>). The Z-score reciprocals were used to build a UPGMA tree with the neighbor tool of the PHYLIP package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felsenstein, 1989</xref>). The tree was visualized with Evolview (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>) and annotated manually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Data deposition</title><p>Coordinates and diffraction data have been deposited with the Protein Data Bank (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.pdb.org">www.pdb.org</ext-link>) under accession codes 4YHU (yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>), 4YHV (yPrp3<sup>DUF1115</sup>) and 4YHW (yPrp3<sup>CTF</sup>-yU4/U6<sup>stem II+10nt</sup>) and will be released upon publication.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Nicole Holton, Freie Universität Berlin, for help with ITC measurements and Grzegorz Chojnowski, International Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, for help with RNA structure comparisons.

Your article has been evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All reviewers thought that your findings regarding the recognition of the 3' single-stranded region of U6 snRNA by Prp3 are a strong point. This represents a significant advance in our understanding of the mechanistic details of the spliceosome machinery, in particular in describing its complex structural changes, including the recycling phase.</p><p>However, as you will see in the reviews below, there were also major differences of opinion regarding the work, including serious criticism. The hydroxyl radical footprinting results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) were considered not very convincing, and should be replaced with another experiment or removed with a corresponding softening of the relevant conclusion. Regarding the U4-U6 stem-Prp3 interaction, further experimental details should be added, along the lines suggested by Reviewer 3, to strengthen this point. There was also some criticism on the presentation of the data, and both the Introduction, the first part of the Results, and some of the Discussion sections were considered difficult to read, fraught with too many details. Some of this is due to confusing switches between human and yeast nomenclature, and would require considerable rewriting and streamlining.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents crystallographic analysis of structures of Prp3 a U4/U6 di-snRNP. Structures of both Prp3 alone and bound to U4/U6 are presented. While some useful new information is obtained, e.g. what appears to be a novel RNA biding motif in Prp3, I have some concerns about the impact of the work. These include the fact that interaction between Prp3 and stem II of U4/U6 is not well resolved. Additionally, the relevance of these structures in the absence of Snu13 and Prp31 is questionable given that the three proteins bind U4/U6 cooperatively. It seems quite possible that the presence of Snu13 and or Prp31 could alter the functionally relevant conformation of Prp3.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>U4 and U6 small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs) undergo several conformational transitions during the spliceosome cycle, from the U4-U6 base pairing interaction, assembly into the U4/U6-U5 tri-snRNP, U4/U6-to-U6/U2 transition during splicing catalysis and U4 release, to post-spliceosomal recycling and re-assembly of the U4/U6-paired structure. The authors have made important contributions here in their previous work, revealing the protein components, the RNP structures and compositional/structural changes of all stages.</p><p>Here they focus on the Prp3 protein, which stably associates with the U4-U6 duplex, in combination with Snu13 and Prp31. They present a wealth of data on Prp3, combining classical biochemical approaches and mutant studies with protein- and RNA-protein crystallographic as well as phylogenetic data; all very carefully done, described and presented in great detail in high-quality figures. Their own work on the yeast complex (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nottrott et al., 2002</xref>) had shown that Prp3 contacts the U4-U6 duplex RNA on the U4-U6 stem II and U6-3' terminal regions. Here they extend these data by a combination of data, showing that the C-terminal region of Prp3 protein combines single- and double-stranded RNA-binding functions in corresponding regions: first, the DUF1115 domain at the very C-terminus of Prp3 recognizing the conserved single-stranded U6 3' terminus, preceded by, second, a protein domain that interacts with the double-stranded U4-U6 stem II.</p><p>Throughout this paper they compare yeast and human in both experiments and phylogenetic RNA/protein-sequence analyses, revealing many conserved features. They delineate the minimal domain at the C-terminal region of Prp3 protein required for stably binding an RNA of U4-U6 stem II and the U6 3' terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: it may help to show schematically also the minimal U4-U6 RNA used in binding assays). This is used for solving the protein structure in that part of Prp3, in addition also together with a minimal U4-U6 RNA duplex. They are able to resolve the protein-RNA interaction at the U6-3' terminal region, but not at the U4-U6 stem region. RNA-protein contacts are probed and confirmed by mutant analysis. To investigate the protein recognition of the U4-U6 double-stranded region, they use hydroxyl radical footprinting with the minimal U4-U6 RNA fused into one RNA, which supports their model that the Prp3 peptide preceding the C-terminal DUF domain contacts the U4-U6 stem II.</p><p>They discuss their data in the context of the extensive mutant data from previous work in both yeast and human systems, in particular of the U6 snRNA mutant effects. Although earlier data were discussed mostly in terms of mutual stabilities of single-snRNA versus U4-U6 duplex RNAs, they add the aspect that these mutations likely also have effects on Prp3 protein binding. Overall, a very comprehensive and careful study I can recommend for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript &quot;A composite double-/single-stranded RNA-binding region in protein Prp3 supports tri-snRNP stability and splicing”, Liu et al. present a structural and functional analysis of the spliceosomal protein Prp3, which is implicated in reassembly of U4/U6 di-snRNA during recycling of the spliceosome. The manuscript is well written and mostly clear although sometimes not easy to follow due to complex nomenclature and description of residue and nucleotide numbers that are not always obvious. The results provide significant novel insight into our understanding of spliceosome assembly but also on protein-RNA recognition. Prp3 recognizes specifically an overhang of U6 snRNA, which is suggested to help to release Prp24 and enable binding to U4 snRNA in conjunction with other factors like Prp31 and Snu13.</p><p>The importance of the findings, quality of research, and presentation of results are in principle suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are some important aspects that need further attention and should be addressed by the authors:</p><p>The manuscript nicely and clearly demonstrates the recognition of the single-stranded RNA region by the globular domain in Prp3. However, the authors also report that the N-terminal region of their crystallization construct seems “to foster RNA contacts”, but that these are not discernible in the electron density. Later they add several experiments to support their initial findings about the importance of this region in U4/U6 di-snRNP assembly (maybe a reordering of the manuscript concerning this region could improve the reading flow). From the structure determined by X-ray crystallography it seems plausible that this presumably flexible tail is indeed present in the crystals and stabilizes the complex by contacts to the stem helix. Given that the manuscript mainly focuses on the structural biology of the complex, and that the recognition of the U4/U6 duplex region may also be an important aspect of the Prp3 interactions, it is a little disappointing that no additional efforts were made to further clarify the contribution of these regions for in complex formation. Straightforward experiments that would greatly help to clarify this point:</p><p>Binding affinities should be quantitatively determined comparing different constructs of the protein, i.e. with or without the disordered extension, but also using additional (point) mutations. Here, ITC, SPR or fluorescence polarization experiments could be employed.</p><p>Potentially, NMR binding studies could identify critical residues for the interaction in the unstructured region which could be further probed by mutational analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07320.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>However, as you will see in the reviews below, there were also major differences of opinion regarding the work, including serious criticism.

In both experimental setups, we find that wt Prp3 CTF binds to an RNA construct containing U4/U6 stem II and a 13 nucleotide U6 3’-overhang about two to three times more strongly than variants of the CTF bearing R304A or R322A exchanges in the N-terminal peptide or the DUF1115 domain alone. For details regarding these new data please refer to the new Figure panels 1C, 1D and 1F. We have also more carefully discussed this point in the beginning of the revised Discussion section.</p><p><italic>There was also some criticism on the presentation of the data, and both the Introduction, the first part of the Results, and some of the Discussion sections were considered difficult to read, fraught with too many details. Some of this is due to confusing switches between human and yeast nomenclature, and would require considerable rewriting and streamlining</italic>.</p><p>We streamlined the entire manuscript.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>We did not see specific criticism by the Reviewers concerning the Introduction. Regarding this section, we have followed the advice of Reviewer 3 and have included more original references in the first paragraph.</p><p>Results:</p><p>We agree that the detailed descriptions of our experiments with human and yeast proteins at the beginning of the Results section might have been confusing. We therefore have removed some details and have grouped the Results differently as suggested by Reviewer 3. We now start the Results with a short section on human Prp3, which we felt should remain in the manuscript, as we used this protein to experimentally define the C-terminal region as the major U4/U6 di-snRNA-binding portion of Prp3 orthologs. However, as mapping of the RNA structure requirements gave very similar results in the human and yeast systems, we removed the human RNA mapping experiments and now exclusively present these analyses for the yeast system. Also all following parts of the Results (additional biochemical, crystal structure and functional analyses) were conducted with yeast factors.</p><p>Furthermore, we have now combined all experiments, which relate to how portions of the protein and RNAs interact with each other, in the first part of the Results (i.e. quantification of relative affinities of different Prp3 fragments/variants and RNA variants as well as differential influence of Prp3 variants on Brr2-mediated U4/U6 unwinding). Finally, we have also placed the analysis of binding cooperativities among U4/U6 proteins directly after the first section on interaction mapping. In this fashion, all biochemical data on the minimal interacting regions and on the role of different protein portions in RNA binding and binding cooperativity are now grouped together at the beginning of the Results.</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>At the beginning of the revised Discussion, we now briefly summarize our experimental evidence that the C-terminal regions of Prp3 orthologs constitute a unique, conserved, composite ds/ss RNA-binding element. Following comments by Reviewer 1, we have now removed several of the more speculative parts of the Discussion (such as the possible role of disease [RP18]-related residues, for which we have no direct experimental evidence, as well as the possible role of Prp3 contacts to Prp24 and/or LSm proteins during U4/U6 re-assembly). We have retained a discussion of previous U4/U6 mutagenesis studies, as many of the previously probed residues are directly contacting Prp3 in our crystal structure; however, an influence of the manipulations on Prp3 binding was not considered at that time. Furthermore, we kept a brief discussion of possible mechanisms underlying the cooperative binding of U4/U6-interacting proteins, as we present data directly relating to this point. However, with respect to comments by Reviewer 1, we now briefly mention that the proteins might modulate each other’s interactions with the RNAs upon binding. Finally, although somewhat speculative, we have retained a discussion of a possible role of Prp3 in re-assembly of the U4/U6 di-snRNP. U6 snRNA regions contained in our crystal structures were also seen in a recently published Prp24-U6 snRNA complex structure, in which they take on a different conformation. Having these two structural snapshots in hand, we think it is important to comment on possible mechanisms of how one functional state (Prp24-U6) could interconvert into the other functional state (U4/U6 di-snRNP).</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>This manuscript presents crystallographic analysis of structures of Prp3 a U4/U6 di-snRNP. Structures of both Prp3 alone and bound to U4/U6 are presented. While some useful new information is obtained, e.g. what appears to be a novel RNA biding motif in Prp3, I have some concerns about the impact of the work. These include the fact that interaction between Prp3 and stem II of U4/U6 is not well resolved</italic>.</p><p>Unfortunately, the relevant region of the protein is not well ordered in the crystal and thus did not allow us to resolve the presumed direct contacts of Prp3 to the stem II region of U4/U6. Although we tried extensively (also testing different RNA and protein constructs), we did not obtain a different crystal form, in which this region was better resolved. We now conducted additional EMSA titrations and ITC experiments using wt and mutant Prp3 constructs (lacking or containing the basic peptide preceding the DUF1115 domain and with or without point mutations in this preceding peptide) and various RNA constructs (new Figure panels 1C, 1D and 1F). The results are consistent with our idea that the peptide preceding the DUF1115 domain binds to the stem II portion of U4/U6 di-snRNAs. We have briefly summarized our combined experimental evidence regarding this point at the beginning of the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>Additionally, the relevance of these structures in the absence of Snu13 and Prp31 is questionable given that the three proteins bind U4/U6 cooperatively. It seems quite possible that the presence of Snu13 and or Prp31 could alter the functionally relevant conformation of Prp3</italic>.</p><p>While it is certainly possible that Prp3, Prp31 and Snu13 contact each other on U4/U6, we consider it highly unlikely that such interactions would change the conformation of the DUF1115 domain and the way it interacts with the U6 3’-overhang, which constitutes a major aspect of our work. However, it is imaginable that the N-terminal stem II-binding peptide might be influenced by the other two proteins and we therefore now briefly point this out in the revised Discussion:</p><p>“It is also conceivable that the Prp3 stem II-binding peptide directly contacts Snu13 and/or Prp31 on the RNAs and that the latter two proteins even modulate how the peptide interacts with stem II.”</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Throughout this paper they compare yeast and human in both experiments and phylogenetic RNA/protein-sequence analyses, revealing many conserved features. They delineate the minimal domain at the C-terminal region of Prp3 protein required for stably binding an RNA of U4-U6 stem II and the U6 3' terminus (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1A</italic></xref><italic>: it may help to show schematically also the minimal U4-U6 RNA used in binding assays). This is used for solving the protein structure in that part of Prp3, in addition also together with a minimal U4-U6 RNA duplex. They are able to resolve the protein-RNA interaction at the U6-3' terminal region, but not at the U4-U6 stem region. RNA-protein contacts are probed and confirmed by mutant analysis. To investigate the protein recognition of the U4-U6 double-stranded region, they use hydroxyl radical footprinting with the minimal U4-U6 RNA fused into one RNA, which supports their model that the Prp3 peptide preceding the C-terminal DUF domain contacts the U4-U6 stem II</italic>.</p><p>We agree and have now included schemes of RNA constructs used in all relevant Figures of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>The manuscript nicely and clearly demonstrates the recognition of the single-stranded RNA region by the globular domain in Prp3. However, the authors also report that the N-terminal region of their crystallization construct seems “to foster RNA contacts”, but that these are not discernible in the electron density. Later they add several experiments to support their initial findings about the importance of this region in U4/U6 di-snRNP assembly (maybe a reordering of the manuscript concerning this region could improve the reading flow)</italic>.</p><p>We have restructured the manuscript as suggested. In the revised manuscript, all biochemical data on the minimal interacting regions and on the role of different protein portions in RNA binding and U4/U6 unwinding by Brr2 are now grouped together at the beginning of the Results. This is followed by a brief section on the binding cooperativity with other U4/U6 proteins.</p><p><italic>From the structure determined by X-ray crystallography it seems plausible that this presumably flexible tail is indeed present in the crystals and stabilizes the complex by contacts to the stem helix. Given that the manuscript mainly focuses on the structural biology of the complex, and that the recognition of the U4/U6 duplex region may also be an important aspect of the Prp3 interactions, it is a little disappointing that no additional efforts were made to further clarify the contribution of these regions for in complex formation. Straightforward experiments that would greatly help to clarify this point</italic>:</p><p><italic>Binding affinities should be quantitatively determined comparing different constructs of the protein, i.e. with and without the disordered extension, but also using additional (point) mutations. Here, ITC, SPR or fluorescence polarization experiments could be employed</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have conducted additional EMSA titrations and ITC experiments to quantify the relative affinities of the wt Prp3 CTF (DUF1115 domain plus preceding basic peptide), the same fragment bearing single Arg-to-Ala exchanges in the N-terminal peptide presumed to bind stem II (R304A and R322A) as well as of the DUF1115 domain alone (without the preceding peptide) to an RNA construct containing U4/U6 stem II and a 13 nucleotide U6 3’-overhang. The trends in the affinities (wt binding several fold more strongly than R304A, R322A or DUF1115) support the idea that the peptide preceding the DUF1115 domain also elicits RNA contacts. We also carried out additional EMSA titrations with RNA constructs, in which we converted a conserved non-canonical pyrimidine-pyrimidine base pair of stem II to a Watson-Crick pair. For details on the quantifications of the relative interactions strengths please refer to the new Figure panels 1C, 1D and 1F.</p><p>Together, the results suggest that there are contacts of the C-terminal fragment of Prp3 to stem II. As based on our crystal structures, contacts to stem II cannot originate from the DUF1115 domain, our results suggest that the preceding basic peptide entertains these interactions with stem II. Our arguments concerning the Prp3-U4/U6 interaction mode are now briefly summarized at the beginning of the new Discussion section.</p><p><italic>Potentially, NMR binding studies could identify critical residues for the interaction in the unstructured region which could be further probed by mutational analysis</italic>.</p><p>Simple NMR-based binding studies would only yield similar insight as, e.g., ITC (i.e. allow to assess differences in affinities of different protein variants), which we now have conducted. An in-depth NMR study to identify residues that directly contact the RNAs would not only require the production of more complex isotope-labeled proteins but also lengthy resonance assignments, which are out of the scope of the present work and not part of our own expertise.</p></body></sub-article></article>
