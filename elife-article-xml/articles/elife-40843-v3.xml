dynamic range. Here we show that an operant conditioning paradigm which provides neurofeedback of the size of motor evoked potentials (MEPs) in response to transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), enables participants to self-modulate their own brain state. Following training, participants were able to robustly increase (by 83.8%) and decrease (by 30.6%) their MEP amplitudes. This volitional up-versus down-regulation of corticomotor excitability caused an increase of late-cortical disinhibition (LCD), a TMS derived read-out of presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> disinhibition, which was accompanied by an increase of gamma and a decrease of alpha oscillations in the trained hemisphere. This approach paves the way for future investigations into how altered brain state influences motor neurophysiology and recovery of function in a neurorehabilitation context.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurofeedback</kwd><kwd>excitability</kwd><kwd>motor</kwd><kwd>neural oscillations</kwd><kwd>gamma</kwd><kwd>disinhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>320030_175616</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wenderoth</surname><given-names>Nicole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002081</institution-id><institution>Irish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GOIPD/2017/798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ruddy</surname><given-names>Kathy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Changing brain state using feedback from transcranial magnetic stimulation, by training participants to increase or decrease how excitable their motor pathways are.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rhythmic oscillatory brain activity at rest is associated with high versus low neuronal responsiveness, or ‘excitability’ of a region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jensen et al., 2011</xref>). Measuring these momentary fluctuations of neural activity via electro- or magnetoencephalography (EEG/MEG) over human primary motor cortex (M1), it has been demonstrated that frequency, amplitude and phase of the ongoing oscillation cycle systematically modulate responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zarkowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sauseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schaworonkow et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kelly et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mazaheri et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schubert et al., 2006</xref>). In particular, it has been shown that corticomotor excitability is significantly higher when the power (amplitude) of sensorimotor rhythms in the alpha band (8–14 Hz, also called the ‘mu’-rhythm), or beta band (15–30 Hz) are low, or when M1 is stimulated during the trough of the oscillatory cycle of these rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zaehle et al., 2010</xref>). This concept has inspired neurofeedback interventions whereby, for example, stroke patients learn to volitionally desynchronize sensorimotor rhythms with the goal of bringing the sensorimotor system into a more excitable state as a precursor for enhanced neural plasticity and accelerated recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caria et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Soekadar et al., 2015a</xref>).</p><p>Previous research has focussed on interactions between corticomotor excitability and cortical dynamics at rest, but much less is known about whether it is possible to <italic>voluntarily</italic> control the excitability of sensorimotor circuits while keeping motor output and sensory feedback constant. In the case of stroke rehabilitation, this mechanism may become particularly relevant as patients are unable to move or receive sensory feedback from the paretic limb. Therefore, interventions that optimally harness the residual ability to voluntarily and endogenously activate relevant brain circuits in the days and weeks after the incident, may provide the crucial innervation necessary to promote re-wiring for functional recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maulden et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>It is well known that primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2013</xref>), and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mellinger et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Soekadar et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sitaram et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>) can gain volitional control of neural activity by receiving neurofeedback via a brain-computer interface (BCI). Here, we used a BCI-neurofeedback approach as an effective method for training participants to both volitionally upregulate and downregulate corticomotor excitability as reflected by the size of TMS-evoked motor potentials (MEPs), with the aim to modulate their amplitudes over a much larger dynamic range than observed during rest. Using this approach enabled us to investigate the neural mechanisms that underlie volitional up- versus down-regulation of corticospinal excitability in the motor system and the associated oscillatory signatures. By modulating one neural marker, motor evoked potential amplitude, while measuring independent modalities using EEG, or paired-pulse TMS, this approach allows us to causally relate voluntary rather than incidental changes of corticomotor excitability to cortical dynamics.</p><p>To achieve this goal we developed a BCI by stimulating the cortex with TMS and providing neurofeedback of MEP amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The feedback was designed such that participants were rewarded for larger than average MEPs in one condition, and smaller than average in another condition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40843.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline of experimental setup.</title><p>Each trial of neurofeedback training commenced with a display of four circles (<bold>A</bold>) each representing the background EMG in one of the recorded hand muscles (right FDI, ADM and OP, and left FDI). The circles were red if the root mean squared (rms) EMG at rest was greater than seven microvolts. It was essential that all four circles were green for at least 500 ms before the trial could proceed. When this condition was met a fixation cross appeared for a random period (in order to prevent anticipation of the TMS pulse). During the fixation period, it was still essential to keep the background EMG below seven microvolts in order for a TMS pulse to be delivered.

In the UP training if the MEP was greater than the baseline mean, the rectangle was green, with a green tick, a dollar sign to indicate a small financial reward, a display of the current score, and a positive encouraging sound bite was heard. If the MEP did not meet the criterion amplitude, the bar was red, there was no dollar sign, and a negative sound bite was heard.

After the training we characterised the neural underpinnings of these two distinct activity states in detail by conducting a series of multimodal experiments using EEG and paired pulse TMS to profile the associated oscillatory and neurophysiological processes. As it has been proposed that dynamic modulation of neuronal activity is realized via synchronization of high frequency rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fries, 2005</xref>) which are tightly coupled to desynchronizing sensorimotor rhythms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grosse-Wentrup et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesised that Gamma synchronisation (31–80 Hz) and alpha (8–13 Hz)/beta (14–30 Hz) desynchronization play a critical role in actively determining the state of the motor cortex. Specifically, we hypothesised that following UP neurofeedback training, MEP amplitudes would be increased, and this volitional upregulation would be associated with increased gamma synchronisation and alpha/beta desynchronization. Concurrent reductions in TMS-derived measures of inhibition were also hypothesised during upregulation. The reverse pattern was predicted following DOWN neurofeedback training.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Bidirectional changes in corticospinal excitability were observed in the MEP neurofeedback group but not in a control group</title><p>We first tested whether participants could learn to volitionally increase or decrease (bidirectional) corticomotor excitability when using a motor imagery strategy shaped by neurofeedback of MEP amplitudes.

Importantly, this control analysis revealed no such interactions on any of the sessions, suggesting that the observed modulation was not driven by changes in peripheral activity of the target muscle, nor any of the additional three control muscles (OP, ADM, left FDI) (all p &gt; 0.18, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 2, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

As distinct functions have been ascribed to eight different sub-frequency bands across the known range of brain signals (0.1–80 Hz), we now probed whether volitional changes in corticospinal excitability of M1, drives neural activity measured in the delta (0.1–4 Hz), theta (5–7 Hz), low alpha (8–10 Hz), high alpha (11–13 Hz), low beta (14–21 Hz), high beta (22–30 Hz), low gamma (31–50 Hz) and high gamma (51–80 Hz) bands. Using the portion of EEG data collected in the 1.5 s prior to each TMS pulse, we calculated relative power in the UP and DOWN states for the eight frequency bands of interest. At this point, one subject was excluded from further EEG analyses due to extremely high Gamma values exceeding 3xSDs above the mean. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–f</xref> (n = 14) shows that UP- versus DOWN regulating corticomotor excitability caused reduced band-limited power in the theta and alpha band (blue areas in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b–d</xref>) while gamma power was clearly increased.

A linear support vector machine (SVM) was applied to the data of each participant (60 UP 60 DOWN epochs). The SVM has been shown to be particularly powerful on EEG data, which is noisy and contains many features that are correlated. This approach additionally allowed us to perform feature selection, to quantify which EEG features most heavily contributed to the distinction between the two states. Using only data from the electrode closest to the hotspot (eight rhythms plus LowGamma:HighAlpha ratio) the SVM was capable of classifying the brain states with an average accuracy of 81.5% (±5.1%) based on 10-fold cross validation which differed significantly (p = 0.001, n = 14) from a null model revealed by permutation testing (accuracy null model: 49.0% ± 13). Additionally, incorporating data from the same rhythms recorded at the corresponding electrode in the opposite hemisphere increased this accuracy to 85.1% (±4.6%) across participants (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 1). Using feature ranking based on Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE), taking the mode of the top ranked features across participants revealed that the strongest contribution to the high classification accuracy of the latter SVM was the High Gamma rhythm in the hotspot electrode, followed by High Alpha at the hotspot, then the LowGamma:HighAlpha ratio (for full ranking order see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 1).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we aimed to uncover neural activity evoked by voluntarily facilitating or suppressing excitability within sensorimotor circuits, while keeping motor or muscle contraction-related sensory feedback constant. We show that using a bidirectional TMS-neurofeedback approach is critical to gain volitional control over MEP amplitudes, a skill that is retained for at least 6 months without further training. This voluntary state-setting with a large dynamic range was related to variation in a paired-pulse TMS proxy measure of pre-synaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> mediated disinhibition, and to a prominent increase of gamma power in sensorimotor cortex for the UP state which was accompanied by a clear reduction of power in the theta, low and high alpha bands.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that it is possible to gain voluntary control over activity in the central nervous system if appropriate neurofeedback is embedded in a reinforcement learning task, with food rewards for animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fetz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2013</xref>) and visually rewarding stimuli for humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majid et al., 2015</xref>). Here we confirm that this approach is also suitable for learning how corticomotor excitability can be bidirectionally up- or down-regulated. Our participants were initially familiarized with two motor imagery strategies which are known to modulate corticospinal excitability in the required manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majid et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stinear et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izumi et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fadiga et al., 1999</xref>). Learning, however, indicated by progressively stronger dissociation between the UP and the DOWN state, only took place when direct low-latency feedback regarding the MEP amplitude was provided. After training, participants were able to modulate corticomotor excitability across a large range so that MEP amplitudes were approximately twice as large during the UP than the DOWN condition. UP training, in particular, resulted in an 83.8% increase of MEP amplitudes from baseline, while downregulation of MEP amplitude was possible (e.g. see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majid et al., 2015</xref>) but more difficult (30.6% decrease from baseline). Once acquired, volitional control of corticomotor excitability was retained for at least 6 months and could be performed even without online feedback indicating true, long-term learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Magill, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Once participants could control their corticomotor excitability, we uncovered the electrophysiological underpinnings by applying measurements that were independent of the feedback modality (single pulse TMS) and investigated whether there were differences between the UP versus DOWN state. This approach cancelled out the effects that were common to both mental strategies, isolating the mechanisms underlying the MEP modulation. This revealed two key novel electrophysiological findings, involving presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> disinhibition, and gamma oscillations. Additionally, the pronounced changes of cortical physiology despite the absence of motor or muscle contraction-related sensory input suggests that the increase vs decrease of corticomotor excitability was -at least partly- of cortical origin rather than mediated by spinal cord mechanisms.</p><p>The UP state was associated with a significant increase of LCD while other measurements probing inhibitory M1 circuits failed to reveal differential effects for the UP versus DOWN state. LCD is thought to represent a read-out of the presynaptic self-inhibition of GABAergic neurons which is thought to be mediated by extrasynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub> auto-receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mott and Lewis, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanger et al., 2001</xref>). This mechanism is hypothesized to result in a net facilitatory effect as observed during the UP condition in our study. Previously, LCD was found to be elevated during motor imagery (MI), but this increase relative to rest was observed irrespective of whether participants imagined voluntarily activating or relaxing hand muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chong and Stinear, 2017</xref>). However, this investigation was conducted in a single session, and did not employ neurofeedback, so MEP modulation by these two imagination conditions could be expected to be substantially smaller than observed in our study, particularly for the voluntary relaxation condition which had a similar excitability state as the rest condition. Thus, it is possible that the clear modulation of LCD observed here only manifested after neurofeedback training, that is when the two excitability states became clearly distinct. It is important to note here that in our protocol, LCD was detected only during the UP state and not at rest. In our search procedure to decide upon the optimum conditioning stimulus (CS) intensities, we prioritized SICI and LICI, finding a CS intensity that elicited as close to 50% inhibition of the test MEP as possible. We tested intensities between 106–114% RMT for LICI (and above or below this if no appropriate inhibition was found), and applied these also to LCD (such that the only difference between the LCD and LICI protocols was the ISI). This may have simply been too low to consistently elicit LCD, which appears to be more robustly evoked at higher intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cash et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cash et al., 2016</xref>) or during mild contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caux-Dedeystère et al., 2014</xref>), and is not observed in all individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cash et al., 2016</xref>). It may also be that LCD is more readily observed using triple pulse procedures in which disinhibition can more directly be measured by the reduction of SICI following a priming stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sanger et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cash et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ni et al., 2007</xref>). The increase in MEP amplitude observed in the TMS-feedback induced UP state, may also be related to the increase in I-wave recruitment that has been reported during LCD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cash et al., 2011</xref>) and suggests that further research into this effect is warranted, with parameters more specifically tailored to investigate LCD.</p><p>The potential contribution of I-wave mechanisms to the current results can be speculated upon by considering the literature relating disinhibition to short-interval intracortical facilitation (SICF). SICF is mediated by excitatory networks in the motor cortex, which are believed to be responsible for the production of I-waves at a periodicity of around 1.5 ms. When measured in the presence of inhibition (eg. during the LICI time period), the magnitude of SICF remains unchanged, whereas if measured during the period of disinhibition (LCD), SICF is found to be enhanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cash et al., 2011</xref>). In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cash et al. (2011)</xref>, it was concluded that disinhibition, rather than inhibition, modulates the excitatory networks of SICF, and therefore of I-wave generation. They further suggest that the increase in SICF in periods of disinhibition supports the view that this is an opportune time period to achieve optimal modulation of synaptic networks while they are in a state that is less constrained by ongoing inhibitory processes. In the context of the current results, it may accordingly be predicted that SICF (and recruitment of I-waves in general) would be increased in magnitude during the UP condition, but this is a speculation that will require further experimental testing.</p><p>We observed significant modulation of the alpha and gamma rhythms close to M1 of the trained hemisphere. Focusing on data from the recording electrode closest to each individual’s hotspot revealed a significant association between low alpha and high gamma power for the UP versus DOWN state. Trial-by-trial modulation of these rhythms correlated significantly with MEP amplitude, and a support vector machine (SVM) classifying the two states based on EEG data ranked the high gamma and high alpha band as the two top features characterizing the distinction. Our observation of reciprocal changes in the alpha and gamma band are in line with previous studies using transcranial as well as intracranial recording methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>). The ‘pulsed inhibition’ theory suggests that repeated bursts of inhibitory alpha activity serve to temporarily silence gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>). Thus, these two rhythms are seen to exhibit a reciprocal relationship, whereby when alpha is high, gamma is low. In periods of high alpha, gamma may still burst periodically, but only at the troughs of the oscillation cycle, meaning that the gamma ‘duty cycle’ (window for neural processing) is short, and only brief messages can be sent. By contrast, in periods of low alpha power, the gamma duty cycle is longer, and more extensive neuronal processing and inter-regional communication may occur. Our finding of increased gamma activity is also consistent with previous animal literature, showing that the pharmacological removal of GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition (by receptor blockage) in rats results in increased gamma oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leung and Shen, 2007</xref>) which have been shown to be largest in M1’s layer V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Johnson et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Gamma has often been considered difficult to detect using scalp electrodes because it is highly localised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>) and may also reflect non-cortical sources when recorded with EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yuval-Greenberg et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Whitham et al., 2007</xref>). However, it is tempting to speculate that, in our experiment, gamma activity was strongly synchronized as a consequence of the neurofeedback training, where participants learned to substantially facilitate corticomotor excitability while keeping EMG activity constant, such that EMG amplitude differed only minimally between the UP and DOWN conditions. This suggestion is in line with previous neurofeedback studies that provided direct feedback of gamma activity, showing that gamma power could be upregulated to a substantial amount which even exceeded power values observed during movement execution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Engelhard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2010</xref>). By keeping the visual feedback for the two conditions identical, we ensured that differences in eye movements between the UP and DOWN states were minor. As we were particularly interested in gamma oscillations, we additionally performed all EEG recordings in an electromagnetically shielded room, using a gel-based electrode system to maximize signal to noise ratio.</p><p>Previous studies have taken a correlational approach to investigating the relationships between brain rhythms and corticomotor excitability. These have shown that low alpha (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sauseng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zrenner et al., 2018</xref>) or beta power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mäki and Ilmoniemi, 2010</xref>) as well as high gamma power (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zarkowski et al., 2006</xref>) during natural fluctuations at rest are associated with larger MEP amplitudes. We confirm and extend these results by introducing causality to this relationship for the first time, showing that experimentally driving excitability into two distinct states causes specific patterns of neural dynamics in the volitionally controlled cortical area.</p><p>While changes in alpha and gamma were specific to the hemisphere from which feedback was provided, theta showed a bilateral pattern of modulation, being higher in the DOWN than the UP state in motor areas in both hemispheres. While mid-frontal theta activity has been linked to error monitoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pezzetta et al., 2018</xref>) the role of lateralized theta activity close to the sensorimotor hotspot electrode and its symmetric counterpart is less clear. Slower rhythms exert effects over larger distances, and are thought to be involved in long-range communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buzsaki, 2006</xref>). A similar pattern of upregulation and downregulation was observed in the homologous muscle in the opposite limb, albeit weaker and not statistically significant. This is likely a reflection of the extensive transcallosal structural connectivity and functional coupling of homologous regions of the cortical motor network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruddy et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruddy et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ruddy, 2017</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that the bilateral theta activity observed in the current study served to regulate the inhibition/facilitation of functional coupling or ‘spillover’ of activation from motor areas in the target hemisphere to their homologous counterparts.</p><p>Surprisingly we did not observe differential modulation of the Beta band, which is the predominant oscillatory frequency in sensorimotor cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Murthy and Fetz, 1996</xref>). It typically desynchronizes (together with alpha) during motor execution and motor imagery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ramos-Murguialday and Birbaumer, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfurtscheller and Neuper, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfurtscheller and Berghold, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alegre et al., 2004</xref>) and has been associated with corticomotor excitability at rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zarkowski et al., 2006</xref>). As our results represent the direct contrast between the UP and DOWN states, the lack of Beta involvement may firstly be due to the fact that both conditions involved a mental strategy targeted at the sensorimotor system and, secondly, that no temporal structure was imposed so that we could not perform analyses which are, for example, time-locked to the potential onset of these mental strategies. However, our data further confirm that the two ‘inhibitory’ rhythms alpha and beta might serve different functions in selecting and activating the appropriate sensorimotor representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brinkman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we present an innovative approach to voluntarily and bidirectionally change the state of the motor cortex, by directly targeting MEP amplitudes in a neurofeedback paradigm. This method provided a unique opportunity to reveal the oscillatory and neurochemical underpinnings of the two distinct trained brain states, using concurrent TMS EEG measurements, and mechanistic follow-up investigations using paired-pulse TMS. The results comparing UP and DOWN states indicate that voluntary upregulation of corticomotor excitability causes increased presynaptic GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated disinhibition, elevated neural oscillations in the gamma frequency range, and reduced alpha and theta rhythms.</p><p>This paves the way for new technologies that allow the user to regulate aspects of their own brain function in order to reach desired states that are, for example, associated with enhanced motor performance. In the context of stroke rehabilitation, training volitional modulation of corticomotor excitability may hold promise as a rehabilitative therapy early after stroke, that is when patients are deprived of rehabilitation training because they are unable to execute overt movements with the impaired upper limb. As it is known that LCD is recruited during actual movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caux-Dedeystère et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hammond and Vallence, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Opie et al., 2015</xref>), the elevated LCD we observed in the UP condition may reflect that the neurofeedback had engaged similar mechanisms to those involved in movement execution, using only voluntary endogenous processes. Furthermore, as pathological hyperexcitability of the non-damaged hemisphere has been hypothesized to limit recovery in some patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murase et al., 2004</xref>), the TMS-neurofeedback protocol can be individually tailored either to upregulate the damaged hemisphere, down-regulate the intact hemisphere, or a combination of both, depending on the patient’s specific needs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>Fifteen healthy volunteers (age 23 ± 3.14 s.d, seven female) participated in the experimental group.

The experiments were approved by the Kantonale Ethikkommission Zürich (KEK-ZH-Nr. 2014–0242), and were conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">World Medical Association, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>TMS-based neurofeedback</title><p>Participants undertook five sessions of TMS-based neurofeedback, on separate days. The first four days comprised of neurofeedback training, and on the fifth day neurofeedback was performed with simultaneous electroencephalography (EEG) recording to investigate state specific neural dynamics. On two of the training days neurofeedback was adjusted so that a rewarding visual stimulus was displayed when MEPs were larger than baseline (the ‘UP’ condition) and on the other two days, the rewarding stimulus was displayed when MEPs were smaller than baseline (the ‘DOWN’ condition). On each of the training days, four separate blocks of neurofeedback were preformed, each comprising of 30 individual MEP feedback trials (total 120 trials per day). The format of individual trials and feedback is described in more detail below, and an outline of experimental design is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 7. Baseline corticospinal excitability was measured on each day prior to training (20 MEPs) and post-measurements were taken during the rest periods between each of the four blocks (12 MEPs per measurement).</p><p>Subjects sat in a comfortable chair with both arms and legs resting in a neutral position supported by foam pillows. Surface electromyography (EMG, Trigno Wireless; Delsys) was recorded from right First Dorsal Interosseous (FDI), Abductor Digiti Minimi (ADM), Opponens Pollicis (OP), and left FDI. EMG data were sampled at 2000 Hz (National Instruments, Austin, Texas), amplified and stored on a PC for off-line analysis.</p><p>TMS was performed with a figure-of-eight coil (internal coil diameter 50 mm) connected to a Magstim 200 stimulator (Magstim, Whitland, UK). The coil was held on the left hemisphere over the ‘hotspot’ of the right FDI at the location with the largest and most consistent MEPs, and with the optimal orientation for evoking a descending volley in the corticospinal tract (approximately 45 degrees from the sagittal plane in order to induce posterior-anterior current flow). Once the hotspot was established, the lowest stimulation intensity at which MEPs with peak-to-peak amplitude of approximately 50μV were evoked in at least 5 of 10 consecutive trials was taken as Resting Motor Threshold (RMT).</p><p>The stimulation intensity used to evoke MEPs during the experiment was chosen using the following procedure in order to obtain a baseline MEP amplitude that was 50% of the participant’s maximum. A recruitment curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carson et al. (2013)</xref> was performed at the beginning of the first experimental session, whereby 6 TMS pulses were applied at 10 different intensities relative to RMT (90%, 100%, 110%, 120%, 130%, 140%, 150%, 160%, 180%, 190%) in a randomized order. MEP amplitude at each intensity was plotted to determine the point on the curve at which plateau occurs and the MEPs do not continue to increase. Maximal MEP amplitude was recorded, and the intensity required to evoke 50% of this amplitude was used for all subsequent testing. With this approach, there was scope for MEP amplitude to both increase and decrease to similar extents from this ‘intermediate’ value. Post-hoc analyses revealed that this procedure resulted in an average stimulation intensity corresponding to 130% RMT. Immediately following this procedure and prior to the first block of neurofeedback, 20 MEPs were collected at rest at the chosen intensity to determine ‘baseline’ corticospinal excitability. The mean MEP amplitude at baseline was recorded and used during neurofeedback to establish the criterion amplitude that determined whether participants received either positive or negative feedback.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Format of neurofeedback</title><p>Neurofeedback was performed using custom written MATLAB software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ruddy, 2018</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/TMS-neurofeedback">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/TMS-neurofeedback</ext-link>). Participants kept eyes open with attention directed to a monitor in front of them. They were instructed to relax their limbs and avoid tensing any muscles throughout the experiment. In order to ensure that MEP amplitude could not be influenced by background muscle activation, the root mean square (rms) of the EMG signal for each muscle for the previous 100 ms of data was calculated and displayed in real-time on screen at the beginning of each trial in the form of four coloured ‘traffic lights’, representing each muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). If the background EMG in a muscle exceeded 7μV, the corresponding light immediately turned red, and stayed red until the EMG dropped below 7μV. Even when the rms EMG dropped below 7 μV, this had to be sustained for 500 ms in order for the software to trigger the remainder of the trial to commence. When this criterion was met, the traffic lights were replaced by a fixation cross which appeared in the centre of the screen indicating that the trial has started. After a variable period of time (between 5.5–8.5 s, or longer if the trials was paused due to muscle activation as described below) a TMS pulse was fired. This variable fixation interval was included to ensure that participants were unable to anticipate the pulse timing, or engage a timely EMG-based strategy just prior to TMS delivery. Note that also during this variable fixation interval background EMG continued to be monitored in the same fashion as prior to the trial, that is the trial was automatically paused until rms EMG of all muscles dropped below 7 μV for at least 500 ms.</p><p>The MEP amplitude for the target muscle (right FDI) was immediately measured and displayed to the participant on screen within 500 ms. The display consisted of a vertical bar indicating MEP amplitude relative to a horizontal line in the middle of the screen representing the mean recorded at baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In ‘UP’ sessions if the MEP was larger than the criterion amplitude, the bar was shown as green with a tick beside it, a positive sound bite was heard, and a number adjacent to a dollar sign incremented to indicate that a small financial reward had been gained. If the MEP was smaller than the criterion amplitude, the bar was red with a cross beside it, a negative sound bite was heard, and no financial reward was shown. The reverse was true in the ‘DOWN’ sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The feedback remained on screen for 4 s, before being replaced by the traffic lights display preceding the next trial. Participants were instructed to attend to the feedback and that the goal was to increase (or decrease) the size of the MEP represented by the bar. Prior to the experiment participants read an instruction sheet explaining the procedures above and providing recommended mental strategies that were reported in previous literature in which corticospinal excitability was downregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Majid et al., 2015</xref>) and upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Izumi et al., 1995</xref>) by motor imagery (Specific task instructions are provided in Supplementary Text. Also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> Table 6). Initially the criterion amplitude corresponded to the baseline MEP measure. After each block of 30 MEPs, performance was quantified and the task difficulty was adjusted if necessary. If the success rate was &gt;70% difficulty was increased by raising (or lowering in the DOWN condition) the criterion MEP amplitude that needed to be reached by 10% in order for the positive reward to be presented. If performance was &gt;90%, this was adjusted by 20%.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>EEG session</title><p>On the fifth day neurofeedback was provided during simultaneous EEG recording. The participant’s TMS hotspot was determined and marked on the scalp prior to EEG capping. EEG signals were recorded using a 64 channel gel-based TMS-compatible cap (Electrical Geodesics Inc., Oregon, USA), and the channel closest to the TMS hotspot was noted. EEG data were amplified and sampled at 1000 hz. In order to minimize artefacts associated with the direct contact of the TMS coil resting on the electrodes of the EEG cap, we designed and 3D-printed a custom plastic ‘coil spacer’ device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruddy et al., 2018</xref>), which has four wide legs positioned to provide a platform distributing the weight of the TMS coil, so that it hovers over the electrodes without contact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This allowed quality recordings to be obtained even from the channel of interest closest to the participant’s ‘hotspot’. The participants RMT was established while wearing the EEG cap with TMS coil spacer, and the same % above threshold that was used for all previous sessions was applied for neurofeedback. Impedances were monitored throughout and maintained below 50 kΩ.</p><p>Baseline corticospinal excitability was measured in the same fashion as for the first four sessions, followed by two blocks of neurofeedback (UP or DOWN, counterbalanced) with brief (12 MEP) post measurements following each. After the final post measurement, a 15 min rest break was scheduled for the participant. Following this, the procedure was repeated and baseline excitability was measured again, followed by two blocks of either UP or DOWN neurofeedback (whichever was not performed in the first half of the session). At the end of this session participants were debriefed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Control group</title><p>Participants were blinded as to whether they were allocated to the experimental or control group. The control group experienced identical conditions to the experimental group, with the exception that direct neurofeedback was not provided. The visual feedback bar demonstrating MEP amplitude was always the same height (reaching the ‘mean’ horizontal line). ‘Positive’ feedback/rewards were presented in the same proportion as in the experimental group (66% of all trials - calculated upon completion of experimental group), but at a fixed and predicable rate in order to prevent the development of illusory correlations. Participants were instructed to attend to the visual feedback on screen, and that rewards would occur at a fixed rate. Aside from this, they were otherwise given identical instructions as the participants in the experimental group- that is the same recommended mental strategies were provided on control ‘UP’ and ‘DOWN’ blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Data processing and analysis</title><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>MEP data</title><p>EMG data from all four hand muscles were band-pass filtered (30–800 Hz), separately for the portion of data containing the 100 ms of ‘pre-TMS’ background EMG, and for the portion of EMG containing the MEP, in order to prevent smearing of the MEP into the background EMG data chunk. The root mean square (rms) of the background EMG was calculated, and peak-peak MEP amplitude was measured. Trimming (removal) of the maximum and minimum MEP in each block was performed in order to screen out extreme values. MEP amplitude is known to be modulated by EMG background activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hess et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devanne et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, the rms pre-stimulus EMG recordings were used to assess the presence of unwanted background EMG activity in the period 110 to 10 ms preceding the magnetic pulse. MEPs preceded by background EMG higher than 0.01 mV were excluded. For each subject and over all trials we calculated the mean and standard deviation of the background EMG. MEPs that occurred when the background EMG value exceeded 2.5 standard deviations above the mean, and MEPs with a peak-to-peak amplitude which exceeded Q3 + 1.5 x (Q3 - Q1) were removed from further analysis, with Q1 denoting the first quartile and Q3 the third quartile computed over the whole set of trials for each subject.</p><p>Inferential statistics were computed using Mixed Effects Models in SPSS (Version 16.0, SPSS Inc.

This was to remove the substantial artefacts that arise during the magnetic pulses, prior to conducting any filtering or further processing. These separate chunks of unpolluted data were then concatenated into one continuous epoch, and highpass filtered at 1 Hz, prior to conducting an independent components analysis (ICA). Independent components were visualized and those containing artefacts arising from eye movements, facial EMG, cardiac signals, bad channels or other non-brain activity related signals were removed.</p><p>The cleaned data were average-referenced, and re-epoched into chunks of data containing only the 1.5 s on each trial prior to the TMS pulse (ie. to capture the ongoing oscillatory activity at the instance in which the TMS occurred, while the fixation cross was on screen and the ‘traffic lights’ had disappeared).</p><p>A power spectrum was computed (Welch periodogram/FFT) for each single epoch and the mean power (and relative power) in each of the relevant bandwidths were extracted (delta (0.1–4 Hz), theta (5–7 Hz), low alpha (8–10 Hz), high alpha (11–13 Hz), low beta (14–21 Hz), high beta (22–30 Hz), low gamma (31–50 Hz) and high gamma (51–80 Hz). Relative power was calculated per channel per epoch, with the power value for each individual frequency point (eg. 20 Hz) being expressed as a % of the total power within the spectrum for that epoch. Thus, the values are normalised across individuals so that large variations in absolute power values can not bias results. Power values were computed separately for UP and DOWN trials, and non-parametric Wilcoxon signed rank tests (with FDR correction) were used to compare neural oscillations in these two states.</p><p>We also analysed whether trial-by-trial variation of EEG data were associated with trial-by-trial variation of MEP amplitudes. Therefore, relative power in each bandwidth for each epoch was entered into a multiple regression model with MEP amplitudes measured in the muscle from which neurofeedback was provided (right FDI). The beta (slope) values resulting from each regression model for each participant were forwarded into a group-level analysis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Classification of distinct brain states</title><p>Individual epochs of EEG data (60 UP, 60 DOWN) were classified by a linear support vector machine (SVM, 10-fold cross validation), to test separately for each participant whether the epochs could be successfully predicted as ‘UP’ state or ‘DOWN’ state based solely on the power values (scaled by using 1/f transformed relative power) of the four frequency bands of interest. The SVM was chosen as it is known to perform particularly well in BCI settings using EEG data which is noisy and has features that are correlated. In order to validate the results the same procedure was repeated with randomly permuted labels, and this null model was statistically compared to the model with true labels (C = 1).

In this feedback-free block, the timing of trials and participant instructions were identical to normal neurofeedback blocks, but in place of the usual feedback bar showing MEP amplitude, the white fixation cross simply turned red during this period. The onset of trials was still contingent on muscles being completely relaxed, and the traffic lights display still preceded every trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Paired pulse TMS measurements</title><p>On separate days (one ‘UP’ one ‘DOWN) from the measurements described above, we performed three additional blocks of TMS neurofeedback (24 trials per block x 3 = 72 total trials), in which just 25% of trials were standard single pulse TMS-neurofeedback trials, with the usual feedback. The remaining trials contained paired pulses in place of the usual single pulse TMS. For all paired pulse measurements, the test stimulus intensity was identical to that which had been chosen for the TMS neurofeedback (ie. that produced MEPs that were 50% of the maximum on the recruitment curve). On 25% of trials Short Interval Intracortical Inhibition (SICI) was measured. This was with a conditioning stimulus intensity that was chosen using a personalized search procedure testing intensities ranging from 50–90% RMT, to achieve as close to 50% inhibition as possible, and an inter-stimulus interval of 1.97 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Peurala et al., 2008</xref>). The reduction in the size of the test MEP is believed to represent postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub> inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fisher et al., 2002</xref>). On 25% of trials Long Interval Intracortical Inhibition (LICI) was measured.

Four models were performed; One on data during all neurofeedback trials (10 levels of ‘trial’) modelling changes over the duration of training (across trials) that were modulated by trial type (UP or DOWN), demonstrating no systematic effects of MEP amplitude modulation on the quantity of trials that were retained for analysis. The three remaining models were conducted separately on the data from Session 1, Session two and Session 3, again revealing no significant modulation on any session. Mixed models employed a compound symmetry covariance matrix, fixed effects of ‘trial’ and ‘trial type’, and random effect of ‘participant’.</p><p>Supplementary Table 5: F tests following mixed effects models comparing background EMG across conditions and blocks for the retention test conducted months following initial training.

Each block of data collection is shown in a separate cell, with the beginning of testing indicated by red vertical lines. Each row depicts testing carried out on separate days unless indicated otherwise (Session 3). Blocks in which MEP neurofeedback was conducted are shaded in grey. All other measurements were taken at rest. Sessions 1 and 2 (blocks 1-8) were considered as ‘training’, as auditory and small financial rewards were presented during feedback. All subsequent blocks of neurofeedback (Session three onwards) were conducted post-training, without financial rewards. Auditory feedback was removed only for the EEG session, to avoid auditory-evoked potentials. The order of UP and DOWN feedback session types was counterbalanced across participants for all sessions. Assessment of resting motor threshold (RMT) was carried out at the beginning of every day of testing. A recruitment curve measurement was performed only at the beginning of the first day in order to establish TMS intensity (as a % of RMT) that evoked MEPs of an amplitude that was 50% of the individual’s maximum before plateau. This % of RMT was used on every subsequent session to elicit MEPs during neurofeedback and for resting blocks.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-40843-supp1-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40843.017</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-40843-transrepform-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>Data are openly available on the ETH Library Research Collection with the DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000300799">https://doi.org/10.3929/ethz-b-000300799</ext-link>.

transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article 'Neural activity related to volitional regulation of cortical excitability' for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Nicole Swann as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Preeya Khanna (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript the authors implemented a novel neurofeedback paradigm designed to test voluntary modulation of corticospinal excitability. Feedback was presented on MEP size in a single-pulse TMS paradigm and participants were instructed to up-regulate or down-regulate MEPs in separate sessions. This manipulation yielded bi-directional differences in MEP size. These effects were retained for a subset of their participants 6 months after initial training. Next, to investigate potential neuro-chemical contributions of this effect, pair-pulse TMS was used and showed a role for GABAB-mediated disinhibition for the up-regulation condition. Finally, CNS contributions to these effects were examined by collecting EEG during the neuromodulation – revealing an increase in gamma activity and a decrease in alpha for the up versus down conditions. By implementing a support vector machine the authors were able to show that the EEG could classify the modulation state (up versus down condition), with a high degree of accuracy.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were impressed with this novel approach for implementing neurofeedback, the author's robust results, and the multiple experimental approaches the authors used. A few of our concerns and points that required additional clarification are described below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We understand that the authors conducted a RMS analysis of the EMG data to address concerns that baseline EMG difference could be driving the MEP results. However, we have lingering concerns that EMG differences could still be influencing the MEPs in more subtle ways. We request that the authors perform/include the following analyses to address this concern.</p><p>a) Please report the percentage of trials that EMG crossed the threshold both as a function of trial and session. This would help clarify that late in the training, when the subjects are experts, they are not utilizing an EMG strategy.</p><p>b) Please include a table similar to Supplementary table 2 in Supplementary file 1 for the 'retention data'. In addition, please clarify how a trial was 'paused' if the EMG crossed a threshold. Does the trial re-start once the EMG is corrected, or is the trial terminated? If a threshold is crossed right before the TMS pulse could this trial still influence the MEP?</p><p>2) We were wondering if MEP feedback was the critical aspect driving these results or if differences in strategies used by participants may have played a role. We appreciate that the control group was offered the same suggested strategies, but, since they were also told that the feedback was irrelevant we were wondering if they may have ended up using different strategies. Please report strategies used by both groups. Also please include EEG results (similar to Figure 5G) for the control participants (if available) so that the reader can evaluate to what degree feedback/modulation, versus the strategies participants, used might have driven the EEG findings.</p><p>3) It would be helpful to add some more details from individual examples to evaluate how the operant conditioning learning took place. We would like the authors to add individual subject points on top of the bar graphs in Figure 2 (or as separate sub-plots). Additionally, if individual subject learning is not already clear from the revised Figure 2, please add individual plots like in Figure 2A from at least one representative experimental and control subject. Finally, please add trial-by-trial plots (within sessions) of MEP amplitude from an example subject to see how fast learning takes place. This is important to verify that effects are not being driven by a few subjects and also to support the author's argument for potential clinical applications.</p><p>4) The experimental design is rich, but also complicated. It would be helpful if the authors included a figure or table to illustrate when sessions occurred and what data was collected during each session.</p><p>5) We felt the authors' claim that volitional control over MEP amplitudes were causally related to modulating pre-synaptic GABAB mediated disinhibition was perhaps over-stated. Please add an analysis which correlates LCD and MEP amplitude to support this claim, or soften the claim.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40843.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) We understand that the authors conducted a RMS analysis of the EMG data to address concerns that baseline EMG difference could be driving the MEP results.

These are broken down per session and per trial, and further also per trial type (UP,DOWN). This demonstrates no systematic differences across the 10 trials in the number of rejected MEPs (70.25% retained in Trial 1, 73.78% in trial 10). We have also added inferential statistics to support this argument, in the form of mixed effects models (with exactly the same model structure as used for the MEP analysis and other background EMG analyses already included in the manuscript). This revealed no systematic variations in the number of retained MEP trials over time as a function of trial type (fixed effects for ‘trial- 10 levels’ and ‘trial type- 2 levels, UP+DOWN’). This analysis was first performed on all trials together (i.e. Trials 1-10, to measure systematic changes from early – late training) and also repeated within each session. There was no Trial x Trial Type interaction in any of the 4 models (all p&gt;0.16). Results are reported in the newly added Supplementary table 4 in Supplementary file 1, and referred to in the main manuscript:</p><p>'Since MEP amplitudes are a compound measure of excitability influenced by multiple neural elements (Carson, Ruddy and McNickle, 2016), including background muscle activity (Hess, Mills and Murray 1986; Devanne, Lavoie and Capaday, 1997), we repeated this analysis using the root mean squared (rms) background muscle activation (EMG) recorded in the 100ms prior to each TMS pulse. […] Further analyses of background EMG revealed no systematic variation in the number of rejected/retained MEP trials over the course of training, or by feedback type (see Supplementary tables 3 and 4 in Supplementary file 1).'</p><p>b) As suggested, we have now included a table similar to Supplementary table 2 in Supplementary file 1 showing inferential analyses of background EMG for the retention data (Supplementary file 5). This demonstrates no significant block (baseline,retention) x Trial Type (UP,DOWN) interactions for any of the four recorded muscles (all p &gt;x). Reference to this new table is made in the manuscript:</p><p>'Participants […] retained the ability to upregulate and downregulate their MEP amplitude with neurofeedback (Figure 3; significant effect of neurofeedback type (UP vs. DOWN) in a retention block carried out with no top-up training (F(1,10)=6.64, p=0.028). Again, this was in the absence of any modulation in background muscle activation (Supplementary table 5 in Supplementary file 1).'</p><p>We have also further elaborated in the manuscript on the details of how the trial was ‘paused’ if EMG exceeded the 7uV threshold prior to each TMS pulse:</p><p>'In order to ensure that MEP amplitude could not be influenced by background muscle activation, the root mean square (rms) of the EMG signal for each muscle for the previous 100ms of data was calculated and displayed in real-time on screen at the beginning of each trial in the form of four coloured ‘traffic lights’, representing each muscle (Figure 1A). […] Note that also during this variable fixation interval background EMG continued to be monitored in the same fashion as prior to the trial, that is the trial was automatically paused until rms EMG of all muscles dropped below 7 μV for at least 500ms.'</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We were wondering if MEP feedback was the critical aspect driving these results or if differences in strategies used by participants may have played a role. We appreciate that the control group was offered the same suggested strategies, but, since they were also told that the feedback was irrelevant we were wondering if they may have ended up using different strategies. Please report strategies used by both groups. Also please include EEG results (similar to Figure 5G) for the control participants (if available) so that the reader can evaluate to what degree feedback/modulation, versus the strategies participants, used might have driven the EEG findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that differences in mental strategies can lead to varied patterns of brain activity measured using EEG and also on the amplitudes of MEPs evoked by TMS. In the neurofeedback literature, it is known from animal and primate studies that neural activity can be modified by feedback alone, suggesting a large implicit learning component. In humans, it is likely that implicit learning from feedback still plays a large part in the operant learning process, but additionally on top of this, humans develop explicit mental strategies. Other neurofeedback studies (using EEG for example) have allowed participants to freely develop their own unconstrained strategies, but we felt that this would introduce too much variability into the data. Thus, we decided to provide a recommended starting point strategy for the UP and DOWN conditions (provided in subsections 'Participant Instructions (Experimental group)' and 'Participant Instructions (Control Group)'), identical for both experimental and control group. Thus, any differences in the pattern of brain activity that emerged (and MEP modulation) could be attributed to the neurofeedback. We expect that the neurofeedback provided the experimental group with the opportunity to shape their mental strategy, such that it became optimised by the end of the training to selectively enhance or suppress their MEP amplitudes. The control group did not have such an opportunity, so were unable to learn any contingencies between their ongoing mental activity and the MEPs.</p><p>We recorded every participant’s strategy for UP and DOWN in their own words during the debrief following the experiment, and have now reported these in Supplementary table 6 in Supplementary file 1, which is referred to in the last paragraph of the subsection 'Format of neurofeedback'. In short, most participants imagined an action requiring index finger activity in the UP condition and a heavy, cold or absent index finger in the DOWN condition. Based on participants’ self-report during debriefing, there was no systematic difference between the strategies of the experimental and the control group.</p><p>The reviewers have suggested including EEG results for the control group (if available) similar to that shown in Figure 5G. While we did not formally record EEG data from all our control participants, we did so for the first 5 subjects before making the decision to drop this aspect of the protocol in the interests of time and prioritisation of resources for the experimental group. These data have now been analysed and a new boxplot similar to that in Figure 5G has been included as Figure 5—figure supplement 4. With such a small number of data points it is difficult to draw conclusions from this analysis, but it is evident that these participants of the control group did not consistently show the elevated Gamma in the UP condition which was clearly present in the experimental group, but that they do show a more pronounced Beta desynchronization (which was not consistently observed in the experimental group). This data and figure have now been referred to in the first paragraph of the subsection 'Distinct oscillatory signatures for high versus low corticospinal excitability'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It would be helpful to add some more details from individual examples to evaluate how the operant conditioning learning took place. We would like the authors to add individual subject points on top of the bar graphs in Figure 2 (or as separate sub-plots). Additionally, if individual subject learning is not already clear from the revised Figure 2, please add individual plots like in Figure 2A from at least one representative experimental and control subject. Finally, please add trial-by-trial plots (within sessions) of MEP amplitude from an example subject to see how fast learning takes place. This is important to verify that effects are not being driven by a few subjects and also to support the author's argument for potential clinical applications.</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewers suggestion, we now show individual subject’s data using the same convention as in Figure 2A and 2B (i.e. individual datapoints are plotted together with the triangle representing the group mean). Presently this has been included as Figure 2—figure supplement 2. Additionally we followed the reviewers alternative suggestion to add individual plots of single subject data, similar to those in 2A because that shows exemplary changes in MEP amplitudes over time. These are now included as Figure 2—figure supplement 3. One representative participant from the experimental group and one from the control group are shown, plotted on the same scale in mV, representing their baseline-corrected change in MEP amplitude during each of the training trials on each session. From this it can be seen that even on an individual subject level, learning can be observed for both the UP and DOWN states as a result of the operant conditioning procedure.</p><p>The participants exhibited different rates of learning across the sample, with some showing signs of robust learning within the first session (first 4 blocks) and others showing later learning profiles. The individual subject shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 for the experimental group exhibited learning mainly in the second session. As the reviewers have also requested plots of individual MEP trials in order to assess speed of learning, we have provided these for the same participant shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 (as evidence of a ‘slow’ learner), and from one additional participant as evidence of a ‘fast’ learner. This now forms Figure 2—figure supplement 4. We have presented this data in 6 different scatterplots. A and B depict ALL 300 MEPs collected for the slow-learning subject (same as Figure 2—figure supplement 3). A line of best fit is shown in red, based upon a robust regression model. From this it is clear that there is a positive slope in the UP condition (gradual increase in MEP amplitude as trial increments from 1-300 across Sessions 1-3) and a negative slope in the DOWN condition (decrease in MEP amplitudes as trial increments). The robust regression revealed that in both cases the slope was statistically significant (UP: slope=0.006, p&lt;0.0001, DOWN: slope= -0.0006, p=0.008), with Spearmans Rho values of 0.37 (p&lt;0.0001) and -0.20 (p=0.003) respectively.</p><p>Importantly, we also want to demonstrate that participants learned at different rates. Thus, in panels C-F we show data from only the first training session (120 MEP trials). It is clear in panels C and D (slow learning subject shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and panels A and B) that there is no learning in the first session (in fact, the slope in DOWN was positive). However, panels E-F show the same data for another participant who exhibited a steep learning curve even in the first session (MEP trials 1-120). In both UP and DOWN, the robust regression result was significant (UP: slope=0.023, p&lt;0.006, DOWN: slope= -0.019, p=0.021), with Rho values of 0.385 (p=0.006) and -0.40 (p=0.007) for UP and DOWN respectively. In the interests of full transparency, we show ALL MEP data points in these plots, including those that were excluded following our stringent background EMG rejection criterion (unfilled dots). Importantly however, these rejected data points were not included in any statistical tests, means, or when computing the lines of best fit (as they may be biased by higher than typical background EMG values).</p><p>These new figure supplements have now been referred to in the subsection 'Bidirectional changes in corticospinal excitability were observed in the MEP neurofeedback group but not in a control group', and legends containing a summary of the statistics mentioned above are included at the end of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The experimental design is rich, but also complicated. It would be helpful if the authors included a figure or table to illustrate when sessions occurred and what data was collected during each session.</p></disp-quote><p>A table displaying the experimental design for each of the separate 9 days of testing is now included as Supplementary table 7 in Supplementary file 1, and referred to in the first paragraph of the subsection 'TMS-based neurofeedback'.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We felt the authors' claim that volitional control over MEP amplitudes were causally related to modulating pre-synaptic GABAB mediated disinhibition was perhaps over-stated.
