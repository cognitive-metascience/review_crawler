It is unknown whether other cues modulate these processes. We detected specific, non-dimorphic, expression of Semaphorin family members in the mouse mammary gland, which signal through PlexinA4. PlexinA4 deletion in both female and male embryos caused developmental hyperinnervation of the gland, which could be reduced by genetic co-reduction of BDNF. Moreover, in males, PlexinA4 ablation delayed axonal pruning, independently of the initial levels of innervation. In support of this, in vitro reduction of BDNF induced axonal hypersensitivity to PlexinA4 signaling. Overall, our study shows that precise sensory innervation of the mammary gland is regulated by the balance between trophic and repulsive signaling. Upon inhibition of trophic signaling, these repulsive factors may promote axonal pruning.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41162.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Almost every action an animal can perform in its life will rely on its nervous system being wired correctly. Before the animal is born, nerve cells next to the spinal cord send out long fibers – called axons – to connect with different parts of its body. These nerves will help relay sensations to the brain. The ends of the nerve fibers follow trails of signals that guide them to the correct targets. When the axon arrives in the right place, it can receive further signals called neurotrophic factors. These signals keep the axon alive, but they are in short supply. Not every axon will receive the signal, and, without it, the nerve fiber dies back. This phenomenon, known as pruning, helps to make sure that nervous system does not form more connections than it needs.</p><p>In mammals, the mammary gland is an example of a part of the body where nerve endings are pruned during development. Axons that connect to this milk-producing gland depend on a neurotrophic factor called BDNF to survive, and BDNF is controlled differently in males and females. In male mammals, another protein grabs hold of the BDNF signal and hides it away before development is complete. After this happens, the axons start to die, however it was not clear if other signals are also involved.</p><p>Sar Shalom et al. have now examined if proteins called Semaphorins – which guide axons to their target locations and influence pruning too – also control how many nerves end up connected to the mammary gland. The experiments used nerve cells grown in the laboratory and genetically modified mice, and suggested that the nerves in the mammary gland would only develop correctly if the BDNF and Semaphorins signals were properly balanced.</p><p>When the lab-grown nerve cells encountered Semaphorins, their growing axons collapsed. Yet unlike for BDNF, the levels of Semaphorins were the same in male and female mice. Further experiments showed that if a protein receptor that detects the Semaphorins was deleted, the nerve cells stopped responding to the signal, and their axons did not collapse. In mice lacking this receptor, both sexes ended up with more axons in their mammary glands. Too many axons grew in the female mice, while the pruning of excess axons was delayed in the males. Reducing the levels of BDNF in these mice helped to return axon growth to normal. Together, these findings suggest that a balance between the BDNF and the Semaphorins sets the correct number of nerves. They also suggest that once the BNDF signal is removed during the normal development of males, it is the Semaphorins that help the axons in the mammary gland to be pruned.</p><p>Lastly, neurotrophic factors and Semaphorins are not just important during development; indeed cells make them well into adulthood. Altered patterns of these signals in mature animals could change the shapes of nerve networks. As such, future work may help scientists to understand why tissues can become too sensitive or lose sensation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>Semaphorins</kwd><kwd>Neurotrophins</kwd><kwd>axon pruning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>873/14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaron</surname><given-names>Avraham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2412/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaron</surname><given-names>Avraham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000193</institution-id><institution>International Development Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2412/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaron</surname><given-names>Avraham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005155</institution-id><institution>Azrieli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2412/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaron</surname><given-names>Avraham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2412/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yaron</surname><given-names>Avraham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The innervation of the mammary gland is controlled by opposing effects of neurotrophic and repulsive factors and, once trophic signaling is inhibited the repulsive factors, may promote axonal pruning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development of the peripheral nervous system, specific neuronal connections are being established to ensure its proper function. Sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) initially extend their axons toward their targets by responding to attractive and repulsive cues expressed in the extracellular environment along their trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolodkin and Tessier-Lavigne, 2011</xref>). Once axons reach the targets, limiting amounts of neurotrophic factors control target innervation by regulating axonal growth, neuronal cell death, and pruning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang and Reichardt, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) acts as a survival factor for specific subsets of sensory neurons during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kirstein and Fariñas, 2002</xref>), and regulates mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carroll et al., 1998</xref>). During early development of the mammary gland, BDNF is required to establish and maintain sensory innervation in both female and male embryos. In males only, at later stages of development, sequestering of BDNF by a truncated form of TrkB (TrkB.T1) results in elimination of the axons innervating the gland. This elimination is not blocked in the Bax knockout (KO), suggesting that it occurs through axonal pruning rather than cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). As a result, a sexually dimorphic pattern of mammary gland sensory innervations is formed. Whether other cues operate in concert with BDNF, both in females and males, is unknown.</p><p>The Semaphorins belong to a large family of secreted and membrane-bound guidance cues. The 27 family members are divided into﻿ 8 subclasses according to structural homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pasterkamp, 2012</xref>). Initially characterized for their importance in axonal guidance during development, Semaphorins are now known to be involved in multiple developmental processes including axonal fasciculation, pruning, dendritic guidance, and modulation of the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pasterkamp and Kolodkin, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhou et al., 2008</xref>). Two receptor families have been implicated in mediating Semaphorin family functions: Plexins and Neuropilins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fujisawa and Kitsukawa, 1998</xref>). Most class 3 Semaphorins bind to Neuropilins, which associate with type A Plexin family members to transduce their signals through the plasma membrane. Other members of the Semaphorin family bind and signal directly through Plexin receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida, 2012</xref>). Moreover, previous in vitro and overexpression studies demonstrated a crosstalk between class 3 Semaphorins and neurotrophins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dontchev and Letourneau, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atwal et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ben-Zvi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-Zvi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Here we show that opposing effects of neurotrophic (BDNF) and repulsive (Semaphorins) factors regulate the sensory innervation of the mammary gland, and that the repulsive factors may promote axonal pruning once trophic signaling is inhibited.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TrkB but not Semaphorins exhibit sexually dimorphic expression in the mammary gland</title><p>The sexually dimorphic innervation of the mammary gland at late E13 mouse embryos is a result of differential expression of TrkB.T1 in mesenchymal cells surrounding the mammary epithelium.

In agreement, we have detected this expression pattern of TrkB.T1 using an antibody that recognizes the TrkB extracellular domain (TrkB<sup>ECD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> arrowheads). In addition, this staining revealed innervation of the gland by TrkB-positive axons in female embryos and reduced innervation in male embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref> arrows). In order to find additional factors that regulate the innervation, we performed an in-situ hybridization screen to detect the mRNA that encodes the different Semaphorins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

DRG explants from early E13 embryos were grown in the presence of BDNF for 48 hr, and then soluble Semaphorins were added to the media for 30 min, after which the axonal growth cones were detected by staining for actin using Phalloidin-Rhodamine. Under basal conditions, between 20% and 40% of the growth cones exhibited a collapsed morphology. Both Sema6A and Sema3D increased this fraction to about 60% of the growth cones. In contrast, Sema3F had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). The PlexinA4 receptor can propagate repulsive activities of both secreted and transmembrane Semaphorins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida, 2012</xref>). Sema6A can bind and signal directly through both PlexinA4 or PlexinA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Suto et al., 2007</xref>). PlexinA4 also acts as the signaling co-receptor for Sema3A in a complex with Neuropilin1 (Nrp1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yaron et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tran et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida, 2012</xref>). While Sema3D was shown to bind Nrp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yazdani and Terman, 2006</xref>), the specific Plexin through which it signals was not reported. Therefore, we tested if Sema3D and Sema6A signal through PlexinA4 in BDNF-responsive neurons by performing a collapse assay using DRGs of PlexinA4 KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yaron et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, we detected complete loss of response both to Sema6A and Sema3D in these neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>), demonstrating that PlexinA4 serves as the signaling receptor for both Sema6A and Sema3D. Since Sema6A can also bind and signal through PlexinA2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Suto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Suto et al., 2007</xref>), we tested if PlexinA2 may serve as an additional binding receptor in these neurons. We performed the binding assay using Sema6A-Fc on WT and PlexinA4 KO DRG neurons. In the WT DRGs, a strong signal was detected along the axons, however, no signal was detected in the PlexinA4 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating that PlexinA4 is the only binding and signaling receptor for Sema6A in these neurons of early E13 embryos.

Compared to WT female embryos, where the fiber density innervating the mammary gland increases gradually during development, in the PlexinA4 KO we detected hyperinnervation of the gland starting at E12 that remained constant at E13 and E14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Importantly, these additional axons appear to be TrkB positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These phenotypes were much more severe than the phenotypes we detected in the Sema6A KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), suggesting that PlexinA4 indeed transmits the signaling from additional Semaphorins and has a critical role in restricting sensory innervation to the mammary gland during development. It has been shown that BDNF produced by the mammary mesenchymal cells promotes the initial ingrowth and maintenance of sensory fibers innervating the gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we next examined the interaction between these two pathways using a genetic approach. It has been previously demonstrated that the level of nerve growth factor (NGF) limits sensory innervation, such that NGF heterozygous (Het) animals exhibit an altered pattern of sensory projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crowley et al., 1994</xref>). Therefore, we speculated that this is the case for BDNF in the mammary gland as well. We first compared innervation of the mammary gland in female embryos heterozygous for BDNF (BDNF Het) to WT. Indeed, we observed a significant reduction in mammary gland innervation at late E12, 13 and 14 in BDNF Het embryos compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). Next, we crossed the BDNF Het with the PlexinA4 KO. At late E12, there was no effect on the innervation density of the gland compared to PlexinA4 KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>), but at later stages, reduction of BDNF levels partially suppressed the hyperinnervation. At late E14, the PlexinA4 KO/BDNF Het exhibited normal mammary gland innervation, indistinguishable from the WT embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,D</xref>). These results show that innervation of the mammary gland is determined by integration of Semaphorins and BDNF pathways in female embryos.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41162.013</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Ablation of PlexinA4 in females causes axonal hyperinnervation of the mammary gland which is balanced by genetic reduction in BDNF.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mammary gland sections from WT, PlexinA4 KO, BDNF Het, and PlexinA4 KO/BDNF Het female embryos at different embryonic stages were stained with Tuj1 (red) and DAPI (blue) to visualize sensory neuron innervations.

As expected, we detected a clear developmental decrease in the innervation of WT male mammary glands between late E12 and late E14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). To test whether Semaphorin-PlexinA4 signaling has any role in regulating developmental axonal pruning in males, we examined the innervation of the mammary gland in the PlexinA4 KO male embryos. Similar to females, we detected hyperinnervation at late E12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), suggesting that PlexinA4 signaling restricts the initial innervation of the mammary gland in males as well. Interestingly, there was virtually no decrease in fiber density between late E12 and late E13 in the PlexinA4 KO. In comparison, in WT males, fiber density decreased by about 50% during the same time frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar to our results from female embryos, these axons are TrkB positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Between late E13 and late E14 there was a sharp decrease in fiber density in the PlexinA4 KO, but to a level which is still significantly higher than that of WT embryos. Importantly, the delay in pruning in the PlexinA4 KO embryos was not due to lower expression of TrkB.T1, as we detected similar expression levels in the mesenchymal cells of WT and PlexinA4 KO embryos, using the TrkB<sup>ECD</sup> antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Since the initial innervation in the PlexinA4 KO at late E12, prior to pruning onset, is much higher than in the WT, we could not discriminate between two possibilities: 1) the delay in pruning is due to increased innervation at the beginning of the process or 2) that signaling through PlexinA4 is required for pruning. To address this issue, we compared the innervation of the male mammary gland on the background of BDNF Het. As in the females, there is a clear reduction in mammary gland innervation in the BDNF Het male embryos compared to WT at late E12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). Unlike in females, we detected a reduction in innervation (~50%) in the PlexinA4 KO/BDNF Het male embryos compared to the PlexinA4 KO, as early as late E12. Despite this greatly reduced initial innervation, there was still a strong delay in axonal elimination between late E12 and late E13 (only 20% decrease). By late E14, we detected similar levels of innervation in the PlexinA4 KO/BDNF Het and PlexinA4 KO embryos, which was still significantly higher than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>).

This effect of PlexinA4 ablation was reversed by genetic reduction of BDNF levels in PlexinA4 KO/BDNF Het embryos, which exhibited normal innervation of the mammary gland, indistinguishable from WT levels, at late E14. These results suggest that although BDNF is expressed in limited amounts, its physiological levels are sufficient to sustain high levels of innervation, which are curbed by Semaphorin signaling.</p><p>In male embryos, ablation of PlexinA4 resulted in initial hyperinnervation of the gland. Co-reduction of BDNF with PlexinA4 ablation dramatically reduced the initial hyperinnervation at late E12, although this was not observed in females at the same stage. The basis for this difference is currently unclear, however, it may reflect an intrinsic hypersensitivity of the male axons to BDNF levels, which is only revealed on the background of PlexinA4 KO. This hypersensitivity may help to promote pruning once BDNF is sequestered. We detected delayed pruning of the fibers innervating the gland in the PlexinA4 KO and the PlexinA4 KO/BDNF het, supporting a model in which PlexinA4 promotes pruning independently of the initial levels of innervation. However, we cannot exclude the idea that the excess initial axonal innervation by itself generates a protective mechanism against pruning, for example by axon-axon adhesion as was observed in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bornstein et al., 2015</xref>). Lastly, while our results show that ablation of PlexinA4 does not affect the expression of TrkB.T1, we were not able to visualize BDNF at the gland by immunostaining. Therefore, we cannot completely dismiss the possibility that ablation of PlexinA4 affects the expression of BDNF.</p><p>Using in vitro growth cone collapse assays with low levels of BDNF resulted in hypersensitivity to PlexinA4 signaling, showing that inhibition of BDNF signaling renders the axons more sensitive to PlexinA4. Although this assay is mainly correlated with growth inhibition by the Semaphorins and not axonal pruning, a recent study suggested that growth cone collapse is an early and critical step in axonal degeneration in response to trophic deprivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Unsain et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the hypersensitivity to PlexinA4-induced growth cone collapse may reflect promotion of the pruning process.</p><p>Interestingly, while BDNF counteracts PlexinA4 effects, our results suggest that PlexinA4 and the BDNF receptor isoform TrkB.T1 operate in the same pathway of axonal elimination, since co-ablation of the two did not have any additive effect. This result supports previous data that TrkB.T1 antagonizes BDNF signaling in the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). Nevertheless, neither ablation of PlexinA4 or of TrkB.T1 was able to prevent pruning at late E14, when the innervation density drops sharply. During mammary organogenesis, the mammary gland of male embryos starts to regress as a result of Androgen release by the male gonads at E13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Robinson, 2007</xref>), and this regression probably forces elimination of the axons.</p><p>Altogether, our study shows that developmental innervation of the mammary gland is regulated by a balance between BDNF, which promotes the initial ingrowth of the sensory fibers, and constant Semaphorin signaling, which restricts innervation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Our results also support the idea that neurotrophins signaling suppresses the Semaphorin signaling, and once this suppression is relieved, the axons become hypersensitive to Semaphorins, as was proposed by Dontchev and Letourneau (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dontchev and Letourneau, 2002</xref>). Overall, our work provides the first clear evidence that the balance between these two cues plays a role in accurate wiring of the nervous system during development, and that physiologically tipping this balance may induce axonal pruning.</p><p>The Semaphorins have been previously implicated in pruning of hippocampal axons, where developmental expression of Sema3F was proposed to largely regulate this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagri et al., 2003</xref>). In contrast, in the mammary gland, we did not detect any dimorphic or temporal expression of Semaphorins or PlexinA4; instead, our results suggest that their ability to prune axons in male embryos is gated by inhibition of BDNF signaling. Whether there are equivalent mechanisms that gate Semaphorin-dependent axonal pruning in the hippocampus remains to be discovered.</p><p>Expression of Semaphorins and Plexins has been previously demonstrated in the developing mammary gland postnatally, and was suggested to affect ductal growth and morphogenesis of the gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Morris et al., 2006</xref>). Here we present new data that show expression of Sema3D and Sema6A in the mammary epithelium during embryonic development, and their involvement in regulation of the mammary gland innervation through the PlexinA4 receptor. We also detected expression of Sema3F in the mammary epithelium, but in vitro it had no effect on growth cone collapse of BDNF-responsive sensory neurons, suggesting it is not involved in target innervation. It may have a role in the regulation of ductal directional outgrowth and branching morphogenesis during later development. This is supported by the fact that Neuropilin2, which serves as the binding receptor of Sema3F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida, 2012</xref>), promotes postnatal branching morphogenesis of the mammary gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goel et al., 2011</xref>). Together, these results suggest that the Semaphorins play a dual role in mammary gland development, determining the extent of sensory innervation density prenatally and promoting gland morphogenesis postnatally.</p><p>Intriguingly, the neurotrophins and the Semaphorins continue to be expressed in peripheral tissues throughout the life of the organism, and their expression may be altered in pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apfel, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Yamaguchi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tominaga et al., 2009</xref>). Our findings raise the possibility that altered expression of these cues could induce aberrant innervation in mature animals, causing either hypersensitivity or reduced sensation, depending on the balance between these pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the roles of Semaphorins and PlexinA4 in sensory innervation of the mammary gland during early embryonic development. The findings support the idea that Sema6A (and possibly Sema3D) expressed in early (E12/13) mammary gland epithelial cells restricts innervation of the gland by TrkB positive sensory axons in females starting at E13. The phenotype of PlexinA4 mutants is more dramatic than Sema6A mutants, suggesting that signaling from additional Semaphorins, possibly Sema3D, may contribute to restricting sensory innervation of the mammary gland during early development. Experiments using genetic deletion of both PlexinA4 and BDNF (and TrkB.T1) suggest that a balance of BDNF and Semaphorin/PlexinA4 signaling controls innervation. The phenotypes presented are strong, the genetics correctly performed, and the observations interesting. The findings support a model in which the balance of neurotrophic factor signals and Semaphorin repulsive signals control early, sexual-dimorphic mammary gland innervation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A concern of all three reviewers is over-interpretation of the results with respect to signaling mechanisms. The opposing effects of BDNF and Semaphorin/PlexinA4 signaling are difficult to disentangle with the single readout of axon innervation during the E12-14 timeframe examined. To illustrate this point, in male PlexinA4 knockout mice, gland hyper-innervation is seen as early as E12 when TrkB.T1 is not expressed (Liu et al., 2012) and the PlexinA4 phenotype appears to be unaffected by the onset of TrkB.T1 expression at the late E13 stages. These findings make it difficult to appreciate how the effects of PlexinA4 intersect with the BDNF/TrkB.T1 sequestration mechanism to contribute to the overall axonal regression in males during development. The authors should address this concern by presenting multiple interpretations of their findings, in the Discussion and elsewhere, since the reviewers do not view the experiments as definitive with respect to cross-talk between BDNF and Semaphorin signaling, nor of an absolute pruning function by Semaphorin signaling (as opposed to simple constraint of axon extension).</p><p>2) Related to point 1 and interpretations of the findings, the implication in the title and text that Semaphorin-PlexinA4 signaling helps to regulate the sexually dimorphic innervation pattern in mammary glands may not be compelling. The findings presented show that Semaphorin/PlexinA4 signaling is inhibitory to axon growth in both females and males, which is consistent with its well-established role. Semaphorins are not expressed in a sexually dimorphic manner in mammary glands, and it is unclear if there are sex-specific differences in PlexinA4 expression. The effects of PlexinA4 deletion in restricting axon growth could hold for any innervated target tissue, regardless of sex. The title and text should be modified to address this concern.</p><p>3) Some of the experiments are not as definitive as presented, and certain caveats need to be discussed. Growth cone collapse is not the same as axon pruning, and it should be noted that in these assays both male and female sensory axons undergo significant loss by E14, even in the absence of Semaphorin signaling. Also, it is likely that only a very minor fraction of all TrkB positive DRG neurons at certain axial levels innervate the mammary gland – the majority of TrkB positive neurons innervate other targets. In addition, the authors have not ruled out cell death resulting from lack of target innervation as a cause for the &quot;pruning&quot; effects that are observed in this system. Further, no evidence is presented to indicate timing of the expression of Semaphorin/PlexinA4 signaling components to selectively prune these axons. These caveats should be noted and discussed.</p><p>4) Why focus on Sema6A when Sema3D is expressed at high levels and causes collapse of growth cones? Sema6A mutant mice do not phenocopy the PlexinA4 mutant mice. Do the authors believe that the PlexinA4 effects are mediated by Sema3D in male embryos? Are Neuropilins expressed in TrkB neurons that innervate the mammary gland? Analysis of innervation using a Sema3D mutant mouse would be ideal, although it is not a requirement for publication if the mice may not be available to the investigators.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41162.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A concern of all three reviewers is over-interpretation of the results with respect to signaling mechanisms.

We now refer to this finding in the second paragraph of the Introduction. We agree that we do not show any evidence for temporal expression of Semaphorin/PlexinA4 signaling components to selectively prune these axons, and we now emphasize this throughout the text.</p><p>Importantly, our model suggests that such temporal control is <italic>not</italic> required, since dimorphic innervation is achieved by combining temporal control of BDNF signaling with constant PlexinA4 signaling.</p><p>Regarding the growth cone collapse assay: indeed, this assay was mainly used as a proxy for growth inhibition and repulsion. However, a recent study suggested that growth cone collapse is early and critical step in axonal degeneration in response to trophic deprivation (Unsain et al., 2018). Therefore, the hypersensitivity to PlexinA4 induced growth cone collapse may reflect promotion of the pruning process. We now refer to this point in the sixth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why focus on Sema6A when Sema3D is expressed at high levels and causes collapse of growth cones? Sema6A mutant mice do not phenocopy the PlexinA4 mutant mice. Do the authors believe that the PlexinA4 effects are mediated by Sema3D in male embryos? Are Neuropilins expressed in TrkB neurons that innervate the mammary gland? Analysis of innervation using a Sema3D mutant mouse would be ideal, although it is not a requirement for publication if the mice may not be available to the investigators.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on Sema6A on the basis of its expression pattern, as visualized by the X-gal staining. Our analysis of the Sema6A KO and PlexinA4 KO strongly suggests that a number of additional Semaphorins might be involved in the control of the innervation. Hence, although Sema3D is a very good candidate, we cannot exclude the role of additional Semaphorins. Since we do not currently have access to a Sema3D mutant mouse, we respectfully submit that analyses of this and additional family members are beyond the scope of the present study, as noted also by the reviewer. Regarding the expression of Neuropilin-1, based on the fact that these neurons respond to Sema3D in vitro it is very likely that they express this receptor.</p></body></sub-article></article>
