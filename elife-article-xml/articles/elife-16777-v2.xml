However, the zoonotic origins of the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic virus (pdmH1N1) remain unclear, due to conflicting evidence from swine and humans. There is strong evidence that the first human outbreak of pdmH1N1 occurred in Mexico in early 2009. However, no related swine viruses have been detected in Mexico or any part of the Americas, and to date the most closely related ancestor viruses were identified in Asian swine. Here, we use 58 new whole-genome sequences from IAVs collected in Mexican swine to establish that the swine virus responsible for the 2009 pandemic evolved in central Mexico. This finding highlights how the 2009 pandemic arose from a region not considered a pandemic risk, owing to an expansion of IAV diversity in swine resulting from long-distance live swine trade.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16777.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16777.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In 2009 a new influenza virus jumped from pigs to humans and spread very rapidly, causing an initial outbreak in Mexico and becoming a global pandemic in just a few months. Although the most straightforward explanation is that the virus originated in swine in Mexico, several studies suggested that this was unlikely because key genetic components of the virus had never been detected in the Americas. Determining the source of the disease is critical for predicting and preparing for future influenza pandemics.</p><p>Mena, Nelson et al. sought to better characterize the genetic diversity of influenza viruses in Mexican swine by obtaining the entire genetic sequences of 58 viruses collected from swine in Mexico, including some from previously unsampled regions in central Mexico. The sequences revealed extensive diversity among the influenza viruses circulating in Mexican swine. Several viruses included genetic segments that originated from viruses from Eurasia (the landmass containing Europe and Asia) and had not previously been detected in the Americas. The new sequences contained key genetic components of the 2009 pandemic virus. Furthermore, the sequences suggest that viruses with a similar genetic composition to the 2009 pandemic virus have been circulating in pigs in central-west Mexico for more than a decade. Thus, this region is the most likely source of the virus that started the 2009 pandemic.</p><p>Mena, Nelson et al. also found that the movement of viruses from Eurasia and the United States into Mexico closely follows the direction of the global trade of live swine. This highlights the critical role that animal trading plays in bringing together diverse viruses from different continents, which can then combine and generate new pandemic viruses.</p><p>A potential next step is to perform experiments that investigate how well the swine viruses can replicate and pass between different animal models. Comparing the results of such experiments with the findings presented by Mena, Nelson et al. could identify factors that make the viruses more likely to spread to humans and produce a pandemic.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16777.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16777.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>influenza A virus</kwd><kwd>2009 pandemic</kwd><kwd>swine</kwd><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd><kwd>phylogeography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Centers of Excellence for Influenza Research and Surveillance, Contract No.HHSN272201400008C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>García-Sastre</surname><given-names>Adolfo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000061</institution-id><institution>Fogarty International Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Multinational Influenza Seasonal Mortality Study</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Martha I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome sequence data from 58 Mexican swine influenza A viruses resolves the spatial origin of the virus that originated the influenza pandemic of 2009.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Our ability to predict outbreaks of zoonotic pathogens requires an understanding of their ecology and evolution in reservoir hosts. At the onset of the 2009 influenza pandemic, whole-genome sequencing revealed that pdmH1N1 was a novel reassortant virus comprised of segments from three major swIAV lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garten et al., 2009</xref>): segments PB2, PB1, PA, NP and NS were derived from a triple reassortant H3N2 swine virus (TRsw) that originated in North American swine during the mid-1990s; the HA (H1) segment derived from the classical swine H1N1 lineage (Csw) that has circulated in North American swine since the 1918 pandemic; and the NA (N1) and MP segments were related to the avian-like Eurasian swine lineage (EAsw) that emerged in European pigs in the late 1970s. Genetic and epidemiological evidence indicate that the first outbreak of pdmH1N1 occurred in humans in Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brockmann and Helbing, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lemey et al., 2009</xref>). However, it remained unclear whether Mexico also was the site of the zoonotic transmission event that gave rise to the 2009 outbreak, given that EAsw viruses had never been detected in swine in any part of the Americas, including Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Mexico, Peru, Canada, and the intensively sampled swine herds in the United States (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nelson et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tinoco et al., 2015</xref>). At the time, Asia was the only region where TRsw, Csw, and EAsw viruses were known to co-circulate in swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Asia is a global source of novel human seasonal influenza viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemey et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Russell et al., 2008</xref>), avian viruses associated with the pandemics of 1957 and 1968 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kawaoka et al., 1989</xref>), and emerging avian viruses with pandemic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lam et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taubenberger Morens, 2009</xref>). Since 2009, several studies have implicated Asian swine as a possible source of the TRsw/Csw/EAsw reassortant swine virus that gave rise to pdmH1N1. Asia is the only region where TRsw, Csw, and EAsw are known to exchange segments through reassortment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Poonsuk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takemae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vijaykrishna et al., 2011</xref>). At the onset of the pandemic, IAVs identified in swine (swIAVs) in Hong Kong, SAR, were more closely related to pdmH1N1 than any other swIAVs available globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). One Hong Kong swIAV was identified with a genotype similar to the pdmH1N1 virus except for the NA segment, and transmitted via respiratory droplet in ferrets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yen et al., 2011</xref>). However, the time of the most recent common ancestor (tMRCA) of the Hong Kong swIAVs and pdmH1N1 was still approximately 10 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2009</xref>). Combined with the lack of any complete swIAV genomes from Mexico’s large swine populations at the start of the pandemic, and the difficulty of understanding how a virus that evolved in Asian swine caused its first outbreak in humans in Mexico, the geographical location of the swine-to-human transmission event that gave rise to pdmH1N1 has remained uncertain. In the years following the pandemic, new surveillance in Mexican swine has identified Csw, TRsw, and pdmH1N1 and seasonal H3N2 viruses of human origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2015a</xref>), but no EAsw viruses. However, the majority of swIAVs in previous analyses were collected in northern and eastern Mexico, and no studies to date have included viruses from major swine-producing states in central Mexico, including Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Puebla (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Live swine production in Mexico.</title><p>Each Mexican state is shaded according to the density of pigs (the number of pigs per square kilometer, light green = lower and dark blue = higher).

We therefore undertook expansive surveillance efforts in Mexico, isolating the virus from pigs with respiratory symptoms in farms from six Mexican states with high swine production, including Sonora in northern Mexico, Yucatan in eastern Mexico, and previously unsampled states in central-east Mexico (Puebla), and central-west Mexico (Jalisco, Guanajuato, and Aguascalientes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). These efforts yielded 58 complete viral genomes (sequence accession numbers are available in the Dryad data repository under Doi:10.5061/dryad.m550m) that were used to identify swIAVs that are closely related to pdmH1N1, resolving the origins of pdmH1N1 in its reservoir host.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Extensive IAV genetic diversity identified in Mexican swine</title><p>Among the 58 swIAVs newly sequenced from Mexico, genome segments were identified from all three major swIAV lineages (Csw, TRsw, and EAsw) and all three major human IAV lineages of the 21<sup>st</sup> century (H3N2, pdmH1N1, and pre-pandemic H1N1), evidence of extensive gene flow between Mexican swine and (a) humans, (b) US swine (Csw and TRsw viruses), and (c) European swine (EAsw viruses) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Except for TRsw (genotype 5) and pdmH1N1 (genotype 6), no other IAV lineages were identified intact in Mexican swine, evidence of frequent reassortment between viral lineages. Of the 12 genotypes identified, 10 were reassortants. Four genotypes were triple reassortants: genotype 1 contains all three swine lineages (Csw/TRsw/EAsw); genotype 9 contains all three human-origin lineages (pre-pandemic H1N1/human H3N2/pdmH1N1); and genotypes 2 and 11 contain one human-origin and two swine lineages (pre-pandemic H1N1/TRsw/EAsw and pdmH1N1/Csw/TRsw, respectively). Although human-origin viruses were observed in all regions of Mexico, the importance of human-to-swine transmission in the evolution of swIAV diversity in Mexico has been characterized recently in detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2015a</xref>). Instead, this study will focus on evolutionary processes that are directly involved in the emergence of pdmH1N1 precursors in Mexican swine, including reassortment and viral migration driven by long-distance movements of live swine.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genetic diversity of IAVs in Mexican swine, 2010–2014.</title><p>Twelve genotypes were identified by surveillance in Mexican swien herds during 2010–2014.

Notably, EAsw viruses have been introduced from Eurasian swine into central Mexico on at least two occasions. Although the US and Canada are Mexico’s primary trade partners for the import of live swine, live swine imports into Mexico also were reported from several European countries during the late 1990s, including the United Kingdom and Denmark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We estimate that at least three TRsw viruses and two Csw viruses were introduced from US swine into Mexican swine herds in the northern and central regions. Estimates of the number and timing of independent swIAV introductions into Mexico are complicated by gaps in global background swIAV sequence data in the 1990s/early 2000s and topological differences in the phylogenies inferred for different segments arising from reassortment. Our conservative approach of defining introductions based on both high posterior probabilities (&gt;90) on the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) and Bayes factor (BF) support for significant rates of migration (BF &gt; 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>) has likely underestimated the number of introductions. We also recognize the need to draw phylogeographic inferences with an awareness of missing data. Major gaps in surveillance in swine in Europe and Asia during the 1990s have resulted in long branch lengths between swIAVs collected in Mexico and Eurasia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Although it is difficult to infer from the tree whether the EAsw MP identified in Mexico was introduced from Asian or European swine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), the lack of live swine imports reported between Mexico and any Asian country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and the low export of Asian swine globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2015c</xref>) suggest that Europe may be a more likely source of the Mexican viruses, similar to the H1 and N1 segments.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Import of live swine and IAVs into Mexico.</title><p>The value of live swine imported into Mexico (USD, y-axis, left) from all countries during 1969–2010 is presented in the background in pink, based on trade data reported to the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nationals, available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>.

Genotype 1 viruses are distinct from the reverse zoonosis introductions of pdmH1N1 from humans to swine (genotype 6) that have been observed globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson and Vincent, 2015</xref>). Phylogenetically, genotype 1 viruses from Mexico form a sister lineage to pdmH1N1 on the PB2, PB1, PA, HA, NP, and NA trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Genotype 2 viruses from Jalisco (genotype 2 viruses are similar to genotype 1, but contain a pre-pandemic human-origin H1 segment [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>]) are closely related to pdmH1N1 on the MP tree. No Mexican swIAVs were closely related to pdmH1N1 on the NS tree. However, NS is the segment with the highest tMRCA between pdmH1N1 and the most closely related swIAVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), an indication of larger gaps in sampling and missing data. It is therefore likely that the NS precursor in Mexico was not detected by surveillance or has been replaced in intervening years by reassortment. The tMRCA analysis therefore provides further indication that Mexico is the likely origin of the swine virus that gave rise to pdmH1N1. However, it is difficult to determine the precise location within central-west Mexico of zoonotic transmission, owing to high rates of gene flow and reassortment between swIAVs in Jalisco and Guanajuato and resulting differences in tree topologies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Swine viruses from Guanajuato are most closely related to pdmH1N1 on the phylogenies inferred for the PB2, PB1, H1, and N1 segments. Jalisco viruses are most closely related to pdmH1N1 on the PA and MP trees. Both Guanajuato and Jalisco viruses are related to pdmH1N1 on the NP tree. Therefore, the swine-to-human transmission event could have occurred in Guanajuato, Jalisco, or possibly another state in central Mexico that has not been sampled.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Timing and location of swine ancestors of pdmH1N1.</title><p>The color of each dot represents the inferred location of the node representing the common ancestor of pdmH1N1 viruses and the most closely related swine ivurses (indicated by open circles on the MCC trees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), for a posterior distribution of ~2000 trees inferred for each segment.

The use of genetic data provides more refined within-country spatial details.

Texas shares a long and heavily-trafficked border with Mexico (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weinberg et al., 2003</xref>), and the southern United States was the largest recipient of pdmH1N1 introductions from Mexico during the early stages of the 2009 pandemic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). However, the southern US was not a major source of pdmH1N1 viruses to the United States’ Midwest, West, Northeast regions or globally. Rather, viruses identified in New York, Wisconsin, California, and other US states represent independent introductions of pdmH1N1 from Mexico. Notably, the Northeast region of the United States, including New York, had the largest role in the onward global dissemination of the pandemic virus to Europe, Asia, and South America (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), perhaps driven by high volumes of air traffic from New York City and the size of the city’s epidemic during the spring wave (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Viboud et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Overall, our findings resolve a long-standing question of where the pandemic H1N1 virus originated in swine. Moreover, they underscore the importance of understanding the global evolution of IAVs in pigs, and the pandemic threat presented by the large number of independently evolving swIAV populations worldwide that periodically experience invasions of new viruses. Our findings demonstrate the central importance of inter-hemispheric swine movements in the long-range dissemination of swIAV diversity, which allowed divergent Eurasian and North American viruses to co-circulate in central Mexico and reassort into genotype 1 viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). It remains unclear whether conditions in Mexico were uniquely suitable for the emergence of genotype 1 viruses, or whether it is possible that similar viruses also circulate undetected in Asia, the only other location where Csw, EAsw, and TRsw viruses and various reassortants are known to be present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lam et al., 2011</xref>). The inability of researchers to produce genotype 1 viruses experimentally in cell cultures or pigs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ma et al., 2014</xref>) implies strain-specific differences in reassortment capabilities. The likelihood of pandemic emergence is therefore enhanced by the seeding of diverse swIAV lineages in countries with varying swine production practices and fitness pressures. The independent evolution of multiple variants increases the probability that one will evolve the capacity to transmit to humans.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Origins of pdmH1N1.</title><p>Summary of the migration and reassortment events leading to the emergence of pdmH1N1 precursor viruses in central-west Mexican swine. Segments from classical and Eurasian viruses for which there is no evidence of onward transmission in central-west Mexican swine are indicated with short horizontal lines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.16777.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.16777.024</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-16777-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>Although understanding the positive and negative interactions between fitness in human and swine hosts is central to understanding pandemic emergence, this area of research remains poorly understood. Strong patterns of reassortment between EAsw and North American viruses in Mexican swine are an indication of competitive interactions. The apparent fitness of the TRIG + EAsw MP internal gene constellation in central Mexican swine was central to the emergence of the genotype 1 viruses that gave rise to pdmH1N1, but is not well understood. The success of genotype 1 viruses for many years in central-west Mexico is notable, given the low levels of persistence of pdmH1N1 viruses as an intact genome in swine following reverse zoonosis in many countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson and Vincent, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelson et al., 2015d</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pereda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Watson et al., 2015</xref>), a pattern also observed in Sonora. The lower levels of onward transmission of pdmH1N1 surface genes in swine could relate to competition with existing H1s and N1s. The identification of EAsw NA and MP segments in central Mexican swine is notable, given that these segments were associated with enhanced respiratory droplet transmission in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lakdawala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yen et al., 2011</xref>). The EAsw MP segment also is associated with zoonotic transmission of swIAVs at agricultural fairs in the US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bowman et al., 2012</xref>). A number of studies have examined the transmission potential of naturally occurring or lab-generated avian and swine viruses in ferret or other animal models, as a measure of pandemic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Herfst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sorrell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). However, a fundamental understanding of fitness landscapes and trade-offs in multi-host systems has been constrained by the a lack of final resolution on the ethics of various experiments that involve novel viruses that present a potential threat to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Frank et al., 2016</xref>). The identification of viruses related to the 2009 pandemic precursors invites new experimental research into central questions of pandemic emergence at the human-swine interface.</p><p>The detection of EAsw in Mexico suggests that even relatively low levels of livestock movement can disseminate a highly transmissible virus such as IAV long distances, bringing attention to the importance of surveillance and mitigation strategies, including quarantine. Presently, imported live swine are not routinely tested for influenza. The emergence of the 2009 pandemic virus was closely linked to the increase in Mexico's imports of live swine during the 1990s and the influx of new influenza virus lineages from the United States and Europe. At this time we cannot rule out Asia-to-Mexico viral migration, owing to possible omissions in reported imports and exports of swine and gaps in sequencing of viruses in swine globally. However, all that is known about the nature of international swine production and trade suggests that this direction of viral movement is unlikely. Long-distance trade of pigs from Europe, the United States, and Canada to countries in Asia and South America occurs primarily to import high-efficiency European and North American breeding lines. Although illegal trade of poultry is important in the spread of AIVs, particularly within the East Asian region, there are no known economic incentives (and strong economic disincentives) for the illegal trade of pigs from Asia and Mexico. Globally, Asia is overwhelmingly a net importer of swine from Europe and North America, with extremely little export of Asian pigs or their viruses to any other continents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2015c</xref>). Another outstanding question is whether genotype 1 viruses have disseminated from Mexico to other countries in Latin America, where surveillance is low or non-existent. Mexico has reported export of live swine to several countries in Latin America (Belize, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, El Salvador). However, the total volume of Mexico’s live swine exports during 1996–2012 amounts to only one-tenth of Costa Rica’s over the same time period, and one-thirtieth of Brazil’s. Mexico is therefore considered an ecological sink for swine influenza viruses, with limited opportunity for viral export to other countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2015c</xref>).</p><p>The unexpected detection of EAsw in Mexico highlights the need to revisit outdated assumptions about the spatial distribution of IAVs in swine populations globally, given the capacity of long-distance live swine movements to disseminate viral diversity between continents. Although surveillance of swIAVs has been initiated in many new regions since 2009, it remains highly imbalanced on a global scale and low compared to avian surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nelson and Vincent, 2015</xref>). Recent detections of novel swIAVs in regions that traditionally have not conducted surveillance in swine, including Latin America and South-east Asia, underscore the importance of expanding surveillance in the large number of under-sampled regions with high densities of swine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cappuccio et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nelson et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ngo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Perera et al., 2013</xref>). China remains an important source of zoonotic influenza viruses with pandemic potential, and the identification of strong regional variations in swIAV diversity in Mexico highlights the importance of capturing swIAV diversity across China’s heterogeneous regions. Although the importance of regional live swine movements in the evolution of swIAVs in the United States has been documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Nelson et al., 2011</xref>), many countries lack data on the intra-country movements of swine, limiting study of interactions between animal movements and regional patterns of swIAV diversity. Data on poultry movements within and between countries are similarly lacking, limiting our understanding of the role of trade in the spatial dynamics of IAVs in domestic birds. Our ability to predict future pandemics will require intensified viral surveillance and an understanding of how economic forces and international trade policies affect changes in animal movements and production practices that drive viral emergence.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Collection of influenza viruses in Mexican swine</title><p>Swine influenza isolates were obtained from samples submitted to Avimex laboratories (Mexico) for confirmation diagnostics of pigs with respiratory syndrome.

For the six additional whole-genome sequences available from Mexico that were published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nelson et al., 2015c</xref>) we defined two new genotypes: genotypes 13 and 14. In addition to estimating transitions between locations (Markov jumps), we also estimated the waiting times between transitions ('Markov rewards') (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Minin and Suchard, 2008b</xref>) as an indication of the period of time Mexican lineages circulate as different genotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Live swine import into Mexico</title><p>The trade value (USD) for live swine trade between other countries and Mexico for the years 1996–2012 was obtained from the United Nations’ Commodity Trade Statistics Database (available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://comtrade.un.org">http://comtrade.un.org</ext-link>, accessed March 20, 2014) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Figure 6—source data 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor.

The newly sequenced genomes close important gaps in our understanding of the emergence of this pandemic. The authors show that virus variants with sequences closely related to all segments of human H1N1pdm09 circulate in Mexican swine. This finding singles out Mexico as the likely region where the pandemic virus emerged. These results emphasize the need for concerted global surveillance of influenza virus diversity in animals.</p><p>All reviewers agree that the data shed light on an important and interesting problem. However, before we can recommend acceptance, a number of issues should be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) More details on sample collection: How many samples were tested in different years? How were animals chosen for testing? Did these animals come from large commercial facilities or backyard farms? What were the criteria for sequencing positive samples? Within each location (Sonora, Puebla, etc) did the samples consistently come from the same producers/farms?</p><p>2) We would like to see a more extensive discussion of the gaps in surveillance in swine (not only in Mexico, but also Asia and Europe), and how these gaps limit the inferences that can be made.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.16777.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>1) More details on sample collection: How many samples were tested in different years?

The revised paragraph is:</p><p>“Collection of influenza viruses in Mexican swine. Swine influenza isolates were obtained from samples submitted to Avimex laboratories (Mexico) for routine confirmation diagnostics of pigs with respiratory syndrome. […] GenBank accession numbers of the 58 genomes are available in the Dryad data repository under DOI: 10.5061/dryad.m550m. Figure 2—figure supplement 1 describes the date, location, subtype and lineage assignment of each viral segment.”</p><p><italic>2) We would like to see a more extensive discussion of the gaps in surveillance in swine (not only in Mexico, but also Asia and Europe), and how these gaps limit the inferences that can be made.</italic></p><p>This is a very important issue, and our revised manuscript addressed this matter in further detail in the Results and the Discussion. We have also changed many of our references from ‘European swine’ to ‘Eurasian swine’ to better reflect ambiguities about the source Eurasian viruses in Mexico.</p><p>Results; “We also recognize the need to draw phylogeographic inferences with an awareness of missing data. Major gaps in surveillance in swine in Europe and Asia during the 1990s have resulted in long branch lengths between swIAVs collected in Mexico and Eurasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although it is difficult to infer from the tree whether the EAsw MP identified in Mexico was introduced from Asian or European swine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), the lack of live swine imports reported between Mexico and any Asian country (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), and the low export of Asian swine globally (Nelson et al., 2015c) suggest that Europe may be a more likely source of the Mexican viruses, similar to the H1 and N1 segments.”</p><p>Discussion; “At this time we cannot rule out Asia-to-Mexico viral migration, owing to possible omissions in reported imports and exports of swine and gaps in sequencing of viruses in swine globally. […] Globally, Asia is overwhelmingly a net importer of swine from Europe and North America, with extremely little export of Asian pigs or their viruses to any other continents (Nelson et al., 2015c).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
