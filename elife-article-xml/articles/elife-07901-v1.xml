Here, by nucleoside triphosphatase (NTPase) assay and comparisons of six high-resolution (2.9–3.1 Å) cryo-electron microscopy structures of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus with bound ligands, we show that the large sub-domain of the guanylyltransferase (GTase) domain of the turret protein (TP) also has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase. S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) acts as a signal and binds the methylase-2 domain of TP to induce conformational change of the viral capsid, which in turn activates the putative ATPase. ATP binding/hydrolysis leads to an enlarged capsid for efficient mRNA synthesis, an open GTase domain for His217-mediated guanylyl transfer, and an open methylase-1 domain for SAM binding and methyl transfer. Taken together, our data support a role of the putative ATPase in mediating the activation of mRNA transcription and capping within the confines of the virus.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07901.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07901.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses can only replicate by invading the cells of other organisms, such as plants and animals. Each virus carries genetic material in the form of molecules of DNA or ribonucleic acid (RNA), which are packaged in a shell made of proteins.</p><p>The cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus has a genome made of a type of RNA called double-stranded RNA. Once inside a host cell, sections of the virus genome are copied to make molecules of ‘messenger RNA’ in a process called transcription. Small chemical groups called guanylyl and methyl groups are added to the messenger RNAs before they are used as templates to make the virus proteins.</p><p>A small molecule called S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) can activate transcription of the virus genome by binding to a protein called turret in the shell of the virus. The turret protein is involved in adding the guanylyl and methyl groups to the messenger RNA molecules, but it is not clear how the protein activates transcription.</p><p>Here, Yu et al. used a technique called cryo electron microscopy to study how the virus binds SAM to activate transcription. The experiments show that the binding of SAM to one region or ‘domain’ of the turret protein leads to changes in the virus shell. This enables another domain of the turret protein to bind a small molecule called ATP and break it down. The energy released from breaking down ATP causes further changes of the shell of the virus to activate transcription and the addition of guanylyl and methyl groups to the newly made messenger RNAs.</p><p>In the future, experiments that directly observe the RNA inside each virus shall offer fresh insights as to how the genomes of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus and other similar viruses are transcribed.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07901.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07901.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>viral ATPase</kwd><kwd>histidine-mediated guanylyl transfer</kwd><kwd>allosteric regulation</kwd><kwd>conformational change</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM071940</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Z Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31172263</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jingchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI094386</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Z Hong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Guangdong Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S2013010016750</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jingchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Specialized Research Fund for the Doctoral Program of Higher Education of China (SRFDP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20134404110023</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Jingchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Atomic structures suggest a novel mechanism for the regulation of mRNA transcription and capping in dsRNA viruses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Viral transcription is highly regulated, as demonstrated biochemically in viruses of the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shatkin and Sipe, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Furuichi, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borsa et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farsetta et al., 2000</xref>). mRNA transcription in these viruses is activated by external actions, for example, removal of their outer shell in multi-shelled reoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shatkin and Sipe, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Borsa et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farsetta et al., 2000</xref>) and binding of S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) in the single-shelled cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Furuichi, 1974</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">1978</xref>). The outer shell and the binding sites of SAM are far away from the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRPs) inside the virus. How these external actions regulate viral mRNA transcription has been a mystery.</p><p>Viruses in the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> contain 9–12 segments of dsRNA enclosed within an inner core that is a self-competent molecular machine fully capable of RNA transcription and processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mertens et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou, 2008</xref>). Each of the 9–12 dsRNA segments wraps around an RdRP located underneath an icosahedral vertex and can undergo independent and simultaneous RNA transcription within an intact core (i.e., endogenous RNA transcription) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Smith and Furuichi, 1982</xref>). The simplest of these, the single-shelled CPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhou, 2008</xref>) has been used as a model system for viral RNA transcription and high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) studies, as highlighted by the discovery of mRNA cap structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Furuichi, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Furuichi and Miura, 1975</xref>) and the demonstration of near atomic resolution cryoEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>To find out how viral mRNA transcription is regulated, we set out to determine a series of structures of CPV in complex with different ligands at resolutions ranging from 2.9 to 3.1 Å. We discovered that the large sub-domain of guanylyltransferase (GTase) domain of CPV turret protein (TP) also has an ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase that mediates the activation process of viral RNA transcription and capping. This process involves sensing the presence of the signal molecule SAM by methylase −2 (MT-2) domain of CPV TP, activating the putative viral ATPase, enlarging the viral capsid for efficient mRNA syntheses, and opening the GTase and MT-1 to enable guanylyl and methyl transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CryoEM structures at up to 2.9 Å and visualization of ligands</title><p>To reveal the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation of viruses within the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family, we determined the cryoEM structures of six CPV/ligand complexes in the presence of magnesium ion: CPV+<underline>S</underline>AM (i.e., ‘S-CPV’), CPV+SAM+4 nucleoside triphosphates (NTPs) (i.e., <underline>t</underline>ranscribing, or ‘t-CPV’), CPV+<underline>S</underline>AM+<underline>G</underline>TP+<underline>A</underline>TP (i.e., ‘SGA-CPV’), CPV+<underline>S</underline>AM +<underline>G</underline>TP (i.e., ‘SG-CPV’), CPV+<underline>G</underline>TP (i.e., ‘G-CPV’), and CPV+<underline>A</underline>TP (i.e., ‘A-CPV’) at resolutions ranging from 2.9 to 3.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This range of resolutions has permitted us to identify side chains of amino acid residues and to define conformations of bound ligands to build atomic models. Like the atomic model of unliganded CPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), the atomic models of these liganded CPV all contain two conformers of the capsid shell proteins (CSP-A and CSP-B), two conformers of the large protrusion proteins (LPP-3 and LPP-5), and one conformer of TP in each asymmetrical unit (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We show below that the large sub-domain of GTase domain of TP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yu et al., 2008</xref>) also has an additional ATP-binding site and is likely an ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Except for A-CPV, these atomic models also contain ligands revealed in our cryoEM maps (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). In S-CPV, one SAM binds to the MT-2 domain of each TP. In G-CPV, one GTP binds to the GTase site of GTase domain. In SG-CPV, two SAM molecules bind to the MT-1 and MT-2 domains, one Mg<sup>2+</sup>-GTP to the GTase site and one GTP to the putative ATPase site. In t-CPV and SGA-CPV, two SAM molecules bind to the MT-1 and MT-2 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>), one Mg<sup>2+</sup>-GTP to the GTase site and one ATP to the putative ATPase site. As we will report in detail below, a comparison of these structures and their correlation with the accompanying biochemical results have led to our discovery of a putative ATPase-mediated regulation process for activating viral RNA transcription and capping.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural overviews of cytoplasmic polyhedrosis virus (CPV) bound with different ligands involved in regulation and capping for viral RNA transcription.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Radially colored G-CPV reconstruction at 2.9 Å resolution as viewed along a fivefold axis.

Superposition of the structures (both at 3.1 Å resolution) of S-CPV and the unliganded CPV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yu et al., 2011</xref>) shows that the capsid shell of S-CPV is slightly expanded with a non-uniform outwards movement of all structure proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). (In contrast, the A-CPV structure reported here does not have such capsid expansion and protein movements, see below.) For example, the apical domain of CSP-A, located next to the fivefold axis, has the largest movement of ∼1 Å (RMSD: 0.97 Å); the dimerization domain, located near the twofold axis, has the smallest movement of ∼0.5 Å (RMSD: 0.49 Å); the CPV-unique small protrusion domain, which is located between the apical and the dimerization domain, moves outwards ∼0.8 Å (RMSD: 0.83 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>). TP, residing on the apical domain of CSP-A, moves outwards ∼1 Å (RMSD: 0.99 Å), which is the same as the displacement of the apical domain of CSP-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In CSP-B, located around the threefold axis, the outwards movements of the apical, small protrusion, and dimerization domains are ∼0.85 Å (RMSD: 0.85 Å), 0.6 Å (RMSD: 0.57 Å), and 0.5 Å (RMSD: 0.49 Å), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Indeed, under cryoEM, SGA-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and S-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) particles look similar and differ from actively transcribing t-CPV particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the 3.1 Å structure of SGA-CPV shows global movements and local conformational changes of its structure proteins that are indistinguishable from those of t-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Furthermore, the large sub-domain of SGA-CPV GTase domain also contains a ligand similar to that in the t-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Second, to eliminate the possibility of GTP as the ligand bound to the putative ATP-binding site in t-CPV, we obtained a 3D reconstruction of SG-CPV at 3.1 Å resolution. While the local conformational changes of SG-CPV structure proteins are identical to those of t-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the global movements of structure proteins of SG-CPV are slightly less than those in t-CPV or SGA-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).

Most importantly, the density of the bound GTP is not as strong as that of the ligand in t-CPV or SGA-CPV, and its triphosphate group becomes invisible when displayed at the same threshold of 3σ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media8" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07901-media8.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.021</object-id><label>Video 8.</label><caption><title>Structure comparison of GTase domain between SG-CPV (gray) and t-CPV (sky blue).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07901.021">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07901.021</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>These results indicate that (1) the global movements and local conformational changes of structural proteins observed in t-CPV are not a consequence, but rather a trigger of RNA transcription; (2) the large sub-domain of the GTase domain binds ATP to mediate the conformational changes observed in t-CPV. Consistent with this assignment, only the large sub-domain (the one containing the ATP-binding site) of the GTase domain undergoes significant conformational changes between S-CPV and t-CPV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figures 3C, 4E</xref>).

We reason that the large sub-domain with the ATP-binding site is possibly an ATPase, and the synergy between SAM and ATP reflects a dependence of its activity on the presence of SAM.

Following the nomenclature of PBCV-1 GTase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hakansson et al., 1997</xref>), we designate the states of GTase domain in G-CPV and t-CPV as closed and open states, respectively. In the open state of GTase domain in t-CPV, we observed extra density next to the β, γ phosphates of the bound GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>), which we interpret as coordinated Mg<sup>2+</sup> for two reasons. First, Mg<sup>2+</sup> was the only divalent cation in our reaction mixture. Second, the GTase domains in SGA-CPV and SG-CPV are also in the open state with prominent densities attributable to Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). Biochemical data have shown that the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is required for GTase activity of viruses in <italic>Reoviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yamakawa et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Le Blois et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Martinez-Costas et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Qiu and Luongo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mohd Jaafar et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, only the open state (with the putative Mg<sup>2+</sup>) is catalytically active. Remarkably, the gate opening is achieved through the displacement of α14 (i.e., the gate helix), one of the three helices comprising the active site of the putative viral ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig6">Figures 4A–C, 6B</xref>). However, even though the gate helix α14 controls the open and closed state, it is not part of the GTase active site. In fact, the active sites of the putative ATPase and GTase do not share any amino acids or secondary elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Therefore, the putative ATPase regulates GTase activity allosterically.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media9" mime-subtype="avi" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-07901-media9.avi"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.027</object-id><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Structure of GTase active site and the bound Mg-GTP in SGA-CPV.</title><p>Color coding: sky blue—atomic model of GTase domain; green—Mg<sup>2+</sup>; GTP—colored by element as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>.

The more extensive hydrogen bonds observed in the open conformation is consistent with our assignment of it as the active state.</p><p>Catalysis of guanylyl transfer occurs in two steps: reaction with GTP to form a covalent enzyme–GMP intermediate (enzyme guanylylation) and transfer of GMP onto the 5′-diphosphorylated acceptor. Previous loss-of-function mutagenesis study of lysine residues in mammalian reovirus suggested that Lys190 of GTase domain is responsible for guanylylation of GTases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luongo et al., 2000</xref>). Lys190 is located in a 28-aa segment (residues 168–195) that connects two structurally conserved β strands. Surprisingly, the conserved β strands (β3 and β4) in CPV GTPase is connected by a segment of only 13 aa (a loop from residues 166–178), which contains no lysine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). The connecting segments do not have sequence or structural similarities. Within the vicinity of the bound GTP, the only lysine residue in CPV GTase domain is Lys234, which maps to a non-conserved residue (Ser259) in mammalian reovirus GTase domain. Moreover, during GTase transition from its closed to open state, the α phosphorus of the GTP moves towards a histidine-rich segment and away from Lys234 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6, 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, our structures indicate that Lys234 cannot directly participate in guanylylation of GTase, a conclusion that is contrary to a previous suggestion based on a likely incorrect placement of a GMP molecule in the active site in a poorer resolution map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yang et al., 2012</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.028</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>The α-phosphorus of GTP bound to the GTase site moves towards His217 and away from Lys234 accompanying the activation of GTase.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The distance between the Nε2 of His217 and the α-phosphorus of GTP in G-CPV is ∼6.5 Å.

Located on the same side of the leaving group (i.e., β, γ-diphosphate), His208 is hydrogen bonded to the β-phosphate of the GTP in SGA-CPV and SG-CPV. Therefore, His208 is not the active site residue; rather, it stabilizes the charge built up on the β-phosphate in the transition state during the catalysis process. Instead, His217 is likely the active site residue. His217 and the leaving group are on opposite sides of the α phosphorus, a geometry suitable for in-line nucleophilic attack of the α phosphorus by His217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6 fig7">Figures 6, 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Indeed, these two conserved histidine residues in orthoreovirus are required for the GTase activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Qiu and Luongo, 2003</xref>). Furthermore, unlike KxDG GTases that have maximum activity at high pH, GTases of viruses in the <italic>Reoviridae</italic> family have maximum activity at pH about or lower than the pKa value (∼6.0) of histidine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Qiu and Luongo, 2003</xref>). Because we observed only the pre guanylylation state of GTase in all three CPV structures (t-CPV, SGA-CPV, and SG-CPV), we reason that enzyme guanylylation mediated by His217 is likely the rate-limiting step in the process of guanylyl transfer.</p><p>Our structures also indicate that the putative viral ATPase regulates the methyl transfer activity of MT-1 through a long-range allosteric effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig8">Figures 1D, 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Second, even if the putative ATPase is activated by SAM but lacks ATP for binding/hydrolysis, MT-1 remains incapable of SAM binding as was observed in S-CPV. In t-CPV where ATP is available, MT-1 becomes SAM bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

This putative viral ATPase has the conserved structural motif for recognition of the adenine base of ATP: hydrogen bonds between the side chains of Ser301, Asp302 and Tyr316 and the adenine ring, pi–pi stacking between the side chain of Tyr305 with the adenine base, and the cation–pi stacking between the side chain of Arg271 and the adenine base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). However, this putative viral ATPase lacks the structural motifs of canonical nucleoside triphosphatases (NTPases) (including cellular kinases), most notably the P loop, for binding the phosphoryl moiety of NTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Saraste et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Smith and Rayment, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Snider and Houry, 2008</xref>). Instead, the phosphoryl group of the bound ATP is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with the side chain of Arg271 or Tyr268 from α13 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Although the large sub-domain has an α helices/β sheet fold, the putative viral ATPase active site is composed of three consecutive helices of α13, α14, and α15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Structurally, the putative ATPase is different from all ATPase known to date, and it may thus represent a new type of ATPase.</p><p>Although both GTP and ATP can bind at the putative viral ATPase site, their interactions with the protein have some differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>). The base and ribose of the bound GTP are less hydrogen bounded to the active site than those of the bound ATP. More importantly, while the triphosphate group of the bound GTP forms only one hydrogen bond through its β phosphate with Tyr268 of the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), the triphosphate moiety of the bound ATP is better stabilized by forming two more hydrogen bonds with the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Conceivably, the more hydrogen bonded ATP is a more efficient substrate of the putative viral ATPase for hydrolysis than GTP, consistent with the colorimetric assay of CPV NTPase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>By integrating the atomic structures of six different CPV particles and correlation with NTPase assay results, we propose a viral ATPase-mediated activation of mRNA transcription and capping, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. As a virus must rely on host cell for replication, it is to the best interest of the virus to remain quiescent outside host cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). CPV senses the entrance into host cytoplasm by detecting the presence of SAM. SAM, acting as a signal and binding to its receptor of MT-2, causes initial conformational change of the virus capsid, which activates the putative viral ATPase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The activated viral ATPase then binds and hydrolyzes ATP to cause three major structural transformations, leading to mRNA transcription and capping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). First, as a result of the translocation of CSP, the viral capsid is enlarged, facilitating dsRNA template movement and enabling efficient mRNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Second, the GTase domain transforms from its closed to open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Although GTP binds to the GTase active site in both states of GTase domain, only in the open state can the GTase bind Mg<sup>2+</sup> and catalyze His217-mediated guanylyl transfer. Third, the MT-1 domain transforms from its closed to open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Only in its open conformation can MT-1 bind SAM. While the MT-1 and GTase domains from the same molecule are separated by the bridge domain and have no direct contact with each other, the MT-1 from a neighboring TP sits atop the putative ATPase sub-domain of GTase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). We, therefore propose that the putative ATPase regulates the activity of MT-1 in a neighboring TP, probably through the conformational changes of the putative ATPase sub-domain upon ATP binding/hydrolysis. Notably, from S-CPV to t-CPV, the C-terminal loop of GTase domain exhibits significant movement towards the MT-1 domain of its neighboring TP molecule, presumably contributing to open the active site of the MT-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.032</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Schematic illustration of the putative viral ATPase-mediated activation of mRNA transcription and capping.</title><p>In this illustration, the active open states of enzymes are shown in filled colors and the inactive closed states of enzymes are shown in dotted color lines.

The remarkable parallel between the ATPase activity and the transcription activity indicated that they may have also employed the ATPase-mediated activation for mRNA transcription and capping identified here. For example, reovirus cores had high level of ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Noble and Nibert, 1997</xref>) and could synthesize mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shatkin and Sipe, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee and Shatkin, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Drayna and Fields, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farsetta et al., 2000</xref>), but virions had little ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Noble and Nibert, 1997</xref>) and could not synthesize mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shatkin and Sipe, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Farsetta et al., 2000</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sjors Scheres (Reviewing editor) and Venkatar Prasad (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>All three reviewers thought that the structures presented were of excellent quality and represented a tour-de-force use of near atomic resolution cryo-EM on fairly complicated viral system to derive the mechanistic basis of an intrinsic feature that is common to turreted reoviruses. In particular, the mechanism of SAM activation of the transcriptase was considered to be a nice contribution. Still, a few concerns were raised that would require your careful attention in a revised manuscript. These are (in order of importance):</p><p>1) The suggested ATPase activity at the observed site and its postulated role during transcription are not convincing. The presence of ATP bound there where they see it does not mean that this is the ATPase active site. Normally, to catch ATP bound at the active site of an ATPase, it is necessary to use a non-hydrolysable analog. Your manuscript shows also that the particle hydrolyses ATP in the presence of SAM, so why would this ATP molecule be intact in the ATPase active site? In addition, ATP is hydrolyzed usually to recover the energy for some other function, like in motor proteins. It is not obvious here how is the energy of ATP hydrolysis used during transcription. Would its hydrolysis lead to a further change of conformation of the TP? Or how do you envision the use of the ATPase to help in transcription? Currently, the data do not justify the title “ATP-binding mediates RNA transcription and capping in a dsRNA virus”.</p><p>2) The description of the actual conformational changes is difficult to follow, and at points appears contradictory. The figures are also not very helpful in showing the conformational change. Morphings of the particle from one state to the others, provided as supplementary animations, would help a lot.</p><p>3) Also, the observed conformational differences among some of these maps (e.g. S-CPV and CPV) are very small to support the hypothesis that 'the enlarged capsid may facilitate dsRNA template movement'. Could small differences in magnification have occurred among the different data sets and provide an alternative explanation for the enlarged capsid size? Could you also provide an estimate of the internal cavity in cubic Angstroms for each of the relevant reconstructions?</p><p>4) It is not clear how the location of the magnesium location is identified. Whether the typical magnesium coordination geometry is satisfied, and how tentative is the assignment needs to be addressed.</p><p>5) In the t-CPV structure: it looks like the transcripts are getting extruded, but it appears there is no density that is observed in the turrets that can be assigned to exiting RNA molecules. Considering that endogenous transcription is a dynamic process, one would expect some of the structural features in the exit pathway should be smeared; however, there is no discussion of this in the manuscript.</p><p>The density in the presented figures and movie looks quite good, so the following comments may not be that relevant to this particular paper. However, it is good practice to show clarity in all manuscripts about how potential overfitting was assessed in both cryo-EM map refinement and the atomic model refinement inside that map.</p><p>6) You state that 'We have previously shown that our common-lines based programs do not suffer from the problems of over-fitting or model bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>)'. However, the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou 2014</xref> paper doesn't explicitly mention overfitting, although it does show a gold-standard FSC curve in the supplementary information. Does that mean that you used gold-standard refinement procedures in the calculation of these maps? If so, you should mention this explicitly instead of citing the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou 2014</xref> paper.

You could either choose to limit the resolution used in the model refinement (and then assess the falloff of the R-factor or the FSC between the model and the map beyond that resolution, i.e. the predictive power of the model), or you could refine a scrambled version of the model in one of the gold-standard half-maps and then calculate FSC/R-factors between that model and that same half-map as well as FSC/R-factors between that model and the other half-map. The difference between these 2 curves is an indication of the amount of overfitting in the model. In the absence of overfitting, the 2 curves should overlap.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.034</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The suggested ATPase activity at the observed site and its postulated role during transcription are not convincing. The presence of ATP bound there where they see it does not mean that this is the ATPase active site. Normally, to catch ATP bound at the active site of an ATPase, it is necessary to use a non-hydrolysable analog. Your manuscript shows also that the particle hydrolyses ATP in the presence of SAM, so why would this ATP molecule be intact in the ATPase active site? In addition, ATP is hydrolyzed usually to recover the energy for some other function, like in motor proteins</italic>.</p><p>An intact ATP can be observed at the active site when ATP hydrolysis at that site is a slow, rate-limiting step. Once ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP, it would be rapidly replaced by a new ATP. For the same reason, we only observed GTP—not the GMP product—at the active site of CPV GTase. We have performed preliminary reconstruction with an ATP analog (AMP-PNP) and indeed, the analog was observed at the expected site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07901.035</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>CryoEM of SGnA-CPV.

Would its hydrolysis lead to a further change of conformation of the TP? Or how do you envision the use of the ATPase to help in transcription?</italic></p><p>Yes, we observed significant outwards movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) of TP (please see the subsection entitled “Structure changes in t-CPV and discovery of an ATP-binding site in TP”). We show that CPV capsid underwent two-step size expansion: one small (from unliganded CPV to S-CPV, therefore no ATP hydrolysis) and one large [from S-CPV (without hydrolysis) to t-CPV (with hydrolysis), and from S-CPV (without hydrolysis) to SGA-CPV (with hydrolysis)]. The energy released is used for these conformation changes.</p><p><italic>Currently, the data do not justify the title</italic> “<italic>ATP-binding mediates RNA transcription and capping in a dsRNA virus</italic>”.</p><p>With the affirmative answers to the above two questions, we hope the reviewers are less concerned about our title. In the revised manuscript, we have changed the title to the following: “A putative ATPase mediates RNA transcription and capping in a dsRNA virus” to soften our tone.</p><p>More specifically, the following four facts support our conclusion that the sub-domain harboring the newly discovered ATP-binding site is likely an ATPase that mediates the activation of mRNA transcription. First, our results show that CPV’s ATPase activity and ATP binding to the putative ATPase sites are both SAM-dependent. Second, the two non-transcribing CPV (i.e., SGA-CPV and SG-CPV) have similar structures to that of transcribing CPV (t-CPV), indicating that the conformation changes observed in t-CPV are not a consequence, but rather a trigger of RNA transcription. Third, previous biochemical studies have shown that the mRNA transcription of CPV is SAM-dependent and is specifically coupled to ATP hydrolysis. Fourth, the removal of turret in orthoreovirus leads to loss of mRNA transcription activity (please see the subsection headed “Demonstration of viral ATPase activity and its SAM-dependence”). This cumulative evidence strongly suggests that the large sub-domain of CPV TP is likely an ATPase that plays a role in the activation of mRNA transcription.</p><p><italic>2) The description of the actual conformational changes is difficult to follow, and at points appears contradictory. The figures are also not very helpful in showing the conformational change. Morphings of the particle from one state to the others, provided as supplementary animations, would help a lot</italic>.</p><p>We now provided two new movies (Movie 2 and Movie 4). These movies show morphing of CPV particle from CPV to S-CPV and from S-CPV to t-CPV.</p><p><italic>3) Also, the observed conformational differences among some of these maps (e.g. S-CPV and CPV) are very small to support the hypothesis that 'the enlarged capsid may facilitate dsRNA template movement'. Could small differences in magnification have occurred among the different data sets and provide an alternative explanation for the enlarged capsid size? Could you also provide an estimate of the internal cavity in cubic Angstroms for each of the relevant reconstructions?</italic></p><p>As indicated above, in the response to point 1, we report two-step conformational changes – one small and one large. The reviewer is correct that the conformational change from unliganded CPV to S-CPV is small. However, the “enlarged capsid” was not referring to this small change but rather to the large change (up to 9Å, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-D</xref>) from S-CPV to t-CPV. The estimated internal volume of unliganded CPV and t-CPV is 73,900,000 Å<sup>3</sup> and 77,500,000Å<sup>3</sup>, respectively. This is an ∼5% increase in volume.</p><p>Although the small change (i.e., that from CPV to S-CPV) is not relevant to our hypothesis, we trust the observed change is real and is unlikely due to magnification variation for the following two reasons. First, the slight expansion of viral capsid from unliganded CPV to S-CPV is anisotropic (The region proximal to the five-fold axis has the largest change of ∼1Å while the regions around the two- and three-fold axes have the smallest changes of ∼0.5Å.). Second, unlike the small changes between unliganded CPV and S-CPV, the structures of A-CPV and G-CPV are identical, so are the structures of t-CPV and SGA-CPV.</p><p><italic>4) It is not clear how the location of the magnesium location is identified. Whether the typical magnesium coordination geometry is satisfied, and how tentative is the assignment needs to be addressed</italic>.</p><p>We identified the magnesium based on the density and chemical geometry. The modeled magnesium and GTP coordination has the cis bidentate conformation, which is the most commonly observed formation. We recognize that our maps are at about ∼3Å resolution and still not high enough to be very definitive for Mg modeling. To soften the tone, we have deleted Mg<sup>2+</sup> from the Abstract and added “putative Mg<sup>2+</sup> bound” in the revised manuscript (second paragraph of the subsection headed “The putative viral ATPase regulates the activities of GTase and MT-1”).</p><p><italic>5) In the t-CPV structure: it looks like the transcripts are getting extruded, but it appears there is no density that is observed in the turrets that can be assigned to exiting RNA molecules. Considering that endogenous transcription is a dynamic process, one would expect some of the structural features in the exit pathway should be smeared; however, there is no discussion of this in the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Good point. We have added the following statement (to the subsection “Structure changes in t-CPV and discovery of an ATP-binding site in TP”): “However, no mRNA densities are visible in our icosahedral reconstruction because these RNA molecules are transcripts of different genomic segments at different stages of the dynamic transcription process and are smeared by averaging.”</p><p><italic>The density in the presented figures and movie looks quite good, so the following comments may not be that relevant to this particular paper. However, it is good practice to show clarity in all manuscripts about how potential overfitting was assessed in both cryo-EM map refinement and the atomic model refinement inside that map.</italic></p><p><italic>6) You state that 'We have previously shown that our common-lines based programs do not suffer from the problems of over-fitting or model bias (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"><italic>Zhou et al., 2014</italic></xref><italic>)'. However, the</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47"><italic>Zhou 2014</italic></xref> <italic>paper doesn't explicitly mention overfitting, although it does show a gold-standard FSC curve in the supplementary information.

In the absence of overfitting, the 2 curves should overlap</italic>.</p><p>We thank you for recognizing the quality of the maps. To provide further validation, we took advantage of the existence of identical structures of t-CPV and SGA-CPV (both independently determined) and calculated the FSC curves between the SGA-CPV map and the SGA-CPV model and that between the SGA-CPV map and the t-CPV model. Because these structures were independently determined, they are essentially the same as “gold-standard” FSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheres, 2012</xref>). These analyses further support our conclusion that our reconstructions do not have over-fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1B</xref> in the revised manuscript).</p></body></sub-article></article>
