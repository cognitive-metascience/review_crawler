<italic>Drosophila</italic> progenitors (neuroblasts) are a good model: they are individually identifiable with relevant spatial and temporal transcription factors known. Here we test whether spatial/temporal factors act independently or sequentially in neuroblasts. We used Targeted DamID to identify genomic binding sites of the Hunchback temporal factor in two neuroblasts (NB5-6 and NB7-4) that make different progeny. Hunchback targets were different in each neuroblast, ruling out the independent specification model. Moreover, each neuroblast had distinct open chromatin domains, which correlated with differential Hb-bound loci in each neuroblast. Importantly, the Gsb/Pax3 spatial factor, expressed in NB5-6 but not NB7-4, had genomic binding sites correlated with open chromatin in NB5-6, but not NB7-4. Our data support a model in which early-acting spatial factors like Gsb establish neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, leading to neuroblast-specific temporal factor binding and the production of different neurons in each neuroblast lineage.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44036.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human brain is considered to be the most complicated object in the universe, but it only takes a handful of stem cells to make one. The process depends on two types of information: signals separated across space and time. Spatial cues tell a stem cell what type of cell it is going to be, while temporal cues work as molecular clocks to generate a sequence of different neurons over time. Together, these cues generate the large array of cell types in the nervous system.</p><p>Each stem cell occupies its own space in the developing body and receives its own spatial cues, but they all follow the same timeline. For example, proteins called transcription factors act as molecular clocks and interact with specific genes, telling the cell when to turn them on or off. The same series of transcription factors operates in different stem cells, but they have different effects. So far, it has been unclear whether spatial and temporal signals work independently or sequentially to generate new cell types.</p><p>To find out, Sen et al. studied two distinct, developing stem cells in fruit flies, which receive different spatial signals. Transcription factors only work if they are able to get to their target genes. Cells can open or close access to different genes by changing the structure of the chromatin wrapping that surrounds the genes. In the experiments, a marker was used to reveal the areas of open chromatin in each of the cells. Another marker was used to track the transcription factors. The results showed that the areas of open chromatin varied between stem cells. Moreover, although both cells used the same transcription factor called Hunchback, it targeted different genes in each stem cell. This was due to changes in the chromatin wrapping: Hunchback only acted in areas where the chromatin was open. This suggests that the spatial cues first sculpt the chromatin, making some genes easier to get to than others. Then, the same transcription factors go to the accessible gene, which will differ from one stem cell to another.</p><p>These findings help us to understand how different types of brain cells develop, which may also aid us in finding a way how to engineer specific cell types. If we could turn stem cells into different types of brain cells, it might help us to treat brain diseases. This may involve giving the right spatial signal before starting the temporal cues.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>DamID</kwd><kwd>stem cell</kwd><kwd>spatial patterning</kwd><kwd>temporal identity</kwd><kwd>neuroblast</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia Q</given-names></name><name><surname>Chanchani</surname><given-names>Sachin</given-names></name><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fulbright-Nehru Postdoctoral Fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sen</surname><given-names>Sonia Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD27056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Doe</surname><given-names>Chris Q</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Spatial factors generate neuroblast-specific open chromatin, thereby biasing the subsequent binding of transcription factors to produce neuroblast-specific neurons.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The generation of neuronal diversity in mammals and Drosophila is a multi-step process. The initial step is the production of the neuroectoderm (ventral in Drosophila, dorsal in mammals) that gives rise to neural progenitors. In both systems, the neuroectoderm and neural progenitor population acquire regional differences due to the action of Hox genes and spatial patterning genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jessell, 2000</xref>). Although spatial patterning generates diversity within the neural progenitor population, it is insufficient to account for the neuronal diversity in the mature nervous system. Expanding neural diversity requires a second step called temporal patterning, where individual neural progenitors produce a sequence of distinct neurons and glia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe, 2017</xref>). In both Drosophila and mammals, this process appears to be regulated, in part, by temporal transcription factors (TTFs) that are sequentially expressed within individual neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>). Although a great deal is known about how spatial factors generate regional diversity, and much has recently been learned about temporal patterning mechanisms, virtually nothing is known about how spatial factors and TTFs are integrated to specify distinct neuronal identities in spatially distinct progenitor populations.</p><p>Drosophila is an excellent model system to investigate how spatial and temporal factors are integrated during neurogenesis, due to a deep understanding of neural progenitor (neuroblast) lineages, and the molecular mechanisms involved in both spatial and temporal patterning during neurogenesis. The Drosophila neuroectoderm produces a bilateral array of 30 neuroblasts in each segment, named according to their row and columnar position within the two dimensional neuroblast array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). Each neuroblast has a unique identity based on its distinct molecular profile and each neuroblast produces a unique and stereotyped family of neurons.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44036.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spatial and temporal cues are integrated to generate neuronal diversity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial and temporal patterning.Â (Left) As neuroblasts delaminate from the neuroectoderm, they experience spatial transcription factors (e.g. Gsb, En, Vnd, Ind, Msh shown) that gives each neuroblast a unique molecular identity.

Henceforth we refer to these spatial factors as âspatial transcription factorsâ or STFs, paralleling the naming of temporal transcription factors as TTFs. The Gooseberry (Gsb) Pax-3 family transcription factor is expressed in row 5 neuroblasts; loss of Gsb transforms row 5 neuroblasts into row 3/4 identity, and misexpression of Gsb transforms row 3/4 neuroblasts into row 5 identity. Importantly, transient misexpression of Gsb in the neuroectoderm, prior to neuroblast formation, is sufficient to generate ectopic row 5 neuroblasts, suggesting that neuroblast identity is determined in the neuroectoderm and maintained during the subsequent neuroblast lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skeath et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhat, 1996</xref>). Thus, Gsb is one of the best characterized STFs. Similarly, the secreted Wingless (Wg) protein is produced by row 5 neuroectoderm, where it is required to specify the adjacent row 4 and 6 neuroblast identity that is maintained in the row 4 and 6 neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu-LaGraff and Doe, 1993</xref>). Precise inactivation of a temperature-sensitive Wg protein showed that loss of Wg activity in the neuroectoderm resulted in loss of neuroblast identity, whereas inactivation of Wg after neuroblast formation had no effect, showing that transient Wg generates row 4 and 6 neuroblast identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu-LaGraff and Doe, 1993</xref>). In addition, Hedgehog (Hh) expression in row 6/7 neuroectoderm is required to specify neuroblast identity in adjacent rows 1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McDonald and Doe, 1997</xref>). Finally, Engrailed expression in the neuroectoderm is required for the proper development of row 6/7 neuroblasts, and transient Engrailed misexpression generates ectopic row 7 neuroblast identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Deshpande et al., 2001</xref>). Taken together, these spatial patterning experiments show that neuroblast spatial identity is specified in the neuroectoderm by the transient action of STFs expressed in different neuroblast rows.</p><p>Spatial patterning does not only generate distinct rows of neuroblasts, but also distinct neuroblast columns. During the first stages of neuroblast formation there are three distinct columns of neuroblasts, each specified by a conserved homeodomain protein. Vnd is expressed in a medial column of neuroectoderm, Ind is expressed in an intermediate column, and Msh (Flybase: Drop) is expressed in the lateral column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isshiki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiss et al., 1998</xref>). Loss of function and misexpression studies show that each is necessary and partially sufficient for specifying columnar neuroblast identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isshiki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McDonald et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiss et al., 1998</xref>). It is likely that these columnar factors function in the neuroectoderm, like spatial row factors, because they do not persist throughout neuroblast lineages. All three of these STFs have conserved mammalian orthologs with similar medial-lateral expression in the neuroectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weiss et al., 1998</xref>). Overall, the combination of row and columnar STFs are likely to generate the observed 30 distinct neuroblast identities. Hox factors provide an additional spatial cue that distinguishes segmental differences in neuroblast identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prokop and Technau, 1994</xref>).</p><p>Whereas spatial patterning generates 30 different neuroblast identities, temporal patterning is required to generate different progeny within each neuroblast lineage. Most neuroblasts sequentially express a series of four TTFs as they divide to generate ganglion mother cell (GMC) progeny, and the specific TTF inherited by each GMC determines its identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohwi and Doe, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe, 2017</xref>). Embryonic ventral nerve cord (VNC) neuroblasts undergo a TTF cascade that progresses from Hunchback (Hb; Ikaros zinc finger family) to KrÃ¼ppel (zinc finger family) to the redundant Nubbin/Pdm2 (Pdm) to Castor (Cas; Casz1 zinc finger family) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle). Other neuroblasts in the larval VNC, brain, and optic lobes undergo a similar TTF cascade to increase neuronal diversity, although the identity of the TTFs differs in each region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doe, 2017</xref>). The Hb-Kr-Pdm-Cas TTF cascade has been particularly well-characterized, with each factor being necessary and sufficient to specify the neuronal identity produced during its window of expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Novotny et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grosskortenhaus et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tran and Doe, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohwi et al., 2013</xref>). Importantly, each TTF specifies a different type of neuron in each neuroblast lineage, showing that spatial identity provides a different context for Hb function in each neuroblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). Understanding this âcontextâ at a mechanistic level is the goal of our experiments below.</p><p>The role of TTFs is best exemplified by Hb, the first TTF in the cascade. Loss of Hb results in absence of the first-born neuron identities in all neuroblast lineages assayed to date (1-1, 3-1, 3-5, 7-1, 7-3). Conversely, driving prolonged Hb expression in neuroblasts results in ectopic first-born neurons in all lineages tested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Novotny et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanai et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohwi et al., 2013</xref>). For example, prolonged expression of Hb in NB7-1 produces ectopic U1 motor neurons, whereas prolonged expression of Hb in NB7-3 produces ectopic EW1 serotonergic interneurons. Note that these misexpression experiments further confirm the neuroblast-specific effect of Hb, showing that the spatial identity of the neuroblast determines the effect of Hb. Importantly, Hb can induce early-born neuronal identity throughout a âcompetence windowâ ofÂ ~5 neuroblast divisions (from embryonic stage 9â12). The length of the competence window is defined by expression of Distal antenna (Dan), a nuclear Pipsqueak domain protein present in all neuroblast nuclei until stage 12 (about five divisions for most neuroblasts); Dan is downregulated in all neuroblasts at the end of stage 12, and this closes the Hb competence window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohwi et al., 2013</xref>). Hb can induce first-born neuronal identity at any point during this competence window, showing that Hb binding sites are accessible throughout the competence window; this is important to consider for the experiments described here, where we have restricted our Hb binding and chromatin accessibility profiling experiments to the stage 9â12 competence window in individual neuroblast lineages (see below).</p><p>It is clear that spatial and temporal cues are integrated to generate lineage-specific neuronal diversity, both in Drosophila embryonic neuroblasts and optic lobe neuroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erclik et al., 2017</xref>), and likely in mammalian progenitor lineages. Yet in no case, mammals or Drosophila, is it known how spatial and TTFs are integrated. Here we hypothesise two mechanisms by which this integration could occur. (1) Independent specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In this scenario, spatial and temporal transcription factors bind their genomic targets independently, and the combinatorial actions of these factors and their downstream gene regulatory networks results in unique gene expression and therefore unique neural identities. (2) Sequential specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In this scenario, early expression of STFs in the neuroectoderm (where they are known to act) biases the subsequent DNA-binding profile of the later expressed TTFs. This could happen via STFs generating different chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast, or via STFs promoting the persistent expression of TTF cofactors that result in neuroblast-specific TTF DNA-binding. While both scenarios would result in the specification of distinct neural identities in spatially distinct NBs, in the independent specification model, TTF binding will be identical in all neuroblasts whereas in the sequential specification model, TTF binding will occur at different loci in each neuroblast.</p><p>To discriminate between these models, we sought to determine Hb genomic targets in NB5-6 versus NB7-4. If independent specification is used, we expect to find similar Hb occupancy in each neuroblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), whereas if sequential specification is used, we expect to find different Hb genomic binding in each neuroblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Our goal was to identify Hb occupancy within the early NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages during the Hb competence window, when Hb retains the ability to generate ectopic early-born neuronal identities, and thus presumably can still bind its normal genomic targets. To identify Hb occupancy in these two neuroblast lineages, we adapted the previously described TargetedÂ DamIDÂ (TaDa) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Southall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Marshall et al., 2016</xref>). TaDa relies on an attenuated expression of the DNA adenosine methyltransferase (Dam) enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), which binds genomic DNA and methylates adenosine at GATC sites. This covalent DNA mark can be used to determine Dam binding sites, due to the very low level of endogenous DNA methylation in Drosophila. Expression of Dam alone can be used to detect open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aughey et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) or Dam can be fused to a transcription factor such as Hb, which provides a read-out of Hb genomic occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Here we characterize two Gal4 lines that are specific for NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages in the embryo. We use these lines to obtain NB-specific expression of Dam:Hb (to identify Hb genomic occupancy) and Dam alone (to detect open chromatin). We demonstrate that Hb has differential targets in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages, which correspond to differentially open chromatin in each lineage. Importantly, our observation that Hb-bound loci specific to NB5-6 have open chromatin, but the same loci in NB7-4 have closed chromatin, shows that Hb is not sufficient to create open chromatin. Rather, Hb binding in each neuroblast is likely restricted to a subset of neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains. In support of this model, the Gsb STF, required to specify NB5-6 but not NB7-4, shows enriched occupancy at open chromatin and Hb enriched loci in NB5-6, but not in NB7-4, consistent with a role for Gsb in generating neuroblast-specific open chromatin organization. Our findings support a sequential specification model in which STFs create neuroblast-specific chromatin organization, leading to neuroblast-specific Hb DNA-binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of Gal4 lines specificÂ for NB5-6 or NB7-4</title><p>Here we characterize two Gal4 lines that label either the NB5-6 or the NB7-4 lineages, which is a prerequisite for profiling neuroblast-specific Hb binding sites. NB5-6 forms in the Gsb domain, whereas NB7-4 forms in the Engrailed domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

DiI clonal analyses show that both NB5-6 and NB7-4 make distinct populations of interneurons, but also similar populations of subperineurial glia, and their birth-order in the lineage has not been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). Therefore, we used <italic>NB5-6-Gal4</italic> to generate MultiColorFlipOut (MCFO; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nern et al., 2015</xref>) single neuron labelling among NB5-6 progeny. We repeatedly (nÂ =Â 31) identified a Hb<sup>+</sup> neuron that had a characteristic ipsilateral ascending projection, which we name the Chaise Lounge neuron due to its distinctive morphology; two segmentally repeated Chaise Lounge neurons are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; inset shows a Chaise Lounge neuron expressing Hb. We searched the EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohyama et al., 2015</xref>) and identified an identical Chaise Lounge neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Thus, NB5-6 makes a distinctive ipsilateral neuron during its Hb expression window. Similarly, we used <italic>NB7-4-Gal4</italic> to generate MCFO single cell labelling, but could not directly identify a Hb+Â neuron either due to loss of Hb from early-born neurons prior to neuronal differentiation, or due to lack of Gal4 expression in these neurons. Instead, we used multiple criteria to identify a putative early-born neuron, the G neuron, using MARCM clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), and EM reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>). Our criteria for assigning this neuron as early-born include (i) presence of the neuron in full NB7-4 clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>) but not in the NB7-4-Gal4 pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which misses early-born neurons; (ii) cell body position next to the neuropil, where most Hb+Â neurons are located (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kambadur et al., 1998</xref>); and (iii) close morphological match to the grasshopper G neuron, an early-born neuron from NB7-4, including ascending and descending projections in the most lateral connective tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raper et al., 1983</xref>). Finally, we note that all NB7-4 neuronal progeny have contralateral axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>), whereas the NB5-6 early-born Chaise Lounge neuron has ipsilateral projections. Thus, we conclude that NB5-6 and NB7-4 produce different neurons during the Hb expression window. This makes NB5-6 and NB7-4 an appropriate model system to characterize how different spatial patterning cues produce distinct Hb+Â early born cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Generation of a functional, non-toxic Dam:Hb fusion protein</title><p>The first step in using the TaDa method to map Hb occupancy in the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages is to generate a functional, non-toxic Dam:Hb fusion protein.

To determine whether the Hb portion of the Dam:Hb fusion protein was functional, we assayed for its ability to generate ectopic Eve+Â U neurons, despite being expressed at very low levels. In wild type, NB7-1 generates five Eve+Â U neurons, including the Hb+Â early born U1 and U2 neurons, and extending neuroblast expression of Hb produces many ectopic Eve+Â U1/U2 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pearson and Doe, 2003</xref>). We observed that expression of Dam:Hb was capable of inducing a small number of ectopic Eve+Â neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), despite the low levels of Dam:Hb, showing that Dam:Hb is functional.

The TaDa method involves comparing Dam genomic binding to Dam:Hb genomic binding, with a normalised ratio used to identify sites preferentially bound by the Dam:Hb fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Southall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marshall and Brand, 2015</xref>). We expressed Dam or Dam:Hb in all cells throughout embryogenesis, measured the quantile normalised ratio between them to identify Dam:Hb binding sites (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods), and performed three biological replicates at embryonic stage 17. We found that the biological replicates showed high Pearson correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left), and were qualitatively very similar along the entire fourth chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, right). Most importantly, we compared Dam:Hb genomic occupancy with published Hb genomic occupancy determined by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bradley et al., 2010</xref>). A comparison over 700 kb of genomic DNA on chromosome 3R showed qualitatively similar Dam:Hb and Hb ChIP binding profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Indeed, enriched Dam:Hb binding was detected at eight of the nine known Hb target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lyne et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We next compared the similarities in Hb occupancy as reported by these two techniques at the genomic level. To do this, we ran the MACS2 peak caller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) on the two datasets and identified 6597 and 6656 regions significantly enriched for Dam:Hb and Hb ChIP respectively (see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). We found that 1972 regions were shared between the two (29.89% of ChIP peaks and 29.62% of Dam:Hb peaks). When broad peaks were used for this analysis, 2394 regions were shared between the two, or 33.74% of ChIP peaks and 45.13% of Dam:Hb peaks; and when the narrow peaks were extended to 2 kb on either side of the peak summit, 2207 regions were shared between the two, or 57.53% of ChIP peaks and 60.37% of Dam:Hb peaks. A Monte Carlo analysis on the narrow peak overlap showed this was highly significant, detecting only 6.16% overlap with a set of random peaks (100 iterations, p-valueÂ &lt;Â 1 e<sup>â300</sup>, see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods). Correspondingly, we found high ChIP signals at the Dam:Hb binding sites and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, this overlap in occupancy was not seen when the Dam:Hb data were compared with the ChIP-seq data of any other transcription factor, such as Ftz or Bcd (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), demonstrating the specificity of the method. Additional support for the accuracy of Dam:Hb binding is that the known Hb DNA-binding motif is the most enriched motif at Dam:Hb binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Taken together, these results show that Dam:Hb binding closely mimics endogenous Hb binding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages have different Hb-bound loci</title><p>At this point we have validated two neuroblast-specific Gal4 lines, as well as shown that Dam:Hb genomic binding is both reproducible and matches published Hb ChIP data in stage nine whole embryos. However, to test the two models of spatial and temporal integration we had to use Dam:Hb in the NB5-6 or NB7-4 lineages â much smaller pools of cells â to determine whether Hb genomic targets were the same or different in these spatially distinct NB lineages. Therefore, our next step was to determine if we could get reproducible Dam:Hb binding data from this small pool of cells, and with shorter Dam:Hb exposure than previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Southall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erclik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Widmer et al., 2018</xref>).

We expressed Dam:Hb in a single neuroblast lineage in each hemisegment (about 200 cells in theÂ ~50,000 cell embryo) and for five hours (from embryonic stage 9â12).

This clearly rules out the independent specification model where Hb has identical binding sites in different neuroblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Different chromatin states in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages</title><p>We next wanted to understand how STFs might influence TTF genomic binding. Given the order of their action â STFs acting early in the neuroectoderm, and TTFs acting later in the delaminated NB â one possibility is that STFs generate different open/closed chromatin landscapes in each neuroblast such that TTFs have access to different loci in each neuroblast. This would predict that spatially distinct NBs would have different open/closed chromatin landscapes. To determine if this were indeed true, we performed chromatin accessibility profiling by Dam only (CaTaDa), which exploits the ability of the Dam protein to bind open chromatin domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aughey et al., 2018</xref>). We first expressed Dam in all cells throughout embryogenesis using <italic>Da-Gal4</italic> and observed excellent reproducibility between biological replicates both qualitatively and quantitatively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, red tracks in C). We next wanted to confirm that Dam only binding in the embryo correlates with open chromatin domains, as has been shown in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aughey et al., 2018</xref>). To do this, we analysed the Dam only signal around the DNase I hypersensitive sites (peaks) made available by the BDTNP consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2011</xref>) and found enriched Dam signals around the DNaseI peaks, as well as qualitative similarities between the two (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, compare red and ochre tracks in C). We observed 6,708 Dam only peaks were aligned with DNase I hypersensitive peaks (44.6% of all Dam only peaks; 33.9% of all DNaseI peaks). A Monte Carlo analysis showed this was highly significant, detecting only 18.14% overlap with a set of random peaks (100 iterations, p-valueÂ &lt;Â 1 e<sup>â300</sup>, see MaterialsÂ andÂ methods).

We wanted to determine if Dam:Hb binding was similarly responsive to the state of the chromatin in the NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages. To do this, we took all Dam:Hb-bound loci â both those specific for each neuroblast as well as those shared by both neuroblasts â and queried the state of the chromatin at these loci in each NB lineage.

Corresponding to this, we found 364 peaks, or 50.76% of the differential Dam:Hb peaks in NB5-6 overlapped with differentially open chromatin peaks in that lineage; and 164 peaks or 32.74% of the differential Dam:Hb peaks in NB7-4 overlapped with differentially open chromatin peaks in that lineage.

As a control, we assayed loci bound by Dam:Hb in both neuroblast lineages and found that there was no difference between lineages in open chromatin at these sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

This correlation suggests that either Hb binds where chromatin is open, or that Hb binding opens chromatin. The latter model seems unlikely, because both NB5-6 and NB7-4 are exposed to Hb expression, yet each neuroblast has specific open chromatin domains (see Discussion).

In all cases, the number of cells expressing the Dam constructs are relatively large:~10,000 FACS purified ESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheetham et al., 2018</xref>) andÂ ~5000 mushroom body neurons per brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Widmer et al., 2018</xref>). In our study we analyze the smallest percentage of cells to date - we calculate that there are between 8â12 cells in each hemisegment expressing Dam constructs; with a total of 11 segments that would give a maximum of 264 cells per embryo, or about 0.5% of the estimated 50,000 cells per embryo. Furthermore, we pushed the limits of the technique by allowing just 5 hr of Dam or Dam:Hb expression. Itâs likely that this restrictive condition was successful in the case of a transcription factor-DNA interaction, which is stable during the time window; it might not be sufficient for factors such as RNA Pol II that require processivity through a gene. The ability to query transcription factor occupancy in such a precise manner â in a small subsets of cells over short periods of time â will encourage new uses of the method, such as studying the determination of cellular identities during development, upon reprogramming, or even in response to stimuli.</p><p>We propose that the spatial factor Gsb opens genomic loci in NB5-6, allowing the temporal factor Hb to bind loci that are not available in the adjacent Gsb-negative NB7-4. Although nothing is currently known about the role of Gsb in chromatin regulation, the closely related mammalian Pax3 and Pax7 transcription factors can recruit histone methyltransferase to promote open chromatin and increase gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McKinnell et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawabe et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Pax7 is a pioneer factor during pituitary development, openingÂ ~2500 loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Budry et al., 2012</xref>). It would be informative to test whether Gsb can recruit trithorax complex methyltransferase to open genomic loci in row five neuroblasts, and whether this is required for row five neuroblast spatial identity and differential binding of Hb.</p><p>The specific enrichment of Gsb occupancy at regions of accessible chromatin in NB5-6 is a striking result that supports our model despite different cell populations used for each experiment (total embryonic vs. single NB lineage), different stages assayed (0â12 vs. 9â12), and different methods used (Dam vs. Gsb ChIP). Despite these differences, we observed significant enrichment of Gsb-bound loci at open chromatin in a NB-specific manner: NB5-6 shows enrichment, whereas NB7-4 does not. Ideally, similar experiments need to be conducted with Dam:Gsb in NB5-6 and Dam:En in NB7-4 lineage to determine correspondence of STF occupancy and chromatin accessibility, as well as STF and TTF occupancy in the NB lineages. The advantage of the Drosophila model is that these relationships can be rigorously tested. For example, mutational inactivation of the relevant STF, while assaying chromatin accessibility or Hb occupancy in a lineage-specific way could reveal a causal link between the STF and chromatin landscape, and STF and Hb occupancy. Similarly, targeting chromatin modifiers to select loci while assaying Hb occupancy could demonstrate a causal link between chromatin state and Hb occupancy. To definitively rule out the possibility that Hb acts as a pioneer in these lineages, it may be feasible to misexpress or mutate Hb, to determine the effect on chromatin accessibility. These are technically difficult studies, beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>We show thatÂ ~1200 Hb-bound loci are different in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages, and that the chromatin at these sites is preferentially open. In some cases Dam:Hb occupancy is broader than Dam (open chromatin) occupancy; this could be due to Dam:Hb maintaining occupancy longer than Dam alone. The strong correlation between Dam:Hb binding and open chromatin could be due to Hb binding to previously opened chromatin domains, or Hb acting as a pioneer factor to open chromatin. We do not favor the latter mechanism because Hb binds some sites in NB5-6 but not in NB7-4 (and vice versa) showing that it is not sufficient to open chromatin.</p><p>NB5-6 and NB7-4 develop adjacent to each other during neuroblast formation. They share a common lateral Msh+Â spatial column, but are in different anterior/posterior spatial domains (NB5-6 is Gsb<sup>+</sup>, NB7-4 is En<sup>+</sup>). Although NB5-6 and NB7-4 make different early-born neurons, they share a common ability to make subperineurial glia and neurons that project through the posterior commissure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmidt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmid et al., 1999</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that their common properties are due to their shared columnar spatial position, whereas their differences are due to different anterior/posterior spatial cues.</p><p>Although we have provided evidence that Hb-bound loci are chosen from neuroblast-specific open chromatin domains, this does not rule out that sequential specification occurs via lineage-specific STFs/STF-target genes acting as Hb cofactors to bias Hb binding in each lineage. However, we have been unable to find any <italic>de novo</italic> DNA motif enriched within 1 kb of Hb-bound loci throughout the genome, either neuroblast-specific loci or within all Hb-bound loci. This is consistent with Hb acting independently, but we canât rule out the possibility of Hb acting with co-factors. Our conclusions are in agreement with studies showing that DNA accessibility, not cooperative or competitive interactions, have the strongest impact on transcription factor binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaplan et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, this model is supported by in vitro protein-DNA studies that eliminate chromatin state contribution to these interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guertin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Using traditional methods of studying protein-DNA interactions, Hb targets in early embryogenesis have been well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hoch et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Struhl et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rivera-Pomar et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berman et al., 2002</xref>), yet little is known about Hb direct targets in the CNS, and nothing is known about neuroblast lineage-specific targets that specify lineage-specific neuronal identity. Here weâve reported the first description of Hb occupancy in vivo within the genome of individual neuroblast lineages. Our study identified many loci that were similarly occupied in the two lineages, which are likely to consist of regulatory modules common to both lineages such as pan-neuronal specification or the progression of the temporal series. The latter example consists of Hb activating <italic>Kr</italic> and repressing <italic>pdm2</italic> in most neuroblast lineages. Indeed we find that Hb binds to both loci in NB5-6 and NB7-4 lineages, confirming previous observations that Hb directly represses <italic>pdm2</italic> and activates <italic>Kr</italic> in multiple neuroblast lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kambadur et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tran et al., 2010</xref>). Hb is also likely to directly repress <italic>zfh2</italic> in most neuroblast lineages (CQD, unpublished results) and our data show that the <italic>zfh2</italic> locus is indeed equivalently occupied in both neuroblast lineages. Apart from the commonly regulated loci, we identified over 100 loci that are differentially bound by Hb in NB5-6 or NB7-4. These are excellent candidates for lineage-specific neuronal specification.</p><p>Our study, coming almost two decades after the first descriptions of spatial and temporal patterning in Drosophila neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Isshiki et al., 2001</xref>), has for the first time explored the mechanism by which spatial and temporal factors could be integrated to generate neuroblast-specific neuronal progeny. Only recently has it been possible to probe TTF DNA-binding and chromatin landscapes within two distinct neuroblast lineages â due to the parallel advances in genetic tools, functional genomics, and our ability to manipulate the genome. Given the conservation of mechanisms in generating neural diversity in vertebrates and invertebrates, and exquisite ways in which the genome can now be manipulated in different organisms, it is now possible to determine if similar mechanisms generate diversity during vertebrate neurogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-LT3-Dam</td><td>A Brand</td><td>NA</td><td>UAS drives mCherry from 1<sup>st</sup> cistron and Dam from 2<sup>nd</sup> cistron</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>engrailed-Gal4</td><td>A Brand</td><td>NA</td><td>Expressed in row 6 and 7 neuroblasts</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>R19B03<sup>AD</sup>;R18F07<sup>DBD</sup></td><td>G Rubin</td><td>NA</td><td>Expression in NB7-4 lineage from stage 9</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Lbe(K)-Gal4</td><td>S Thor</td><td>NA</td><td>Expression in NB5-6 lineage from stage 9; salivary gland at stage 17</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-LT3-Dam:Hb</td><td>This paper</td><td>NA</td><td>UAS drives mCherry from 1<sup>st</sup> cistron and Dam:Hb from 2<sup>nd</sup> cistron</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Sca-Gal4</td><td>Y Hiromi</td><td>NA</td><td>Expressed in all NBs</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>hsFLP;;UAS-MCFO</td><td>A Nern</td><td>NA</td><td>MCFO (multi-colored-flip-out) line</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>MARCM stock</td><td>T Lee</td><td>NA</td><td>For clonal analysis of NB7-4 lineage</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>UAS-HA:UPRT</td><td>Doe lab</td><td>NA</td><td>Control transgene</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain <break/>background <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>Da-Gal4</td><td>BDSC</td><td>55850 homozygous on III</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>chicken anti-GFP <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam (Eugene, OR)</td><td>ab13970</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse anti-en <break/>(monoclonal)</td><td>DSHB (Iowa City, IA) 4D9</td><td/><td>(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-Dan <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Doe lab</td><td>NA</td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-Hb <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Doe lab</td><td>NA</td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit anti-Eve <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Doe lab</td><td>SC1320A</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rat anti-Gsb <break/>(monoclonal)</td><td>Holmgren Lab</td><td>1:1 10E10/16F2</td><td>(1:10)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse <break/>anti-mCherry <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Clonetech</td><td>632543</td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit <break/>anti-V5::549 <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Rockland</td><td>600-442-378</td><td>(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse <break/>anti-HA::488 <break/>(monoclonal)</td><td>Cell signaling</td><td>2350S</td><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rat anti-Ollas::650 <break/>(monoclonal)</td><td>Novus</td><td>NBP1-06713</td><td>(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Secondary <break/>antibodies <break/>(polyclonal)</td><td>Thermofisher <break/>(Eugene, OR)</td><td/><td>(1:400)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly lines</title><p>Fly stocks were obtained from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center (Bloomington, IN USA) and, unless otherwise stated, were grown on cornmeal media at 25Â°C. <italic>UAS-LT3-Dam</italic> flies were kindly provided by Andrea Brand, <italic>R19B03<sup>[AD]</sup>; R18F07<sup>[DBD]</sup></italic> was a gift from Gerald Rubin, and <italic>Lbe-(K)-Gal4</italic> (called <italic>NB5-6-Gal4</italic> here) was a gift from Stephan Thor.

Briefly, the 4 tubes of each replicate were thawed on ice, processed separately and in parallel until the PCR purification step after the DpnI digestion step; subsequently, an additional PCR purification step using standard Qiagen PCR purification columns was used to concentrate the DpnI digested product to 32 ÂµL. Embryos were homogenized with an electric pestle and gDNA was extracted using the DNA Micro Kit (Qiagen, cat. no. 56304). Extreme care was taken to ensure that the gDNA remained intact â this was done by using wide bore tips to avoid fragmenting the DNA, pipetting deliberately, and avoiding any rough shaking/tipping. gDNA was digested with DpnI for 14â16 hr in a thermocycler then PCR purified. MyTaq HS DNA polymerase kit (Bioline, cat. no. BIO-21112; not the Advantage 2 cDNA polymerase from Clonetech) was used for amplification and 21 PCR cycles we used.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neuroblast-specific chromatin landscapes allow integration of spatial and temporal cues to generate neuronal diversity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Gail Mandel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Claude Desplan (Reviewer #2); Michael B Eisen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work describes an elegant application of a recently developed technique (targeted DAMID) to determine chromatin changes mediated by transcription factors that regulate spatiotemporal gene expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts. Authors provide results suggesting that the chromatin changes mediated by the spatial factors establish a permissive environment for activity of the temporal factors important in lineage control (intersection of spatial and temporal identify mechanisms).</p><p>There were few major concerns identified by all three reviewers, who were very enthusiastic about the novelty and rigor in the technique application and the importance of the question. These concerns are easily addressed and don't require further experimentation (please see attached reviews). However, one concern that merits more attention is that the data in Figure 7, the crux of the conclusion for integration of the chromatin signaling, does not appear to be to the same level of rigor as the technical aspects. Authors need to address this point, by providing either more convincing data in Figure 7 or, minimally, providing more details in the results and interpretation of Figure 7 data, as well as toning down wording in the title, Abstract and Discussion that they have proven intersection, as opposed to generating data that is consistent with this conclusion.</p><p>Essential revisions: Figure 7 data and toning down language if no more data is provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work is meant to address the intersection of temporal and spatial information leading to neuronal diversity (distinct neuroblast lineages), an intersection that has received very little traction. The work takes advantage of the huge breadth of knowledge of the spatial transcription factors (STFs) and hunchback transcription factor (TFF) cascades for neuronal lineage control in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The study also applies a new method of binding site identity (DAMID) that has not been applied previously for small numbers of cells or for addressing this specific question. Applying this method, apart from the question of integration signaling, the authors have identified 100 new targets that could potentially contribute importantly to neuronal specification.</p><p>Shown in an elegant manner is that STF Gsb and DamHb bind within open chromatin, defined by DAM analysis, in a neuroblast-specific manner. Because Gsb binds prior to Hb, authors propose a sequential model wherein open chromatin induced by Gsb binding is required for subsequent binding of Hb. However, their data in support of this model (Figure 7) falls short of showing causality and doesn't seem to be done at the same level of rigor as in the prior experiments, leading to somewhat of an anticlimax. For example, there is no direct evidence presented that the STF open chromatin is sufficient for binding of Hb, only that the binding of the two factors is enriched in close proximity in open chromatin. Additionally, the data in Figure 7B is not completely convincing â the binding enrichment curves are quite broad and appear very noisy, suggesting that the n value of # peaks is very small, although the Monte Carlo analysis shows significance (throughout the figures authors should provide an n value in their plots). While I think the work represents a clever adaptation of the technique, rigor for establishing the technique, first demonstration of in vivo binding of Hb, identification of potentially new factors important in specification, and setting the stage for attacking an important unanswered question, I think the question is still, well, an open question. In their Discussion, authors indicate that experiments to determine causality of Gsb binding/open chromatin for Hb binding lie outside the scope of the paper. Agreed, such studies would involve further work, but as it stands the current study doesn't support the bold title that the chromatin landscape allows integration. The Abstract wording is more accurate, but saying in the Impact statement and Introduction that the integration is due to and support (as opposed to consistent with) the sequential model, and asking whether similar mechanisms occur in vertebrates, seems overstated based on the current data.</p><p>Unless I missed it, authors do not state explicitly precisely how close the Hb and STF sites of enrichment are? Related to this, in terms of strengthening the correlative data, authors might consider plotting the distributions of distances of the closest Gsb peaks (or motifs) from the peak center of the Dam:Hb peaks and doing the same for other &quot;control&quot; STF or TFFs/motifs Chip data. Authors indicate that they didn't see any other motifs close to Hb sites but it wasn't clear whether the analysis was genome wide? It might also be optimal for authors to perform their own ChIP experiments to make this critical point. Regarding the Discussion. How does Gsb open chromatin â must be recruiting enzymes? Anything known about a Gsb complex? Are the Gsb binding sites associated with enhancer chromatin marks?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This a very carefully crafted manuscript that analyzes how spatial and temporal information are integrated in neural stem cells to generate the large diversity of neurons in the ventral nerve cord of <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p>The authors wanted to assay the mechanisms of molecular integration between the two sets of transcription factors (TFs).</p><p>They chose to look at the binding sites for the best known temporal TF, Hunchback (Hb) in two spatially distinct neuroblasts. Because of the very small number of neurons available in each embryo, the authors chose to use a very clever method initially developed in Andrea Brand's lab, TaDa. This method relies on the specific expression of a Dam methylase fused to the TF to test in specific cell types, but requires difficult adjustments as Dam can be very toxic even at low concentrations.</p><p>What makes this paper special is the very careful evaluation of the Gal4 lines used to mark two specific neuronal lineages, but more importantly the evaluation of how Dam-Hb functions. This allowed the authors to evaluate the differential binding of Hb to its targets in the two lineages. These differ significantly, suggesting that spatial information instructs the ability of Hb to bind to its (important) targets, likely through opening of chromatin, which they tested.</p><p>For this purpose, they also used Dam without its targeting moiety: even with the minuscule number of cells, they could see that there is a correlation between differential open chromatin and Hb binding. It is quite amazing that they got this to work but the controls appear to be fine. If this works that well, others should use this approach before single cell ATACseq becomes available!</p><p>The spatial transcription factor Gsb expressed early in the lineage appears to be responsible for this opening.</p><p>In conclusion, the use of the very powerful and highly focused TaDa technique allowed the authors to propose a model where chromatin is differentially opened by spatial TFs which allow the same temporal TFs to define distinct lineages. I am impressed by the technical sophistication of the paper and the care with which this has been done, which led to this important conclusion.</p><p>Of course, I would have liked to see other spatial and other temporal TFs being tested but in keeping with the spirit of <italic>eLife</italic>, I think that the paper makes an important enough contribution to be published without much change.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The meat of this paper is the use of cell-type specific DamID to compare Hunchback (Hb) binding in two populations of neuroblasts distinguished by the expression of different spatial transcription that both respond to a pulse of Hb expression to make distinct neurons. The authors establish through a set of control experiments and comparisons to other data the efficacy of using specific expression of Dam:Hb to identify Hb target sites, and the viability of the neuroblast specifically expression Dam:Hb using cell-type specific drivers. The results are pretty straightforward: Hb binds to different targets in these two neuroblast subpopulations. They then show that this differential binding corresponds to differential chromatin accessibility, leading to their primary conclusion, that the differential binding of Hb (and presumably other temporal transcription factors) is due to the establishment of distinct chromatin states. They present data suggesting that the spatial transcription factors Gsb might be responsible for establishing these differential states in one subpopulation, lending support for a general model for neuroblast specification in which spatial transcription factors create a unique chromatin state that shapes how temporal transcription factors create identity.</p><p>I found the data generally compelling and don't have any major issues. Of course this is just binding, measured indirectly with a technique that whose pitfalls are not well established, and the evidence for STF involvement in establishing chromatin states is based on one factor. But as a first pass it's good data of great interest that warrants publication.</p><p>One thing confused me. The Abstract says:</p><p>&quot;Profiling chromatin accessibility showed that each neuroblast had a distinct chromatin landscape: Hunchback-bound loci in NB5-6 were in open chromatin, but the same loci in NB7-4 were in closed chromatin.&quot;</p><p>I assume this is just poorly worded since it seems to contradict what's said in the paper (The data show that Hb binding in NB7-4 is in open chromatin in NB7-4)? I'm putting this in the major comments section since having an Abstract that says the opposite of the paper isn't good.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44036.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[â¦] However, one concern that merits more attention is that the data in Figure 7, the crux of the conclusion for integration of the chromatin signaling, does not appear to be to the same level of rigor as the technical aspects.

See also new data in response to the third comment below. There are several likely reasons for the relatively low (but significant!) correlation between Gsb occupancy and the open chromatin states of the two NBs. First, different cell populations are used (NB lineages vs. total embryonic cells), different stages are assayed (0-12 vs. 9-12), different methods are used (ChIP vs. Dam). Despite these differences we were actually very pleasantly surprised to see significant enrichment of Gsb bound loci at open chromatin in a NB-specific manner â NB 5-6 shows enrichment, whereas NB7-4 does not. We have added the above text to the Discussion. We have also added a graphical representation of the Monte Carlo analysis used in 7B to the revised Figure 7 (new 7C), which demonstrates the significance of the enriched Gsb binding at unique NB5-6 Hb peaks.</p><p>We agree that it would be ideal to compare Dam (open chromatin) to Gsb-Dam (Gsb binding), but we do not yet have a Gsb-Dam fly stock. We would be very interested in adding these data in the future as an <italic>eLife</italic> Research Advance (Patterson et al., 2014) linking back to our current paper.</p><p>Dr Mandel is also correct in noting that the number of peaks is small in 7B. While the number of peaks used in 7A (sites of open chromatin) are 20,838 and 18,201 for the NB5-6 and 29,817 and 31,080 for NB7-4, the number of peaks used in 7B (NB-specific Hb-bound loci) is 504 and 718.

We found that of the 503 Hb enriched loci in NB5-6, 101 had a Gsb peak within 2Kb of the centre, whereas, this number was only 49 for NB7-4. A Fisherâs exact test on these data found this spatial relationship to be highly significant for NB5-6 (p=8.7812e-19), but not for NB7-4 (p=0.077982).

Although <italic>Drosophila</italic> Gsb shows no protein or genetic interactions with chromatin regulators (Flybase and PubMed), its closest mammalian relatives, Pax3 and Pax7, are well-known to recruit trithorax complex proteins to open chromatin. We now cite these studies in the Discussion: âAlthough nothing is currently known about the role of Gsb in chromatin regulation, the closely related mammalian Pax3 and Pax7 transcription factors can recruit histone methyltransferase to promote open chromatin and increase target gene expression (Diao et al., 2012; Kawabe et al., 2012; McKinnell et al., 2008). [â¦] It would be informative to test whether Gsb can recruit trithorax complex methyltransferases to open genomic loci in row 5 neuroblasts, and whether this is required for row 5 neuroblast spatial identity and differential binding of Hb.â These experiments are now among our highest priorities for the coming year!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[â¦] One thing confused me.
