Sci-Hub has grown rapidly since its creation in 2011, but the extent of its coverage has been unclear. Here we report that, as of March 2017, Sci-Hub’s database contains 68.9% of the 81.6 million scholarly articles registered with Crossref and 85.1% of articles published in toll access journals. We find that coverage varies by discipline and publisher, and that Sci-Hub preferentially covers popular, paywalled content. For toll access articles, we find that Sci-Hub provides greater coverage than the University of Pennsylvania, a major research university in the United States. Green open access to toll access articles via licit services, on the other hand, remains quite limited. Our interactive browser at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://greenelab.github.io/scihub">https://greenelab.github.io/scihub</ext-link> allows users to explore these findings in more detail. For the first time, nearly all scholarly literature is available gratis to anyone with an Internet connection, suggesting the toll access business model may become unsustainable.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Sci-Hub</kwd><kwd>open access</kwd><kwd>copyright</kwd><kwd>journals</kwd><kwd>LibGen</kwd><kwd>paywalls</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The availability of almost all articles from toll access journals in the Sci-Hub repository will disrupt scholarly publishing towards more open models.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Recent estimates suggest paywalls on the web limit access to three-quarters of scholarly literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Khabsa et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bosman and Kramer, 2018</xref>). The open access movement strives to remedy this situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Tennant et al., 2016</xref>). After decades of effort by the open access community (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Royster, 2016</xref>), nearly 50% of newly published articles are available without paywalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archambault et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Van Noorden, 2013a</xref>).</p><p>Despite these gains, access to scholarly literature remains a pressing global issue. Foremost, widespread subscription access remains restricted to institutions, such as universities or medical centers. Smaller institutions or those in the developing world often have poor access to scholarly literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Meadows, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kirsop and Chan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bendezú-Quispe et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, only a tiny percentage of the world’s population has been able to access much of the scholarly literature, despite the fact that the underlying research was often publicly or philanthropically funded. Compounding the problem is that publications have historically been the primary, if not sole, output of scholarship. Although copyright does not apply to ideas, journals leverage the copyright covering an article’s prose, figures, and typesetting to effectively paywall its knowledge.</p><p>Since each article is unique, libraries cannot substitute one journal subscription for another without depriving their users of potentially crucial access. As a result, the price of journal subscriptions has grown at a faster rate than inflation for several decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Association of Research Libraries, 2017</xref>), leading to an ever-present “serials crisis” that has pushed library budgets to their brink while diverting funds from other services (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roth, 1990</xref>). Meanwhile, publishing has trended towards oligopoly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Larivière et al., 2015</xref>), with nondisclosure clauses obfuscating price information among subscribers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergstrom et al., 2014</xref>) while publishers profit immensely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Morrison, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Buranyi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Van Noorden, 2013b</xref>). Price increases have persisted over the last decade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bosch and Henderson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lawson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lawson, 2017a</xref>). For example, EBSCO estimates that per-journal subscription costs increased by 25% from 2013–2017, with annual subscription to a journal for research libraries now averaging $1,396 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">EBSCO, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we use the term “toll access” (also known as “closed access”) to refer to paywalled literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Suber, 2017</xref>). On the other hand, we refer to literature that is free to read as “open access”. Furthermore, we discuss two variants of open access: “libre” and “gratis” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Suber, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Suber, 2008</xref>). Libre open access refers to literature that is <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://opendefinition.org/">openly licensed</ext-link> to allow reuse. Gratis open access refers to literature that is accessible free of charge, although permission barriers may remain (usually due to copyright) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Himmelstein, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The website Sci-Hub, now in its sixth year of existence, provides gratis access to scholarly literature, despite the continued presence of paywalls. Sci-Hub brands itself as “the first pirate website in the world to provide mass and public access to tens of millions of research papers.” The website, started in 2011, is run by Alexandra Elbakyan, a graduate student and native of Kazakhstan who now resides in Russia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bohannon, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schiermeier, 2015</xref>). Elbakyan describes herself as motivated to provide universal access to knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Elbakyan, 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Elbakyan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Milova, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Sci-Hub does not restrict itself to only openly licensed content. Instead, it retrieves and distributes scholarly literature without regard to copyright. Readers should note that, in many jurisdictions, use of Sci-Hub may constitute copyright infringement. Users of Sci-Hub do so at their own risk. This study is not an endorsement of using Sci-Hub, and its authors and publishers accept no responsibility on behalf of readers. There is a possibility that Sci-Hub users — especially those not using privacy-enhancing services such as Tor — could have their usage history unmasked and face legal or reputational consequences.</p><p>Sci-Hub is currently served at domains including <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sci-hub.hk">https://sci-hub.hk</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sci-hub.la">https://sci-hub.la</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sci-hub.mn">https://sci-hub.mn</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sci-hub.name">https://sci-hub.name</ext-link>, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sci-hub.tv">https://sci-hub.tv</ext-link>, and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sci-hub.tw">https://sci-hub.tw</ext-link>, as well as at scihub22266oqcxt.onion — a Tor Hidden Service (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Dingledine et al., 2004</xref>). Elbakyan described the project’s technical scope in July 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Elbakyan, 2017</xref>): “Sci-Hub technically is by itself a repository, or a library if you like, and not a search engine for some other repository. But of course, the most important part in Sci-Hub is not a repository, but the script that can download papers closed behind paywalls.”</p><p>One method Sci-Hub uses to bypass paywalls is by obtaining leaked authentication credentials for educational institutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Elbakyan, 2017</xref>). These credentials enable Sci-Hub to use institutional networks as proxies and gain subscription journal access. While the open access movement has progressed slowly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Björk, 2017</xref>), Sci-Hub represents a seismic shift in access to scholarly literature. Since its inception, Sci-Hub has experienced sustained growth, with spikes in interest and awareness driven by legal proceedings, service outages, news coverage, and social media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Here we investigate the extent to which Sci-Hub provides access to scholarly literature. If Sci-Hub’s coverage is sufficiently broad, then a radical shift may be underway in how individuals access scholarly literature.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32822.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The history of Sci-Hub.</title><p>Weekly interest from Google Trends is plotted over time for the search terms “Sci-Hub” and “LibGen”.

Sci-Hub access logs were combined from two releases: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elbakyan and Bohannon, 2016</xref>) covering 27,819,963 downloads from September 2015 to February 2016 and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tzovaras, 2018</xref>) covering 150,875,862 downloads from 2017. The plot shows the average number of downloads per day for months with data. There were 54 days within the collection periods without any logged access events, due presumably to service outages or server misconfiguration. Hence, we ignored days without logs when computing monthly averages. Point color indicates the proportion of days with logs for a given month. For example, November 2015 and October 2017, which were missing logs for 17 and 23 days respectively, are thus lighter. The December 2017 dropoff in downloads likely reflects the effect of domain suspensions that occurred in late November (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Silver, 2017</xref>).

Whenever a user requested an article, Sci-Hub would check LibGen for a copy. If the article was not in LibGen, Sci-Hub would fetch the article for the user and then upload it to LibGen. Cabanac compared the number of articles in the LibGen scimag database at the start of 2014 to the total number of Crossref DOIs, estimating that LibGen contained 36% of all published scholarly articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cabanac, 2016</xref>). Coverage was higher for several prominent publishers: 77% for Elsevier, 73% for Wiley, and 53% for Springer (prior to its merger with Macmillan/Nature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Van Noorden, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Later, Bohannon analyzed six months of Sci-Hub’s server access logs, starting in September 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bohannon, 2016b</xref>). He found a global pattern of usage. Based on these logs, Gardner, McLaughlin, and Asher estimated the ratio of publisher downloads to Sci-Hub downloads within the U.S. for several publishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Gardner et al., 2017</xref>). They estimated this ratio at 20:1 for the Royal Society of Chemistry and 48:1 for Elsevier. They also noted that 25% of Sci-Hub downloads in the U.S. were for articles related to clinical medicine. Greshake also analyzed the logs to identify per capita Sci-Hub usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Greshake, 2016</xref>). Portugal, Iran, Tunisia, and Greece had the highest usage, suggesting Sci-Hub is preferentially used in countries with poor institutional access to scholarly literature. In a subsequent study, he found especially high Sci-Hub usage in chemistry, with 12 of the top 20 requested journals specializing in chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greshake, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Greshake, 2017b</xref>).</p><p>Since 2015, Sci-Hub has operated its own repository, distinct from LibGen. On March 19, 2017, Sci-Hub released the list of DOIs for articles in its database. Greshake retrieved metadata for 77% of Sci-Hub DOIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Greshake, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Greshake, 2017b</xref>). He found that 95% of articles in Sci-Hub were published after 1950. Sci-Hub requests were even more skewed towards recent articles, with only 5% targeting articles published before 1983. Greshake’s study did not incorporate a catalog of all scholarly literature. This study analyzes Sci-Hub’s catalog in the context of all scholarly literature and thus assesses coverage. In other words, what percentage of articles in a given domain does Sci-Hub have in its repository?</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To define the extent of the scholarly literature, we relied on DOIs from the Crossref database, as downloaded on March 21, 2017.

Sci-Hub currently redirects requests for these delisted journals to the publisher’s site, unless it already possesses the article, in which case it serves the PDF.

Since we were unaware of any studies that comprehensively profiled library access to scholarly articles, we collaborated with Penn Libraries to assess the extent of access available at the University of Pennsylvania (Penn). Penn is a private research university located in Philadelphia and founded by the open science pioneer Benjamin Franklin in 1749. It is one of the world’s wealthiest universities, with an <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.nacubo.org/Documents/EndowmentFiles/2016-Endowment-Market-Values.pdf">endowment</ext-link> of over $10 billion.

In 2017, Penn Libraries <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/library-access/issues/23">estimates</ext-link> that it spent $13.13 million on electronic resources, which includes subscriptions to journals and ebooks. During this year, its users accessed 7.3 million articles and 860 thousand ebook chapters, averaging a per-download cost of $1.61.</p><p>Penn Libraries uses the Alma library resource management system from Ex Libris. Alma includes an OpenURL resolver, which the Penn Libraries use to provide a service called <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://upenn.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/citationlinker?vid=01UPENN_INST:Services&amp;lang=en">PennText</ext-link> for looking up scholarly articles. PennText indicates whether an article’s fulltext is available online, taking into account Penn’s digital subscriptions. Using API calls to PennText’s OpenURL resolver, we retrieved Penn’s access status for the 290,120 articles analyzed by the State of OA study (see the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/library-access">greenelab/library-access</ext-link> repository). We randomly selected 500 of these articles to evaluate manually and assessed whether their fulltexts were available from within Penn’s network as well as from outside of any institutional network. We defined access as fulltext availability at the location redirected to by an article’s DOI, without providing any payment, credentials, or login information. This definition is analogous to the union of oaDOI’s gold, hybrid, and bronze categories.</p><p>Using these manual access calls, we found PennText correctly classified access 88.2% [85.2%–90.8%] of the time (bracketed ranges refer to 95% confidence intervals calculated using Jeffreys interval for binomial proportions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Rubin and Schenker, 1987</xref>)). PennText claimed to have access to 422 of the 500 articles [81.0%–87.4%]. When PennText asserted access, it was correct 94.8% [92.4%–96.6%] of the time. However, when PennText claimed no access, it was only correct for 41 of 78 articles [41.6%–63.4%]. This error rate arose because PennText was not only unaware of Penn’s access to 23 open articles, but also unaware of Penn’s subscription access to 14 articles. Despite these issues, PennText’s estimate of Penn’s access at 84.4% did not differ significantly from the manually evaluated estimate of 87.4% [84.3%–90.1%]. Nonetheless, we proceed by showing comparisons for both the 500 articles with manual access calls as well as the 290,120 articles with PennText calls.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Coverage combining access methods</title><p>In practice, readers of the scholarly literature likely use a variety of methods for access. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> compares several of these methods, as well as their combinations.

Similarly, the bottom-right diagram assesses coverage of articles that were classified as closed or green by oaDOI, and thus excludes gold, hybrid, and bronze articles (those available gratis from their publisher).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32822-fig8-v3"/></fig><p>Sci-Hub and Penn had similar coverage on all articles: 85.2% [81.9%–88.1%] versus 87.4% [84.3%–90.1%] on the manual article set and 84.8% [84.7%–84.9%] versus 84.4% [84.3%–84.5%] on the larger but automated set. However, when considering only toll access articles, Sci-Hub’s coverage exceeds Penn’s: 94.2% [91.2%–96.3%] versus 80.7% [76.1%–84.7%] on the manual set and 90.7% [90.5%–90.8%] versus 83.5% [83.4%–83.7%] on the automated set. This reflects Sci-Hub’s focus on paywalled articles. In addition, Sci-Hub’s coverage is a lower bound for its access rate, since it can retrieve articles on demand, so in practice Sci-Hub’s access to toll access articles could exceed Penn’s by a higher margin. Remarkably, Sci-Hub provided greater access to paywalled articles than a leading research university spending millions of US dollars per year on subscriptions. However, since Sci-Hub is able to retrieve articles through many university networks, it is perhaps unsurprising that its coverage would exceed that of any single university.</p><p>Combining access methods can also be synergistic. Specifically when including open access articles, combining Sci-Hub’s repository with oaDOI’s or Penn’s access increased coverage from around 85% to 95%. The benefits of oaDOI were reduced when only considering toll access articles, where oaDOI only improved Sci-Hub’s or Penn’s coverage by approximately 1%. On toll access articles, Penn’s access appeared to complement Sci-Hub’s. Together, Sci-Hub’s repository and Penn’s access covered approximately 96% of toll access articles [95.0%–98.6% (manual set), 95.9%–96.1% (automated set)]. Our findings suggest that users with institutional subscriptions comparable to those at Penn as well as knowledge of oaDOI and Sci-Hub are able to access over 97% of all articles [96.7%–99.1% (manual set), 97.3%–97.5% (automated set)], online and without payment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Coverage of recently cited articles</title><p>The coverage metrics presented thus far give equal weight to each article. However, we know that article readership and by extension Sci-Hub requests are not uniformly distributed across all articles. Instead, most articles receive little readership, with a few articles receiving great readership. Therefore, we used recent citations to estimate Sci-Hub’s coverage of articles weighted by user needs.</p><p>We identified 7,312,607 outgoing citations from articles published since 2015. 6,657,410 of the recent citations (91.0%) referenced an article that was in Sci-Hub. However, if only considering the 6,264,257 citations to articles in toll access journals, Sci-Hub covered 96.2% of recent citations. On the other hand, for the 866,115 citations to articles in open access journals, Sci-Hub covered only 62.3%.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Sci-Hub access logs</title><p>Sci-Hub released article access records from its server logs, covering 165 days from September 2015 through February 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Elbakyan and Bohannon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bohannon, 2016b</xref>). After processing, the logs contained 26,984,851 access events. Hence, Sci-Hub provided access to an average of 164,000 valid requests per day in late 2015–early 2016.</p><p>In the first version of this study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Himmelstein et al., 2017a</xref>), we mistakenly treated the log events as requests rather than downloads. Fortunately, Sci-Hub reviewed the preprint in a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/issues/17">series of tweets</ext-link>, and pointed out the error, stating “in Sci-Hub access logs released previous year, all requests are resolved requests, i.e. user successfully downloaded PDF with that DOI … unresolved requests are not saved”. Interestingly however, 198,600 access events from the logs pointed to DOIs that were not in Sci-Hub’s subsequent DOI catalog. 99.1% of these events — corresponding to DOIs logged as accessed despite later being absent from Sci-Hub — were for book chapters. Upon further investigation, we <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/issues/20#issuecomment-327854780">identified</ext-link> several DOIs in this category that Sci-Hub redirected to LibGen book records as of September 2017. The LibGen landing pages were for the entire books, which contained the queried chapters, and were part of LibGen’s book (not scimag) collection. The explanation that Sci-Hub outsources some book access to LibGen (and logged such requests as accessed) is corroborated by Elbakyan’s statement that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Elbakyan, 2017</xref>): “Currently, the Sci-Hub does not store books, for books users are redirected to LibGen, but not for research papers. In future, I also want to expand the Sci-Hub repository and add books too.” Nonetheless, Sci-Hub’s catalog contains 72.4% of the 510,760 distinct book chapters that were accessed according to the logs. Therefore, on a chapter-by-chapter basis, Sci-Hub does already possess many of the requested scholarly books available from LibGen.</p><p>We computed journal-level metrics based on average article downloads. The “visitors” metric assesses the average number of IP addresses that accessed each article published by a journal during the 20 months preceding September 2015 (the start date of the Sci-Hub logs). In aggregate, articles from toll access journals averaged 1.30 visitors, whereas articles from open access journals averaged 0.25 visitors. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> shows that articles from highly cited journals were visited much more frequently on average. Articles in the least cited toll access journals averaged almost zero visitors, compared to approximately 15 visitors for the most cited journals. In addition, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref> shows that articles in toll access journals received many times more visitors than those in open access journals, even after accounting for journal impact. One limitation of using this analysis to judge Sci-Hub’s usage patterns is that we do not know to what extent certain categories of articles were resolved (and thus logged) at different rates.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32822.009</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Relation to journal impact.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average coverage for journals divided into 2015 CiteScore deciles.

Coverage for the 54.5 million articles attributed to toll access journals — which many users would not otherwise be able to access — was 85.1%. Since Sci-Hub can retrieve, in real time, requested articles that are not in its database, our coverage figures are a lower bound. Furthermore, Sci-Hub preferentially covered popular, paywalled articles. We find that 91.0% of citations since 2015 were present in Sci-Hub’s repository, which increased to 96.2% when excluding citations to articles in open access journals. Journals with very low (including zero) coverage tended to be obscure, less cited venues, while average coverage of the most cited journals exceeded 90%.</p><p>We find strong evidence that Sci-Hub is primarily used to circumvent paywalls. In particular, users accessed articles from toll access journals much more frequently than open access journals. Additionally, within toll access journals, Sci-Hub provided higher coverage of articles in the closed and green categories (paywalled by the publisher) as opposed to the hybrid and bronze categories (available gratis from the publisher). Accordingly, many users likely only resort to Sci-Hub when access through a commercial database is cumbersome or costly. Finally, we observed evidence that Sci-Hub’s primary operational focus is circumventing paywalls rather than compiling all literature, as archiving was deactivated in 2015 for several journals that exemplify openness. Attesting to its success in this mission, Sci-Hub’s database already contains more toll access articles than are immediately accessible via the University of Pennsylvania, a leading research university.</p><p>Judging from donations, many users appear to value Sci-Hub’s service. In the past, Sci-Hub accepted donations through centralized and regulated payment processors such as PayPal, Yandex, WebMoney, and QiQi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">DeMarco et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Woltermann, 2015</xref>). Now however, Sci-Hub only advertises donation via Bitcoin, presumably to avoid banking blockades or government seizure of funds. Since the ledger of Bitcoin transactions is public, we can evaluate the donation activity to known Sci-Hub addresses (1K4t2vSBSS2xFjZ6PofYnbgZewjeqbG1TM, 14ghuGKDAPdEcUQN4zuzGwBUrhQgACwAyA, 1EVkHpdQ8VJQRpQ15hSRoohCztTvDMEepm). We find that, prior to 2018, these addresses have received 1,232 donations, totaling 94.494 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Using the US dollar value at the time of transaction confirmation, Sci-Hub has received an equivalent of $69,224 in bitcoins. 85.467 bitcoins have been withdrawn from the Sci-Hub addresses via 174 transactions. Since the price of bitcoins has risen, the combined US dollar value at time of withdrawal was $421,272. At the conclusion of 2017, the Sci-Hub accounts had an outstanding balance of 9.027 bitcoins, valued at roughly $120,000. In response to this study’s preprint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Himmelstein et al., 2017a</xref>), Sci-Hub <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/892751909530071040">tweeted</ext-link>: “the information on donations … is not very accurate, but I cannot correct it: that is confidential.” Therefore, presumably, Sci-Hub has received considerable donations via alternative payment systems or to unrevealed Bitcoin addresses, which our audit did not capture. Since we do not know the identity of the depositors, another possibility would be that Sci-Hub transfered bitcoins from other addresses it controlled to the identified donation addresses.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32822.016</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Number of bitcoin donations per month.</title><p>The number of bitcoin donations to Sci-Hub is shown for each month from June 2015 to December 2017.

Elsevier (whose 13.5 million works are 96.9% covered by Sci-Hub) and the American Chemical Society (whose 1.4 million works are 98.8% covered) both filed suit against Sci-Hub, despite the limited enforcement options of United States courts. The widespread gratis access that Sci-Hub provides to previously paywalled articles calls into question the sustainability of the subscription publishing model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">McKenzie, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lawson, 2017b</xref>). Avoiding biblioleaks and retaining exclusive possession of digital media may prove an insurmountable challenge for publishers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>). As distributed and censorship-resistant file storage protocols mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Benet, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">ConsenSys, 2016</xref>), successors to Sci-Hub may emerge that no longer rely on a centralized service. Indeed, Alexandra Elbakyan is only one individual in the larger “guerilla access” movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bodó, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bodó, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Laskow, 2016</xref>), which will persist regardless of Sci-Hub’s fate. As such, Sci-Hub’s corpus of gratis scholarly literature may be extremely difficult to suppress.</p><p>Surveys from 2016 suggest awareness and usage of Sci-Hub was not yet commonplace (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Travis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mejia et al., 2017</xref>). However, adoption appears to be growing. According to Elbakyan, the number of Sci-Hub downloads increased from 42 million in 2015 to 75 million in 2016, equating to a 79% gain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Van Noorden, 2016</xref>). Comparing the search interest peaks following <bold>D</bold> and <bold>L</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which both correspond to domain outages and hence existing users searching how to access Sci-Hub, we <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/issues/35#issuecomment-355171030">estimate</ext-link> annual growth of 88%. As per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, Sci-Hub averaged 185,243 downloads per day in January–February 2016, whereas in 2017 daily downloads averaged 458,589. Accordingly, the ratio of Sci-Hub to Penn Libraries downloads in 2017 was 20:1. In addition, adoption of Sci-Hub or similar sites could accelerate due to new technical burdens on authorized access (the flip side of anti-piracy measures) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Davis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Esposito, 2016</xref>), crackdowns on article sharing via academic social networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Singh Chawla, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Singh Chawla, 2017b</xref>), or large-scale subscription cancellations by libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Esposito, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Historically, libraries have <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/">often canceled</ext-link> individual journal subscriptions or switched from bundled to à-la-carte selections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roth, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Fernandez et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rogers, 2012</xref>). More recently, library consortia have threatened wholesale cancellation of specific publishers. In 2010, Research Libraries of the UK threatened to let Elsevier contracts expire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bergstrom et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Prosser, 2011</xref>), while the University of California raised the possibility of boycotting Nature Publishing Group. But these disputes were ultimately resolved before major cancellations transpired. But in 2017, researchers began losing access to entire publishers. Universities in the Netherlands canceled all Oxford University Press subscriptions in May 2017 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Else, 2017</xref>). University of Montreal reduced its subscriptions to Taylor &amp; Francis periodicals by 93%, axing 2,231 journals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Gagnon, 2017</xref>). Negotiations with Elsevier reached impasses in Germany, Peru, and Taiwan. As a result, hundreds of universities have cancelled all Elsevier subscriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schiermeier and Mega, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Schiermeier, 2018</xref>). These developments echo the predictions of Elsevier’s attorneys in 2015 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">DeMarco et al., 2015b</xref>): “Defendants’ actions also threaten imminent irreparable harm to Elsevier because it appears that the Library Genesis Project repository may be approaching (or will eventually approach) a level of ‘completeness’ where it can serve as a functionally equivalent, although patently illegal, replacement for ScienceDirect.”</p><p>In the worst case for toll access publishers, growing Sci-Hub usage will become both the cause and the effect of dwindling subscriptions. Librarians rely on usage metrics and user feedback to evaluate subscriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Roth, 1990</xref>). Sci-Hub could decrease the use of library subscriptions as many users find it more convenient than authorized access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Travis, 2016</xref>). Furthermore, librarians may receive fewer complaints after canceling subscriptions, as users become more aware of alternatives. Green open access also provides an access route outside of institutional subscription. The posting of preprints and postprints has been growing rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaiser, 2017</xref>), with new search tools to help locate them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Singh Chawla, 2017c</xref>). The trend of increasing green availability is poised to continue as funders <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://roarmap.eprints.org/">mandate</ext-link> postprints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Van Noorden, 2014</xref>) and preprints help researchers sidestep the slow pace of scholarly publishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Powell, 2016</xref>). In essence, scholarly publishers may have already lost the access battle. Publishers will be forced to adapt quickly to open access publishing models. In the words of Alexandra Elbakyan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Elbakyan, 2016b</xref>): “The effect of long-term operation of Sci-Hub will be that publishers change their publishing models to support Open Access, because closed access will make no sense anymore.”</p><p>Sci-Hub is poised to fundamentally disrupt scholarly publishing. The transition to gratis availability of scholarly articles is currently underway, and such a model may be inevitable in the long term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewis, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sutton, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Jha, 2012</xref>). However, we urge the community to take this opportunity to fully liberate scholarly articles, as well as explore more constructive business models for publishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Vogel, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Logan, 2017</xref>). Only libre access, enabled by open licensing, allows building applications on top of scholarly literature without fear of legal consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Himmelstein, 2016</xref>). For example, fulltext mining of scholarly literature is an area of great potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Westergaard et al., 2017</xref>), but is currently impractical due to the lack of a large-scale preprocessed corpus of articles. The barriers here are legal, not technological (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brook et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Van Noorden, 2012</xref>).

The Sci-Hub and LibGen scimag repositories also uniquely identify articles by their DOIs, making DOIs the natural primary identifier for our analyses. The DOI initiative began in 1997, and the first DOIs were registered in 2000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">International DOI Foundation, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wang, 2007</xref>). Note that DOIs can be registered retroactively.

By evaluating the presence of DOIs in other databases of scholarly literature (such as PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus), researchers estimate around 90% of newly published articles in the sciences have DOIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gorraiz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boudry and Chartron, 2017</xref>). The prevalence of DOIs varies by discipline and country of publication, with DOI assignment in newly published Arts &amp; Humanities articles around 60% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Gorraiz et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, DOI registration is almost entirely lacking for publishers from many Eastern European countries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boudry and Chartron, 2017</xref>). In addition, the prevalence of DOI assignment is likely lower for older articles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Boudry and Chartron, 2017</xref>). The incomplete and non-random assignment of DOIs to scholarly articles is a limitation of this study. However, DOIs are presumably the least imperfect and most widespread identifier for scholarly articles.</p><p>An often overlooked aspect of the DOI system is that DOIs are case-insensitive within the ASCII character range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">International DOI Foundation, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">British Standards Institute, 2012</xref>). In other words, 10.7717/peerj.705 refers to the same article as 10.7717/PeerJ.705. Accordingly, DOIs make a poor standard identifier unless they are consistently cased. While the DOI handbook states that “all DOI names are converted to upper case upon registration” (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">International DOI Foundation, 2017</xref>), we lowercased DOIs in accordance with Crossref’s behavior. Given the risk of unmatched DOIs, we lowercased DOIs for each input resource at the earliest opportunity in our processing pipeline. Consistent casing <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/issues/9">considerably influenced</ext-link> our findings as different resources used different casings of the same DOI.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Crossref-derived catalog of scholarly articles</title><p>To catalog all scholarly articles, we relied on the Crossref database. Crossref is a DOI Registration Agency (an entity capable of assigning DOIs) for scholarly publishing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lammey, 2014</xref>). There are presently 10 Registration Agencies. We <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/crossref/issues/3">estimate</ext-link> that Crossref has registered 67% of all DOIs in existence. While several Registration Agencies assign DOIs to scholarly publications, Crossref is the preeminent registrar. In March 2015, of the 1,464,818 valid DOI links on the English version of Wikipedia, 99.9% were registered with Crossref (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kikkawa et al., 2016</xref>). This percentage was slightly lower for other languages: 99.8% on Chinese Wikipedia and 98.0% on Japanese Wikipedia. Hence, the overwhelming majority of DOI-referenced scholarly articles are registered with Crossref. Since Crossref has the most comprehensive and featureful programmatic access, there was a strong incentive to focus solely on Crossref-registered DOIs. Given Crossref’s preeminence, the omission of other Registration Agencies is unlikely to substantially influence our findings.</p><p>We queried the works endpoint of the Crossref API to retrieve the metadata for all DOIs, storing the responses in a MongoDB database.

Second, a mapping of DOI to ISSN for associating articles with their journal of publication.</p><p>We <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/issues/7">selected</ext-link> a subset of Crossref work types to include in our Sci-Hub coverage analyses that corresponded to scholarly articles (i.e. publications). Since we could not locate definitions for the Crossref types, we used our best judgment and evaluated sample works of a given type in the case of uncertainty. We included the following types: book-chapter, book-part, book-section, journal-article, proceedings-article, reference-entry, report, and standard. Types such as book, journal, journal-issue, and report-series were excluded, as they are generally containers for individual articles rather than scholarly articles themselves. After filtering by type, 81,609,016 DOIs remained (77,201,782 of which had their year of publication available). For the purposes of this study, these DOIs represent the entirety of the scholarly literature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Scopus-derived catalog of journals</title><p>Prior to June 2017, the Crossref API had an issue that prevented exhaustively downloading journal metadata. Therefore, we instead relied on the Scopus database to catalog scholarly journals. Scopus uses “title” to refer to all of the following: peer-reviewed journals, trade journals, book series, and conference proceedings. For this study, we refer to all of these types as journals. From the October 2017 data release of Scopus titles, we extracted metadata for 72,502 titles including their names, ISSNs, subject areas, publishers, open access status, and active status. The publisher information was poorly standardized — e.g. both “ICE Publishing” and “ICE Publishing Ltd.” were present — so name variants were combined using OpenRefine. This version of Scopus determined open access status by whether a journal was registered in DOAJ or ROAD as of April 2017. Note that Scopus does not index every scholarly journal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mongeon and Paul-Hus, 2015</xref>), which is one reason why 30.5% of articles (24,853,345 DOIs) were not attributable to a journal.</p><p>We tidied the Scopus Journal Metrics, which evaluate journals based on the number of citations their articles receive. Specifically, we extracted a 2015 CiteScore for 22,256 titles, 17,336 of which were included in our journal catalog. Finally, we queried the Elsevier API to retrieve homepage URLs for 20,992 Scopus titles. See <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/dhimmel/scopus">dhimmel/scopus</ext-link> for the source code and data relating to Scopus.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>LibGen scimag’s catalog of articles</title><p>Library Genesis (LibGen) is a shadow library primarily comprising illicit copies of academic books and articles. Compared to Sci-Hub, the operations of LibGen are more opaque, as the contributors maintain a low profile and do not contact journalists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Elbakyan, 2017</xref>). LibGen hosts several collections, including distinct repositories for scientific books and textbooks, fiction books, and comics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cabanac, 2016</xref>). In 2012, LibGen added the “scimag” database for scholarly literature. Since the spring of 2013, Sci-Hub has uploaded articles that it obtains to LibGen scimag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Elbakyan, 2017</xref>). At the end of 2014, Sci-Hub forked LibGen scimag and began managing its own distinct article repository.</p><p>We downloaded the LibGen scimag metadata database on April 7, 2017 as a SQL dump. We <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/issues/2">imported</ext-link> the SQL dump into MySQL, and then exported the scimag table to a TSV file (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Himmelstein and McLaughlin, 2017</xref>). Each row of this table corresponds to an article in LibGen, identified by its DOI. The TimeAdded field apparently indicates when the publication was uploaded to LibGen. After removing records missing TimeAdded, 64,195,940 DOIs remained. 56,205,763 (87.6%) of the DOIs were in our Crossref-derived catalog of scholarly literature. The 12.4% of LibGen scimag DOIs missing from our Crossref catalog likely comprise incorrect DOIs, DOIs whose metadata availability postdates our Crossref export, DOIs from other Registration Agencies, and DOIs for excluded publication types.</p><p>Next, we explored the cumulative size of LibGen scimag over time according to the TimeAdded field (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). However, when we compared our plot to one generated from the LibGen scimag database SQL dump on January 1, 2014 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cabanac, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cabanac, 2017</xref>), we noticed a major discrepancy. The earlier analysis identified a total of 22,829,088 DOIs, whereas we found only 233,707 DOIs as of January 1, 2014. We hypothesize that the discrepancy arose because TimeAdded indicates the date modified rather than created. Specifically, when an article in the database is changed, the database record for that DOI is entirely replaced. Hence, the TimeAdded value is effectively overwritten upon every update to a record. Unfortunately, many research questions require the date first added. For example, lag-time analyses (the time from study publication to LibGen upload) may be unreliable. Therefore, we do not report on these findings in this manuscript. Instead, we provide <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref> as an example analysis that would be highly informative were reliable creation dates available. In addition, findings from some previous studies may require additional scrutiny. For example, Cabanac writes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cabanac, 2016</xref>): “The growth of LibGen suggests that it has benefited from a few isolated, but massive, additions of scientific articles to its cache. For instance, 71% of the article collection was uploaded in 13 days at a rate of 100,000+ articles a day. It is likely that such massive collections of articles result from biblioleaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dunn et al., 2014</xref>), but one can only speculate about this because of the undocumented source of each file cached at LibGen.” While we agree this is most likely the case, confirmation is needed that the bulk addition of articles does not simply correspond to bulk updates rather than bulk initial uploads.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32822.018</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Number of articles in LibGen scimag over time.</title><p>The figure shows the number of articles in LibGen scimag, according to its TimeAdded field, for two database dumps.

For example, this plot shows that 75% of articles published in 2011 were uploaded to LibGen within 60 months. This analysis only considers articles for which a month of publication can reliably be extracted, which excludes all articles allegedly published on January 1. This plot portrays lag-times as decreasing over time, with maximum coverage declining. For example, coverage for 2016 articles exceeded 50% within 6 months, but appears to have reached an asymptote around 60%. Alternatively, coverage for 2014 took 15 months to exceed 50%, but has since reached 75%. However, this signal could result from post-dated LibGen upload timestamps. Therefore, we caution against drawing any conclusions from the TimeAdded field in LibGen scimag until its accuracy can be established more reliably.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-32822-fig11-figsupp1-v3"/></fig></fig-group></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sci-Hub’s catalog of articles</title><p>On March 19, 2017, Sci-Hub <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://twitter.com/Sci_Hub/status/843546352219017218">tweeted</ext-link>: “If you like the list of all DOI collected on Sci-Hub, here it is: sci-hub.cc/downloads/doi.7z … 62,835,101 DOI in alphabetical order”.

Of these DOIs, 56,246,220 were part of the Crossref-derived catalog of scholarly articles, and 99.5% of the DOIs from Sci-Hub’s list were in the LibGen scimag repository (after filtering). Hence, the LibGen scimag and Sci-Hub repositories have largely stayed in sync since their split.

Using the oaDOI infrastructure, the State of OA study investigated the availability of articles from three collections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>).

Since the Unpaywall collection is based on articles that users visited, it’s a better reflection of the actual access needs of contemporary scholars. Unfortunately, since the number of visits per article is not preserved by this dataset, fulfillment rate estimates are biased against highly-visited articles and become scale-variant (affected by the popularity of Unpaywall).</p><p>The State of OA study ascertained the accessibility status of each DOI in each collection using oaDOI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Piwowar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Piwowar et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by Peter Rogers as the <italic>eLife</italic> Features Editor.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: David Prosser (peer reviewer).</p><p>Overall the reviewers were positive about the article, but they had a small number of concerns. We therefore invite you to prepare a revised submission that addresses these concerns.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and original piece of work that focusses on one of the most potentially disruptive forces in scholarly communication in the 21st Century. It outlines, for I think the first time, the shear size and scope of Sci-Hub and the amount of material that is now available through it. It is perhaps a little early to say with any certainly what the effect of Sci-Hub will be on subscriptions and I am pleased that the authors have highlighted the issue, but not moved too far into the space of prediction. They have allowed the analysis to speak for itself.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors make one claim that seems to me not supported by the evidence. They claim that their paper shows that toll-based publishing is becoming unsustainable. But they also point to a recent study that estimates that the ratio of the number of times papers are downloaded from the publisher to downloaded from Sci-Hub is 48:1 for Elsevier and 20:1 for Royal Society of Chemistry. This suggests that Sci-Hub so far has very little influence on the subscription demand for journal articles.</p><p>2) To calculate coverage, DOIs from Crossref and Sci-Hub for over 56M records are compared. Please give details of the algorithm used to compare the DOIs.</p><p>A straight comparison of 56M DOI's with another similarly large number of DOIs would require at least 2.5 X 10<sup>14</sup> comparisons. Was it done this way? If so, how long did it take? Was another clustering method used?</p><p>And if such comparisons were made, why are the percentages of coverage only given to third order? Is this just for convenience? (Giving the percentages of coverage to third order seems to imply a sample and not a complete comparison).</p><p>3) I believe if the authors compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with Table 2 in Piwowar et al., 2017, a strong negative correlation can be observed whereby the more likely a paper is to be found on the web, the less likely it is in Sci-Hub.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.32822.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We'd like to thank the reviewers and editors for their feedback, which we have aimed to address in our revised manuscript, corresponding to <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3100/">version 3</ext-link> of the study's preprint. Sci-Hub and scholarly publishing are both rapidly developing topics. As such, the revised manuscript contains additions resulting from new developments since version 2. These include the judgment in the ACS suit and the subsequent suspension of four Sci-Hub domains; the release of Sci-Hub download logs for 2017, which we visualize in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; and additional withdrawals from Sci-Hub's bitcoin addresses. As such, we extended the Google trends and Bitcoin analyses through the end of 2017. The revised version contains <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub-manuscript/milestone/2">many enhancements</ext-link>, of which the major ones are summarized here.</p><p>We updated our journal information to the October 2017 release of Scopus. In addition, we created patches to standardize publisher names in Scopus. As a result, many of the numbers reported in the manuscript have changed slightly. Thomas Munro assisted with the Scopus enhancements, as well as providing feedback in other areas, and has been added as an author.</p><p>We investigated the level of access provided by the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. This is a major addition to the study, since it allows us to compare Sci-Hub's database with the access of a major research university. Furthermore, the data for this analysis are openly available, making it the most comprehensive public analysis of a university's coverage of the scholarly literature (that we're aware of). Jacob Levernier, who helped perform these analyses, has been added as an author.</p><p>[…] <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The authors make one claim that seems to me not supported by the evidence.

While there is disagreement on the matter, we have added additional evidence and reasoning to the manuscript regarding these claims.</p><p>The 48:1 and 20:1 estimates from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://eprints.rclis.org/30981/">Gardner et al.</ext-link> assess Sci-Hub's usage at the start of 2016. These numbers are, of course, small. However, awareness of Sci-Hub was also low at that time. For example, a survey conducted in the first half of 2016, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0185673">found that</ext-link> only 19% of Latin American medical students were aware of Sci-Hub. An online survey by <italic>Science</italic> in May 2016 <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/results/SM-PQX56R8R/">found</ext-link> 59% of 10,874 respondents had used Sci-Hub, although it <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/05/survey-most-give-thumbs-pirated-papers">noted</ext-link> &quot;the survey sample is likely biased heavily toward fans of the site&quot;. Incidentally, the 62% of respondents thought &quot;Sci-Hub will disrupt the traditional science publishing industry&quot;.</p><p>An important factor here is the rate at which Sci-Hub adoption will grow. Our manuscript now includes two distinct metrics for assessing Sci-Hub's annual growth: 79% according to download statistics provided by Sci-Hub and 88% according to peak Google search interest following service outage. In addition, Sci-Hub released access logs for 2017, which we analyze in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> to show how Sci-Hub downloads per days have increased over time. We observe rapid growth in 2017, peaking in July 2017 with an average of 593,880 downloads per day. Combining the new Sci-Hub log data with information from the Penn Libraries, we calculate that Sci-Hub usage for electronic access to scholarly articles exceeds Penn's usage by a ratio of 20:1. We now discuss how Sci-Hub usage could lead to subscription cancellations by affecting the usage metrics and feedback librarians use to evaluate subscriptions. Finally, we discuss the growth of green open access, composed of preprints and postprints, which may also diminish the need for subscription access.</p><p>These developments are happening in the context of library budgets that are increasingly burdened by subscription costs, as mentioned in our Introduction. Since our manuscript submission, SPARC released a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sparcopen.org/our-work/big-deal-cancellation-tracking/">Big Deal Cancellation Tracker</ext-link>, which supports our observation that large-scale subscription cancellations are becoming more prevalent. We now reference this resource as well as the latest coverage of the Project DEAL negations with Elsevier in Germany. We also cover the domain name suspensions following the ACS suit judgment and Sci-Hub's re-emergence at several new domains. We modified a few sentences to make it clear that our assessment of Sci-Hub's disruptive influence is a prediction and not a certainty.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To calculate coverage, DOIs from Crossref and Sci-Hub for over 56M records are compared.

Python <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://docs.python.org/3.6/tutorial/datastructures.html#sets">includes</ext-link> a set data type to store unordered collections with no duplicate elements. Set operations <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://wiki.python.org/moin/TimeComplexity#set">enable</ext-link> efficient membership testing and intersection with other sets. As a result, we do not need to apply a list intersection algorithm, as described by the reviewers, that would scale quadratically due to nested iteration.</p><p>We evaluate each Crossref DOI for membership in the set of Sci-Hub DOIs in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/blob/ca4d523e149f30be7fd3d3ae6551a26d1c625313/01.catalog-dois.ipynb">01.catalog-dois.ipynb</ext-link>. The specific implementation we apply passes a set of Sci-Hub DOIs to the <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20.1/generated/pandas.Series.isin.html">pandas.Series.isin</ext-link> function. This function <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/blob/v0.20.1/pandas/core/algorithms.py#L399">uses</ext-link> a hash table, the formative data structure behind sets, to enable an efficient comparison of DOIs. The 01.catalog-dois.ipynb notebook does take considerable time (perhaps up to an hour) to execute. However, much of this time is spend on file input/output, which requires reading/writing to disk and (de)compressing streams, both of which can be runtime intensive.</p><p>We create a tabular file <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/greenelab/scihub/blob/ca4d523e149f30be7fd3d3ae6551a26d1c625313/data/doi.tsv.xz">doi.tsv.xz</ext-link> that contains a binary indicator (coded as 0/1) of whether each Crossref DOI is in Sci-Hub's repository. The general workflow we followed to compute coverage was to subset the DOI dataset for the relevant DOIs (e.g. all DOIs published in 2016) and take the sum/mean of the binary membership column. These operations made heavy use of <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.20.1/generated/pandas.DataFrame.join.html">pandas.DataFrame.join</ext-link> to incorporate additional information about DOIs and <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.groupby.html">pandas.DataFrame.groupby</ext-link> to compute coverage for all possible subsets at once.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I believe if the authors compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> with Table 2 in Piwowar et al., 2017, a strong negative correlation can be observed whereby the more likely a paper is to be found on the web, the less likely it is in Sci-Hub.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe this comment is comparing <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3119v1.pdf#page=16">Figure 4 of the OA study</ext-link> (titled &quot;Percentage of different access types […] per NSF discipline&quot;, also see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://peerj.com/preprints/3119v1.pdf#page=32">Figure A5</ext-link>) with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of our study (titled &quot;Coverage by journal attributes&quot;). For example, among plotted disciplines, Sci-Hub coverage is highest for chemistry, whereas oaDOI's coverage is lowest for chemistry. On the other hand, oaDOI exceeds 50% coverage of mathematics, whereas mathematics coverage is relatively low in Sci-Hub.</p><p>Regarding the hypothesis, &quot;the more likely a paper is to be found on the web, the less likely it is in Sci-Hub&quot;, we evaluate this directly in the &quot;Coverage by category of access status&quot; section. This hypothesis appears true for most types of gratis web access. Compared to closed articles, bronze, hybrid, and gold OA articles are less likely to be in Sci-Hub. However, green articles (available without charge, but not from the publisher) do not seem have lower coverage than closed articles in Sci-Hub. The conclusion from the reviewers' comparison could therefore be rephrased as &quot;the less gratis availability of a discipline's articles on the web (according to oaDOI), the greater the coverage on Sci-Hub.&quot; One possibility is that researchers from disciplines with poor oaDOI coverage more frequently encounter access problems, leading to greater awareness and usage of Sci-Hub.</p></body></sub-article></article>
