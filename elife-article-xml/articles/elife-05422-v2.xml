layer 4 (L4). Here, we tested the idea that M1, despite lacking a cytoarchitecturally visible L4, nevertheless possesses its equivalent in the form of excitatory neurons with input–output circuits like those of the L4 neurons in sensory areas. Consistent with this idea, we found that neurons located in a thin laminar zone at the L3/5A border in the forelimb area of mouse M1 have multiple L4-like synaptic connections: excitatory input from thalamus, largely unidirectional excitatory outputs to L2/3 pyramidal neurons, and relatively weak long-range corticocortical inputs and outputs. M1-L4 neurons were electrophysiologically diverse but morphologically uniform, with pyramidal-type dendritic arbors and locally ramifying axons, including branches extending into L2/3. Our findings therefore identify pyramidal neurons in M1 with the expected prototypical circuit properties of excitatory L4 neurons, and question the traditional assumption that motor cortex lacks this layer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05422.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05422.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05422.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>In 1909, a German scientist called Korbinian Brodmann published the first map of the outer layer of the human brain. After staining neurons with a dye and studying the structures of the cells and how they were organized, he realized that he could divide the cortex into 43 numbered regions.</p><p>Most Brodmann areas can be divided into a number of horizontal layers, with layer 1 being closest to the surface of the brain. Neurons in the different layers form distinct sets of connections, and the relative thickness of the layers has implications for the function carried out by that area. It is thought, for example, that the motor cortex does not have a layer 4, which suggests that the neural circuitry that controls movement differs from that in charge of vision, hearing, and other functions.</p><p>Yamawaki et al. now challenge this view by providing multiple lines of evidence for the existence of layer 4 in the motor cortex in mice. Neurons at the border between layer 3 and layer 5A in the motor cortex possess many of the same properties as the neurons in layer 4 in sensory cortex. In particular, they receive inputs from a brain region called the thalamus, and send outputs to neurons in layers 2 and 3.</p><p>Yamawaki et al. go on to characterize some of the properties of the neurons in the putative layer 4 of the motor cortex, finding that they do not look like the specialized ‘stellate’ cells that are found in some other areas of the cortex. Instead, they resemble the ‘pyramidal’ type of neuron that is found in all layers and areas of the cortex.</p><p>The discovery that the motor cortex is more similar in its circuit connections to other area of the cortex than previously thought has important implications for our understanding of this region of the brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05422.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05422.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>neocortex</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical</kwd><kwd>layer 4</kwd><kwd>pyramidal neuron</kwd><kwd>microcircuit</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS061963</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Gordon M G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shepherd</surname><given-names>Gordon M G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harris</surname><given-names>Kenneth D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>New evidence challenges the long-held view that motor cortex lacks a fourth layer, and reveals that its circuitry resembles that of other cortical regions more than previously thought.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>‘Agranular’ cortical regions such as the primary motor cortex (M1; area 4) are so named as they are commonly held to lack layer 4 (L4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brodmann, 1909</xref>).

If the <italic>Rorb</italic>-expressing zone in M1 is similarly organized, then neurons in that laminar location should receive strong TC input from the primary motor thalamic nuclei, particularly the ventrolateral nucleus (VL).

(For convenience, we henceforth refer to this forelimb region simply as ‘M1’.) To map input connections, we used an optogenetic strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>), injecting AAV-ChR2-Venus in VL and subsequently preparing coronal slices containing M1; recording conditions were set to isolate monosynaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Laminar profiles of the fluorescence intensity of labeled VL axons showed three peaks, in L1, the L3/5A border, and the L5B/6 border, similar to vibrissal M1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In each slice, we recorded from neurons at the L3/5A border (i.e., putative L4 neurons) and from additional neurons across other layers, thereby obtaining a laminar profile of the excitatory TC input from VL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This analysis revealed two distinct peaks of TC input, the uppermost of which coincided with the L3/5A border (normalized cortical depth, ∼1/3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D,E</xref>). These data thus indicate that M1 contains neurons in a laminar zone corresponding to L4 that receives strong monosynaptic excitatory TC input from a primary thalamic nucleus associated with this cortical area, thereby fulfilling one important circuit-level criterion for the identification of L4 in M1. For convenience, we henceforth refer to these as M1-L4 neurons.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05422.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Thalamocortical (TC) input to M1-L4 neurons from VL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Epifluorescence image of coronal slice containing M1, showing laminar pattern of labeled thalamocortical axons following injection of AAV carrying ChR2 and GFP in the ventrolateral (VL) region of the thalamus.

We examined this pathway by mapping local input to L2/3 neurons at high spatial sampling density (75 µm grid spacing) both in M1 and, for comparison, in the adjacent S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To facilitate this side-by-side comparison, in these experiments (only), we used sagittal instead of coronal slices. Synaptic input maps for M1-L2/3 neurons showed a local peak of excitatory input strength arising at the location of the hypothesized L4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Synaptic input maps for S1-L2/3 neurons were generally similar, but with stronger and spatially more focused excitation from L4, roughly the size and shape of a L4 barrel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

The input maps of these neurons typically showed an overall paucity of input, which arose mainly from nearby intralaminar sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Plotting the median input map of these 10 neurons confirmed that inputs to these L4 neurons arose mostly from L4, with relatively weak input from L2/3 and other layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Only 2 of 10 neurons received distinct loci of input from other layers: one neuron received relatively weak inputs from L5B/6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) and a second received strong input from L2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These two neurons were at similar laminar locations as the others, suggesting some heterogeneity among M1-L4 neurons' local circuits. Nevertheless, input maps of L4 neurons were generally distinct from those of neurons in mid-L2/3 (see above), and from those of neurons in low-L5A, which typically, and in sharp contrast to the L4 neurons studied here, receive strong L2/3 input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>).

Although exceptions to this rule exist, for example, in primate V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</xref>), this pattern appears to hold in mouse S1, where a ‘gap’ is evident in L4 following retrograde tracer injection into ipsilateral vibrissal M1 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sato and Svoboda, 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a similar gap has been noted in the upper layers of vibrissal M1 following retrograde tracer injections in S1, potentially corresponding to L4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao et al., 2011</xref>). Consistent with this pattern, we observed relatively sparse labeling in M1-L4 following injection of retrograde tracers into contralateral M1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). This laminar gap in labeling was not absolute; higher resolution imaging showed that some of the M1-L4 neurons were clearly labeled with the retrograde tracer but at lower intensity compared with cells in adjacent layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

Having established that M1 does contain a L4 in the form of these hodologically defined L4 neurons, we next sought to characterize their cellular properties. First, we assessed the electrophysiological properties of these M1-L4 neurons. We recorded 56 neurons located across the upper layers of M1, from upper L2 through L5A. Recordings were targeted to any neurons appearing more likely to be excitatory (pyramidal/stellate) rather than inhibitory based on familiar soma features (shape and size) as observed under bright-field visualization at high magnification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hooks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apicella et al., 2012</xref>); all recorded cells had soma features typical of pyramidal neurons, as we did not observe any with stellate-like somata. For each neuron, we analyzed various passive and active membrane properties. Plotting these parameters vs soma depth showed diverse depth-dependent trends and patterns (circles in plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To compare neurons in L4 to those in adjacent layers, we binned the data on the basis of the soma depths into three laminar groups, corresponding to L4, L2/3, and L5A (see ‘Materials and methods’). Statistical comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) indicated that the electrophysiological properties of L4 neurons were not simply intermediate between those of L2/3 and L5A neurons. For example, L4 neurons were similar to L2/3 neurons but different from L5A neurons in <italic>R</italic><sub>input</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>thresh</sub>, and SFA ratio. Conversely, L4 neurons resembled L5A neurons but differed from L2/3 neurons in <italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>, AP width, and <italic>V</italic><sub>thresh</sub> − <italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub>. In the case of AP amplitude, the average was greater for L4 neurons than for L2/3 and L5A neurons. L4 neurons showed considerable variability in firing patterns, which ranged from regular and non-adapting to moderately and even strongly adapting, and in other cases highly irregular. From this analysis, we conclude that the properties of L4 excitatory neurons tend to differ from those of either L2/3 or L5A but with considerable cell-to-cell variability, particularly in spiking patterns.

Neurons in slices were filled with biocytin during whole-cell recordings, processed, and imaged with two-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). The fluorescently labeled neurons were then digitally reconstructed as three-dimensional tracings (<italic>n</italic> = 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). The morphology of M1-L4 neurons consistently had pyramidal-like dendritic morphology, including a basal arbor with multiple dendrites emerging from the soma, and an apical dendrite extending towards the pia and branching into a small apical tuft in L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). These impressions were borne out by quantitative analysis of dendritic length density across layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). The axonal morphology of these neurons was variable but typically included branches in multiple layers, especially L2/3, L4, and L5A, a pattern evident from inspection of the reconstructions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>) and borne out by length density analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This laminar profile of axonal density peaked in L4 and steadily declined in the ascending direction across L2/3 towards zero in L1 and also in the descending direction across L5A towards a low baseline level in L5B and L6. The main trunk of each neuron's axon descended towards the white matter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>), a feature that can also be seen in reconstructed L4 axons from the sensory cortex (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lübke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>). In most cases, this descending axon could be traced into the white matter, typically coursing laterally, and sometimes but not always sending a branch medially towards the corpus callosum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Another difference from S1-L4 neurons was that the M1-L4 neurons were all pyramidal neurons; we did not detect star pyramids or spiny stellate cells, as are found in rodent S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>). In this respect, M1-L4 is more similar to the primary visual and auditory cortices of rodents, which also do not contain spiny stellate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Peters and Kara, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith and Populin, 2001</xref>). Indeed, as shown in ferret visual cortex, spiny stellate cells first develop as pyramidal neurons and subsequently lose their apical dendrites through developmental sculpting, indicating a spectrum of L4 morphological subtypes, with ‘pyramidal’ as the default or prototypical structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Callaway and Borrell, 2011</xref>). The finding that all M1-L4 neurons in our sample extended an axon towards and often into the subcortical white matter does not however represent a difference, as this is also commonly observed for S1-L4 neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lübke et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>), and L4 neurons (including stellates) with callosal projections have been described in cat V1 (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Vercelli et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>In several ways, M1-L4 neurons displayed properties that more closely resembled pyramidal than spiny stellate neurons in rodent S1-L4. For example, the axonal projections of S1-L4 stellate neurons tend to be more focused in a dense beam to L2/3; in contrast, those of S1-L4 pyramidal neurons tend to show more horizontal spread, lower density in L2/3, and more branching in L5A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bender et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lübke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Staiger et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>). Such a pattern is also observed for S1-L4 neurons located in the inter-barrel septa (in rats), which are pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brecht and Sakmann, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bureau et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>). In rat S1, thalamocortical axons from PO branch in L4 in septum-related columns (similar to our finding of PO innervation of M1-L4 neurons) but not in barrel-related columns in rat S1, where they instead branch in L5A (and L1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu and Lin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wimmer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>). The septal region of rat S1 has been proposed to be hodologically organized as a higher order rather than primary sensory cortical area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Killackey and Sherman, 2003</xref>). Consistent with this, PO projects to L4 in S2 in addition to septal-S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Theyel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pouchelon et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, our findings are generally suggestive that, at least in terms of its L4-related organization, the ‘primary’ motor cortex more closely resembles higher order than primary sensory cortex.</p><p>The apparent absence of L4 in M1 and other agranular cortical areas has long been of interest for its implication that the circuit organization of these areas differs fundamentally from that of sensory areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shipp, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldmeyer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shipp et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">García-Cabezas and Barbas, 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that L4 in M1 has been ‘lost’ only at the level of cytoarchitecture but not of cellular connectivity, as it is present in the form of a layer of pyramidal neurons with the expected input–output connections of prototypical L4 neurons. This accords with the general notion that cortical circuit organization tends to be conserved rather than reinvented across areas, with variations arising mostly through quantitative differences in a core set of existing circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Harris and Shepherd, 2015</xref>). For example, rodent M1 possesses not only a thin L4 but an expanded L5B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>). In rodent S1 barrel cortex, it is L4 that is instead expanded and shows the most overtly specialized connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feldmeyer, 2012</xref>); similarly, L4 in V1 of highly visual mammals is often elaborately differentiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fitzpatrick, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nassi and Callaway, 2009</xref>). Thus, L4 appears to be most elaborate in the primary sensory cortices of modalities that are particularly ethologically relevant to an animal. Motor cortex contains a L4 circuit that is smaller and simpler but retains the same prototypical connectivity patterns. We speculate that like their sensory cortical counterparts, L4 neurons in M1 are specialized for processing of thalamic input before this information is integrated with the activity of other cell classes (which may also be thalamorecipient) downstream in the local M1 network. Our results should facilitate further studies of M1-L4 by enabling a shift of focus away from the question of whether L4 neurons are present in M1 to questions of what types of information they process, how they do so, and how this relates to motor behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Animal studies were approved by the Northwestern University Animal Care and Use Committee. In vivo stereotaxic injections of retrograde tracers (fluorescent microspheres, Lumafluor, Durham, NC) or AAV viruses encoding channelrhodopsin-2 (AAV-ChR2-Venus) were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>). Retrograde tracer injections were made in either the contralateral M1 or ipsilateral M2, S1, and S2 of 6- to 7-week-old mice, to label corticocortical projection neurons in M1; brain slices were prepared 3–7 days later and imaged as described below. Viral injections were made in the motor thalamus of 3- to 4-week-old mice, targeting the ventrolateral nucleus, and optogenetic experiments in brain slices were performed ∼3 weeks later.</p><p>Brain slice preparation and electrophysiology were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2010</xref>). Whole-cell patch-electrode recordings were made from neurons in 0.3-mm-thick brain slices containing M1. Data were sampled at 10 kHz (most experiments) or 40 kHz (for intrinsic electrophysiology measurements) and filtered at 4 kHz. For optogenetic experiments, recordings in L4 (and other layers) were generally targeted to neurons with ‘pyramidal’ somata. For experiments aimed at characterizing intrinsic and morphological properties, recordings were targeted to L4 neurons with any soma shape or size except those suggestive of common types of interneurons, particularly basket cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Apicella et al., 2012</xref>). Data acquisition was controlled by <italic>Ephus</italic> software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ephus.org">www.ephus.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suter et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Standard electrophysiological stimulus protocols were delivered to assess intrinsic properties, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2013</xref>). For each cell, after measuring the resting membrane potential, current was injected as needed to set the membrane potential to −70 mV, and then stimulus protocols were delivered to measure electrophysiological properties. Spike-frequency accommodation (SFA) ratio was calculated as the ratio of the third to fifth inter-spike interval in the first trace containing ≥6 spikes. Current threshold was defined as the amplitude of the current step that was sufficient to evoke one or more action potentials.</p><p>For group analyses of electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), statistical comparisons were performed by pooling neurons into laminar groups corresponding to L4, L2/3, and L5A. Based on the results of the circuit analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3 fig4 fig5 fig6">Figures 1–6</xref>), we defined ‘L4’ as a thin zone centered on 0.33 (in units of normalized cortical depth) and spanning 0.05 the cortical thickness (i.e., depth range 0.305–0.355). We defined ‘L2/3’ as the laminar zone spanning 0.14–0.26, and ‘L5A’ as the zone 0.37–0.42. These laminar zones were separated by small gaps (0.045 between L2/3 and L4, and 0.015 between L4 and L5A), which reduced (but did not necessarily eliminate) the likelihood that some neurons were wrongly classified due to slice-to-slice variability in layer thicknesses. A small number of neurons thus fell outside these groups and were excluded from group analyses (but not from the plots; all data are plotted as circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>Glutamate uncaging and laser scanning photostimulation (glu-LSPS) were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wood and Shepherd, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shepherd, 2012</xref>), using 3- to 5-week-old mice. As described in ‘Results’, in one set of experiments, we acquired sets of input maps for L2/3 neurons in M1 or S1; in another set, we further analyzed a subset of glu-LSPS mapping data from a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weiler et al., 2008</xref>). Temporal windowing was used to detect photostimulation sites where the postsynaptic neuron's dendrites were directly stimulated (defined as excitatory events arriving within 7 msec post-stimulus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schubert et al., 2001</xref>), and these sites were excluded from analysis (shown in the figures as black pixels).</p><p>Optogenetic photostimulation in brain slices was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kiritani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hooks et al., 2013</xref>), exploiting the retained photoexcitability of ChR2-expressing long-range axons in slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Petreanu et al., 2007</xref>) and using conditions (in particular, tetrodotoxin and 4-aminopyridine in the bath solution) that isolate monosynaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Petreanu et al., 2009</xref>). Responses to blue-LED photostimulation were sampled in voltage-clamp mode for each neuron, and multiple neurons were recorded per slice. Traces were analyzed to determine the average response amplitude in a 50-msec post-stimulus window. For the set of neurons recorded in the same slice, responses were normalized to the strongest response, resulting in a normalized laminar profile for each slice. Profiles from different slices and animals were pooled for group analyses.</p><p>Imaging and morphological reconstructions were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suter et al., 2013</xref>), by acquiring two-photon image stacks of neurons that had been biocytin filled during slice recordings, fixed, and processed for fluorescent labeling. Three-dimensional reconstructions of axons and dendrites were manually traced (Neurolucida, MBF Bioscience, Williston, VT) and further analyzed using custom Matlab routines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Source code 1</xref>) to quantify dendritic and axonal length density, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shepherd et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Images of expression patterns of molecular markers were obtained from the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org">http://mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lein et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Many analyses involved plotting a parameter of interest as a function of cortical depth, providing a laminar profile of that parameter. To facilitate comparisons across slices, we converted from absolute cortical depth (distance from pia) to a normalized scale, with pia defined as zero and the cortex–white matter border defined as one. To the extent that the thicknesses of individual cortical layers vary as a constant fraction of the total cortical thickness, this normalization procedure is assumed to reduce some of the slice-to-slice variability; for example, due to small differences in slice angle.</p><p>Unless noted otherwise, statistical comparisons were performed using non-parametric tests (rank-sum or signed-rank tests, as appropriate) with significance defined as p &lt; 0.05.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 2 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sacha Nelson (Reviewing editor); Kevan Martin (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Both reviewers thought the experiments performed were valuable and well carried out. One reviewer had mostly minor suggestions for improvement. His only substantive comment centered on the fact that the way that the normalized laminar boundaries was calculated was not adequately justified in terms of slice-to-slice variability. For example in the authors’ prior work (Suter et al.), the SDs of the layer boundaries are given and these are larger than the gaps between the currently assigned layers.</p><p>The second reviewer had additional concerns. First, he thought that there was inadequate citation of prior literature. Specifically, he noted “Krieg saw layer 4 in M1 of the albino rat in 1946 and the 1997 analyses of Skogland et al in the rat indicated there are indeed cytoarchitectural features consistent with a layer 4 in M1. Skoglund et al demonstrated quantitatively a middle layer that had higher density and small cells reminiscent of layer 4 in 'granular' cortices. Indeed, their paper is entitled, 'The existence of a layer IV in rat motor cortex'). Cajal reported that human M1 has a layer 4, but thanks to Brodmann it was then was lost to primates and their 'agranular' cortex became a defining feature of M1; see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shipp, 2005</xref>. Fortunately Garcia-Cabezas and Barbas have just rediscovered layer 4 in the macaque M1.”</p><p>Perhaps more importantly, the reviewer was concerned that the case for separating L4 neurons from, for example L3 or L5 neurons was not strong enough and that the criteria were not inadequately specified. Specifically, since the location of the thalamic input has long been known, if the primary criterion is that it is thalamorecipient, this seems like a rather modest advance. On the other hand, one might argue that although the location of the axons was known, the functional strength of input to neurons in different layers that might contact those axons with their basal or apical dendrites was arguably not known.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer was concerned about the need for further discussion to indicate whether the authors' prior views of a fundamentally different circuit organization leading to a different laminar sequence of processing for motor cortex (as compared to sensory cortex) is now in need of revision.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05422.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Both reviewers thought the experiments performed were valuable and well carried out.

We have addressed this through several changes to the text, including a move of the explanation of the laminar grouping (used for the electrophysiology analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, where this assignment of cells into layers was done) from the table legend to the Results section, and providing greater detail both in the Methods and Results sections, which should help to clarify these issues.</p><p>The SDs in the Suter et al paper presumably overestimate (perhaps substantially) the actual biological variability of the laminar borders, simply because the borders in M1 are rather indistinct and the measurements were made by eye.</p><p><italic>The second reviewer had additional concerns. First, he thought that there was inadequate citation of prior literature. Specifically, he noted “Krieg saw layer 4 in M1 of the albino rat in 1946 and the 1997 analyses of Skogland et al in the rat indicated there are indeed cytoarchitectural features consistent with a layer 4 in M1. Skoglund et al demonstrated quantitatively a middle layer that had higher density and small cells reminiscent of layer 4 in 'granular' cortices. Indeed, their paper is entitled, 'The existence of a layer IV in rat motor cortex'). Cajal reported that human M1 has a layer 4, but thanks to Brodmann it was then was lost to primates and their 'agranular' cortex became a defining feature of M1; see e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52"><italic>Shipp, 2005</italic></xref><italic>. Fortunately Garcia-Cabezas and Barbas have just rediscovered layer 4 in the macaque M1</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>We have added a sentence (Introduction, end of first paragraph) regarding primate M1, further emphasizing the (already cited) Garcia-Cabezas and Barbas paper, and also mentioning Rorb labeling in primate M1. We already cited Brodmann, Shipp, and Skoglund (among others), but not the Krieg study (of rat cortex) simply because the Caviness study (of mouse cortex) seemed most relevant; we now cite Krieg as well as this contains an interesting initial description of a cytoarchitecturally apparent L4 in M1. In the same paragraph we also already stated that various observations have suggested the presence of L4 in M1, and cite the Skoglund paper (among numerous others).</p><p>The studies mentioned (e.g. Skoglund) primarily address the question of whether L4 is identifiable at the level of cytoarchitecture. Our study addresses the issue at a different level, that of synaptic connectivity (i.e., cellular hodology).</p><p><italic>Perhaps more importantly, the reviewer was concerned that the case for separating L4 neurons from, for example L3 or L5 neurons was not strong enough and that the criteria were not inadequately specified</italic>.</p><p>If we understand correctly, this refers primarily to the electrophysiology analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The presentation has been modified in several ways to try to address this; please see our response to reviewer 1’s similar comment above.</p><p><italic>Specifically, since the location of the thalamic input has long been known, if the primary criterion is that it is thalamorecipient, this seems like a rather modest advance. On the other hand, one might argue that although the location of the axons was known, the functional strength of input to neurons in different layers that might contact those axons with their basal or apical dendrites was arguably not known</italic>.</p><p>Thalamorecipience was not the primary criterion, but rather one of the multiple circuit-level criteria (also including a largely unidirectional projection to the superficial cortical layers; a paucity of inputs from other cortical areas; and a paucity of long-range cortical outputs), which are enumerated the Abstract and elsewhere, and established experimentally in subsequent figures. Regarding the laminar profile of thalamic drive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we were not certain what to expect based on prior literature, and indeed were surprised at the time by what we found. We feel that this evidence, together with our other observations of M1 layer 4’s prototypical connectivity, detailed in later figures, forms a powerful case that at least in mouse, M1 has a genuine layer 4 that may play a similar computational role to layer 4 of other cortices.</p><p><italic>Finally, the reviewer was concerned about the need for further discussion to indicate whether the authors' prior views of a fundamentally different circuit organization leading to a different laminar sequence of processing for motor cortex (as compared to sensory cortex) is now in need of revision</italic>.</p><p>We’ve added comments that address this, at the end of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
