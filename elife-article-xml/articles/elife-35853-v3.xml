Previous studies unraveled three essential ion channels that regulate these parameters: (1) the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel CatSper, (2) the K<sup>+</sup> channel KSper, and (3) the H<sup>+</sup> channel Hv1. However, the molecular identity of the sperm Na<sup>+</sup> conductance that mediates initial membrane depolarization and, thus, triggers downstream signaling events is yet to be defined. Here, we functionally characterize DSper, the Depolarizing Channel of Sperm, as the temperature-activated channel TRPV4. It is functionally expressed at both mRNA and protein levels, while other temperature-sensitive TRPV channels are not functional in human sperm. DSper currents are activated by warm temperatures and mediate cation conductance, that shares a pharmacological profile reminiscent of TRPV4. Together, these results suggest that TRPV4 activation triggers initial membrane depolarization, facilitating both CatSper and Hv1 gating and, consequently, sperm hyperactivation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPV4</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>sperm cell</kwd><kwd>hyperactivation</kwd><kwd>CatSper</kwd><kwd>thermosensitivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM111802</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lishko</surname><given-names>Polina V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>00028642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lishko</surname><given-names>Polina V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

To accomplish these goals, a spermatozoon must sense the environment and adapt its motility, which is controlled in part by ATP production and flagellar ion homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lishko et al., 2012</xref>). Of vital importance is the transition from symmetrical basal tail bending into ‘hyperactivated motility’ – an asymmetrical, high-amplitude, whip-like beating pattern of the flagellum - that enables sperm to overcome the egg’s protective vestments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ho et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ishijima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Suarez, 1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">1993</xref>). The steroid hormone progesterone (P4) acts as a major trigger of human sperm hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suarez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uhler et al., 1992</xref>). P4 is released by cumulus cells surrounding the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schuetz and Dubin, 1981</xref>) and causes a robust elevation of human sperm cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] via the principal Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel of sperm, CatSper (EC<sub>50</sub> = 7.7 ± 1.8 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strünker et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). The steroid acts via its non-genomic receptor ABHD2, a serine hydrolase that, upon P4 binding, releases inhibition of human CatSper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2016</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx produced from the opening of CatSper channels is a necessary milestone in the process of fertilization and initiates hyperactivated motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suarez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlson et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Navarro et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Quill et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>CatSper channels exhibit weak voltage-dependency with half-maximal activation at V<sub>1/2 human CatSper</sub> =+70 mV for capacitated sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>). This parameter (V<sub>1/2</sub>) reflects a certain membrane voltage condition under which 50% of CatSper channels are in the open state. Given this unusually high V<sub>1/2</sub>, only a small fraction of human CatSper channels are open at physiological-relevant membrane potentials. P4 has been shown to potentiate CatSper activity by shifting V<sub>1/2</sub> to more negative values (V<sub>1/2 human CatSper</sub> =+30 mV with 500 nM P4 for capacitated sperm cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>]). However, CatSper still requires both additional intracellular alkalization and significant membrane depolarization to function properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirichok et al., 2006</xref>). The proton channel Hv1 was revealed as one of the potential regulators of intracellular pH (pH<sub>i</sub>) in human spermatozoa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lishko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2017</xref>). By mediating unidirectional flow of protons to the extracellular environment, Hv1 represents an important component in the CatSper activation cascade, but it also induces membrane hyperpolarization by exporting positive charges out of the cell. Hv1 is a voltage-gated channel and depends on membrane depolarization to be activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramsey et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sasaki et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, both CatSper and Hv1 must rely on yet unidentified depolarizing ion channels. P4 was shown to inhibit the K<sup>+</sup> channel of human sperm KSper (IC<sub>50</sub> = 7.5 ± 1.3 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mannowetz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brenker et al., 2014</xref>]) making KSper inhibition one of the potential origins for membrane depolarization. However, efficient KSper inhibition requires P4 concentrations in the μM range, which are only present in close vicinity of the egg. Sperm hyperactivation, however, occurs in the fallopian tubes, where P4 concentrations are not sufficient to block KSper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Demott and Suarez, 1992</xref>). Hence, the current model is missing a fourth member – the ‘Depolarizing Channel of Sperm’ (DSper) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miller et al., 2015</xref>). Activation of the hypothetical DSper ion channel would induce long-lasting membrane depolarization and provide the necessary positive net charge influx for CatSper/Hv1 activity. Despite its central role, the molecular identity of DSper yet remains elusive.</p><p>The goal of this work was to characterize DSper and resolve its molecular identity in human spermatozoa. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp measurements, we recorded a novel non-CatSper conductance in both capacitated and noncapacitated spermatozoa. This unidentified, nonselective cation conductance exhibited outward rectification and pronounced temperature sensitivity in a range that matches the temperature spectrum of TRPV4 activity. Moreover, the pharmacological profile of DSper bears resemblance to TRPV4. Based on our electrophysiological, biochemical and immunocytochemical data, we thus conclude that the molecular identity of DSper is TRPV4.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A novel non-CatSper conductance of human sperm cells</title><p>As many calcium channels, CatSper conducts monovalent ions, such as Cs<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> in the absence of divalent cations from the extracellular solution (divalent free; DVF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirichok et al., 2006</xref>).

Cs<sup>+</sup> inward and outward currents elicited under DVF condition (black traces and bars) were larger than currents recorded in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (red traces and bars) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>). This phenomenon was observed in both noncapacitated and capacitated spermatozoa, respectively. Notably, capacitated cells generally showed increased current densities under both conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The data suggests that the remaining conductance is a novel non-CatSper conductance via the yet to be identified DSper ion channel. DSper currents were potentiated during capacitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>) and exhibited outward rectification, though, DSper currents recorded from capacitated cells were notably less rectifying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). This DSper component is unlikely a remnant of an increased leak current since the cells returned to their initial ‘baseline’ current after returning to the initial (HS) bath solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Cation influx is the physiologically relevant entity to be analyzed as it represents channel activity under physiological relevant conditions and ensures membrane depolarization. Therefore, we preferentially analyzed DSper inward currents elicited by the change of membrane potential from 0 mV to −80 mV. To rule out ‘contamination’ of putative <italic>I</italic><sub>DSper</sub> with remaining <italic>I</italic><sub>CatSper</sub>, we next tested whether 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> is sufficient to completely block <italic>I</italic><sub>CatSper</sub> and selectively isolate DSper currents. The CatSper inhibitor NNC 55–0396 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strünker et al., 2011</xref>) did not elicit any additional inhibitory effect on <italic>I<sub>DSper</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1A</xref>), confirming efficient CatSper pore block by Mg<sup>2+</sup>. These findings corroborate our hypothesis that a novel CatSper-independent cation conductance could provide additional depolarization under physiological conditions.

By contrast, Kumar <italic>et al</italic>. detected TRPV4 expression in human spermatozoa using immunocytochemistry and calcium imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>).

However, functional characterization of a temperature-activated cation conductance via direct methods, such as electrophysiology, has not been performed in human sperm yet. Since the functional expression of a thermosensitive TRP ion channel in human spermatozoa is currently under debate, and their cation permeability renders many of them DSper candidates, we investigated the impact of temperature on DSper activity.

To discriminate between these channels, we tested potential effects of corresponding selective agonists – carvacrol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vogt-Eisele et al., 2009</xref>) for TRPV3, RN1747 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vincent et al., 2009</xref>) for TRPV4, capsaicin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caterina et al., 1997</xref>) for TRPV1, and pregnenolone sulfate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harteneck, 2013</xref>) for TRPM3. Employing either electrophysiological, or Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings, only TRPV4 agonist RN1747 elicited a significant effect. In detail, application of 10 μM RN1747 (EC<sub>50</sub> = 0.77 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vincent et al., 2009</xref>]) significantly potentiated DSper outward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1A</xref>) in noncapacitated human sperm.

Using Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging of fluo-4/AM-loaded sperm, we next recorded fluorescence changes in the flagellar principle piece while stimulating human sperm with either 10 μM capsaicin or 500 μM carvacrol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1C,D</xref>).

TRPM3 channels also exhibit temperature sensitivity between ambient warm to hot, which resembles the range observed for DSper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vriens and Voets, 2018</xref>).

It is thus very likely, that human spermatozoa express a temperature-activated ion channel, which operates in the described temperature range and enables thermotaxis. Another potential role for this channel is to serve as a sensor for the initiation of human sperm capacitation. During maturation in the female reproductive tract, human sperm are exposed to elevated temperature, especially before and during ovulation, which is correlated with an increase in basal body temperature by 1°C. As spermatozoa are able to survive in the female reproductive tract for several days by binding to the ciliated epithelia of the fallopian tubes, they must eventually undergo hyperactivation to detach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ardon et al., 2016</xref>). Accordingly, CatSper-deficient spermatozoa that cannot hyperactivate are not able to ascend the fallopian tubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In order for hyperactivation to occur, spermatozoa must be fully capacitated – a process that takes approximately 5 hr in humans, and requires sperm exposure to bicarbonate, albumin, and elevated temperature. While sperm capacitation can be achieved in vitro, exposure to 37°C is an absolute requirement. Therefore, the presence of a temperature-sensitive sperm ion channel could serve as the potential sensor for the onset of capacitation and might ensure sperm final maturation in the female reproductive tract.</p><p>The temperature response profile of DSper conforms with previously reported temperature sensitivity of TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Güler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, we observed <italic>I</italic><sub>DSper</sub> potentiation by the selective TRPV4 agonist RN1747 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), as well as decreased temperature-sensitivity upon stimulation with TRPV4 selective inhibitors HC067047 and RN1734 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). It should be noted that the absence of a significant inward current via TRPV4 in presence of both extracellular Mg<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, such as in HS solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), results from competition for the channel pore between the divalent and monovalent ions. It has been reported that extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> inhibits TRPV4 monovalent conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Watanabe et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The temperature coefficient Q<sub>10</sub> reflects the temperature dependence of the membrane current and has been reported to be between 9 and 19 for recombinantly expressed TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Güler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>). However, endogenously expressed TRPV4 channels recorded from aorta endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Watanabe et al., 2002</xref>) exhibit less steep temperature dependence, which resembles the Q<sub>10</sub> of sperm TRPV4 (Q<sub>10 sodium</sub> = 2.30, noncapacitated sperm). It is possible that different lipid environments or additional channel modifications are responsible for such differences.</p><p>It is also possible that sperm cells possess more than one type of temperature-regulated ion channel. The biphasic inhibition of DSper with TRPV4-selective antagonists (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) does not result in complete current inhibition, particularly in the temperate range between 24 and 32°C. This may suggest an additional, non-TRPV4 conductance. The molecular nature of such additional conductance(s) could be either temperature-dependent release of NNC inhibition on CatSper or perhaps the presence of other yet undiscovered temperature-sensitive ion channel(s). Interestingly, according to one published report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamano et al., 2016</xref>), murine TRPV4 regulates sperm thermotaxis. However, TRPV4-deficient male mice are fertile which may indicate either presence of an additional temperature sensor or a compensatory mechanism.</p><p>According to our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), human spermatozoa are exposed to an increase in both temperature and [Na<sup>+</sup>] upon deposit to the female reproductive tract. TRPV4-mediated Na<sup>+</sup> influx induces membrane depolarization, which in turn activates both Hv1 and CatSper. H<sup>+</sup> efflux through Hv1 promotes intracellular alkalization and thus enhanced CatSper activation. Approaching the egg, sperm is exposed to P4 and the endocannabinoid anandamide (AEA), both secreted by cumulus cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">El-Talatini et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hunter and Rodriguez-Martinez, 2004</xref>). P4 binding to ABHD2 releases CatSper inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miller et al., 2016</xref>) while AEA was shown to activate Hv1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lishko et al., 2010</xref>). The resulting opening of CatSper generates a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx along the flagellum and serves as the trigger for hyperactivation. P4 not only potentiates CatSper, it also inhibits KSper-mediated hyperpolarization, which gives the CatSper activation cascade an additional impulse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mannowetz et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35853.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Interdependency of ion channel complexes in the human sperm flagellum.</title><p>Transition into hyperactivated motility is triggered by a CatSper-mediated rise in the cytosolic calcium levels. Proper CatSper function requires three concurrent activation mechanisms: (1) membrane depolarization, (2) intracellular alkalization via Hv1-mediated proton extrusion, and (3) abundance of progesterone. In our proposed model the sperm’s sodium channel TRPV4 is activated by warm temperatures (37°C at the site of fertilization). TRPV4-mediated sodium influx induces: (1) membrane depolarization, which in turn activates both Hv1 and CatSper. Hv1 then extrudes protons out of the sperm, thereby leading to (2) intracellular alkalization and further activation of CatSper. Cumulus cells surrounding the egg secrete (3) P4 and AEA. P4 releases CatSper inhibition and high P4 concentrations block KSper-mediated hyperpolarization. AEA was shown to potentiate Hv1. The resulting opening of CatSper generates a Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that serves as the trigger for hyperactivation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35853-fig7-v3"/></fig><p>Using a CatSper2-deficient infertile patient, no remaining cation current was recordable, when both Hv1 and KSper were blocked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2013</xref>). However, these recordings were performed in a condition where ATP was absent from the pipette solution. According to Phelps <italic>et al</italic>. intracellular ATP binding to the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of TRPV4 has a profound sensitizing effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Phelps et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lishko et al., 2007</xref>), which is a feature of the TRPV ankyrin repeats and is shared between TRPV1 and TRPV4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lishko et al., 2007</xref>). Indeed, addition of 4 mM ATP to the pipette solution, allowed us to consistently record TRPV4 activity from fertile human sperm.</p><p>Our data suggests that TRPV4 activity is increased upon capacitation. Since capacitation encompasses changes in the phosphorylation state of many proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Visconti et al., 2011</xref>), and TRPV4 requires tyrosine phosphorylation to function properly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wegierski et al., 2009</xref>), it is likely that TRPV4 phosphorylation is required. It would also explain, why only capacitated human spermatozoa appear to be thermotactically responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bahat et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, we also observed different <italic>I</italic><sub>DSper</sub> kinetics (i.e. less outward rectification) after capacitation. This finding could also be the result of phosphorylation, modified lipid composition or even formation of TRPV4/X heteromers upon capacitation. These aspects will be addressed in future studies.</p><p>Selective anti-hTRPV4 antibodies located TRPV4 in the flagellum and acrosome of human sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The localization of TRPV4 in the acrosome region should be evaluated critically since this compartment is highly antigenic and attracts antibodies in general (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 1996</xref>). However, TRPV4 appears to be distributed in the sperm flagellum. The principal piece of the sperm tail is also the compartment where CatSper and Hv1 reside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lishko et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2001</xref>), bringing those three interdependent ion channels in close proximity to each other.</p><p>TRPV4 – more precisely its hyperfunction - might underlie the aversive effect of increased scrotal temperatures on sperm production and epididymal preservation. As proposed by Bedford <italic>et al</italic>., increased scrotal temperatures when clothed contribute substantially to the inferior quality of human ejaculate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bedford, 1991</xref>). By contrast, TRPV4 might represent an attractive target for male fertility control, since TRPV4 is likely to lie upstream in the signaling cascades leading to sperm hyperactivation and can be heterologously expressed for high-throughput functional studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line</td><td valign="top">HEK293</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">ATCC cat# CRL-1573 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVRL_0045">CVRL_0045</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">RN1747</td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top">3745</td><td valign="top">TRPV4 agonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">capsaicin</td><td valign="top">Cayman</td><td valign="top">404-86-4</td><td valign="top">TRPV1 agonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">carvacrol</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">499-75-2</td><td valign="top">TRPV3 agonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">Pregnenolone sulfate</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">P162</td><td valign="top">TRPM3 agonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">HC067047</td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top">4100</td><td valign="top">TRPV4 antagonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">RN1734</td><td valign="top">Tocris</td><td valign="top">3746</td><td valign="top">TRPV4 antagonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">NNC 55–0396</td><td valign="top">R and D systems</td><td valign="top">2268</td><td valign="top">CatSper antagonist</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">Fluo-4/AM</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">F14201</td><td valign="top">Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicator</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Compound</td><td valign="top">Lipofectamine</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">11668019</td><td valign="top">Transfection reagent</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">α-TRPV4</td><td valign="top">Alomone</td><td valign="top">Alomone cat# ACC-034 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2040264">AB_2040264</ext-link></td><td valign="top">polyclonal; host: <break/>rabbit; unconjugated</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human sperm cells</title><p>A total of 5 healthy male volunteers were recruited to this study, which was conducted with approval of the Committee on Human Research at the University of California, Berkeley (protocol 10–01747, IRB reliance #151).

Single cells were visualized with an inverse microscope (Olympus IX71) equipped with a differential interference contrast, a 60 x Objective (Olympus UPlanSApo, water immersion, 1.2 NA, ∞/0.13–0.21/FN26.5) and a 1.6 magnification changer. An AXOPATCH 200B amplifier and an Axon<sup>TM</sup> Digidata 1550A digitizer (both Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) with integrated Humbug noise eliminator was used for data acquisition. Hardware was controlled with the Clampex 10.5 software (Molecular Devices). We monitored and compensated offset voltages and pipette capacitance (C<sub>fast</sub>). Gigaohm seals were established at the cytoplasmic droplet of highly motile cells in standard high saline buffer (‘HS’ in mM: 135 NaCl, 20 HEPES, 10 lactic acid, five glucose, 5 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, one sodium pyruvate, pH 7.4 adjusted with NaOH, 320 mOsm/l) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kirichok et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lishko et al., 2011</xref>). The patch pipette was filled with 140 mM CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 20 mM HEPES, 10 mM BAPTA, 4 mM NaATP, 1 mM CsCl (pH 7.4 adjusted with CsOH, 330 mOsm/l). For recordings from capacitated spermatozoa, BAPTA was substituted for 5 mM EGTA and 1 mM EDTA. We confirmed that changing of the chelator composition had no effect on DSper current amplitudes in noncapacitated cells. Transition into whole-cell mode was achieved by applying voltage pulses (499–700 mV, 1–5 ms, V<sub>hold</sub> = 0 mV) and simultaneous suction. After establishment of the whole-cell configuration, inward and outward currents were elicited via 0.2 Hz stimulation with voltage ramps (−80 mV to +80 mV in 850 ms, V<sub>hold</sub> = 0 mV, total 1000 ms/ramp). Data was not corrected for liquid junction potential changes. To ensure stable recording conditions, only cells with baseline currents (in HS solution) ≤10 pA at −80 mV were used for experiments. Under ‘HS’ condition, CatSper and DSper currents were considered to be minimal, thus any remaining baseline current represented the cells leak current. During whole-cell voltage-clamp experiments, the cells were continuously perfused with varying bath solutions utilizing a gravity-driven perfusion system. If not stated otherwise, electrophysiological experiments were performed at 22°C. Temperature of the bath solution was controlled and monitored with an automatic temperature control (TC-324B, Warner Instrument Corporation, Hamden, CT, USA). Both, CatSper and DSper currents were recorded under symmetric conditions for the major permeant ion. Under these conditions, the bath solution was divalent free (‘DVF’) containing (in mM) 140 CsMeSO<sub>3</sub>, 20 HEPES, 1 EDTA, and pH 7.4 was adjusted with CsOH, 320 mOsm/l. To isolate DSper conductances, monovalent currents through CatSper channels were inhibited by supplementing the DVF solution with 1 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> and in the absence of EDTA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2007</xref>). Experiments with different bath solutions were performed on the same cell. Signals were sampled at 10 kHz and low-pass filtered at 1 kHz (Bessel filter; 80 dB/decade). Pipette resistance ranged from 9 to 15 MΩ, access resistance was 21–100 MΩ, membrane resistance ≥1.5 GΩ. Membrane capacitance was 0.8–1.3 pF and served as a proxy for the cell surface area and thus for normalization of current amplitudes (i.e. current density). Capacitance artifacts were graphically removed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Anne Carlson (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Human sperm physiology is still not well understood. Specifically, research into the presence and molecular nature of several ion transport mechanisms is still in its infancy. It is known that sperm capacitation and hyperactivation is accompanied by an initial increase in calcium concentration mediated by CatSper channels, but the trigger of this activation, a presumed depolarization event, remained obscured. In this manuscript, Mundt at al. have undertaken a study to characterize an inward, depolarizing cationic current, that is highly sensitive to temperature and provide evidence that it is produced by the TRPV4 thermosensitive channel. The experiments are of high quality and in general support the conclusions. This paper is potentially of high general interest and impact in sperm physiology.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>– The reviewers feel that it is essential that throughout the manuscript, it is made clear that the conclusions reached are so far applicable to human sperm.</p><p>– All reviewers find that the use of specific blockers, and perhaps other agonists, of TRPV4 channels is paramount to make a more solid case for TRPV4 being the basis of I<sub>DSper</sub> currents.</p><p>– Since TRPV4 was cloned from the preparation used in this study, it would be greatly enhanced by showing that the properties of the cloned channels match the properties of the endogenous I<sub>DSper</sub> current.</p><p>– Since TRPV1 channels are present in human sperm, although no currents with the properties of these channels have been recorded, it is essential that the authors demonstrate that no capsaicin activated currents are recorded. Please consider that these channels might be &quot;washed-off&quot; by the recording conditions.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Mundt et al. presents evidence that the TRPV4 ion channels is responsible for a temperature-sensitive, depolarizing conductance in human sperm cells. Through careful electrophysiological and molecular biology experiments the authors describe an inward current that is separate from the main CatSper current present in these cells. The electrophysiology of sperm is riddled with controversies, and although the presence of several ion channels and transporters has been reported by inmmunoanalysis and physiology of multi-cell measurements, functional data is very hard to come by. The findings presented here are potentially of great general interest, since they might help explain the initial steps in sperm hyperactivation and offer a better understanding of sperm physiology.</p><p>The data in the manuscript is of very high quality and in general the interpretation of results is supported by the data. I have several comments and suggestions that need to be addressed.</p><p>– The authors describe a novel inward current in human sperm that they designate as I<sub>DSper</sub>. This is the finding in which the rest of the paper is supported and therefore it's very important that the evidence for it is strong. Although human electrophysiology is sparse, any references to this current in other reports should be included and discussed.</p><p>– If I<sub>DSper</sub> is a TRPV channel, it is not clear to me why in HS solution (initial baseline recordings) the inward current is not visible, since TRPV channels are Na<sup>+</sup> permeable and HS solution has a high NaCl concentration. This is a very important point to clarify.</p><p>– The authors suggest that, since I<sub>DSper</sub> is temperature sensitive, it could be made up of TRPV3, TRPV4 or TRPV1. TRPV3 has a very high threshold for temperature activation, very different from I<sub>DSper</sub>. This should be discussed. TRPV1 is ruled out because capsaicin fails to elicit currents. However, TRPV1 protein is present in human sperm. Also, capsaicin activation is dependent of the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub>, since this lipid is a positive regulator of TRPV1 channels. TRPV1 cannot be activated by capsaicin at low PIP<sub>2</sub> concentrations. My worry is that recording conditions might have promoted the washing off of PIP<sub>2</sub> and this TRPV1 channels possibly present did not respond to capsaicin. Recordings should be made in conditions that protect the regulation of TRPV1 by PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>– An TRPV4-selective antagonist should be used to demonstrate that I<sub>DSper</sub> is indeed TRPV4.</p><p>– The authors have a nice form of evidence in that they have cloned a TRPV4 channel from human sperm. They even expressed it in HEK cells and did some western blotting. They should do electrophysiological recordings of this TRPV4 clone in HEK cells to demonstrate that is has at least some of the functional characteristics of I<sub>DSper</sub>.</p><p>– Temperature activation data in Figures 2 and 3 have a curve fitted to them, but no details are given as to what is its theoretical meaning. This should be fixed. Also for comparison purposes, at least a Q<sub>10</sub> value should be given and discussed in terms of what is known of temperature gating in TRPV4 channels.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Background: At mating, mammalian sperm are unable to fertilize an egg, even when the two gametes are placed in direct contact with each other. Sperm must spend time in the female reproductive tract where they acquire various physiologic processes that endow them with the capacity to fertilize, and these processes are collectively referred to as capacitation. It has long been known at the ionic currents of sperm play a commanding role in signaling capacitation, but only in the last 15 years have we begun to uncover the molecular identity of these channels.</p><p>Synopsis: Mundt and colleagues sought to uncover the identity of the channel that passes depolarizing currents during human sperm capacitation. Several pieces of data substantiated the existence of such current, including the requirement of depolarizing potentials for the proper functioning of CatSper (a channel known to be required for capacitation – hyperactivation in particular). Using electrophysiology on human sperm, the authors found that the depolarizing current: increases during capacitation, is passed by a CatSper-independent channel, increases with increasing temperatures, and can conduct Na<sup>+</sup>. Finally, the authors employed the TrpV4 targeting agonist, RN1747, to demonstrate that TrpV4 channels pass the depolarizing current in human sperm. These studies represent a major breakthrough in reproductive biology with interesting biological consequences.</p><p>Comments:</p><p>This paper depends on the finding that the TrpV4 agonist RN1747 is acting specifically on TrpV4 channels. Although these data are compelling, this story would be greatly strengthened by including an additionally drug targeting this channel. For example, demonstrating that TrpV4 targeting inhibitor, RN1734, blocked this current would substantiate their claim. Alternatively, is the requirement of Na-ATP (rather than Mg-ATP) TrpV4 specific? If so, perhaps that could be discussed more to substantiate these findings.</p><p>The authors focus on the physiologic temperature differences between the epididymis (34.4 °C) and body core temperature (37 °C), yet this manuscript does not demonstrate that these TrpV4 passed currents are significantly different at 34.4 vs 37 °C. Moreover, the data included in this manuscript indicate that TrpV4 channels mainly pass current after capacitation. Between the onset of hyperactivation (at the end of capacitation) and fertilization, sperm should not experience a temperature gradient.

The reason behind this decision is the fact that RN1747 must be dissolved in DMSO, as it is the only solvent in which RN1747 can be dissolved. DMSO (up to 0.1%) doesn’t affect DSper currents using electrophysiology, as evident from the newly added pregnenolone sulfate (PS) experiments (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E) since we have dissolved PS in DMSO as well. We found that DMSO has a profound nonspecific effect on calcium changes inside sperm cells at such small concentrations as 0.02%, as observable during calcium imaging measurements (Figure 1). This effect may not be TRPV4- related, and might not even reflect calcium influx from outside, versus release of calcium from intracellular stores. This DMSO effect has also been reported by others (Kumar et al., 2016), therefore we do not feel it is justified to rely on calcium imaging experiments when the agonist is dissolved in DMSO. All other compounds we have tested here using calcium imaging have been dissolved in ethanol.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35853.023</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Single-cell calcium imaging of the sperm flagellum.</title><p>Arrow indicates application of either RN1747 dissolved in DMSO (red) or the corresponding concentration of DMSO as a vehicle control (blue).

Thank you for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript by Mundt et al. presents evidence that the TRPV4 ion channels is responsible for a temperature-sensitive, depolarizing conductance in human sperm cells. Through careful electrophysiological and molecular biology experiments the authors describe an inward current that is separate from the main CatSper current present in these cells. The electrophysiology of sperm is riddled with controversies, and although the presence of several ion channels and transporters has been reported by inmmunoanalysis and physiology of multi-cell measurements, functional data is very hard to come by. The findings presented here are potentially of great general interest, since they might help explain the initial steps in sperm hyperactivation and offer a better understanding of sperm physiology.</p><p>The data in the manuscript is of very high quality and in general the interpretation of results is supported by the data. I have several comments and suggestions that need to be addressed.</p><p>– The authors describe a novel inward current in human sperm that they designate as I<sub>DSper</sub>. This is the finding in which the rest of the paper is supported and therefore it's very important that the evidence for it is strong. Although human electrophysiology is sparse, any references to this current in other reports should be included and discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the references to the work of others. Indeed, several temperature-sensitive ion channels or specific transporters have been reported in mammalian sperm (Gervasi et al., 2011; Hamano et al., 2016; Kumar et al., 2016). However, functional characterization of the temperature-activated cation conductance via direct methods, such as electrophysiology, has not been performed in human sperm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– If I<sub>DSper</sub> is a TRPV channel, it is not clear to me why in HS solution (initial baseline recordings) the inward current is not visible, since TRPV channels are Na<sup>+</sup> permeable and HS solution has a high NaCl concentration. This is a very important point to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>The residual inward current is still possible to observe in HS solution, particularly in the capacitated sperm (Figure 1B), however since TRPV4 channel is permeable to both divalent cations (calcium) and monovalent cations (sodium), there will be a competition for the pore region and the divalent block of monovalent conductance will be observed. This is a common feature shared between many calcium permeant channels, such as voltage-gated calcium channels and CatSper. For example, CatSper is perfectly permeable to calcium (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A of this manuscript), as well as sodium and cesium (Kirichok, Navarro and Clapham, 2006; Lishko et al., 2010, and Lishko et al., 2011), and yet we do not observe large CatSper currents in the solutions when both monovalent ions and calcium are present (Lishko et al., 2011 Figure 2C and Supplementary Figure 6). It has been reported that calcium exhibits a similar inhibitory influence on TRPV4 monovalent conductance with IC<sub>50</sub> of 591 ± 89 nM (Watanabe et al., 2003). We have included this explanation in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors suggest that, since I<sub>DSper</sub> is temperature sensitive, it could be made up of TRPV3, TRPV4 or TRPV1. TRPV3 has a very high threshold for temperature activation, very different from I<sub>DSper</sub>. This should be discussed. TRPV1 is ruled out because capsaicin fails to elicit currents. However, TRPV1 protein is present in human sperm. Also, capsaicin activation is dependent of the presence of PIP<sub>2</sub>, since this lipid is a positive regulator of TRPV1 channels. TRPV1 cannot be activated by capsaicin at low PIP<sub>2</sub> concentrations. My worry is that recording conditions might have promoted the washing off of PIP<sub>2</sub> and this TRPV1 channels possibly present did not respond to capsaicin. Recordings should be made in conditions that protect the regulation of TRPV1 by PIP<sub>2</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe, the reviewer meant TRPV2, which has indeed a very high threshold for activation (above 53 °C). We have included the reference to this and the sentence describing why we have excluded TRPV2. As for TRPV1, indeed human sperm retain significant amount of TRPV1 mRNA (Miller et al., 2016), and yet we failed to detect any capsaicin-elicited activity even when we supplemented pipette solution with 30 µM PIP<sub>2</sub> and applied 10 µM of capsaicin (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). It is possible that TRPV1 is initially active in the developing spermatids, and then the channel is either inactivated or removed from the plasma membrane.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– An TRPV4-selective antagonist should be used to demonstrate that I<sub>DSper</sub> is indeed TRPV4.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have tested two TRPV4-selective antagonists: HC067047 and RN1734, and both prevented temperature activation of DSper, confirming that DSper is TRPV4 (Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The authors have a nice form of evidence in that they have cloned a TRPV4 channel from human sperm. They even expressed it in HEK cells and did some western blotting. They should do electrophysiological recordings of this TRPV4 clone in HEK cells to demonstrate that is has at least some of the functional characteristics of I<sub>DSper</sub>.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. As evident from Figure 6, TRPV4 cloned from human sperm mRNA recapitulates DSper temperature sensitivity, and activation by selective agonist RN1747.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Temperature activation data in Figures 2 and 3 have a curve fitted to them, but no details are given as to what is its theoretical meaning. This should be fixed. Also for comparison purposes, at least a Q<sub>10</sub> value should be given and discussed in terms of what is known of temperature gating in TRPV4 channels.</p></disp-quote><p>Recombinantly expressed TRPV4 channels have reportedly high temperature coefficient Q<sub>10</sub>: from 9 to 19 (Guler et al., 2002; Watanabe et al., 2002). However, endogenously expressed TRPV4 recorded from aorta endothelial cells ((Watanabe et al., 2002) Figure 7A-B) have less steeper heat activation, somewhat between 1.5 and 2. In our experiments, a temperature ramp from 23°C to 37°C potentiated I<sub>DSper</sub> inward currents by factors of 2.7 ± 0.5 for noncapacitated cells and 2.0 ± 0.2 for capacitated cells, which corresponds to Q<sub>10</sub> noncapacitated=1.76, and Q<sub>10 capacitated</sub>=1.65. In our experiments we have measured Q<sub>10</sub> for cesium currents (Figure 2), and not for sodium, which could account for the difference. Indeed, Q<sub>10</sub> for DSper sodium conductance is higher: Q<sub>10 noncapacitated, sodium</sub>= 2.30 (Figure 3). Secondly, we have measured TRPV4 activation using a ramp protocol with 5 s interval between stimulations, which is a different protocol used by Watanabe et al. More importantly, as reported by Xu and colleagues, the heating speed °C/s has high impact on the resulting Q<sub>10</sub> for TRPV channels (Q<sub>10</sub>=23.3 for 4.7 °C/s vs. Q<sub>10</sub>=6.4 for 2.4 °C/s for TRPV3) (Xu et al., 2002). Since we have used in-line heater to apply the change in temperature, which is a slow heating-device, it is very likely that the rather slow heating speed of our in-line heating device (0.2 °C/s) results in a low Q<sub>10</sub> of DSper. It is also possible that a different lipid environment to which sperm TRPV4 is exposed, or additional modification of the channel are responsible for such differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Comments:</p><p>This paper depends on the finding that the TrpV4 agonist RN1747 is acting specifically on TrpV4 channels. Although these data are compelling, this story would be greatly strengthened by including an additionally drug targeting this channel. For example, demonstrating that TrpV4 targeting inhibitor, RN1734, blocked this current would substantiate their claim. Alternatively, is the requirement of Na-ATP (rather than Mg-ATP) TrpV4 specific? If so, perhaps that could be discussed more to substantiate these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. We have tested two TRPV4-selective antagonists: HC067047 and RN1734, and both prevented temperature activation of DSper, confirming that DSper is TRPV4 (Figure 5). As for sodium vs magnesium ATP, indeed, there is a requirement for this as according to Phelps et al. (Phelps, et al., 2010) since intracellular Na-ATP binding to the N-terminal ankyrin repeat domain of TRPV4 has a profound sensitizing effect, which is a feature of the TRPV ankyrin repeats and is shared between TRPV1 and TRPV4 (Lishko et al., 2007).

The biphasic inhibition of DSper with TRPV4-selective antagonists (Figure 5) does not result in complete current inhibition, particularly in the temperate range between 24°C and 32°C. This may suggest an additional, non-TRPV4 conductance. The molecular nature of such additional conductance(s) could be a temperature-sensitivity of CatSper to its inhibitors NNC 55-0396, or perhaps the presents of other temperature-sensitive ion channel(s).
