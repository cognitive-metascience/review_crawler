To compare the relative influence of transient events and temporally stable environmental stimuli on the firing of LEC cells, we recorded neuron spiking patterns in the region during blocks of a trace eyeblink conditioning paradigm performed in two environments and with different conditioning stimuli. Firing rates of some neurons were phasically selective for conditioned stimuli in a way that depended on which room the rat was in; nearly all neurons were tonically selective for environments in a way that depended on which stimuli had been presented in those environments. As rats moved from one environment to another, tonic neuron ensemble activity exhibited prospective information about the conditioned stimulus associated with the environment. Thus, the LEC formed phasic and tonic codes for event-environment associations, thereby accurately differentiating multiple experiences with overlapping features.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28611.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28611.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28611.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The context in which an event occurs plays a large role in how the brain understands and responds to the event. While a key part of context is where we are, contexts can also change within the same space: different meetings are held at different times and with different people in the same room, and a grassy field can be a place of intense competition or a place to relax and gaze at clouds. However, we have little understanding of how the brain sets up and maintains a sense of context.</p><p>A region of the brain called the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC) responds to events as they happen, but may also maintain a record of past experiences, and helps us to learn new associations between events. To find out how LEC neurons might represent context, Pilkiw et al. measured the activity of individual LEC neurons in rats as they experienced different combinations of events and environments. In each trial, the rats were placed in one of two different rooms and exposed to one of two sensory cues (sound or light) six times, either alone or, to test learning, paired moments later with a mild stimulation to the eyelid. The gaps between the cues lasted from 20 to 40 seconds.</p><p>As expected, some LEC neurons responded to the sensory cues, and varied their responses to cues depending on whether or not they were paired with eyelid stimulation. What was much more striking is that almost all cells in the LEC behaved very differently in different contexts, both in response to the cues and also during the long gaps between the cues. This suggests that the LEC provides the brain with information about the circumstances of an event, and may be the reason we expect different events under different circumstances – even if we are in the same place.</p><p>We tend to underestimate how much we rely on context to remember events and to guide our behavior. Many disabling health conditions, including addiction, post-traumatic stress disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, are affected by context. For example, people who are trying to overcome drug addiction can often reduce their cravings by avoiding places and situations in which they previously used the drug in question. Understanding how the LEC represents context may therefore help us to develop treatments that target this brain region in order to alter harmful behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.28611.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.28611.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>episodic memory</kwd><kwd>context</kwd><kwd>associative memory</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>single-unit activity</kwd><kwd>ensemble decoding</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN-2015-05458</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takehara-Nishiuchi</surname><given-names>Kaori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP-133693</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takehara-Nishiuchi</surname><given-names>Kaori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Takehara-Nishiuchi</surname><given-names>Kaori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>396157093</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pilkiw</surname><given-names>Maryna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neuron populations in the lateral entorhinal cortex discriminate between memory-based contexts through both continuous &quot;tonic&quot; activity patterns as well as by their stimulus-evoked &quot;phasic&quot; responses.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The entorhinal cortex is thought to support rapid encoding of daily experiences by serving as an interface between the hippocampus and neocortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Squire, 1992</xref>). In particular, lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex encode non-spatial information, such as objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshmukh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Keene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>) as well as visual and olfactory stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Igarashi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu and Wilson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Young et al., 1997</xref>). Recent evidence, however, demonstrates that the role of the LEC goes beyond a simple relay of non-spatial sensory information. For example, some cells in the LEC encode the location at which a specific object is placed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Keene et al., 2016</xref>) whereas other cells fire at the location of a previously encountered object or rewarding stimulus that is no longer present in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>). These findings are consistent with the LEC’s role in recognizing objects in a specific context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hunsaker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Van Cauter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>) and suggest that the LEC may encode the content of events with the environmental context in which they take place.</p><p>The selectivity of the LEC for the combination of sensory event and spatial/environmental context raises a question as to how strongly environmental context <italic>per se</italic> modulates cell firing in the LEC and how it compares to the modulation by more transient sensory events. We set out to address these points by recording the activity of LEC cells during six blocks of trace eyeblink conditioning, in which rats associated either auditory or visual conditioned stimulus with eyelid shock in two different conditioning environments. This paradigm was chosen because the acquisition and retrieval of memory are known to depend on the LEC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Morrissey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ryou et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tanninen et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">2015</xref>); thus, inferences could be made about the necessity of any observed activity patterns for behavior. The use of the transient, discrete sensory stimuli, rather than objects, allowed for precisely controlling the onset and offset of sensory events. We found that the LEC cells encode the conjunction of a sensory stimulus and an environment phasically during the stimulus presentations, while also differentiating between environments tonically based on the history of stimulus presentations in those environments, revealing that stimulus-environment conjunctions are coded in the LEC at multiple time scales.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Behavioral performance</title><p>We recorded activity from cells in the LEC while seven rats underwent six blocks of trace eyeblink conditioning which required the subjects to form an association between a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) and mild electric stimulation near the eyelid (US) over a 500 ms interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The conditioned responses (CRs) were monitored by recording electromyogram from the eyelid. To examine the selectivity of cell firing for stimulus modality and conditioning environment, three of these blocks (CS-US block) included the pairings of either auditory or visual CS and the US in one of two visually distinct conditioning boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To examine the cells’ selectivity for stimulus relationship, in the remaining three blocks (CS-alone block) the CS was presented by itself in the box. The CS presentations were separated with pseudorandom inter-trial intervals (ITI) ranging from 20 to 40 s. Each rat daily received six trial blocks in a fixed temporal sequence (an example pattern, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; patterns used for each rat, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), enabling the rats to acquire the temporal context predictive of what would happen in the present trial block. Consistent with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>), the rats gradually increased the expression of CRs in the CS-US paired trials but not CS-alone trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; Two-way repeated measures ANOVA, Session × Block, F<sub>75, 450</sub> = 2.99, p&lt;0.001). The asymptotic level of CR expression during the three CS-US blocks was significantly different from that during the three CS-alone blocks (follow-up one-way repeated measures ANOVA on CR% during the last session, F<sub>5, 30</sub> = 21.9, p&lt;0.001, planned pairwise comparisons, ps &lt; 0.05/6), but it was comparable between all three CS-US blocks (all ps &gt; 0.7). In addition, the increased frequency of eyeblink responses was not observed during the ITIs of any of six trial blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; Session × Block interaction, F<sub>70, 420</sub> = 8.48, p=0.717), suggesting that the eyeblink responses were conditioned to the CS, but not to the conditioning environment (see also, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). In the last session, the frequency of CR expression changed upon the transition from the CS-alone to the CS-US block within the first ten trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), suggesting that blocks of CS-alone trials did not simply extinguish associations acquired on previous days, rather they formed a distinct temporal context between earlier and later trials. On a trial-by-trial basis, all except one rat responded correctly on the first trial of two blocks in which the change in stimulus contingency was signaled by the change in the conditioning environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, the performance of Rat 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, the performance of four rats that underwent the trial blocks in the same temporal order). In contrast, when the stimulus contingency was changed in the same environment, the rats gradually adjusted the frequency of CR expression over ten CS-US paired trials, suggesting that the presence of the US served as a cue for the block transition. Thus, the rats formed three associative memories that shared a common, relational feature (the CS-US association) but differed in a discrete, physical feature (the sensory modality of the CS) or environmental context (Box 1 or 2). They also learned to use the change in conditioning environment and the presence of the US to rapidly infer whether the CS would be paired with the US in the current block.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28611.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rats acquired three associative memories with different stimulus and environmental features.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) In trace eyeblink conditioning, animals associated a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) with electrical shock near the eyelid (US) over a temporal gap (500 ms). With repeated pairings, rats developed anticipatory blinking responses before US onset (CRs), which were monitored by recording electromyogram (EMG) from the upper eyelid (a.u., arbitrary unit).

(<bold>C</bold>) Rats first entered Box 1 and received an auditory stimulus (ACS) alone for 20 trials (CS-alone block), followed by 50 ACS-US pairings (CS-US block). They then moved to Box 2, where they received 20 ACS alone trials followed by 50 ACS-US paired trials. Finally, they returned to Box 1 and received a visual stimulus (VCS) alone for 20 trials followed by pairings of the VCS and US for 50 trials.

The classification accuracy for the stimulus modality was higher than that for the conditioning environment during the ITI (p=0.002), but not the trial period (p=0.693).</p><p>Collectively, the analyses with two independent measures of ensemble selectivity suggest that LEC formed ensemble codes that differentiated the six trial blocks not only during the trials but also during extended intervals between the trials.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Tonic ensemble code prospectively signaled stimulus-environment conjunctions</title><p>Ensemble firing during ITIs maintained high selectivity for the modality of the CS and the CS-US relationship even though the CS had been terminated tens of seconds before. It is therefore possible that the LEC prospectively signals which CS will be subsequently presented, by recovering the stimulus-environment associations learned through past experiences. Alternatively, the LEC may retrospectively hold information about which CS had been presented several seconds ago. To differentiate these possibilities, we examined the degree to which ITI ensemble firing changed upon the transition from one trial block to the next. This analysis was applied to 139 cells recorded from four rats which underwent six trial blocks in the same temporal sequence (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). A state vector (firing rates of 139 cells) for an ITI (template) was compared against the vectors for the other ITIs using Pearson correlation coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Ensemble firing in an ITI was similar to those in the other ITIs within the same trial block, though the similarity appeared to monotonically decrease across ITIs within each trial block. In contrast to the gradual changes, ensemble firing showed an abrupt transition after the shift from the ACS-US block in Box 1 to the ACS-alone block in Box 2, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, template = the 70th trial) as well as the shift from the ACS-US block in Box 2 to the VCS alone block in Box 1 (template = the 140th trial). These block shifts involving the move from one box to the other resulted in a greater change in the ensemble firing (measured by a ‘Similarity Score’, 1- no change, 0-uncorrelated) than their spontaneous change within each block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, n = 20 runs with randomly sampled 100 neurons; t-test with Bonferroni corrections, ps &lt;0.001). Notably, the block shift involving the change in CS modality and conditioning environment induced a greater change in ensemble firing than the block shift involving the environmental change alone (p&lt;0.001). This difference was apparent during the last five recording sessions, but not during the first five recording sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Linear regression analyses showed that over nine blocks of five sessions, the degree of ensemble transition upon the block shift with the environmental and modality change was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.944, p&lt;0.001) while the degree of transition upon the block shift with the environmental change alone was decreased (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.508, p=0.031).<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28611.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>LEC ensemble activity showed an abrupt transition upon the shift of trial block involving changes in the conditioning environment and the stimulus modality.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A matrix of state vector (SV) correlation in which the element <italic>r</italic><sub>ij</sub> represents the correlation coefficient between the SV computed during a 9 s interval (ITI) before the ith and jth CS presentation.

We show here that cells in the LEC signaled this event-environment conjunction not only during events (‘phasic’ coding) but also stably during extended periods between those events (‘tonic’ coding). The analyses of both single neurons and ensembles of neurons in the LEC revealed a highly selective code for conditioning epochs that were defined by both static, environmental features and associated transient stimuli. Selectivity was observed not only when stimuli were being presented but also, with comparable strength, during intervals between stimulus presentations. These results suggest that the LEC may signal not only what is happening but also what had happened previously in an environment.</p><p>The identification of phasic and tonic codes was possible due to the types of stimuli that were used. Temporally precise, transient stimuli offered methodological advantages for discriminating between stimulus-evoked and stimulus-independent responses, thereby overcoming a limitation of many previous investigations which used physical objects to characterize neuron activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Deshmukh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Keene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>). In the present data set, ~45% of cells responded to the CS, which falls within the range of selective cells for unimodal sensory stimuli (47–90%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Leitner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Xu and Wilson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Young et al., 1997</xref>) but higher than that of cells selective for object location (~30%, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>). Some of these cells differentially responded to the CS depending on whether the CS was predictive of a US. Notably, these cells were also selective for the modality of the CS and environment in which the CS was presented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This conjunctive selectivity results in a clear separation of neural responses to the CS across six trial blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that the cells carry both behaviorally relevant and incidental information about the CS. In contrast to the strong selectivity for the stimulus and environmental features of the task, almost no cells in the LEC differentiated firing patterns depending on CR expression on a trial by trial basis. This finding suggests that the LEC may not be involved in the generation of CRs per se. Rather the LEC may play a role in differentiating the CS depending on the current situation.</p><p>In parallel with stimulus-responsive cells, nearly all cells exhibited high selectivity for specific trial blocks by drastically discriminating between trial blocks during the non-stimulus periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Ensembles were strongly selective for the trial blocks that used visual compared with auditory CS, yet only about half of these cells changed firing rates at the time of CS presentations and maintained stable firing patterns throughout the entire period of a trial block. Notably, virtually none of these cells were purely selective for the conditioning environment (independently from the stimulus features), suggesting that they did not simply respond to perceivable differences between two conditioning boxes, such as patterns of the wall and lighting (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Lu et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, given the absence of a significant difference in spontaneous eyeblink activity across six trial blocks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), differential firing rates were not reflective of variations of activity level across blocks. Therefore, a plausible interpretation would be that these cells encode the conditioning environment with the history of sensory events that took place in that environment.</p><p>The hypothesis that differential activity patterns between task epochs were driven by past events in those same contexts is consistent with prior observations of neural activity patterns in the LEC. In particular, prior experience with an object can later evoke selective firing patterns in the LEC even after that object has been removed: an ‘object-trace’ code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>). In these earlier studies, object-trace selectivity was observed in ~15% of LEC cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>), while the present results showed that virtually all cells in the LEC differentiated sensory stimuli that had been experienced tens of seconds or longer in the past. This difference may be in part because our criteria for significance were based on the averaged firing rate across 9 s periods before CS presentations. This long time window serves as a kind of a ‘low-pass-filter’ that cancels out variations in spike timing across trials. In fact, the proportion of selective cells dropped down to ~50% when shorter bin sizes were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Another critical difference between our study and previous studies is the number of times stimuli were presented. Over about two weeks, the rats of the present study repeatedly underwent the same temporal structure of the trial blocks, each of which included seventy presentations of the CS. The total number of repeated stimulus presentations, therefore, is far greater than the repetition of object presentations used in the previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tsao et al., 2013</xref>). This task design could have facilitated the development of an internal model of the stimulus, which may be reflected in the high proportion of cells that maintain the selectivity during the stimulus-free periods.</p><p>The strong selectivity for the combination of sensory and environmental features unique to each trial block was also observed at the ensemble level during both the stimulus and stimulus-free periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Notably, changes in ensemble activity during stimulus-free periods were tightly coupled with the shift of trial blocks with the change in the conditioning environment. When rats moved from one conditioning box to the other, ensemble activity showed abrupt transition <italic>before</italic> the first presentation of the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). Initially, the degree of ensemble transition was comparable regardless of whether the rats were to receive the different or same modality of the CS from/as the one in the previous block. Over two weeks, however, it became greater for the block shift with the different CS than the one with the same CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). This observation suggests that the LEC keeps track of what had happened in a given environment in the past and prospectively signals the information when the rat enters the environment next time. One may argue that LEC ensemble activity differentiated the trial blocks because of their temporal separation, rather than their difference in the stimulus and environmental features. In support of this view, some cells in the cortex change their responses to a sensory stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Fahy et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Riches et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>) or environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Takehara-Nishiuchi et al., 2013</xref>) over repetitive presentations of the stimulus, suggesting that they may keep track of the temporal order or repetition of experiences. In fact, within each trial block, the similarity of ensemble firing between stimulus-free periods decreased with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This time-dependent change in the ensemble activity, however, was substantially smaller than the changes upon the shift of two trial blocks in the different environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), suggesting that time alone is not sufficient to account for the observed across-block changes in ensemble firing. Comparing the relative impact of time, environment, and past experiences on the LEC activity requires future studies which monitor the change of LEC ensemble activity while controlling the temporal order of experiences with and without changes in the environment or sensory events.</p><p>To disentangle the coding properties of the LEC that resulted in trial block selectivity, our correlation analysis compared a relative difference in the selectivity for three features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In general, ensemble selectivity was higher for stimulus modality (auditory vs. visual CS) compared with conditioning environment (Box 1 vs. 2). This observation could be considered alongside previous observations that LEC ensembles show greater selectivity for object identity compared with object location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Keene et al., 2016</xref>) and suggests that the physical features of sensory events have a strong influence on the neuron activity in the LEC. In parallel the selectivity of LEC ensembles was weaker for stimulus relationship (CS-US paired vs. CS alone) than stimulus modality. In our paradigm, stimulus relationship was a critical factor for adaptive behavior while stimulus modality and conditioning environment were not. The stronger selectivity for behaviorally irrelevant over relevant features sharply contrasts with the opposite selectivity observed in neuron ensembles in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) during the same behavioral paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). These findings indicate a difference in information organization between the two regions, the LEC being more sensitive to incidental details of experiences and the mPFC being more sensitive to their behaviorally relevant features. The difference in feature selectivity may underlie the complementary roles that the hippocampal system and prefrontal cortex play for memory formation, consolidation, and assimilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Memories of daily experiences are thought to reside in a hippocampal-rhinal-neocortical network within which information becomes increasingly well integrated as it flows from the neocortical associative areas to the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Squire, 1992</xref>). The presently observed selectivity of LEC cells suggests that the perceivable and relational information of experiences has already been highly integrated at the level of the LEC, even to a comparable level that was reported in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Komorowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Leutgeb et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Moita et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wood et al., 1999</xref>). The LEC, therefore, may not differ from the other regions regarding the level of information integration, but it may make a unique contribution to memory formation and retrieval by stably maintaining the highly integrated information throughout the experience. Such representations may serve as a scaffold in which efferent regions, such as the hippocampus, embed temporal dynamics of events within an experience, thereby facilitating accurately encoding the content of each experience. They also play a role in the retrieval of appropriate information based on the similarity between a present situation and situations encountered in the past.</p><p>In summary, the present findings support an emerging view that all regions within the hippocampal system encode the highly integrated information of sensory and environmental features of an experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Keene et al., 2016</xref>). The LEC may be unique in that it signals the information not only during specific events but also stably throughout the experience. This coding property may support the LEC’s involvement in the accurate binding of physical, relational, and contextual features of everyday experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Eichenbaum, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Morrissey and Takehara-Nishiuchi, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Squire, 1992</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All surgical and experimental procedures were approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Toronto.

A 3D-printed plastic base housed twelve individually movable tetrodes, two reference electrodes, and an electrode interface board (EIB-54-Kopf, Neuralynx, Bozeman, MT, USA). Tetrodes were made by folding in four and twisting a 36 cm wire (12 µm polyimide coated nichrome wire, Sandvik, Stockholm, Sweden). Each tetrode was connected to the plastic base with a shuttle containing a custom-made screw which allowed a precise control of the tetrode movement. From the top, individual tetrode wires were connected to the interface board with gold pins. From the bottom, the electrode tips were cut, and gold plated to reduce impedance to 200–250 kΩ. At the base, the tetrodes were arranged in a bundle with a honeycomb pattern, with the total area of the bundle not exceeding 1.2 × 1.2 mm.</p><p>During the surgery, the base of the drive with all tetrodes retracted was positioned at the surface of the brain in the right hemisphere (6.5 mm posterior, 5.3 mm lateral from Bregma at a 5° lateral angle) secured to the skull with a self-adhesive resin cement. During the surgery, tetrodes were lowered either 3 mm (rats 1–4) or 5–7 mm (rats 5–7). The reference electrodes were placed at the white matter tracts between the entorhinal cortex and the ventral hippocampus. Four stainless steel wires, two for delivering stimulation and two for recording electromyographic (EMG) activity, were implanted in the muscle of the left, upper eyelid and connected to the interface board. Two screws serving as a ground were placed in the skull above the cerebellum and the parietal cortex.</p><p>Across 7–10 days following the surgery, the rats were daily connected to the recording system to monitor the signal while tetrodes were gradually lowered to the lateral entorhinal cortex (LEC). The conditioning began at least seven days after the surgery. After each conditioning session, the tetrodes were lowered 30–65 µm to record different cells every day. Therefore, all cells were recorded only in one session. To allow for tetrodes to stabilize after each new placement and to avoid a potential electrode drift during the recording, the following recording session was conducted at least 20 hr after the electrode adjustment.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Experimental apparatus and behavioral paradigm</title><p>Experimental apparatus consisted of two 20 × 20 × 70 cm boxes, connected with a 21.5 × 10 × 70 cm walkway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

The CS was either 85 dB, 2.5 kHz pure tone (ACS, Multipurpose Sound Generator ENV-230, Med Associate Inc., St. Albans, VT, USA) or a white LED light pulsed at 50 Hz (VCS). The US was a mild electric stimulus applied near the left upper eyelid (a 100 Hz square pulse at 0.3–2.0 mA), generated by a stimulus isolator (ISO-Flex, A.M.P.I., Jerusalem, Israel). Seven rats received six blocks of this conditioning, each of which included one of two CS and took place in one of two visually distinct rooms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) in a fixed temporal sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For example, a rat was first placed in one of the rooms (Box 1) and presented with the ACS alone for 20 times, followed by 50 pairings of the ACS and US. The rat was then gently forced to walk over to the other room (Box 2) and received 20 presentations of ACS alone followed by 50 ACS-US pairings. Finally, the rat was forced to walk back to the original room and received 20 presentations of visual CS (VCS) alone followed by 50 pairings of VCS and US.

The instantaneous amplitude of the EMG signal was calculated as the absolute value of the Hilbert transform of the EMG signal. Then, two values were calculated in each trial: (1) the averaged amplitude of EMG signals during a 200 ms period before CS onset (pre-CS) and (2) the averaged amplitude during a 200 ms period before US onset or the corresponding interval in the CS-alone trials (CR value). A threshold was defined as the average of all pre-CS values plus one standard deviation. If the pre-CS value was greater than 130% of the Threshold in a trial, the trial was discarded due to the hyperactivity of a rat immediately before the CS presentation. If the pre-CS value was below the Threshold and CR-value was greater than 110% of the Threshold, the trial was considered to have a CR. Finally, in the case when the pre-CS value was between the Threshold and 130% of the Threshold, the trial was considered to have a CR only if the CR value above the Threshold was five times greater than the pre-CS value above the Threshold. CR% was calculated as a ratio of the number of trials containing the CR to the total number of valid trials (<italic>i.e.</italic>, total trials minus hyperactive trials). To examine whether eyeblink frequency that was not time-locked to the CS presentations increased with the conditioning, we applied the same analysis to EMG signals 480–280 ms before CS onset (pre-CR%).

The significance was tested by random permutation tests which examined whether the observed firing rate difference fell within the 5% upper tail of the distribution of chance firing difference estimated by randomly assigning each firing rate to either the trial or the pre-CS period (1000 re-assignments).</p><p>Subsequently, the selectivity of firing rates for three task variables was quantified as a Differential Index, which compared mean firing rates between two conditions:</p><p>Differential Index = (Fr1 – Fr2) / (Fr1 + Fr2)</p><p>where Fr1 and Fr2 are averaged firing rates across trials in two conditions. To test the selectivity of CS-evoked firing rates, firing rates during the 600 ms period from CS onset to US onset were used. To examine the selectivity of firing rates during intervals between trials, firing rates during the 9 s period before CS onset (ITI) were used. Because the duration of intervals between the trials ranged from 20 to 40 s, the ITI period started at least 11 s after US offset. This 9 s period was chosen to avoid any contamination of lasting firing rate changes that continued for a few seconds after US offset. For the selectivity for stimulus relationship, Fr1 was the mean firing rate during CS-alone trials, and Fr2 was the mean firing rate during the corresponding CS-US paired trials with the same CS and in the same conditioning environment. For the selectivity for stimulus modality, Fr1 was the mean firing rate during trials with the auditory CS in Box 1, and Fr2 was the mean firing rate during trials with the visual CS in Box 1. For the selectivity for the conditioning environment, Fr1 was the mean firing rate during trials with the auditory CS in Box 1, and Fr2 was the mean firing rate during trials with the auditory CS in Box 2. Raw differential indices were converted to absolute values. Then, in each cell the differential index at chance was estimated as 5% upper tail of its corresponding distribution of differential indices with shuffled trial labels (random permutation test, 1000 shuffles, α = 0.05), and this value was subtracted from the value with the real trial label. A cell was judged as selective for a task variable if the shuffle-corrected differential index was greater than zero.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Firing rate stability</title><p>During the 9 s ITI period, firing rates of each cell were binned into fifteen 600 ms bins and averaged across all trials in each of six trial blocks. The averaged, binned firing rates were divided by their sum, resulting in a distribution of firing rates across the bins. Kullback-Leibler divergence (<italic>D</italic><sub>KL</sub>) between this distribution (P) and a uniform distribution (Q) was calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:munder><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:munder><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>Q</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>As a measure for the within-block variation of firing rates, <italic>D</italic><sub>KL</sub> was calculated across 15 bins in each of six trial blocks.

To match the number of two types of trials, 20 trials were randomly sampled from each trial type. The Differential index was calculated with FR1 as firing rates during the CR trials and FRs as firing rates during the non-CR trials. The significance of the selectivity was determined by random permutation tests as shown in ‘Single unit selectivity.’</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>State vector analysis</title><p>To compare the selectivity of population firing patterns during trials for three task variables, we first constructed firing rate vectors that consisted of binned firing rates of all cells (state vectors) in each trial (CS + subsequent CS-US interval, 600 ms). In each block, ten state vectors were randomly selected and averaged, resulting in one state vector for each of six trial blocks. The firing rate of each cell in the state vectors was divided by its own maximum across the six blocks. We then calculated Pearson correlation coefficient (r) between the state vectors in two trial blocks with the ACS and VCS in the Box 1 (Modality, ACS alone vs. VCS alone, ACS-US vs. VCS-US), two blocks with the ACS in the Box 1 and 2 (Environment, ACS alone in Box 1 vs. ACS alone in Box 2, ACS-US in Box 1 vs. ACS-US in Box 2), or two blocks of ACS-alone trials and ACS-US paired trials in the Box 1 (Relationship, ACS alone vs. ACS-US, VCS alone vs. VCS-US). As controls, we calculated r values of state vectors between odd- and even-numbered trials within the same trial block (ACS-US paired in Box 1, VCS-US paired in Box 1, an estimate of the highest r value) and pairs of trials without any overlapping task variable (ACS alone in Box 2 vs. VCS-US paired in Box 1, ACS-US paired in Box 2 vs. VCS alone in Box 1; an estimate of the lowest r value). We repeated these steps for twenty times, which generated 40 r values (2 pairs of trial blocks × 20 repeats) for each comparison. The same analysis was applied to firing rates during 600 ms bins randomly selected from 9 s periods before the CS onset (ITI period). The difference in the r values across these comparison types was quantified with a one-way ANOVA with posthoc comparison with Tukey HSD.</p><p>To examine how the ensemble activity changed upon the transition from one trial block to the next, we selected 139 cells recorded from four rats which underwent the trial blocks in the same temporal order (Rats 1, 2, 3, 7, see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We first randomly selected 100 cells out of 139 cells and constructed a state vector for each inter-trial interval (a 9 s period before CS onset). The firing rate of each cell in the state vectors was divided by its own maximum across all ITIs. Pearson correlation coefficient (r) was calculated for each state vector (template) with all other state vectors. This generated a 210 × 210 matrix of r values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The change in the state vectors after the block shift was quantified with the averaged r values of the last trial in a trial block with the first 19 trials in the following block (Between-block Similarity Score). The change in the state vectors within a trial block was measured as the averaged r values of the last trial in a trial block and the 19 preceding trials (1st–19th CS-alone trials or the 31st to 49th CS-US trials) in the same block (Within-block Similarity Score). These steps were repeated for twenty times each of which used 100 randomly subsampled cells. The t-test with Bonferroni corrections was used to compare between the Between- and Within-block Similarity Scores in each comparison type or the Between-block Similarity Scores between the comparison types.</p><p>To examine how the degree of ensemble transition changed over about two weeks of recording sessions, 139 cells were sorted based on the session on which they were recorded. We then repeated the above-mentioned analysis on a series of 49 cells taken from the sorted 139 cells with an increment of 10 cells. This roughly corresponded to examining ensemble firing in a block of five sessions with an increment of one session. The Between-block Similarity Score was subtracted from the Within-block Similarity Score. Linear regression analyses were used to test whether the value changed over the session blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Population decoding analysis</title><p>As a secondary measure of ensemble selectivity, we used a machine learning algorithm, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cortes and Vapnik, 1995</xref>). The decoding accuracy of the classifier represented a degree to which ensemble firing patterns differentiated three task variables and their combination. The procedure was similar to that used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). SVM classification was performed in MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) with the algorithms from the open source LIBSVM library (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chang and Lin, 2011</xref>). The SVM classifier constructs a model based on a set of attributes from the training data and then predicts the target values based on the test data attributes. In the present study, the attributes were normalized firing rates of a neuron population in a trial from one of the six trial blocks. The target values were the identities of the sampled trials.</p><p>Each run of SVM analysis used a set of 200 randomly subsampled cells (total 20 runs). Population firing rate vectors were constructed by concatenating the responses of these cells during a 600-ms period from CS onset to US onset (trial) or a 600-ms period randomly selected from a 9 s period before the CS onset (ITI) in a trial from one of six trial types. In each cell, the firing rate in each trial was divided by the maximum firing rate of the cell among all trials. Note that the cells were recorded in separate sessions from seven rats, and thus we ignored any correlated activity between cells. The classifier constructed a model with the Gaussian radial basis function kernels. To maximize the classification accuracy, two SVM parameters, cost and gamma, were identified by performing a grid search over a range of values, using the firing rates from all available trials for a given target value. Then, a new population firing rate matrix was generated from firing rates during twenty trials of each of six trial blocks. These trials were randomly drawn, without replacement, from all trials in a given trial block. Then, in each cell, the firing rate in each trial was divided by the maximum firing rate of the cell among the 120 trials (20 trials × 6 blocks). Half of the trials (10 trials from each block) were then used to train the SVM classifier with the parameters selected by the grid search. The remaining trials (10 trials from each block) were then used to test the decoding accuracy after training. The process was repeated 20 times using a different sampling of 60 training and 60 test trials each time. The accuracy was defined as a proportion of correct predictions out of 1200 tests (60 test trials × 20 sets of randomly selected trials). To quantify the selectivity for one of three trial variables, the SVM classification was performed after collapsing six trial types into two trial types (for the modality feature, trials with the auditory CS and visual CS; for the environmental feature, trials in Box 1 and Box 2; for the relationship feature, CS-alone and CS-US paired trials). Classification accuracy was compared between three task features with t-test with Bonferroni corrections.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NSERC Discovery Grant, CIHR Operating Grant, Ontario Research Fund Early Researcher Awards, CFI Leaders Opportunity Fund (KT), NSERC graduate fellowship (MP).

In the task, the have an auditory and a visual cue, each of which predicts shock in a different context or box, and they alternate blocks of trials in which shock is given with blocks in which it is not. They report that LEC neurons exhibit both phasic and tonic firing, correlated with multiplexed information about the cues, their significance in different contexts and different trial blocks. Particularly remarkable, tonic activity reflected activity about the current block/context between trials, and this activity seemed to reflect a fairly precise internal model of the time or duration of the current block, inasmuch as it seemed to reflect the start of new blocks in the current context, which would otherwise be unsignaled.</p><p>I think the paper is generally sound and the results are quite novel and interesting. I have no major concerns from my reading and generally agree with the comments of the other reviewers. In particular, I think the authors should clarify whether firing changes really do precede the first trial of a new block in the same context or whether they are cued by the first shock or shock omission. I also think showing whether or not there is a relationship to behavior would be a good addition. Clarifying the other analysis issues would be important. In this area, I am particularly interested in the question raised about the decoding and why it is expressed as fractional performance rather than a raw percentage and the question of whether the tonic and phasic description is really a dichotomy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, Pilkiw and colleagues describe recordings made in the lateral entrorhinal cortex (LEC) as rats experienced a multi-block fear conditioning paradigm previously shown to depend of LEC function. The authors report that during cue presentation, neurons in LEC show complex patterns of mixed selectivity, encoding features of the task blocks (context, current meaning of the CS, modality of the CS) in a combinatorial way. Interestingly, the authors also demonstrate that information about the task's features was represented during the inter-trial interval by a separate population of neurons. The authors further show that the distinct representations of trial blocks they identify are not merely the result of a slow drift in ensemble representations over the course of a session, but rather that at least certain types of block transitions elicit step-like jumps in ensemble representations.</p><p>These data are an interesting and potentially valuable contribution to the literature. Attempts to understand entorhinal/hippocampal function in tasks that are not entirely and explicitly spatial are always welcome, and this paradigm is particularly interesting because of the rich temporal structure the blocked design creates; this allows the authors to investigate LEC encoding of both overtly-signaled aspects of the task (e.g. transitions between contexts) and more subtle features that require animals to track simultaneously multiple aspects of the task (e.g. whether the CS predicts shock, which depends on context, CS modality, and the temporal order of blocks). The analyses presented here are sophisticated, detailed, and generally sound, and the authors complement traditional single unit analyses with more modern, decoding-based approaches to identify what information is being represented by the population of neurons they recorded.</p><p>I have a few major questions that, if addressed, I think would strengthen the manuscript further.</p><p>1) The authors argue that animals learn the temporal structure of the task (i.e. whether the CS will be followed by the US in the particular block of trials). Is there any evidence of this specifically? When the block transition involves a change between the two contexts, rats clearly have overt evidence that there has been a change in block. However, is there specific evidence that they know before the first trial was completed whether or not they'd be shocked after the CS? Certainly once a shock does or does not arrive the identity of the block would be clear. But observing the context change as evidence of a new block and then waiting to see whether or not the CS in the current block is paired with shock is different than learning the temporal sequence of &quot;shock present&quot; and &quot;shock absent&quot; blocks.</p><p>This question is particularly interesting for block transitions that did not involve a change in context. In this case, if I understand the design correctly, there is no overt evidence whatsoever that a change in block has occurred. The first observable evidence that they're in a new block would be a change in whether the CS was or was not followed by the US. So, if rats did in fact learn the temporal structure of the task (and weren't using shock presence/absence to determine block identity), for block transitions that did not involve a change in context they would need to somehow time the length of blocks to estimate when transitions had occurred. Over the timescale of blocks on this task, that seems somewhat hard to imagine.</p><p>This also relates to the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> regarding transitions between neural representations of trial blocks. In the text of the manuscript the authors claim that ensemble transitions occur before the first CS presentation in a new block. Again, this is easy to understand in the case that animals moved to a new context for the block transition in question, but is it also true of transitions that did not involve a change in context? If pre-CS transitions in ensemble representations only occur when block switches involve a change in context, can it really be said that animals &quot;prospectively&quot; anticipated which block would be next?</p><p>To be clear, I'm not sure this issue substantially impacts the novelty or importance of the work here. Neural representations clearly differentiate task blocks and show step like changes across at least some block transitions; whether these representations are based on a fully-internal, learned model of how the task works, or whether they are prompted by the confirmatory presence/absence of shocks, I think the result is clear and interesting. But more clarity on precisely what is being claimed here would be appreciated.</p><p>2) The decoding results are a bit confusing to me. Why is classification accuracy presented as a fractional value of decoding performance on the shuffled data set rather than the raw percentage of trials correctly classified? I found this somewhat unintuitive. Does classification based on shuffled data not fall to the theoretical chance level? If not, does this suggest some bias has crept into the classifier somewhere?</p><p>Similarly, classification accuracy for &quot;relationship&quot; falls substantially below classification accuracy for shuffled data. How can performance on the actual data be worse than data where shuffling has removed all information about the actual trial identity?</p><p>3) The authors begin their analyses by dividing neurons into those that had a significant change in firing rate during the CS period and those that did not, and go on to conclude that the two classes of neurons form phasic and tonic codes related to the task. Is it clear, however, whether neurons with phasic responses did not also contribute to task representations during the ITI? Similarly, is it clear that the tonic neurons represented information homogeneously across the entire ITI? Perhaps some of the &quot;tonic&quot; responses were actually phasic and time-locked to the CS or US with a lag, such that their peak firing response occurred during the ITI. For instance, a hypothetical neuron might have reliably fired a burst of spikes 0.5 seconds after the offset of the US; while this response may have been perfectly phasic, it would have fallen during the ITI, and thus been counted as &quot;tonic&quot; activity. Because firing rates for the tonic neurons were computed over the full duration of the ITI (so far as I can tell), phasic responses like this hypothetical example could drive differences in the average ITI firing rate.</p><p>I grant that the example neurons the authors present do indeed look pretty &quot;tonic&quot;, but it would be interesting to know whether the information the authors can decode during the ITI is truly homogenous across time at a single cell level, or is instead homogeneous across time at a population decoding level, but supported by transient, phasic activations of single neurons.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript of Pilkiw et al. describes an experiment designed to characterize how neuronal responses in the lateral entorhinal cortex are modulated by sensory and contextual stimuli. The authors build on previous work from their group demonstrating activity in the LEC is required for the acquisition and expression of trace eyeblink conditioning, as well as their characterization of PFC neuronal activity during a very similar behavior. Here they design a clever protocol that interleaves multiple sensory stimuli and contexts to specifically examine how events and environments are associated in the LEC. Overall I find the experiment to be well designed and described and the analyses to support the informative and timely conclusions of the paper. I have a few suggestions and clarifications outlined below:</p><p>1) The authors suggest behavioral data establishes a framework in which the observed physiological activity can be interpreted as necessary for the behavior. While I do not disagree, it raises the issue of the correlation of the activity with the rat's behavior on a trial by trial basis. Given the rats only exhibit the CR on roughly 50% of the trials does a comparison of the activity of the various population (phasic/tonic; R/E/M?) of neurons during response/no response trials reveal the relative importance of one type of LEC coding in the rats behavioral output? I realize this is a bit off-topic for the main thrust of this study, it seems like an interesting analyses of these robust data.</p><p>2) The authors interpret the tonic activity related to context reflects the animals' experience in the task. Unlike in their PFC recording paper earlier this year, it appears in the current study recording made during both learning and post-learning periods were pooled. Was this indeed the case? If so, how does that impact the interpretation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> which is memory-driven predictive code?</p><p>3) Given previous LEC recording studies (Tsao et al., Deshmukh et al), albeit in a different task, it was a bit surprising to me that virtually every single recorded neuron here was responsive, either to the CS or tonically. The authors should address this discrepancy in the Discussion.</p><p>4) In the Materials and methods the authors describe the &quot;Differential Index&quot; as the absolute value of (FR1-FR2)/(FR1+FR2), thus running on a scale from 0 to 1. However in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref> they plot the values on a -1 to 1 scale. While I understand the value in this, it should be clarified in the Materials and methods.</p><p>5) A simple table describing the number of units recorded per rat and number of sessions per animal would be useful.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28611.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Reviewers agreed that the work was sound and the results are quite novel and interesting.

To make these points clear, we edited the paragraph on this result in Results (subsection “Tonic ensemble code prospectively signaled stimulus-environment conjunctions”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>I also think showing whether or not there is a relationship to behavior would be a good addition.</italic> </p><p>We examined whether individual cells differentiated firing patterns between trials in which rats expressed conditioned responses (CR trials) and those in which they did not (non-CR trials). The proportion of cells that differentiated two trial types was at or below the cut-off for significance, suggesting that firing patterns of individual cells were not strongly correlated with CR expression on a trial by trial basis. To make this point clear, we added a new paragraph in Results (subsection “Firing rates of individual cells were not correlated with CR expression on a trial by trial basis”) and Materials and methods (subsection “Correlation with CR expression”).</p><p><italic>Clarifying the other analysis issues would be important. In this area, I am particularly interested in the question raised about the decoding and why it is expressed as fractional performance rather than a raw percentage and the question of whether the tonic and phasic description is really a dichotomy.</italic> </p><p>In the original version of the manuscript, we reported classification accuracy above chance by subtracting the 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the chance distribution. If the value was greater than zero, classification accuracy with the real data was significantly better than chance. Because we realize that this value may not be intuitive, we revised the Results (subsection “LEC ensembles formed phasic and tonic codes that signaled physical stimulus features more strongly than environmental context”, second paragraph) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>To address the second point, we additionally performed and included a new analysis, which shows that both CS-responding and non-responding cells formed tonic selectivity for the event-environment conjunction.

Throughout the manuscript, we removed any sentence that implies that a different set of cells shows the phasic and tonic selectivity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] I have a few major questions that, if addressed, I think would strengthen the manuscript further.</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors argue that animals learn the temporal structure of the task (i.e. whether the CS will be followed by the US in the particular block of trials). Is there any evidence of this specifically? When the block transition involves a change between the two contexts, rats clearly have overt evidence that there has been a change in block. However, is there specific evidence that they know before the first trial was completed whether or not they'd be shocked after the CS? Certainly once a shock does or does not arrive the identity of the block would be clear. But observing the context change as evidence of a new block and then waiting to see whether or not the CS in the current block is paired with shock is different than learning the temporal sequence of &quot;shock present&quot; and &quot;shock absent&quot; blocks.</italic> </p><p><italic>This question is particularly interesting for block transitions that did not involve a change in context. In this case, if I understand the design correctly, there is no overt evidence whatsoever that a change in block has occurred. The first observable evidence that they're in a new block would be a change in whether the CS was or was not followed by the US. So, if rats did in fact learn the temporal structure of the task (and weren't using shock presence/absence to determine block identity), for block transitions that did not involve a change in context they would need to somehow time the length of blocks to estimate when transitions had occurred. Over the timescale of blocks on this task, that seems somewhat hard to imagine.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. When the block shift occurred within the same environment, they adjusted the frequency of CR expression over the first ten trials (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F, G</xref>). This pattern suggests that the rats likely used the first presentation/omission of the US as a cue to infer the change in stimulus contingency. In contrast, all except one rat were able to adjust the response immediately upon the block transition involving the environmental change, suggesting that the rats were able to use the change in the conditioning environment to infer whether the CS would be paired with the US or not. To make these points clear, we added two new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and modified the corresponding section in Results (subsection “Behavioral performance”).</p><p><italic>This also relates to the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> regarding transitions between neural representations of trial blocks. In the text of the manuscript the authors claim that ensemble transitions occur before the first CS presentation in a new block. Again, this is easy to understand in the case that animals moved to a new context for the block transition in question, but is it also true of transitions that did not involve a change in context? If pre-CS transitions in ensemble representations only occur when block switches involve a change in context, can it really be said that animals &quot;prospectively&quot; anticipated which block would be next?</italic> </p><p><italic>To be clear, I'm not sure this issue substantially impacts the novelty or importance of the work here. Neural representations clearly differentiate task blocks and show step like changes across at least some block transitions; whether these representations are based on a fully-internal, learned model of how the task works, or whether they are prompted by the confirmatory presence/absence of shocks, I think the result is clear and interesting. But more clarity on precisely what is being claimed here would be appreciated.</italic> </p><p>Ensemble firing patterns abruptly changed before the first presentation of the CS only in the block shift involving the change in the conditioning environment. Importantly, the degree of ensemble transition was greater in the block shift involving the change of the conditioning environment and CS modality than the shift involving the environmental change alone. This result suggests that the LEC ensembles prospectively signal the modality of the CS associated with the present environment before the first CS presentation. In the block shift involving the stimulus contingency change within the same environment, ensemble activity patterns gradually changed over ~ten trials. To make these points clear, we edited the corresponding paragraph in Results (subsection “Tonic ensemble code prospectively signaled stimulus-environment conjunctions”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) The decoding results are a bit confusing to me. Why is classification accuracy presented as a fractional value of decoding performance on the shuffled data set rather than the raw percentage of trials correctly classified? I found this somewhat unintuitive. Does classification based on shuffled data not fall to the theoretical chance level? If not, does this suggest some bias has crept into the classifier somewhere?</italic> </p><p>The distribution of classification accuracy with shuffled data peaks closely at the theoretical chance level, and its width allows for determining whether classification accuracy with the real data is significantly better than chance. In our original analysis, we used the 5% upper tail of the chance distribution as the cut-off for significance and subtract it from classification accuracy with the real data. Because we realize that this way of data presentation may not be intuitive, we revised the Results and the figure so that they report raw classification accuracy (subsection “LEC ensembles formed phasic and tonic codes that signaled physical stimulus features 201 more strongly than environmental context”, second paragraph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Similarly, classification accuracy for &quot;relationship&quot; falls substantially below classification accuracy for shuffled data. How can performance on the actual data be worse than data where shuffling has removed all information about the actual trial identity?</italic> </p><p>The threshold from the shuffled data is the 95th percentile line; thus, 95% of “chance” classifications will fall below this line. The significance of this when looking at the real data is, simply, that the classifier was unable to discriminate the relationship cues at a level that exceeded statistical significance. A “significantly worse than chance” discrimination would require the true data to fall below a different threshold, such as the 5<sup>th</sup> percentile mark, which was not observed.</p><p><italic>3) The authors begin their analyses by dividing neurons into those that had a significant change in firing rate during the CS period and those that did not, and go on to conclude that the two classes of neurons form phasic and tonic codes related to the task. Is it clear, however, whether neurons with phasic responses did not also contribute to task representations during the ITI?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point. We applied the same analysis on stimulus-free, ITI firing rates of CS-responding cells and found that the majority of them (96.5%) were selective for at least one of three task features. Therefore, the tonic and phasic codes were not opposing one-another: the phasic code was supported by a subset of the population supporting the tonic code. In other words, nearly all cells changed ITI firing rates depending on the trial blocks while only a subset of them additionally changed their firing rate patterns upon the stimulus presentations. To make these points clear, we have rewritten the section on the tonic firing pattern so that it reports the selectivity of ITI firing rates of both CS-responding and non-responding cells (subsection “Nearly all cells encoded environments with the history of sensory stimuli presented in those environments”, last paragraph). We have also updated <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> accordingly. Throughout the manuscript, we removed any sentence that implies that a different set of cells shows the phasic and tonic selectivity.</p><p><italic>Similarly, is it clear that the tonic neurons represented information homogeneously across the entire ITI? Perhaps some of the &quot;tonic&quot; responses were actually phasic and time-locked to the CS or US with a lag, such that their peak firing response occurred during the ITI. For instance, a hypothetical neuron might have reliably fired a burst of spikes 0.5 seconds after the offset of the US; while this response may have been perfectly phasic, it would have fallen during the ITI, and thus been counted as &quot;tonic&quot; activity. Because firing rates for the tonic neurons were computed over the full duration of the ITI (so far as I can tell), phasic responses like this hypothetical example could drive differences in the average ITI firing rate.</italic> </p><p><italic>I grant that the example neurons the authors present do indeed look pretty &quot;tonic&quot;, but it would be interesting to know whether the information the authors can decode during the ITI is truly homogenous across time at a single cell level, or is instead homogeneous across time at a population decoding level, but supported by transient, phasic activations of single neurons.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s question, two new analyses have been added to the manuscript. First, we quantified the fluctuation of firing rates during the ITI period by calculating Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) between a uniform distribution and fifteen 600-msec binned firing rates during the ITI period in a trial block (within-KLD). As a comparison, we also calculated KLD between a uniform distribution and the binned firing rate across six trial blocks (between-KLD). We found that in the majority of cells (96.4%) the within-KLD was smaller than the between-KLD (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A-C</xref>), suggesting smaller firing fluctuations across time bins in each trial block than across six blocks in each time bin. Second, we divided the ITI period into smaller bins (1/4 or 1/8 of the 9-sec period) and examined the selectivity of firing rates separately in each of these time bins. The proportion of selective cells decreased as the bin size became smaller (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), likely due to the reduced accuracy in firing rate estimation. Across the time bins, the proportion of each selectivity category was almost identical (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These results support our view that individual cells maintained the selective firing patterns stably throughout the ITI period. To make these points clear, we added a new paragraph in Results (subsection “Individual cells maintained selectivity for the combination of task features throughout the ITI period”) and Materials and methods (subsection “Firing rate stability”) along with one new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>As suggested by the reviewer, some cells indeed showed lasting firing rate changes after US offset for a few seconds. Because we defined the start of the ITI period minimum 10 seconds after US offset, these phasic, US-evoked firing rate changes did not affect our analysis. To make this point clear, we added several sentences in Materials and methods (subsection “Single-unit selectivity”, last paragraph).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] I have a few suggestions and clarifications outlined below:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors suggest behavioral data establishes a framework in which the observed physiological activity can be interpreted as necessary for the behavior. While I do not disagree, it raises the issue of the correlation of the activity with the rat's behavior on a trial by trial basis. Given the rats only exhibit the CR on roughly 50% of the trials does a comparison of the activity of the various population (phasic/tonic; R/E/M?) of neurons during response/no response trials reveal the relative importance of one type of LEC coding in the rats behavioral output? I realize this is a bit off-topic for the main thrust of this study, it seems like an interesting analyses of these robust data.</italic> </p><p>To address the reviewer’s point, we compared firing rates of individual cells between trials in which rats expressed conditioned responses (CR trials) and those in which they did not (non-CR trials). This analysis required us to match the number of two types of trials (20 trials minimum per trial type). Because ~1/4 of sessions met this criterion, we were only able to use 35-63 cells (the number varied across three CS-US trial blocks) for this analysis. Among these limited samples, the proportion of cells that differentiated two trial types was at or below the cut-off for significance, suggesting that firing patterns of individual cells were not correlated with CR expression on a trial by trial basis. To make this point clear, we added a new paragraph in Results (subsection “Firing rates of individual cells were not correlated with CR expression on a trial by trial basis”), Discussion (second paragraph), and Materials and methods (subsection “Correlation with CR expression”).</p><p><italic>2) The authors interpret the tonic activity related to context reflects the animals' experience in the task. Unlike in their PFC recording paper earlier this year, it appears in the current study recording made during both learning and post-learning periods were pooled. Was this indeed the case? If so, how does that impact the interpretation of the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> which is memory-driven predictive code?</italic> </p><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for inspiring closer examination into experience effects, as we believe this has strengthened the study. Our original manuscript did not analyze changes with learning phase for several reasons. First, in our previous study, learning and post-learning periods were determined by when CR% reached 60%. Because CR% of the rats in the current study only reached ~45% at the end of about two weeks of training, all sessions in the current study would fall under the “learning” stage category. Note that the lower performance in the current set of rats is likely because the ratio of CS-US trials relative to CS-alone trials was lower in the current design (5:2) compared with the previous design (4:1). Also, due to technical difficulty, we were able to record spike activity from the LEC only for ~16 days, which is about half of a total number of the recording sessions in our previous study.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s point, we performed an additional analysis that examined changes of ensemble activity over time or experience, rather than changes with learning per se. Sessions were divided into nine blocks of five sessions each, and the degree of ensemble transition was compared across the session blocks. Initially, the degree of ensemble transition was comparable between two types of the block shift involving the change in the conditioning environment. Over the course of two weeks, the degree of ensemble transition became greater upon the block shifts with the changes in both the environment and CS modality, but not the block shifts with the environmental change alone (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These results suggest that the LEC ensembles become capable of prospectively signaling the stimulus to be presented in a given environment only after repeated exposures to the fixed temporal sequence of trial blocks. We believe this result significantly strengthens our argument that the LEC develops the prospective code with experiences and thank the reviewer for raising this important point. The result of this analysis was added in Results (subsection “Tonic ensemble code prospectively signaled stimulus-environment conjunctions”) and Materials and methods (subsection “State Vector Analysis”, last paragraph), along with two new figures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Given previous LEC recording studies (Tsao et al., Deshmukh et al), albeit in a different task, it was a bit surprising to me that virtually every single recorded neuron here was responsive, either to the CS or tonically. The authors should address this discrepancy in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important point of discussion. The proportion of CS-responding cells (~45%) falls in the range of selective cells for unimodal sensory stimuli (47-90%, Leitner et al., 2016; Suzuki et al., 1997; Xu and Wilson, 2012; Young et al., 1997) but higher than that of cells selective for object location (~30%, Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011; Tsao et al., 2013). In parallel, nearly all cells in the LEC showed the selectivity for the CS that were presented tens of seconds ago, which was much higher than cells selective for locations at which an object was placed in the past (~15%; Tsao et al., 2013). This difference may be in part because our criteria for the significant selectivity were based on the averaged firing rate across 9-sec period within the ITI. This long period allows for accurately estimating firing rates by effectively canceling out fluctuations of spike timing across trials. Another reason may be that the total number of repeated CS presentations was far greater than the repetition of object presentations in the previous studies (Deshmukh and Knierim, 2011; Tsao et al., 2013). This task design would facilitate the development of an internal model of the CS, which may be reflected in the high proportion of cells that maintained the selectivity during the stimulus-free periods. To make these points clear, the new section has been added to Discussion (second and fourth paragraphs).</p><p><italic>4) In the Materials and methods the authors describe the &quot;Differential Index&quot; as the absolute value of (FR1-FR2)/(FR1+FR2), thus running on a scale from 0 to 1. However in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref> they plot the values on a -1 to 1 scale. While I understand the value in this, it should be clarified in the Materials and methods.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the careful review. To test the significance of Differential Index (DI), in each cell, we conducted a random permutation test based on the distribution of DI at chance. The 95<sup>th</sup> percentile of the chance distribution was subtracted from raw DI, resulting in a “shuffle-corrected” DI that became positive if the DI was significantly different from the chance. To make this point clear, we edited the section in Materials and methods (subsection “Single-unit selectivity”, last paragraph) and renamed the x label of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) A simple table describing the number of units recorded per rat and number of sessions per animal would be useful.</italic> </p><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we added a new table (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl4">Table 4</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
