Mutations that cause heterozygous deletion or dysfunction of the human gene <italic>Syngap1</italic> cause a severe form of intellectual disability (synGAP haploinsufficiency, also called Mental Retardation type 5 [MRD5]) often accompanied by autism and/or seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hamdan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Hamdan et al., 2009</xref>). In mice, heterozygous deletion of the gene <italic>Syngap1</italic> causes similar neurological deficits; homozygous deletion causes death a few days after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Komiyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>One function of synGAP is to regulate the balance of active Ras and Rap at the postsynaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>), thereby controlling the balance of exocytosis and endocytosis of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>) and contributing to regulation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Tolias et al., 2005</xref>). In a recent paper in eLife (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>), we postulated that synGAP also helps to regulate anchoring of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) in the PSD. AMPARs are tethered to the scaffold protein PSD-95 by auxiliary subunits called TARPs (Transmembrane AMPA Receptor-associated Proteins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Tomita et al., 2003</xref>). TARPs contain a PDZ ligand that binds to PDZ domains in PSD-95. An early event in induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) is increased trapping of AMPARs that is mediated by enhanced binding of TARPs to PDZ domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>). SynGAP is also anchored in the PSD by binding of its Î±1 splice variant to the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McMahon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>). SynGAP is nearly as abundant in the PSD fraction as PSD-95, which suggests that it occupies a large fraction of the PDZ domains and can compete with TARPs for binding to PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dosemeci et al., 2007</xref>). During induction of LTP, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII) phosphorylates synGAP, increasing the rate of inactivation of Rap relative to Ras, and, at the same time, causing a decrease in the affinity of synGAP-Î±1 for the PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Walkup et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>). We postulated that the decreased affinity of synGAP for PSD-95 might contribute to induction of LTP by allowing TARPs and their associated AMPARs to compete more effectively for binding to the PDZ domains and thus increase their anchoring in the PSD. If this hypothesis is correct, one consequence could be that induction of LTP would be disrupted in synGAP heterozygotes because the transient shift in competition for PDZ binding by synGAP would be less potent because of loss of a copy of S<italic>yngap1</italic>. A second possible consequence could be that the steady state level of TARPs bound to PSD-95 in PSDs would be increased in synGAP heterozygotes because the steady state level of synGAP is reduced.</p><p>In the study that prompted the present work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>), we measured the ratios to PSD-95 of TARPs, LRRTM2, neuroligin-1 and neuroligin-2Â in PSD fractions prepared from six pooled forebrains of <italic>wild type</italic> (WT) mice and six of S<italic>yngap1<sup>+/-</sup></italic> (HET) mice. The WT animals comprised three 9.5 and two 7.9 week old males and one 12.5 week old female. The HETs comprised three 12.5 week old males, one 7.9 week old male, and two 9.5 week old females. The mean ratio of synGAP to PSD-95 was 25% less in PSDs from the HET mice compared to WT. As we had predicted, the mean ratio of TARPs to PSD-95 showed a small (12%) but significant increase in PSDs from the HET animals compared to WT. We also found a small but significant increase in the mean ratio of LRRTM2 (14%) and neuroligin-2 (9%) to PSD-95. The mean ratio of neuroligin-1 to PSD-95 was unchanged.</p><p>Because the number of pooled brains in this previous study was small and WT and HET pools were not perfectly balanced by developmental age or sex, we set out to expand these findings with a larger data set gathered from PSDs isolated from individuals rather than from pooled animals. Data from individuals allowed us to use a more rigorous statistical measure of correlation, the well-established Spearmanâs rank correlation coefficient r. Comparison of mean levels of two proteins in pooled samples is not a perfect measure of the correlation between the two levels in individuals. It is possible to have a correlation between protein levels in individuals that is not reflected as a difference between mean levels. Spearmanâs r tests whether a monotonic correlation exists between the rank order of magnitudes of two variables in a data set. We used it to examine the correlation of levels of synGAP with levels of four other proteins in individual PSD fractions. If the rank orders of two variables correlate perfectly, Spearmanâs r is 1; if there is no correlation, it is zero; and if the ranks are perfectly anti-correlated, it is â1.</p><p>When the data were averaged for WT and HET animals in this large data set, we were surprised to find that the mean TARP/PSD-95 ratio in PSDs was not different between WT and HET animals, in contrast to our earlier finding. However, when we calculated Spearmanâs r for individual data sets, we made the unexpected discovery that a strong inverse correlation between the levels of TARP and synGAP is present only in females and not in males. The large and highly significant inverse correlation in HET females drives a significant inverse correlation data from all HET animals and from all female animals. The inverse correlation is not found in any subset of animals that contains only males. We also established that a similar sex difference is present in rats, as well as mice. We repeated the finding of the earlier study that there is no difference in the level of neuroligin-1 between WT and HET rodents; but, there is a small increase in the amount of neuroligin-2 in HETs. Finally, we made the additional discovery that the level of synGAP correlates positively with the level of the NMDA-type glutamate receptor GluN2B. In other words, the level of NR2B is reduced in the PSDs of HET rodents.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Creation of rat synGAP KO by the CRISPR-Cas9 method</title><p>CRISPR/Cas9 technology was used to establish a <italic>Syngap1</italic> KO rat line that harbors a frameshift mutation in exon8 of <italic>Syngap1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which prevents expression of the protein.

PSD fractions were prepared from the forebrains of 165 individual rodents, comprising 82 WT and 83 HETs. The total sample included 81 females (39 WT, 42 HET), and 84 males (43 WT, 41 HET). In each category, approximately half of the animals were rats and half were mice; approximately half were 7.5 weeks old and half were 12.5 weeks old. The ratio of synGAP/PSD-95 and TARP/PSD-95, averaged over all of the rodents, are summarized in the two bars labeled âAllâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>, left). As expected, the synGAP/PSD-95 ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, left) is reduced by 22% in HET rodents compared to WT (the WT level is indicated by a dotted line). However, the ratio of TARP to PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left) is not significantly different, even when the results were averaged for animals grouped by sex, species, and age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), except for seven wk old female mice in which the ratio of TARPs to PSD-95 was significantly reduced compared to WT. This value may have been influenced by a developmental effect causing lower overall expression of TARPs in 7 week old mice.

The simplest explanation is that in HET females, the structure of the PSD, which is determined by multiple equilibria among several proteins, is such that TARP and synGAP compete directly for binding to PSD-95; whereas in HET males, this particular competition is not significant. Possible underlying mechanisms are outlined in the Discussion.</p><p>We also compared data sets from mice and rats at 7.5 weeks and 12.5 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>). These data sets were small (9 or 10 animals). Nevertheless, they show a statistically significant inverse correlation between TARP/PSD-95 and synGAP/PSD-95 in HET female mice at both 7.5 and 12.5 weeks. In data from HET rats at 7.5 weeks, the inverse correlation is very close to significance; at 12.5 weeks, it is less significant, but still shows a trend. In the corresponding males, none of the data sets shows a statistically significant inverse correlation. More data would be required to make a definitive conclusion, but the results suggest that competition between synGAP and TARP for binding to PSD-95 in females is more prominent at 7 weeks than at 12 weeks, and more prominent in mice than in rats.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Effect of synGAP haploinsufficiency on the relative levels of other PSD proteins</title><p>In our previous paper, we examined the levels of neuroligins 1 and 2 (NLG-1,â2), and of the surface protein LRRTM2.

Specifically, we show that a decrease in the steady-state concentration of synGAP in rodent PSDs correlates with a higher concentration of TARPs in PSDs only in females and not in males. In female HETs, the rank correlation coefficient between the concentrations of TARP and synGAP in PSDs is â0.5, which suggests a relatively high competition between the two proteins for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95 in vivo. This competition does not affect the composition of PSDs in male HETs. SynGAP haploinsufficiency causes about 4% of cases of sporadic intellectual disability (ID) in humans, often accompanied by seizures and autistic behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Berryer et al., 2013</xref>). If the sex difference in the interaction of synGAP with TARPs in the rodent PSD is also present in humans, it might result in differences between girls and boys in the prevalence of some of the associated symptoms.</p><p>The PSD is formed by multiple interactions among the major scaffold proteins and âclientâ signaling proteins which are concentrated in the PSD by their association with the scaffold proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kennedy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kennedy et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Sheng and Kim, 2011</xref>). At any one time, the composition of a PSD is a dynamic equilibrium among all the possible protein associations, driven by the relative concentrations of each protein in a spine, and the relative affinities of their mutual binding domains (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gray et al., 2006</xref>). The simplest interpretation of our present result isthat there is a difference between males and females in the composition or regulation of proteins in PSDs which causes the concentration of TARPs in PSDs to be sensitive to the steady-state concentration of synGAP in females, but not males. This occurs despite the fact that there is no difference between males and females in the amount of synGAP in PSDs of either genotype.</p><p>TARPs are subunits of AMPARs, and have been shown to immobilize AMPARs at the synaptic site by binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Opazo and Choquet, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Tomita et al., 2005</xref>). In our recent eLife paper, we postulated that synGAP-Î±1, which contains a PDZ ligand, competes with TARPs for binding to PSD-95 and therefore helps to limit the number of AMPARs immobilized at the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>). This hypothesis has two possible corollaries. One is that transient phosphorylation of synGAP by CaMKII during induction of LTP, which reduces the affinity of its PDZ ligand for PSD-95, will allow more binding of TARP to the PDZ domains; and thus contribute to increased trapping of AMPARs. The second corollary, which is addressed in this study, concerns the steady-state composition of PSDs in <italic>Syngap<sup>+/-</sup></italic> rodents. If, at steady-state, the concentration of synGAP in WTs is high enough to effectively compete with binding of TARPs to PSD-95, then, in HET rodents, which have a reduced concentration of synGAP, the concentration of TARPs (and thus AMPARs) in the PSD will be higher than in WT. Indeed, we previously reported a higher concentration of TARPs in PSDs isolated from a pool of six HET mice compared to a pool of six WT mice. The pools were only approximately matched for age and sex; the HET pool contained two females, whereas the WT pool contained one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>). Because the increase in concentration of TARPs in the HET pool was significant but small, we re- examined the correlation of TARP and synGAP concentrations in a large set of individual PSDs. To do this, we developed a method for isolating PSDs from individual rodents. The analysis supports the hypothesis that synGAP-Î±1 does indeed compete with steady-state binding of TARPs to PSD-95 in some circumstances.</p><p>There are many possible mechanistic explanations for the sex difference in sensitivity of TARPs to the concentration of synGAP. One simple one is that additional protein(s) are present in females that compete with synGAP for binding to PDZ domains of PSD-95. The resulting âcrowdingâ could make binding of TARP to PSD-95 more sensitive to reduction of synGAP in females.</p><p>Another is that an additional protein which can compete with TARPs more strongly than synGAP for binding to PSD-95 is present in male PSDs, but not in female PSDs. In this case, reduction of synGAP in PSDs of males would be expected to have little effect on the concentration of TARPs. Interestingly, despite any differences between males and females in mechanism, the mean steady-state ratio of TARPs to PSD-95 in the two sexes is not significantly different among WTs or HETs.</p><p>Two recent studies have documented sex differences in regulation of synaptic plasticity. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Wang et al. (2018)</xref> found that 7 to 12 week old female rodents (the same age range used in our study) have higher synaptic levels of membrane estrogen receptor alpha (mERalpha) and, in contrast to males, require activation of mERalpha for activation of some of the signaling kinases that support long-term potentiation. This difference results in a higher threshold in females for LTP and for some forms of spatial learning. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jain et al. (2019)</xref>, studying hippocampal slices from 7 to 10 week old rats, found that estrogen-induced plasticity, which occurs in both males and females, requires synergistic activation of L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and internal Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores in females; whereas in males, either of the two sources is sufficient. In addition, activity-dependent LTP requires activation of protein kinase A in females, but not in males. They conclude that there are latent sex differences in mechanisms of synaptic potentiation in which distinct molecular signaling pathways converge to common functional endpoints in males and females. Neither of these studies provides an immediate explanation for our findings, but they support the idea that there are a number of biochemical and structural differences between males and females in the synaptic regulatory apparatus of 7 to 12 week old rodents.</p><p>Because the cytosolic tail of the GluN2B subunit binds to the first and second PDZ domains of PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kornau et al., 1995</xref>), we tested whether the concentration of GluN2B in PSDs is altered by synGAP haploinsufficiency. In contrast to TARPs, the concentration of GluN2B in PSDs shows a strong positive correlation with the amount of synGAP (rank correlation coefficient â 0.4), and is reduced in <italic>Syngap1</italic> HETs. The rank correlation among individual animals is significant in both WT and HET animals and does not differ between males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This data shows that synGAP plays a role in localizing GluN2B to the PSD, but that it is not the only protein involved.</p><p>We reproduced our original finding that the amount of synGAP in the PSD does not influence the amount of NLG-1 and shows a trend toward a small inverse correlation with the amount of NLG-2 in PSDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Walkup et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, although both synGAP and NLG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Irie et al., 1997</xref>) bind to PDZ3 of PSD-95, reduction of synGAP does not increase the steady-state amount of NLG-1 in the PSD in vivo. The simplest explanation is that NLGâs have a higher affinity for PDZ3 than synGAP such that synGAP does not compete effectively with them for binding to PDZ3 in vivo. The affinities of NLG-1 and of synGAP for PSD-95 have been estimated by Biacore surface plasmon resonance technology; but, the measurement parameters were not directly comparable. A protein fragment containing all three PDZ domains of PSD-95 was found to have a K<sub>D</sub> ofÂ ~200 nM for a 16mer with the sequence of the carboxyl terminus of NLG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Irie et al., 1997</xref>). In our recent study, we found that nearly full length synGAP, missing only the first 100 residues of the amino-terminus, has an affinity for PDZ3 ofÂ ~650 nM and for a fragment containing all three PDZ domains of 5 nM. It is likely that the competition for binding to PDZ3 between NLGâs and synGAP is influenced by additional binding sites on PSD-95 or on other scaffold proteins for NLGâs and/or synGAP.</p><p>These results illustrate the complex role that synGAP plays in modulating the steady-state composition of the PSD. It can compete with some proteins for localization in the PSD and it can help to concentrate others. The results are consistent with the concept that the structure of the PSD is a dynamic equilibrium governed by multiple protein associations and driven by the relative concentrations of each protein and the affinities of their mutual binding domains. This study has not tested the effect of the concentration of synGAP on the acute re-organization of the PSD that occurs, for example, upon induction of LTP. Our earlier finding that phosphorylation of synGAP by CaMKII, which is activated upon induction of LTP, reduces the affinity of synGAP for all three of the PDZ domains of PSD-95 suggests that post-translational modulation of synGAPâs affinity for PSD-95 may initiate transient reorganization of the PSD in stimulated synapses. Disruption of this transient role likely contributes to the phenotypes of synGAP haploinsufficiency, but in ways that may not differ between females and males.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Syngap1</italic> KO mouse</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">C57BL/6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Syngap1</italic> KO rat; <italic>LE-Syngap1<sup>em1/PWC</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">SAGE Labs, Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top"><italic>Syngap1<sup>em1/PWC</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">CRISPR/Cas9 based genome targeting exon 8</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-PSD-95 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Caltech Monoclonal Antibody Facility</td><td valign="top">50% ammonium sulfate cut of Ascites fluid of 7E3-1B8; AB_212825</td><td valign="top">WB (1:10,000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-synGAP (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Pierce</td><td valign="top">PA1-046; AB_2287112</td><td valign="top">WB (1:3,500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-TARP (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">EDM Millipore</td><td valign="top">Ab9876; AB_877307</td><td valign="top">WB (1:300)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GluN2B (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Raised in our lab. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NLG-1 <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">129013; AB_2151646</td><td valign="top">WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-NLG-2 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">129202; AB_2151646</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td valign="top">A28183; AB_2536167</td><td valign="top">WB (1 Î¼g/ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">IRdye800-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG</td><td valign="top">Rockland Immunochemicals, Limerick, PA</td><td valign="top">611-145-122; AB_1057618</td><td valign="top">WB (1 Î¼g/ml)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td>BCA Protein Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Pierce</td><td>23227</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Image Studio Light</td><td valign="top">LI-COR Biosciences</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Microsoft Excel</td><td valign="top">Microsoft</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Prism 8</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Software, San Diego</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Syngap1</italic> KO mice were generated in the Kennedy lab, bred in the Caltech animal facility, and genotyped by polymerase chain reaction as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Vazquez et al., 2004</xref>).

ID numbers were assigned randomly with respect to genotype, and were used to label and track tissue samples and extracts after harvesting from the animal. Animals were killed by decapitation according to a protocol approved by the Caltech Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. The following steps were carried out at 4Â° C. Forebrains were dissected from each animal, rinsed in Buffer A (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl chloride [PMSF, Sigma Millipore, St. Louis, MO]). Each individual forebrain was homogenized in Buffer A (10% w/v, 4.5 ml for mice and 13.5 ml for rats) with 12 up and down strokes of a teflon/glass homogenizer at 900 rpm. Homogenates were subjected to centrifugation at 1400Â ÃÂ g for 10 min. The pellet was resuspended in Buffer A to 10% w/v (3.8 ml for mice, 12 ml for rats), homogenized (three strokes at 900 rpm) and subjected to centrifugation at 710 g for 10 min. The two supernatants were combined and subjected to centrifugation at 13,800 g for 10 min. The resulting pellet was resuspended in Buffer B (0.32 M sucrose, 1 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>; 2 ml for mice, 8 ml for rats), homogenized with 6 strokes at 900 rpm in a teflon/glass homogenizer, and layered onto a discontinuous sucrose gradient (equal parts 0.85 M, 1.0 M, and 1.2 M sucrose in 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>CO<sub>3</sub> buffer; 10.5 ml for mice, 30 ml for rats). Gradients were subjected to centrifugation for 2 hr at 82,500 g in a swinging bucket rotor. The synaptosome-enriched layer at the interface of 1.0 and 1.2 M sucrose was collected, diluted with Buffer B, 7 ml for mice and 20 ml for rats, then added to an equal volume of Buffer B containing 1% Triton (10% X-100 Surfact-Amps, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). The mixture was stirred for 15 min at 4Â°C and subjected to centrifugation for 45 min at 36,800 g. The pellet, which contained the PSD-enriched Triton-insoluble fraction, was resuspended in 0.5â1.0 ml 40 mM Tris pH 8 with a 21-gauge needle attached to a 1 ml syringe, and then homogenized with six strokes at 900 rpm in a teflon/glass homogenizer. Samples were flash-frozen, and stored at â80Â° C. Protein concentrations were determined by the bicinconic acid method (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Individual mouse brains yieldedÂ ~1.25 mgs and individual rat brains yieldedÂ ~3.5 mgs protein. The yield was sufficient to measure the ratio of amounts of five separate proteins to PSD-95 for each individual animal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Immunoblots</title><p>To measure each of the five proteins, an equal amount of protein from each sample (5 Î¼g) was dissolved in SDS-PAGE sample buffer (50 mM Tris-HCL pH 6.8, 2% SDS, 10% glycerol, 5% Î²-mercaptoethanol, 0.005% bromophenol blue), heated at 90Â°C for 5 min, loaded into acrylamide gels (8% gel for analysis of synGAP, GluN2B, NLG-1 and 2; or 12% for TARPs), fractionated, and electrically transferred to PVDF membranes in 25 mM Tris, 150 mM glycine at 250V for 2â3 hr at 4 Â°C. All gels contained a mixture of males and females randomized by genotype. Completeness of transfer was checked by staining of gels with Gel Code Blue (Thermo Fisher Scientific) after transfer. Membranes were washed for 5 mins three times in 20 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl (TBS), blocked with Odyssey blocking buffer (LI-COR Biosciences, Lincoln NE) for 45 mins at RT, washed for 5 mins three times in TBS plus 0.1% tween (TBST) and then incubated in primary antibodies dissolved in TBST plus 5% BSA ON at 4 Â°C. Each blot was incubated with a mixture of mouse anti-PSD-95 (50% ammonium sulfate cut of Ascites fluid of 7E3-1B8, AB_212825, dilution 1:10,000), and one of the following; rabbit anti-synGAP (Pierce PA1-046, AB_2287112 dilution 1:3500), rabbit anti-TARP (EDM Millipore Ab9876, AB_877307 dilution 1:300), rabbit anti-GluN2B (raised in our lab, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>, dilution 1:1000), rabbit anti-NLG-1 (Synaptic Systems 129013 AB_2151646 dilution 1:2000), or rabbit anti-NLG-2 (Synaptic System 129202 dilution 1:1000). Membranes were washed for 5 min three times in TBST and incubated for 45 min at RT in 5% nonfat milk in TBST with a mixture of secondary antibodies including Alexa Fluor 680 goat anti-mouse IgG (Thermo Fisher Scientific A28183, AB_2536167, 1 Î¼g/ml) to label PSD-95, and IRdye800-conjugated goat-anti-rabbit IgG (Rockland Immunochemicals, Limerick, PA, 611-145-122, AB_1057618, 1 Î¼g/ml) to label the target proteins. Membranes were then given three 5 min washes in TBST, followed by three 5 min washes in TBS. Bound antibodies were visualized with the Odyssey Infrared Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data quantification and analysis</title><p>For each gel lane (representing a single animal) the ratio of the target protein (NLG-1, NLG-2, TARPs, GluN2B, or synGAP) to PSD-95 was calculated (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Regions of Interest (ROI) were drawn around each protein band and the intensity within the box was determined with the use of Image Studio Light software supplied by LI-COR. To measure background, a box of the same size was placed in the lane in an unstained region above or below the band of interest. The fluorescence intensity values were transferred to Microsoft Excel. For both the target protein and PSD-95, background was subtracted from the signal, then the ratio of the two background-corrected signals was calculated. At least three technical replicates of the synGAP signal were performed for each animal; and, in general, six technical replicates were performed for the other targets.</p><p>To gather the data, cohorts of 7.5 week old mice, 7.5 week old rats, 12.5 week old mice, and 12.5 week old rats were processed separately. Because of the large number of animals within each cohort (~40), gels were run and the samples were quantified over a few days and sometimes with different lots of antibodies. To normalize intensity signals within each cohort between different days and different lots of antibodies for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, we first grouped the ratios for each target (e.g synGAP/PSD-95) according to the genotype and sex of the animals. For each combination of genotype and sex (e.g. WT male), we averaged the ratios determined for each target on each day, then calculated the overall average of these daily averages. To obtain correction factors that compensated for systematic small variations in signals on different days and for different lots of antibodies, we calculated the ratio of the overall average to each daily average. Each ratio for individual animals (ie. from a single lane) was then adjusted by multiplying by the appropriate correction factor. Eighty percent of the correction factors fell between 0.5 and 1.75. One percent were larger than 2.75 and four percent were less than 0.5. After normalization within cohorts, the ratios were used for the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>. This procedure allowed us to correct for technical variation within cohorts while preserving true differences in ratios based on species, age, genotype, or sex. Analyses for significance were carried out and graphs were created with Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, San Diego). The DâAgostino-Pearson omnibus test was used to determine the normality of the data sets. The means of groups of data were compared for significant differences with one- or two-tailed Mann-Whitney test (when non-normal), or one- or two-tailed paired T-Test, as indicated. If the variances of the two groups were found to be different using an F test, a one- or two-tailed T-Test with a Welchâs correction was applied.</p><p>To test rigorously among individual animals for correlations between the ratio of synGAP to PSD-95 and the ratio of the other target proteins to PSD-95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>), We corrected for differences in intensity of signals between the four cohorts (i.e. 7.5 week old mice, 7.5 week old rats, 12.5 week old mice, and 12.5 week old rats) which had been analyzed separately. (The previous normalization only corrected for technical variation within each cohort.) Data for each cohort was divided into ratios from WT males, WT females, HET males, and HET females. Averages of the ratios for each protein within each of these groups, were calculated. The averaged ratios for each group were then further averaged across the cohorts. A normalization factor was calculated for each protein in each cohort by dividing the overall average for all the cohorts by the average for each cohort. Then the appropriate normalization factor was applied to individual data points in each cohort. This sequence corrected for variation in the average intensities of signals between cohorts and groups (for example, the overall lower expression of TARPS in 7.5 week old HET females [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>]) and allowed us to look for correlations between ratios among the individuals across cohorts. To determine the correlations between ratios shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, we treated data as non-normal and calculated one-tailed Spearman rank correlation coefficients with Prism software.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Visualization, Project administration</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Animal experimentation: This study was performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Leslie Griffith as Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper builds on a previous report by the Kennedy lab showing that synGAP may play a role in regulation of PSD composition. In this Advance, the authors develop a single-animal PSD prep and find that, surprisingly, there is a sex difference in the effects of heterozygosity for synGAP. While this is a very interesting finding, there were several issues raised by the reviewers that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to be more transparent about the ratio data so a reader can understand what underlies the means and correlations they plot in figures. Ruling out PSD-95 differences based on means, but ruling in a synGAP/TARP relationship based on correlations that are not evident in means seems potentially problematic.</p><p>2) The authors need to relate their new data more clearly to the previous results and conclusions. As an Advance, it should be completely clear how these results are both related to and advance understanding of the relationship between synGAP and TARPs. The primary issue is with Figure 2. Both synGAP/PSD-95 <italic>and</italic> TARPs/PSD-95 go <italic>down</italic> relative to WT in HET female mice at 7.5 weeks; there is no effect on TARPs in 12.5 week female mice, despite the expected decrease in synGAP. Thus, with the exception of 7.5 week HET female rats, in which TARPs go up when synGAP goes down, the relationships shown in the previous paper are not recapitulated. It is also very hard to understand how such a small fraction of females in the first paper could have accounted for those results unless those data sets were seriously underpowered and did not reflect the true underlying distribution of the phenomena.</p><p>3) The authors need to show primary data to support the rigor of their analyses e.g. some representative immunoblots.</p><p>4) Most of the pairwise statistics are one-tailed. The authors need to do two-sided statistical tests or genuinely justify one-sided tests. It is possible they did have a hypothesis to justify one-sided tests (based on the previous paper). But Figure 2 (in which synGAP and TARPs do not consistently show an opposite regulation) calls this into question.</p><p>5) Since there are no sex difference apparent in WT animals, the title of the paper should reflect this and focus on the sex difference in the ability of animals to respond to genetic insult.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52656.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors need to be more transparent about the ratio data so a reader can understand what underlies the means and correlations they plot in figures.

We include a step by step explanation of how the data was transformed into the indicated ratios.

We have now included in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1, a correlation plot and determination of Spearmanâs r for the relationship between synGAP levels and PSD-95 levels in the data set for 7.5 week old mouse HET females. This graph (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C) shows that the correlation between synGAP/PSD-95 and TARPs/PSD-95 in this data set is not related to a change in PSD-95 levels in the synGAP HETs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors need to relate their new data more clearly to the previous results and conclusions.

We were, and are, aware that developmental differences in expression of synGAP or TARPs between animals at these ages might have contributed to our findings. Therefore, we undertook to collect larger individual data sets of animals at each age and of each sex in order to more carefully examine the relationship between amounts of synGAP and amounts of TARPs in PSDs. The data set of measurements on individual PSDs enabled us to use the well-established statistical measure, Spearmanâs r, a more rigorous measure of correlation between two measurements. It is exactly because of the possibility that the original data might have been underpowered that we undertook the present study to examine the issue more rigorously. We also indicate in the manuscript a related reason for this follow up study. Namely, comparison of mean ratios is not the most accurate or sensitive way to test for a correlation between the levels of two proteins. It is entirely possible to have a situation in which the levels of two proteins are correlated when examining each individual; however, the mean levels of the two proteins, averaged over all individuals, appear uncorrelated. As we explained in the manuscript, Spearmanâs r is a well-known statistical test designed to reveal correlations based on measurements from each individual in a group.</p><p>We also added a study of rats, for which we have obtained synGAP heterozygote mutants, in order to establish whether mice and rats differ.</p><p>In response to the reviewerâs request, we moved to the Introduction (second paragraph) the explanation of the relationship to the original study, and of our decision to gather individual data to permit a more rigorous study.</p><p>The study involved the sacrifice of 160 mice and rats. We would have had a hard time justifying such a detailed study without the original finding. Investigators need to publish data at reasonable intervals and cannot always wait until each aspect of a finding is explored to the fullest. Notably, except for the sex difference, the relationships indicated in our original study between TARP and synGAP, neuroligin-1 and synGAP, and neuroligin-2 and synGAP are correct, despite the apparent âunderpowering.â That is the data. We were, and are, not in the position of those proposing clinical trials, in which a meaningful estimate of needed âpowerâ can be calculated prior to gathering the actual data.</p><p>In summary, we did this follow up study principally to test in a more sensitive way for a correlation between synGAP and TARP, and between synGAP and the other proteins; and also to determine the variability among individuals of levels of synGAP, TARP, neuroligin-1, neuroligin-2, and GluN2B in PSDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors need to show primary data to support the rigor of their analyses e.g. some representative immunoblots.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see our response to comment #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Most of the pairwise statistics are one-tailed.

But Figure 2 (in which synGAP and TARPs do not consistently show an opposite regulation) calls this into question.</p></disp-quote><p>We have replaced one-tailed T-tests with two-tailed T-tests for the data in Figure 2B. In Figure 3, we kept one-tailed T-tests since our hypothesis still predicted an inverse relationship between synGAP and TARP levels. In Figure 4, we substituted two-tailed T-tests since we did not have a pre-existing hypothesis about this data. We also used a two-tailed T-test in Figure 4B since NLG-1 did not appear to have a consistent relationship to synGAP. In Figure 4C, we hypothesized that NLG-2 would show an anti-correlation with synGAP, so we used a one-tailed T-test. In Figure 5, we hypothesized, based on Figure 4A, that the level of GluN2B would correlate positively with synGAP, therefore, we used one-tailed T-tests. In Figure 6, neither one-tailed nor two-tailed tests indicated significant correlation. Although, the one-tailed T-test in Figure 6A suggested a trend toward anticorrelation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
