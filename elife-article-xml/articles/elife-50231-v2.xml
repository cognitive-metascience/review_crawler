The release of particles is abolished by blocking cell movement (either by depolymerizing actin with latrunculin A or by inhibiting myosin II with blebbistatin). Confocal microscopy and NanoSIMS imaging studies revealed that the plasma membrane–derived particles are enriched in ‘accessible cholesterol’ (a mobile pool of cholesterol detectable with the modified cytolysin ALO-D4) but not in sphingolipid-sequestered cholesterol [a pool detectable with ostreolysin A (OlyA)]. The discovery that macrophages release cholesterol-rich particles during cellular locomotion is likely relevant to cholesterol efflux and could contribute to extracellular cholesterol deposition in atherosclerotic plaques.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>accessible cholesterol</kwd><kwd>NanoSIMS</kwd><kwd>focal adhesions</kwd><kwd>cholesterol efflux</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL090553</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL087228</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL125335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001674</institution-id><institution>Fondation Leducq</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12CVD04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Young</surname><given-names>Stephen G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ruth L Kirschstein National Research Service Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32HL69766</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Xuchen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Discovery Early Career Researcher</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Haibo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001170</institution-id><institution>Cancer Council Western Australia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Early Career Investigator Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jiang</surname><given-names>Haibo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Macrophages release 30-nm vesicular particles enriched in accessible cholesterol during cellular locomotion, a discovery that is likely relevant to cholesterol disposal by these cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A key function of macrophages is to engulf and digest cellular debris. The cholesterol in the debris can be esterified and stored in cytosolic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown et al., 1980</xref>), thereby avoiding toxicity associated with an accumulation of free cholesterol, but macrophages ultimately must dispose of the surplus cholesterol, a process generally referred to as ‘cholesterol efflux’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rothblat and Phillips, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adorni et al., 2007</xref>). One mechanism for cholesterol efflux involves transferring free cholesterol to high density lipoproteins (HDL), a process that is facilitated by ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tall et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rothblat and Phillips, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yvan-Charvet et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Westerterp et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Duong et al., 2006</xref>). A deficiency of ABCA1 interferes with cholesterol efflux by macrophages, leading to an accumulation of foam cells (macrophages containing numerous cholesterol ester droplets) in tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brooks-Wilson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bodzioch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clee et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rust et al., 1999</xref>). Another potential mechanism for cholesterol efflux by macrophages is the release of cholesterol-rich particles from the plasma membrane. Using a cholesterol-specific monoclonal antibody and immunocytochemical approaches, the laboratory of Howard Kruth reported that cultured human monocyte–derived macrophages release ‘cholesterol microdomains’ (varying in size but as large as several hundred nm) onto the surrounding substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). The release of these microdomains was reduced by decreasing the expression of ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, we demonstrated, by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), that large numbers of ~30-nm vesicular particles were released from the plasma membrane of mouse peritoneal macrophages and a mouse macrophage cell line by a process that morphologically resembles ‘budding.’ The plasma membrane–derived particles were enriched in ‘accessible cholesterol’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2018</xref>), a mobile pool of cholesterol that can be detected by ALO-D4, a modified cholesterol-binding cytolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gay et al., 2015</xref>). The cholesterol content of the particles could be increased by loading macrophages with cholesterol or by treating the cells with a liver X receptor (LXR) agonist, and the cholesterol content of the particles could be depleted with HDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The SEM studies by He and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2018</xref>) demonstrated that the particles released by macrophages are derived from the plasma membrane, but the mechanism was unclear. One possibility is that the budding of particles from the plasma membrane was driven by shuttling cholesterol into plasma membrane microdomains, causing outward ballooning of a localized segment of the plasma membrane and ultimately to the release of a vesicular particle. A second possibility, mentioned by He and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2018</xref>) but not pursued, was that the particles represented segments of the macrophage plasma membrane that had been affixed to the substrate but then ‘torn away and left behind’ during movement of filopodia and lamellipodia.</p><p>In the current study, we used live-cell microscopy and SEM, along with proteomic studies, to explore the mechanism for the release of particles from the plasma membrane of macrophages. We also used super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and NanoSIMS imaging, in combination with two different cholesterol-binding proteins (one specific for ‘accessible cholesterol’ and the other for sphingomyelin-sequestered cholesterol), to examine the cholesterol pools within the plasma membrane–derived particles released by macrophages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Macrophages release plasma membrane–derived particles during the movement of filopodia and lamellipodia</title><p>In the current studies, we again found that particles are released from macrophage filopodia and lamellipodia onto the surrounding substrate by a process that resembles budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because the released particles remain adherent to the substrate, we suspected that the particles might represent fragments of the plasma membrane that were affixed to the underlying substrate but then pulled away and left behind during movement of filopodia/lamellipodia. To explore this idea, we plated mouse peritoneal macrophages onto gridded glass-bottom dishes and recorded images of cells by live-cell microscopy (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">2</xref>), making it possible to visualize the projection and retraction of filopodia/lamellipodia.

Because latrunculin A blocks particle release from macrophages, neither ALO-D4 nor OlyA detected particles on the substrate around macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, when latrunculin A was added to the medium after allowing the cells to adhere to the substrate (‘post-adherence’), a circumferential ring of ALO-D4 binding, but not OlyA binding, was observed on the substrate surrounding macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), corresponding to the circumferential ring of particles detected by SEM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>.

First, we showed that particles are released from the macrophage plasma membrane during the projection and retraction of filopodia and lamellipodia. When the movement of filopodia/lamellipodia was blocked by actin depolymerization (latrunculin A) or by inhibiting myosin II (blebbistatin), particle release was abolished. Also, the deposition of particles onto the substrate occurred only in sites where we had observed (by live-cell microscopy) the projection and retraction of filopodia and lamellipodia. These findings implied that the particles were fragments of the plasma membrane that had been anchored to the substrate but subsequently torn away and left behind during the projection and retraction of filopodia/lamellipodia. Particles were also left behind as adherent macrophages progressively retracted during latrunculin A–induced depolymerization of the actin cytoskeleton. The fact that macrophage particles contained proteins associated with the plasma membrane, including adhesion complex proteins and cytoskeletal proteins, is consistent with the conclusion that the particles are plasma membrane fragments left behind during cellular locomotion. Second, we found that the plasma membrane–derived particles were enriched in ‘accessible cholesterol’ but not in sphingolipid-sequestered cholesterol. By super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and NanoSIMS imaging, we found robust binding of ALO-D4 (specific for the accessible pool of cholesterol) to the lawn of particles around macrophages. In contrast, there was minimal binding of OlyA, which binds to the sphingolipid-sequestered pool of cholesterol in the plasma membrane.</p><p>Our studies with biotinylated macrophages provided further evidence that the particles on the surrounding substrate are derived from the plasma membrane. After an overnight incubation, the lawn of particles around macrophages was readily detectable with fluorescently labeled streptavidin. Also, we observed binding of streptavidin-conjugated gold nanoparticles to the particles on the substrate around macrophages. Immunocytochemistry studies designed to detect specific plasma membrane proteins on the lawn of particles were inconclusive, very likely because of the low abundance of any given protein within a particle and because the binding affinities of most antibodies are far lower than the affinity of streptavidin for biotin.</p><p>We observed particularly large lawns of particles around macrophages that had been treated with an FAK inhibitor, which interferes with the disassembly of focal adhesions (the macromolecular complexes that tether cells to the underlying substrate). It makes sense that inhibiting focal adhesion disassembly would increase the likelihood of plasma membrane fragments being left behind during cellular locomotion. However, even though the lawn of particles surrounding FAK inhibitor–treated macrophages was consistently larger in multiple experiments, we are hesitant to draw ironclad conclusions, simply because we have not yet developed a realistic and practical strategy for accurately quantifying numbers of particles in the ‘lawn’ surrounding an individual macrophage (let alone the numbers of particles surrounding large numbers of macrophages on a cell culture plate).</p><p>In our studies, the particles on the substrate surrounding macrophages were enriched (relative to the plasma membrane over the cell body) in accessible cholesterol but depleted in sphingomyelin-sequestered cholesterol. This finding was evident by both fluorescence microscopy and NanoSIMS imaging. Why the lawn of particles would be enriched in the accessible pool of cholesterol has not been established in an unequivocal fashion, but we would propose a potential explanation—one stimulated from the observations by Raghupathy and coworkers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raghupathy et al., 2015</xref>) on the role of the cytoskeleton in organizing plasma membrane lipids. They proposed that the actin cytoskeleton is tethered, through adaptor proteins, to long acyl-chain–containing phosphatidylserines in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane, which interact with microdomains on the outer leaflet containing cholesterol and long acyl-chain–containing lipids (<italic>e.g.</italic>, sphingolipids). According to this model, sphingolipid-associated cholesterol on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane associates, indirectly, with the actin cytoskeleton and thus would presumably remain tethered to the actin cytoskeleton during movement of filopodia and lamellipodia. According to this model, the <italic>non-sequestered</italic> ‘accessible’ pool of cholesterol, which is known to be mobile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017</xref>), would be more likely than the sphingolipid-sequestered cholesterol to be left behind on the substrate during the movement of filopodia/lamellipodia. Our NanoSIMS images of [<sup>15</sup>N]ALO-D4 and [<sup>13</sup>C]OlyA binding are consistent with this model. We observed broad bands of <sup>13</sup>C enrichment along the perimeter of macrophages, corresponding to the broad, flat, actin cytoskeleton–rich lamellipodia, but there was minimal <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in the lawn of particles surrounding cells. In contrast, both the lawn of particles on the substrate as well as the extreme edge of the macrophage plasma membrane (from which particles are released) were enriched in <sup>15</sup>N. The thin linear band of <sup>15</sup>N enrichment at the far edge of the cell extends beyond the broad band of [<sup>13</sup>C]OlyA binding. Thus, the plasma membrane at the far edge of the cell is enriched in accessible cholesterol. Presumably, the negligible amounts of <sup>13</sup>C enrichment in the lawn of particles around macrophages is explained by the low amounts of <sup>13</sup>C within the thin <sup>15</sup>N-enriched region at the far edge of the plasma membrane.</p><p>We found that macrophages release, during movement of filopodia and lamellipodia, large numbers of ~30-nm ‘accessible cholesterol’–rich particles onto the substrate. In earlier studies, other groups have uncovered evidence for the release of membranous fragments during cell migration. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt et al. (1993)</xref> described the ripping away of integrin-containing, cytoskeletal element–free membranous particles from rat fibroblasts during cell migration, but those particles (visible by light microscopy) were larger than we observed by SEM around cultured macrophages. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Regen and Horwitz (1992)</xref> described release of trails of membranous particles from migrating chicken fibroblasts, but again, the particles were larger than we observed in macrophages. In these studies, the cholesterol content of particles was not investigated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vedhachalam et al. (2007)</xref> provided suggestive electron microscopy evidence for the protrusion of cholesterol-rich exovesicular domains from the surface of J774 macrophages, but they did not describe the release of vesicular particles from those cells. They proposed that the exovesicular protrusions contained ABC transporters and were involved in the efflux of cholesterol onto apolipoprotein AI molecules in the biogenesis of HDL. Most recently, Li Yu’s group described release of ‘migrasomes’ from filopodia in a variety of cell lines during cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). Migrasomes were described as cholesterol-rich micron-sized structures that, by electron microscopy, contained multiple 50–100-nm vesicular structures. Migrasome formation was blocked by cholesterol depletion. They did not describe ‘lawns’ of ~30-nm particles on the substrate surrounding their cultured cells. In our studies, we did not observe structures resembling migrasomes within the filopodia of cultured macrophages. Also, in an earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2018</xref>), we observed lawns of particles surrounding macrophages even after depleting the cells of cholesterol with an overnight incubation with HDL.</p><p>Our studies revealed that cultured macrophages release large numbers of cholesterol-rich particles onto a poly-D-lysine-coated substrate, but whether macrophages in living tissues release cholesterol-rich particles in the same manner has not yet been established. Detecting the release of plasma membrane–derived particles in vivo will be extremely challenging, in part because it will be very difficult to distinguish plasma membrane–derived particles from plasma lipoproteins and other membrane-bound particles (<italic>e.g.,</italic> exosomes). However, we did find that macrophages are capable of releasing plasma membrane–derived particles onto more physiologic substrates (<italic>e.g.</italic>, collagen matrix, dead cells), lending plausibility to the notion that particle release could occur in vivo. Particle release by macrophages in vivo could be relevant to cholesterol homeostasis. In terms of normal cholesterol physiology, it is conceivable that particle release could contribute to reverse cholesterol transport. In support of this idea, the release of [<sup>3</sup>H]cholesterol by macrophages (incubated in the absence of cholesterol acceptors) was reduced by abolishing particle release with blebbistatin. An earlier study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">He et al., 2018</xref>) revealed that HDL is effective in depleting cholesterol from plasma membrane–derived particles. Thus, particle release could facilitate the return of accessible cholesterol into the circulation. In terms of disease, the release of cholesterol-rich membrane particles onto matrix proteins in the interstitial spaces of the arterial wall could, over a period of many years, contribute to the accumulation of extracellular cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Dishes were then washed three times for 5 min with 100% ethanol, air dried, and then coated with 0.1 mg/ml poly-D-lysine overnight at 4°C. On the next day, the dish was rinsed three times with sterile water; after drying, peritoneal macrophages were plated at 50,000 cells/dish. Live-cell videos were captured with a Zeiss LSM800 confocal microscope with a Plan Apochromat 20×/0.80 objective. The incubation chamber was maintained at 37°C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> with TempModule S1 (Zeiss) and CO<sub>2</sub> Module S1 (Zeiss). Images were captured at 5 min intervals for 24 hr. Next, the cells were washed with PBS containing Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (PBS/Ca/Mg) containing 0.2% bovine serum albumin (BSA) three times for 2 min and then incubated with [<sup>15</sup>N]ALO-D4 (20 μg/ml in PBS + 0.2% BSA) for 2 hr at 4°C.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Release of cholesterol-rich particles from the macrophage plasma membrane during movement of filopodia and lamellipodia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Fredric B Kraemer as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Paul Dawson (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Questions regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying cholesterol excretion remain an important missing link in our understanding. Young and coworkers recently employed state-of-the-art approaches to provide compelling evidence for a pathway by which membrane particles containing significant amounts of accessible cholesterol are released from the filopodia of macrophages. This pathway operates in parallel with the previously characterized ABC transporter-mediated movement of cellular cholesterol to HDL (although the activity of ABC transporters may contribute to the cholesterol content of those particles).</p><p>The present study uses live cell microscopy, proteomics, and NanoSIMS imaging to identify the source of those accessible cholesterol-enriched particles. The authors make the surprising and novel discovery that the particles represent membrane fragments (enriched in focal adhesion-related proteins) deposited by filopodia and lamellipodia in the process of cellular locomotion.</p><p>All the reviewers agreed that this is a very clear and well written manuscript that identifies the mechanism for the release of small cholesterol-rich particles from macrophage plasma membranes and that the methodologies utilized are state-of-the-art and provide convincing data supporting the authors conclusions.</p><p>Although the studies raise a number of questions, such as the generalizability of the process to other cells, the fate of the particle-associated cholesterol in vivo, why the enrichment in &quot;accessible&quot; cholesterol, the reviewers do not feel that additional experiments are currently required.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It was noted that a substantial body of literature has been overlooked by the authors in which other investigators have previously reported loss of fragments of cell membrane and attachment proteins during cell movement or excretion of microparticles (see Regen and Horwitz, 1992; Schmidt et al., 1993; Nandi et al., 2009, J Lipid Res 50:456, to cite a few). While the more extensive characterization of these membrane fragments by more modern techniques in the current manuscript provides additional information, it should be presented within the context these previous observations.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50231.052</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It was noted that a substantial body of literature has been overlooked by the authors in which other investigators have previously reported loss of fragments of cell membrane and attachment proteins during cell movement or excretion of microparticles (see Regen and Horwitz, 1992; Schmidt et al., 1993; Nandi et al., 2009, J Lipid Res 50:456, to cite a few).

In the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we have added a paragraph in which we have done our best to place our observations in the context of earlier observations on the release of membranous particles from migrating cells. As the reviewer noted, there are important similarities between our observations and the observations in earlier papers, but there are also important differences. Also, our studies were the first to use NanoSIMS and electron microscopy to study the mechanism for the release of large numbers of ~30-nm cholesterol-rich particles from macrophage filopodia and lamellipodia.</p></body></sub-article></article>
