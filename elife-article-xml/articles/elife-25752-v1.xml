Tumors which remodel their glycocalyces, by overexpressing bulky glycoproteins like mucins, exhibit a higher predisposition to metastasize, but the role of mucins in oncogenesis remains poorly understood. Here we report that a bulky glycocalyx promotes the expansion of disseminated tumor cells in vivo by fostering integrin adhesion assembly to permit G1 cell cycle progression. We engineered tumor cells to display glycocalyces of various thicknesses by coating them with synthetic mucin-mimetic glycopolymers. Cells adorned with longer glycopolymers showed increased metastatic potential, enhanced cell cycle progression, and greater levels of integrin-FAK mechanosignaling and Akt signaling in a syngeneic mouse model of metastasis. These effects were mirrored by expression of the ectodomain of cancer-associated mucin MUC1. These findings functionally link mucinous proteins with tumor aggression, and offer a new view of the cancer glycocalyx as a major driver of disease progression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>glycocalyx</kwd><kwd>mucins</kwd><kwd>integrins</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>cell proliferation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM59907</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weaver</surname><given-names>Valerie M</given-names></name><name><surname>Bertozzi</surname><given-names>Carolyn R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31CA200544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Woods</surname><given-names>Elliot C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mucins, long associated with cancer aggression, remodel the cancer glycocalyx in a way that promotes proliferation in the metastatic site by enhancing integrin-mediated adhesion and thus driving cell cycle progression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell surface mucins, such as MUC1 and MUC16, are so consistently upregulated in epithelial cancers that they are considered reliable biomarkers of the disease.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bast et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rahn et al., 2001</xref>) Despite their importance for diagnosis and prognosis, the mechanisms by which mucins might promote malignancy remain largely speculative.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kufe, 2009a</xref>) To date, the majority of studies exploring the role of mucins in determining tumor phenotype have focused on the signaling function of these molecules, which resides within their short cytoplasmic tail. Yet, a striking and defining feature of cell surface mucins is their long, densely glycosylated ectodomain, which can extend hundreds of nanometers from the plasma membrane.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hattrup and Gendler, 2008</xref>) Consequently, mucins can profoundly enhance the bulk physical properties of the glycocalyx, which is a composite of the polysaccharides and glycoproteins that project from the plasma membrane and decorate all cells.</p><p>We recently showed that the bulk physical properties of the glycocalyx can exert profound effects on cellular behavior. These effects include a reorganization of cell surface receptors such as integrins. This reorganization alters their activation state and influences not only their ability to interact with extracellular matrix (ECM) ligands but also their synergistic downstream signaling with growth factor receptors.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paszek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Freeman et al., 2016</xref>) By occluding the majority of binding sites, an expansive glycocalyx paradoxically promotes integrin clustering by creating a kinetic funnel in which integrins are most likely to bind to the ECM where bonds are already formed.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Paszek et al., 2009</xref>) In this regard, in vitro studies revealed that increasing the bulkiness of the glycocalyx enhanced the ability of nonmalignant mammary epithelial cells to grow and survive under minimally adhesive conditions whereas otherwise the cells underwent anoikis.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paszek et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woods et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Desgrosellier and Cheresh, 2010</xref>) Whether a bulky glycocalyx similarly modulates cell growth and survival in vivo, however, has yet to be unambiguously tested.</p><p>Importantly, we and others have also noted that tumor aggression is frequently associated with an increased expression of mucins which enhance the bulkiness of the glycocalyx and, similarly, that circulating epithelial tumor cells typically express an abundance of mucins.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paszek et al., 2014</xref>) Concomitantly, primary tumor xenografts that overexpress MUC1 grow and metastasize more aggressively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and mice deficient in MUC1 resist formation of spontaneous tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Spicer et al., 1995</xref>). Together, these observations raise the intriguing possibility that tumor associated mucin expression may foster tumor progression and aggression by enhancing either tumor cell growth and survival or both by modulating integrin and growth factor receptor signaling.</p><p>Herein, we report that increasing the thickness of the glycocalyx promotes tumor metastasis by permitting cell cycle progression to facilitate cell proliferation at the metastatic site. We modulated glycocalyx thickness both genetically through ectopic expression of a tailless (signaling defective) MUC1 and more definitively by coating cells with synthetic glycopolymers with long-term cell surface retention that were designed to emulate the structure of mucin ectodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woods et al., 2015</xref>) The longevity of the synthetic glycopolymers was facilitated by developing the chemistry so that the tail terminated in a cholesterylamine lipid at one end, which effectively drives spontaneous insertion into cell membranes based on mass action and the hydrophobic effect. We previously found that this particular lipid confers a long cell surface residence time to glycopolymer conjugates by mediating continuous recycling from an internal reservoir.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woods et al., 2015</xref>) The core of the glycopolymer comprises <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) residues affixed to a poly (methyl vinyl ketone [MVK]) backbone via oxime linkages. The spacing afforded by this structure approximates that of GalNAc-Î±-Ser/Thr clusters within native mucins. Likewise, GalNAc-modified poly (MVK) glycopolymers emulate the physical characteristics of native mucins such as length and stiffness.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Paszek et al., 2014</xref>) However, unlike the more complex glycans found in native mucins, which can engage in biochemical interactions,Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hudak et al., 2014</xref>) the GalNAc residues we used here are considered biochemically inert in mammalian systems. Thus, these synthetic structures allowed us to model mucinsâ biophysical contribution to the glycocalyx without any confounding contributions from their cytosolic or extracellular biochemical activity. As well, the living polymerization chemistry used to generate the glycodomains enabled precise control of polymer length with high homogeneity.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Godula et al., 2009</xref>) Living polymerization techniques allow for the synthesis of polymers of very homogeneous lengths, a necessity for the comparison of the effects of long and short polymers. In this work, we used short glycopolymers ofÂ ~3 nm in length (degree of polymerization (DP)Â =Â 36 monomer units) and long glycopolymers that wereÂ ~90 nm in length (DPÂ =Â 719 monomer units). As a point of comparison, integrin heterodimer pairs extend roughly 20 nm from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eng et al., 2011</xref>)</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25752.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The glycocalyx increases metastatic potential in a size dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Mucin-mimetic glycopolymers consist of a poly(methyl vinyl ketone) polymer with pendant GalNAc residues.

The nonmalignant mammary epithelial cell line, MCF-10A, offers a unique model for oncogenic progression.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Miller et al., 1993</xref>) These cells, though immortal, lack the ability to grow or survive efficiently in a soft matrix, and therefore serve as an ideal cell line to evaluate the effects of the glycocalyx on mammary epithelial cell behavior in the context of a metastatic site.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Paszek et al., 2005</xref>) Our prior studies suggested that a bulky glycocalyx permitted not only the survival but also the growth of these mammary epithelial cells in an in vitro model of a minimally adhesive microenvironment. Thus, we asked whether a bulky glycocalyx would permit both the survival and the growth and expansion of disseminated mammary epithelial cells in vivo. MCF-10A cells were painted with our glycopolymers, then injected into the venous system of nude mice, where they accumulated in the lungs regardless of glycopolymer length. We found that those cells treated with long glycopolymer mucin-mimetics survived longer, as demonstrated by delayed activation of the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (CC3), than those decorated with short glycopolymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with our in vitro studies. Nevertheless, the cells eventually died and therefore ultimately failed to form metastatic lesions, leaving us unable to determine the potential effect of the glycocalyx on proliferation. Thus, to unambiguously address whether or not a bulky glycocalyx might influence tumor behavior and metastasis by regulating cell proliferation, independent of cell survival, we assessed the influence of the glycopolymers on the growth and metastatic efficiency of the dormant-prone tumor cell line from the syngeneic 4TO7/Balbc model.</p><p>The murine cell line 4TO7 is a Balb/c syngeneic mammary carcinoma that is able to efficiently disseminate and survive for prolonged periods of time at metastatic sites such as the lung.Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aslakson and Miller, 1992</xref>) However, the tumor cells in this model form predominately dormant tumors because they are unable to proliferate efficiently at the target site. These 4TO7 cells, therefore, provided us the ideal model to specifically address the contribution of a bulky glycocalyx on cell proliferation and G1 cell cycle transit in vivo.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>The glycocalyx increases metastatic potential in a size dependent manner</title><p>We first confirmed that the mucin-mimetic glycopolymers were long-lived on 4TO7 cell surfaces in culture, as previously found with other cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woods et al., 2015</xref>) Next, we grew mApple-luciferase fusion-transfected 4TO7 cells to subconfluency, painted them with glycopolymers, then injected them into the tail veins of Balb/c mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Veins lead directly to the right heart where cells next meet the capillary beds of the lungs and are lodged. Every 4â5 days mice were anesthetized and given an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of luciferin for bioluminescence imaging (BLI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). By day 13, mice injected with 4TO7 cells coated with long glycopolymers were generating greater photon flux, on average, than their counterparts injected with short glycopolymer-treated cells, suggesting a higher density of luciferase-expressing cells and thus an increased tumor burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In particular, we noted that the increase in BLI over time in the long glycopolymer group appeared to approximate an exponential growth-type trend, while the short group did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Importantly, we measured no significant difference in accumulation of tumor cells in the lungs between treatment groups as measured by BLI at Day 0.</p><p>On day 15, the mice were sacrificed and necropsies were performed. We observed gross differences in tumor burden between glycopolymer treatment groups (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Lungs were weighed wet then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde and embedded in paraffin wax for whole histological sectioning. Hematoxylin and eosin (H and E) staining revealed qualitative differences in tumor burden, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining for mApple confirmed that tumors were derived from exogenous mApple-luciferase transfected 4TO7 cells and did not arise de novo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G and H</xref>).</p><p>Lung tissue is spongy and consists of an abundance of negative space that can be filled with air during respiration. Tumors, by comparison, are dense and contain relatively little negative space. Consequently, in a vein-to-lung model of metastasis, lung mass can be a strong indicator of tumor burden. We found that the lungs of mice injected with 4TO7 cells endowed with a bulky glycocalyx were significantly heavier than lungs from mice injected with short glycopolymer-bearing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In addition to mass, we directly quantitated the number of mets per lung. For each mouse, we counted every met in the whole lung H and E section taken five millimeters (mm) into sectioning. Long glycopolymer-treated 4TO7 cells produced, on average, more than twice the number of mets per mouse when compared to short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Thus, merely increasing the thickness of the glycocalyx was sufficient to increase the metastatic potential of otherwise poorly metastasizing murine carcinoma cells. Importantly, the short glycopolymers did not increase the metastatic potential of 4TO7 cells when compared to mock (PBS) treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Metastasis is an inefficient processâfew circulating tumor cells actually give rise to metastatic tumorsâand the prevailing view is that survival and proliferation at the secondary site is rate limiting.(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chambers et al., 2002</xref>) Therefore, we wondered if this increased metastatic potential could be due to increased growth, survival, or both.</p><p>Quantitative immunofluorescence (IF) imaging of phosphorylated histone H3 (pH3)âa marker of mitosisâand cleaved caspase-3 (CC3)âa marker of apoptosisârevealed that mets from long glycopolymer-treated cells had higher rates of proliferation than those from cells treated with short glycopolymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and L</xref>). But, the rates of apoptosis were similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K and M</xref>). While surprising at first, given our knowledge that a thick glycocalyx improves survival in minimal adhesion settings, we reasoned that by day 15 the survival phenotype had likely run its courseâcells unable to survive in that niche may have died days earlier. These data corroborated our BLI results and indicated that the glycocalyx likely affects metastatic proliferative competency in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A thick glycocalyx drives cell cycle progression via the PI3K-Akt axis</title><p>To gain mechanistic insight into this apparent proliferative effect, we tested the effects of modulating glycocalyx thickness on cell growth in a soft matrix in vitro model.

A bulky glycocalyx increased Akt phosphorylation (pAkt), a proxy for activation, on soft gels relative to that in cells with short glycopolymers, while Erk phosphorylation, however, remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). The same effect on pAkt was seen on 4TO7 cells in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>).

Consistent with this finding, we repeated the colony formation experiments and found that proliferation of long glycopolymer-painted cells was blocked by an inhibitor of phosphoinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), an upstream activator of Akt, or an inhibitor of MEKâa MAPK downstream of growth factor receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).

From this vantage point, mucins are prime targets for therapeutic intervention and warrant increased focus on avenues for their disruption.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mucin-mimetic glycopolymers</title><p>Glycopolymers were synthesized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Woods et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, lipid-conjugated RAFT agents were synthesized, from which methyl vinyl ketone was polymerized, to generate polymers of various lengths with low polydispersities. The ketone pendant groups were functionalized with alkoxy-amine containing <italic>N</italic>-acetylgalactosamine monomers and purified to give the final lipid-terminated glycopolymers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF-10As were acquired from ATCC (CLR-10317), met the published morphological characteristics described on ATCC, used within 30 passages, confirmed to be mycoplasma free, and maintained in recommended media: DMEM/F12 without phenol red, supplemented to contain 5% horse serum (Invitrogen,Â Carlsbad,Â CA), EGF (20 ng/ml from Peprotech, Rock Hill, NJ), hydrocortisone (0.5 mg/ml from Sigma,Â St.Â Louis,Â MO), cholera toxin (100 ng/ml from Sigma), insulin (10 Âµg/ml from Sigma) and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.</p><p>4TO7 cells were a kind gift from Dr. Philip Owens (Vanderbilt University), met the morphologic characteristics described on ATCC, used within 30 passages, confirmed to be mycoplasma free and were maintained in DMEM with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Glycopolymer loading onto cell surfaces</title><p>Lipid-anchored glycopolymers spontaneously insert into cell membranes due to the hydrophobic effect and mass action. Where noted in experimental sections below, cells in suspension are mixed with stock concentrates of aqueous solutions of glycopolymers and allowed to be labeled for 1 hr at room temperature. The cells are then pelleted, the labeling solution aspirated, and the excess glycopolymers washed away by an additional dilution-pelleting step.

Quotients were obtained by dividing either the number of positive nuclei (pH3) or mean pixel intensity (other antibodies) by the number of nucleiâthereby accounting for tumor density or size in our image analysis. Quotients were normalized to negative controls and plotted as normalized average signal per cell.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors would like to thank Dr. Jon Lakins for the rtTA lentiviral vector.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Johanna Ivaska as the Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Ron Schnaar (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Aberrant expression of MUC1 is found in the majority of carcinomas and in hematological cancers. It has been demonstrated earlier by the authors of this manuscript that addition of ~80nm glycoprotein mimetics or enforced expression of MUC1 stimulates survival and proliferation of non-transformed MECs on soft substrates that would otherwise not support survival (Nature 2015). It was also found that oncogenic transformation, which allows these MECs to proliferate on soft substrates, is accompanied by increased expression of MUC1 on these cells. This earlier work indicated that a thicker glycocalyx augments growth-promoting integrin signaling through tension applied to ECM-bound integrins.</p><p>In the current manuscript, the authors extend their work and show that expression of a tailless MUC1 mutant or coating with a ~90nm synthetic GalcNAc polymer is sufficient to support outgrowth of IV-injected 4TO7 breast cancer cells in the mouse lung. This represents a new finding, demonstrating that manipulation of the glycocalyx at the extracellular surface, rather than signaling by MUCs drives metastatic outgrowth. Mechanistic studies in vitro revealing that MCF10A cells coated with large polymers show proliferation even on soft substrates is largely a confirmation of previous work (Nature 2015). The idea that FAK and PI3K-AKT signaling as well as cyclin D accumulation is increased on soft substrates and in metastatic lesions in the presence of the large polymers, extends the previous work but in its current form is not fully convincing.</p><p>Overall the reviewers find the work interesting, largely novel, and the data in the manuscript to be mainly of good quality. However, additional controls are required and further exploration of alternative explanations of the data should be considered. In addition, more Introduction/Discussion regarding the kinetic funneling concept are needed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> â controls are required showing what the metastatic potential of parental 4T07 cells are in this experimental set up. There is significant metastatic formation following treatment of the cells with the short polymer even though there is no signal activation in the in vitro model with this polymer. Therefore it is necessary to show whether this polymer is also having a significant effect in vivo.</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: It is important to rigorously rule out that the bulky glycocalyx in fact increases the propensity of IV injected tumor cells to get stuck in the lung vasculature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the number of macroscopically detectable lung mets is higher in the presence of the long polymer. Is this in any way related to more cells getting trapped? For this, lung tissue can be isolated at early time points post injection (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the number of trapped tumor cells quantitatively determined by qPCR.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> versus 2, 3: Why do the authors switch from 4TO7 to MCF10A here? The in vivo work is with 4TO7, the in vitro experiments with MCF10A. We agree that MCF10A is a good model but are the same results seen with 4TO7 cells? Are 4TO7 cells indeed not showing proliferation on soft substrates and is FAK, PI3K-AKT signaling, cyclin D accumulation in those cells under those conditions stimulated by the long polymers? Not all experiments, but at least confirmation of a few key findings across these two models would be required to directly relate in vitro work in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> to the in vivo experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and 4.</p><p>4) How valid is it to compare the signaling events in the in vitro model with those seen in vivo? For example activation of AKT signaling was reported in vitro but not shown in vivo. pAKT IHC should be carried out on lung metastases in the experiments described for the polymer coated cells and also those where MUC1ÎCT-expressing cells were used. Only then can the authors claim that the PI3K/AKT pathway plays a role in the lung environment.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>: Increased pH3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and FAK-pY925 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) on soft substrate coated with FN in presence of long polymers is clear. However, increased cyclin D levels (compared to PBS and short polymer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and increased AKT phosphorylation (compared to PBS control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) are not convincing at all and increased FAK-pY397 is very modest at best (compared to PBS and short polymer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Western blots are indicated by the authors to be representative of at least 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) experiments. If this is the best example, this data is not convincing. Notably, the effects on pH3 and colony size are clear so the effect on proliferation is well-demonstrated. However, specifically for cyclin D, p-AKT, and p-Y397FAK data, the authors should present WB data where differences are convincing and rigorous quantification of 3 or more biologically independent experiments need to be provided.</p><p>6) pH3 analysis was carried out on 3-4 tumors per mouse. Does the level of positivity depend on the size of the individual tumors? As this analysis was carried out at a single time point it provides a snapshot of proliferation at that time. It may be that reduced proliferation in the short polymer treated cells reflects a delay in their initial growth (and therefore size of the individual tumors) and not one of reduced proliferation per se. The same argument could be made for the cyclin D1 analysis.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: were the mice fed doxycline? What are the levels of MUC1ÎCT at the time of sacrifice? If the expression is not maintained for the duration of the experiment it could again suggest that the effects of MUC1ÎCT may be mediated at very early stages of tumor cell arrest and extravasation in the lung.</p><p>8) Cells were &quot;painted.â¦ with glycopolymers&quot; but the methods used are not apparent within the manuscript. Details sufficient for reproducing this aspect of the experimental approach would be welcome.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A bulky glycocalyx fosters metastasis formation by promoting G1 cell cycle progression&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Evaluation of your article has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Philip Cole as the Senior Editor.</p><p>After discussion, the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors have revised the manuscript considerably and addressed many of the previous points raised by the reviewers. However, it is felt that two of the main points need further work (see below).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>&quot;Point 3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> versus 2, 3: Why do the authors switch from 4TO7 to MCF10A here? The in vivo work is with 4TO7, the in vitro experiments with MCF10A. We agree that MCF10A is a good model but are the same results seen with 4TO7 cells? Are 4TO7 cells indeed not showing proliferation on soft substrates and is FAK, PI3K-AKT signaling, cyclin D accumulation in those cells under those conditions stimulated by the long polymers?

However, it was not clear to the reviewers why 4T07 cells were not studied 'in vitro' in terms of cell signaling. It would seem that these cells can be analyzed in culture since the authors discuss growing them to sub-confluency.

There is significant metastatic formation following treatment of the cells with the short polymer even though there is no signal activation in the in vitro model with this polymer. Therefore it is necessary to show whether this polymer is also having a significant effect in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up a very important point: our negative control (short glycopolymer-bearing cells) requires validation. We have added a new supplementary figure to illustrate that validation: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>. We can determine the effect of short glycopolymers on metastasis by comparing the metastatic potential of cells treated with these glycopolymers or merely mock treated with PBS. The negative control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> â doxycycline withheld cells â is effectively mock-treated naÃ¯ve 4TO7 cells, so we constructed this new figure by compiling the data from this control experiment with the one from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, which uses short glycopolymer-bearing cells. The figure demonstrates that short glycopolymer-bearing cells cause no increase in tumor burden as measured by quantitative bioluminescence imaging (A), lung mass (B), or number of frank mets (C) compared to PBS-treated cells. We have added reference to this new figure in the third paragraph of the subsection âThe glycocalyx increases metastatic potential in a size dependent mannerâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>: It is important to rigorously rule out that the bulky glycocalyx in fact increases the propensity of IV injected tumor cells to get stuck in the lung vasculature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that the number of macroscopically detectable lung mets is higher in the presence of the long polymer. Is this in any way related to more cells getting trapped? For this, lung tissue can be isolated at early time points post injection (days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and the number of trapped tumor cells quantitatively determined by qPCR.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an important potential explanation. The experiments in the paper do actually address this question, but perhaps in a way that would not benefit the reader as originally written. The graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> show that we measured bioluminescence of the mice on day 0, just 4 hours after injection when, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, only those cells stuck in the lungs are left after clearing from the rest of the vasculature. By comparing photon flux at this time point, we can quantitatively measure the number of trapped tumor cells (since the mice themselves generate essentially zero background photons). The treatment groups show no significant increase in accumulated tumor cells relative to controls â see below. We have added a sentence explaining and hopefully making clear this finding in the first paragraph of the subsection âThe glycocalyx increases metastatic potential in a size dependent mannerâ.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25752.019</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-25752-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> versus 2, 3: Why do the authors switch from 4TO7 to MCF10A here? The in vivo work is with 4TO7, the in vitro experiments with MCF10A. We agree that MCF10A is a good model but are the same results seen with 4TO7 cells? Are 4TO7 cells indeed not showing proliferation on soft substrates and is FAK, PI3K-AKT signaling, cyclin D accumulation in those cells under those conditions stimulated by the long polymers? Not all experiments, but at least confirmation of a few key findings across these two models would be required to directly relate in vitro work in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> to the in vivo experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and 4.</p></disp-quote><p>To build upon the work in the 2014 Paszek et al.paper, in which we used MCF-10A cells as an in vitro model, we tested the ability of these same cells to seed metastases in our tail-vein-to-lung model. At early time points, we observed a delay in the onset of anchorage-dependent cell death based on glycocalyx size, just as in our in vitro model. Long glycopolymers seem to delay the onset of cell death as shown by the apoptosis marker cleaved caspase-3 (CC3). Being nontransformed cells, however, the MCF-10A cells were incapable of forming frank metastases. Eventually, the cells did die, likely because metastasis formation also relies upon additional factors including activation of an angiogenic response and immune cell evasion â two parameters extending well beyond the scope of the current proposal. This prevented us from being able to assess any effect the glycocalyx may have had on <italic>proliferation</italic> specifically.</p><p>Thus in order to study the effect of glycocalyx bulkiness on G1 cell cycle progression and cell proliferation, we moved to a new model â that of the syngeneic 4TO7/Balbc model. Upon tail vein injection, the cells in this model survive for extended periods of time in the lung. They fail, however, to proliferate and thus have been used extensively as a model of micrometastatic tumor dormancy. This dormancy &quot;prone&quot; tumor cell line, therefore, permitted us to specifically address the contribution of a bulky glycocalyx on cell proliferation and G1 cell cycle transit in vivo.</p><p>In our newly revised manuscript, we have outlined the rationale for the use of these different breast epithelial models including their complementary strengths/weaknesses and expanded the discussion of their use in the first paragraph of the Results. To demonstrate, as the reviewers requested, key findings of integrin activation across these two models, in our revised article we now include data from the aforementioned MCF-10A in vivo studies in a new supplementary figure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>. This important experiment not only validates critical in vitro findings in an in vivo setting, but the data also demonstrate the utility of the 4TO7/Balbc dormancy model, which permits a more direct exploration of the impact of the glycocalyx on cell proliferation in the metastatic settingin vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How valid is it to compare the signaling events in the in vitro model with those seen in vivo? For example activation of AKT signaling was reported in vitro but not shown in vivo. pAKT IHC should be carried out on lung metastases in the experiments described for the polymer coated cells and also those where MUC1ÎCT-expressing cells were used. Only then can the authors claim that the PI3K/AKT pathway plays a role in the lung environment.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the pAkt signaling should be apparent in the in vivo model as well. To address this, we performed IF-IHC on tissue sections from the experiments described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and 4. We have included these data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref> as well as made reference to their inclusion in the fifth paragraph of the subsection âA thick glycocalyx drives cell cycle progression via the PI3K-Akt axisâ and in the last paragraph of the subsection âThe MUC1 ectodomain is sufficient to increase the metastatic potential of 4TO7 cancer cellsâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>: Increased pH3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and FAK-pY925 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) on soft substrate coated with FN in presence of long polymers is clear. However, increased cyclin D levels (compared to PBS and short polymer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) and increased AKT phosphorylation (compared to PBS control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) are not convincing at all and increased FAK-pY397 is very modest at best (compared to PBS and short polymer in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Western blots are indicated by the authors to be representative of at least 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) or 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) experiments. If this is the best example, this data is not convincing. Notably, the effects on pH3 and colony size are clear so the effect on proliferation is well-demonstrated. However, specifically for cyclin D, p-AKT, and p-Y397FAK data, the authors should present WB data where differences are convincing and rigorous quantification of 3 or more biologically independent experiments need to be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers have requested, we have quantified all of the western blot data for cyclin D1, pAkt and pFAKY397. The quantitative results confirm our subjective conclusions, and illustrate them in a more objective manner. This quantification was accomplished as follows: densitometry was performed on the blots, absolute intensity was normalized relative to the tubulin loading control and then normalized to the positive control lane (in each case, this was the band from cells loaded on stiff gels). Normalized values from replicate blots were averaged and are plotted in new supplementary figures as follows: cyclin D and pAkt were added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2</xref>, and pFAKY397 quantitation was added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>. We also added references to these new figures in the third paragraph of the subsection âA thick glycocalyx drives cell cycle progression via the PI3K-Akt axisâ and in the first paragraph of the subsection âA thick glycocalyx stimulates integrin-FAK mechanosignalingâ. These data bolster our in vivo findings illustrating the role of these markers in the tumor model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) pH3 analysis was carried out on 3-4 tumors per mouse. Does the level of positivity depend on the size of the individual tumors? As this analysis was carried out at a single time point it provides a snapshot of proliferation at that time. It may be that reduced proliferation in the short polymer treated cells reflects a delay in their initial growth (and therefore size of the individual tumors) and not one of reduced proliferation per se. The same argument could be made for the cyclin D1 analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have accounted for this possible bias in our image analysis. Image analysis software was used to quantify the number of nuclei present in the tumor in each image. The number of âpositiveâ pH3 nuclei â determined by a signal intensity threshold algorithmically in ImageJ â is then divided by the number of total nuclei. So the values are normalized for the number of nuclei present in the image (i.e. the size or density of the tumor) and they, therefore, do not affect our quantification. We have added clarification to this effect in the Materials and methods subsection âQuantification of immunofluorescenceâ.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>: were the mice fed doxycline? What are the levels of MUC1ÎCT at the time of sacrifice? If the expression is not maintained for the duration of the experiment it could again suggest that the effects of MUC1ÎCT may be mediated at very early stages of tumor cell arrest and extravasation in the lung.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are correct that the mice are not fed doxycycline, and we have updated the Materials and methods section to make this more clear. The rational was that the glycopolymers, which emulate the effects of mucins such as MUC1, cannot be continuously administered, and so they also dilute out over time (and proliferative generations). While the effects of the MUC1 ectodomain may indeed be mediated at early stages of metastasis, the in vitro experiments demonstrating a proliferative phenotype were performed at these early time points with this in mind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Cells were &quot;painted.â¦ with glycopolymers&quot; but the methods used are not apparent within the manuscript. Details sufficient for reproducing this aspect of the experimental approach would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors apologize for not making this clear in the original manuscript, since the glycopolymers play such an integral role to our experimentation. Their use was detailed in individual experimental Materials and methods sections, but we have added a new subsection to the Materials and methods entitled âGlycopolymer loading onto cell surfacesâ with the inclusion of reference to a paper describing both the synthesis and characterization of these glycopolymers. We hope this clarifies the procedure for readers.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>&quot;Point 3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> versus 2, 3: Why do the authors switch from 4TO7 to MCF10A here?

It would seem that these cells can be analyzed in culture since the authors discuss growing them to sub-confluency. We thus ask the authors to investigate the FAK, PI3K-AKT, and cyclin D status in 4T07 as this would be important to demonstrate the generality and robustness of the main findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, 4TO7 cells can be analyzed in culture, and so we performed the experiments as requested above. 4TO7 cells were cultured, painted with long or short glycopolymers, then plated on soft (400 Pa) polyacrylamide gels with or without EGF challenge before being analyzed by immunoblotting. We found that, like MCF-10A cells, 4TO7 cells demonstrated increased FAK phosphorylation and increased Akt activation when long glycopolymers were used to bolster their glycocalyces when compared to short glycopolymers. Cyclin D1 expression levels, however, did not change in vitro. We posit that this is due to 4TO7 being a transformed cell line which gains only a marginal increase in cell-cycle driving forces with an increased glycocalyx in the rich environment of cell culture. This is demonstrated by our negative control conditions: cyclin D1 expression in PBS treated cells on soft gels. MCF-10A cells in these conditions demonstrate very little cyclin D1 expression, whereas 4TO7 cells show robust levels of cyclin D1 expression, even on soft gels with mock treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>). In addition, the nontransformed cell line MCF-10A does benefit from the increase in glycocalyx size in vitro, and our analysis of 4TO7 metastases in vivo demonstrates a glycocalyx length-dependency on cyclin D1 expression. For all of these results, we repeated the experiments at least thrice and quantified the results along with calculated p values. The data have been added as a combination of new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> as well as the new supplementary figure: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>.
