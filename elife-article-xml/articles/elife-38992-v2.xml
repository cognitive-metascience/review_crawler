organ expansion via peripheral interactions with nephron progenitor cells. A recent study suggested that termination of tip branching within the developing kidney involved stochastic exhaustion in response to nephron formation, with such a termination event representing a unifying developmental process evident in many organs. To examine this possibility, we have profiled the impact of nephron formation and maturation on elaboration of the ureteric bud during mouse kidney development. We find a distinct absence of random branch termination events within the kidney or evidence that nephrogenesis impacts the branching program or cell proliferation in either tip or progenitor cell niches. Instead, organogenesis proceeds in a manner indifferent to the development of these structures. Hence, stochastic cessation of branching is not a unifying developmental feature in all branching organs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38992.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During development and before birth, many organs develop from branched tubes.

Branching typically begins with the formation of a bud like organ anlage which then proceeds to grow and divide, usually by bifurcation. The resulting network of interconnected epithelial tubules serves to break up the larger tissue masses in which they form, facilitating the exchange of oxygen (lungs) and nutrients (vasculature) and the transport of waste (kidneys) or secretions (glands). In some organs like the kidneys and lungs, the process of branching proceeds as a result of the orchestrated interaction of cells at the tips of the branching epithelium and specialized surrounding mesenchymal cells. In others, like the mammary gland, epithelial growth and arborisation occurs through collective cell migration in the absence of specific associated mesenchyma. In the kidneys, the ureteric bud (UB) elaborates (from embryonic day (E)11.5 in mice) within a field of specified cells known as the metanephric mesenchyme, which coalesces to form cap mesenchyme (CM) niches closely associated with each of the UB tips. These CM cells are nephron progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Kobayashi et al., 2008</xref>), sub-populations of which sequentially commit to form nephrons as development progresses. They do so by first forming pre-tubular aggregates which undergo mesenchymal to epithelial transition to form renal vesicles (RV) that differentiate into comma- and S-shaped bodies that elongate and mature to form nephrons. Because the network established by the branching UB will ultimately form the urine collecting system, the nascent nephrons reconnect to the tip from which they were generated at the comma stage and establish a patent lumen through which urine can be transported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Kao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Georgas et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The pervasive role of branching morphogenesis in shaping the development of many organs poses the question as to whether it is governed by shared mechanisms or features. A recent paper by Hannezo et al. has proposed a ‘unifying theory of branching morphogenesis’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hannezo et al., 2017</xref>). This work, based principally on studies in the mammary gland, posits that the elongating tips of the branching mammary tree randomly explore their environment but cease branching and proliferation when in proximity to neighboring branches. It further proposes that developmental morphogenesis in many organs occurs by employing similar stochastic, self-organized approaches characterized by branching and annihilating random walks (BARW). In the kidney, the cessation of branching explicit in the BARW model was proposed to derive from the differentiation of nephrons at individual UB tips. We have investigated a central tenet of this theory - the premise that nephron formation triggers cessation of branching. In doing so, we have examined the broader impact of nephron formation and integration on the behavior of both UB tip and nephron progenitor cell niches. The relationship between these populations is critically important for establishing nephron endowment in the adult kidney; a metric increasingly thought to influence susceptibility to kidney disease and broader physiological measures such as blood pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Luyckx et al., 2013</xref>). We find no evidence that nephron formation can influence the extent of ureteric branching in the developing kidney nor does it alter tip or cap cell proliferation. This indicates that stochastic cessation of branching does not operate during kidney development and demonstrates that nephrogenesis has little to no impact on the progress of branching morphogenesis or the behavior of tip or CM progenitor cells in the developing organ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We have previously profiled the size and cell behavior of the CM and UB tip niches in the developing kidney and correlated this with the rate of branching in the organ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Short et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Short et al., 2014</xref>). This study showed that branching is most rapid in the period between E12.5 and E17.5 but did not examine, in detail, the relationship between nephron formation and branching itself. To do so, we used high resolution confocal microscopy to profile the number of connected nephrons per tip from E12.5 through to the cessation of nephron formation at postnatal day 3 (PN3). One prediction of the annihilation model in which nephron formation triggers cessation of branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Hannezo et al., 2017</xref>), is that nephron formation should not precede the branching process (which the model predicts nephron formation will halt). Analysis of our confocal data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) indicates that almost all the tips of the branching ureteric tree carry an attached nephron 72 hr after branching initiates (87% at E14.5) and that further nephrons are added as development (and branching) progresses. We next utilized organ explant cultures to provide supporting evidence that ongoing branching of tips with associated nephrons was indeed possible. Developing kidneys grown in culture lose the 3D structure of an in vivo organ, but retain local CM-UB interactions including branching morphogenesis and nephron induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Lindström et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Combes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Watanabe and Costantini, 2004</xref>). Using a Hoxb7-GFP transgene to visualise the ureteric epithelium and bright field illumination to identify forming nephrons across time, we observed tips with attached nephrons undergoing bifurcation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38992.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The proportion of ureteric bud tips associated with one or more connected nephrons as a product of developmental time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of developing fetal and early postnatal kidneys in which the proportion of ureteric bud tips with 1 or more nephrons which had re-integrated into their associated ureteric bud tips are quantified (left y-axis, blue and orange bars; assessed at E12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, 17.5, 19.5, PN2 and PN3).

Notwithstanding the results derived from organ culture, this observation raises the formal possibility that nephron formation might still impede the branching of tips - but not their growth. In this scenario, for any given tip in which branching (but not growth) had ceased, it would be necessary for the branch to lengthen over time in order to maintain its position on the organ surface. If extension of non-branching, nephron-associated tips were continuing we would expect that the maximum tip length would grow with the size of the kidney. Since only a small proportion of tips at any given stage might cease branching, we used the maximum tip length per organ to assess this possibility (rather than the mean tip length, which might mask any such effects). Using this approach, no evidence of maximum tip length extension was observed relative to the increase in axial radius of the fetal organ with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, p=0.95). Furthermore, if branching were to cease in a subpopulation of developing tips, their generation should remain static at subsequent stages. We therefore examined the distribution of tip branch generations (the number of branch segments between the root of the tree and each of the tips) but found no evidence of static branch generations. Instead, the distributions indicate continued branching of all tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38992.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The relationship between branching morphogenesis and developmental time.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis of maximal terminal tip length and axial radius of the kidney shows no relationship between the two measures (p=0.95, lm linear regression in R) at different developmental time points (where n = 6,5,7,5,5,4 for increasing time points, respectively).

We then examined the broader effects that nephron formation had on cell behaviors associated with nephron formation. In the mammary gland, proximity-associated annihilation of branching has been associated with a profound decrease in cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Scheele et al., 2017</xref>). To examine whether stochastic or more subtle differences in tip cell division might be driven by nephron formation, proliferating cells in embryos at E13.5 and E17.5 and pups at P2 were labelled with a pulse of the nucleotide analogue EdU and kidneys collected and stained for subsequent confocal imaging of nephrogenic niches. This analysis allowed us to directly relate cell proliferation with the number of connected and associated nephron structures. We found that cell division in the tip cell niches decreases as development progresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; p&lt;1e<sup>−5</sup>, one-way ANOVA between any two stages), which is consistent with our previously reported studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Short et al., 2014</xref>). However, we found little association between cell division and the number of total or connected nephron structures (at E13.5, p=0.0587/0.79 (connected/total nephron structures), n = 49; E17.5, p=0.155/0.0296, n = 50; P2, p=0.06687/0.4772, n = 50, one-way ANOVA). The only exception was at E17.5 where there was a weak but significant association between total associated structures, but this was not significant when examining connected nephrons. We then extended this analysis to profile the same measures in the nephron progenitors associated with each tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) to determine whether the differentiation of nephrons might instead impact on the behavior of this cell niche. We found a similar (and previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Short et al., 2014</xref>]) time-dependent decrease in the rate of proliferation (p&lt;1e<sup>−5</sup>, one way ANOVA), which is consistent with recent work detailing the progressive ageing of these cells and the accumulation of intrinsic characteristics, which affect their contribution to nephrogenic programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). However, we again found little relationship between the number of nephrons derived from and/or associated with a given cap cell niche and the rate of cell proliferation in that niche (E13.5, p=0.01827/0.3654 (connected/total nephron structures), n = 49; E17.5, p=0.3435/0.1503, n = 50; P2, p=0.06605/0.921, n = 50, one-way ANOVA). Together these analyses provide no compelling evidence for an association between nephrogenesis and tip/cap niche proliferation together at any one stage of development.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38992.012</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The relationship between cell proliferation nephron endowment.</title><p>EdU labelling was used to quantify cell proliferation in the tip (<bold>A</bold>) and cap (<bold>B</bold>) cell niches.

Multiple lines of evidence suggest that this is not the case. Integrated nephrons are a feature of almost all tips in the actively branching kidney and live imaging of cultured organs highlights active branching in the presence of attached nephrons. Moreover, hallmarks of ceased branching are not evident in the analysis of terminal tip lengths, the progressive distribution of branch generations over time, rates of cell division or in the correlation between nephron number and branching history of a given tip. In particular, we have found little evidence for a relationship between nephron number and cell proliferation in either the tip cell niches (where the nephrons integrate) or in the nephron progenitor cells of the cap mesenchyme from which they derive. The latter observation suggests that nephron progenitors are fated to differentiate based on an internal ‘clock like’ mechanism which is consistent with recent studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2015</xref>). It remains to determine the manner in which individual nephrons remain associated with their tips of origin. Based on our findings, branching morphogenesis during kidney development is a process which differs considerably from the mammary gland. Although they develop in a superficially similar manner (i.e. through arborisation of an epithelium anlage) the cellular events which direct these processes and which shape branching are likely significantly different and not dictated by a ‘unifying’ developmental mechanism. Instead, we favour a model in which renal branching more closely mirrors that observed in the lung, another organ whose development is driven by reciprocal epithelial-mesenchymal interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Morrisey and Hogan, 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic <break/>reagent (Mus musculus)</td><td valign="top">Hoxb7-GFP</td><td valign="top">PMID: 10322632</td><td valign="top">MGI:Tg(Hoxb7-EGFP)33Cos/J; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_JAX:016251">IMSR_JAX:016251</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Pan-cytokeratin</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Abcam:AB11213; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_297852">AB_297852</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Ecadherin</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher</td><td valign="top">Thermo Fisher:13–1900; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_86571">AB_86571</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:400)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Trop2</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems</td><td valign="top">R and D Systems:AF1122; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2205662">AB_2205662</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Six2</td><td valign="top">Proteintech</td><td valign="top">Proteintech:115621AP; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2189084">AB_2189084</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:600)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial kit</td><td valign="top">Click-iT EdU Alexa Fluor 647 imaging kit</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies</td><td valign="top">Life Technologies:C10340</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Tree Surveyor</td><td valign="top">PMID: 23193168</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software</td><td valign="top">Drishti</td><td valign="top">doi: 10.1117/12.935640</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s3-1"><title>Kidney samples</title><p>C57Bl6/J mouse embryos were collected and individually staged based on limb and developmental (Theiler) criteria as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Short et al., 2013</xref>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Branching morphogenesis in the developing kidney is not impacted by nephron formation or integration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has reviewed by Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: David Bryant (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript seeks to test a &quot;unifying theory of branching morphogenesis&quot; proposed by Hannezo et al., 2017, which built from experimental and computational work in the mammary gland to argue that the cessation of branching in the developing kidney was triggered by the differentiation of nephrons at UB tips. The authors use a combination of powerful imaging methods, on cultured and fixed kidneys, to examine the relationship between ureteric bud tip branching and the formation of nephrons and their connection to the ureteric bud tips. The data show convincingly and quantitatively that ureteric bud growth, ureteric bud branching, and the proliferation of ureteric bud tip cells are all unaffected by nephron formation and connection. The reviewers were unanimous in finding that the study and manuscript demonstrate that the hypothesis from the Hannezo paper fails to explain branching morphogenesis in the kidney. Given the previous claims and the desire to identify general principles to explain branching across organs, this manuscript is timely and important and appropriate for the broad audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. In conclusion, the authors convincingly demonstrate – at least for the developing mouse kidney – that ureteric bud branching is not terminated by the formation of the nephron. In the physical sciences, it is common for theoretical work to motivate new experiments to test the limits of applicability of the theory. It is gratifying to have such an exchange in the field of organogenesis.</p><p>None of the reviewers identified essential experiments necessary for acceptance but the following minor points should be addressed.</p><p>1) Results and Discussion section, third paragraph. Figure 2D should be cited here, not Figure 2C.</p><p>2) Results and Discussion section. &quot;We extended this analysis to […] nephron progenitor cells&quot;. It is not obvious to me how proliferation of nephron progenitor cells is directly relevant to the model being tested, so this experiment requires a better justification in the text.</p><p>3) I think the ordinates of the graphs in Figure 3 should be labeled &quot;Proportion of proliferative tip epithelial cells&quot; and &quot;Proportion of proliferative cap mesenchyme cells&quot;.</p><p>4) Subsection “Kidney culture”. Please indicate the source of the 70 μm beads.</p><p>5) There was confusion amongst the reviewers as to whether data was collected for E16.5, E18.5 and PN1. If so, it should be supplied. If not, these labels should be removed from the X axis or it should be indicated somewhere that they were not examined. The reviewers found the trend in the biology clear from the other time points and so if the data are not available, new experiments are not essential.</p><p>6) Regarding Figure 1B, it was difficult for the reviewers to see the condensing mesenchyme into renal vesicles from the transmitted light images. Perhaps these could be presented in a clearer fashion, as they are likely evident in the bright field images. One problem might be that the white dotted lines can actually make it harder to see the nephrons, so they might also include the images without the white lines (perhaps bright field images without white lines and without the GFP (either below each image with white lines and GFP, or else in a supplementary figure).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38992.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Results and Discussion section, third paragraph.

Tip numbers were counted at the time points indicated by circles (with reference to the above comment, at E16.5 and E18.5) whilst the nephrons were counted at the time points indicated by the coloured graphs. No data was collected at PN1, but we wanted to maintain an equal scale in terms of developmental time on the X-axis so we included it. We have changed the Figure legend to detail exactly when each of these measures was assessed and hope that this serves to clarify things.</p><p>It now reads:</p><p>“(A) Analysis of developing fetal and early postnatal kidneys in which the proportion of ureteric bud tips with 1 or more nephrons which had re-integrated into their associated ureteric bud tips are quantified (left y-axis, blue and orange bars; assessed at E12.5, 13.5, 14.5, 15.5, 17.5, 19.5, PN2 and PN3). The number of tips at each developmental stage is also shown (right y-axis; assessed at E11.5, 12.5, 13.25, 13.75, 15.5, 16.5, 17.5, 18.5, 19.5 and PN2).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Regarding Figure 1B, it was difficult for the reviewers to see the condensing mesenchyme into renal vesicles from the transmitted light images.

We have now included Figure 1—figure supplement 1 without the overlay which we think better shows the formation and positioning of these structures. If the reviewers disagree we could look at other options (stripping out the gfp, presenting other views in z etc.). We are happy to be guided by the reviewers in this respect.</p></body></sub-article></article>
