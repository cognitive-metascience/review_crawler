Here, we introduce a single cell transcriptome atlas of the entire <italic>Drosophila</italic> first instar larval brain. We first assigned cell-type identity based on known marker genes, distinguishing five major groups: neural progenitors, differentiated neurons, glia, undifferentiated neurons and non-neural cells. All major classes were further subdivided into multiple subtypes, revealing biological features of various cell-types. We further assessed transcriptional changes in response to starvation at the single-cell level. While after starvation the composition of the brain remains unaffected, transcriptional profile of several cell clusters changed. Intriguingly, different cell-types show very distinct responses to starvation, suggesting the presence of cell-specific programs for nutrition availability. Establishing a single-cell transcriptome atlas of the larval brain provides a powerful tool to explore cell diversity and assess genetic profiles from developmental, functional and behavioral perspectives.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single cell transcriptome</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>larva</kwd><kwd>brain</kwd><kwd>cell diversity</kwd><kwd>nervous system</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_149499</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SystemsX- SynaptiX RTD</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruggmann</surname><given-names>Rémy</given-names></name><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_188471</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sprecher</surname><given-names>Simon G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell transcriptomics identifies cellular composition of the first instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain and the response to starvation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The brain, as the central organ of the nervous system, shows high complexity and diversity of cell-types. Numerous tasks need to be synchronously orchestrated, singular areas are committed to specific functions and ultimately cause or modulate an array of complex behaviors. The first instar <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> larval central nervous system (CNS) is composed of an estimated 10,000 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Scott et al., 2001</xref>). Only 2000 of these cells populate the two larval cerebral lobes, the remaining cells are distributed among segmental ganglia of the ventral nerve cord (VNC). The cells populating the larval brain develop from neuroblasts delaminated from the procephalic neurectoderm, during early embryonic stages. At the end of embryogenesis neurons are fully differentiated and form the functional neural circuits of the larval brain, while neuroblasts enter a mitotic quiescence phase and are only reactivated at the end of the first larval instar. Neuroblasts will re-enter proliferation and generate different cell-types that form the adult brain. During these steps, nutrient accessibility plays a key role. It has been previously described that some glial cells, in close proximity to the neuroblast populations, release insulin-like peptides upon nutrient-sensing. This signal is later incorporated by neuroblasts through the InR/PI3K/TORC1 pathway, to ultimately induce reactivation and exit from quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, at late-larval stages, NPCs seem to be able to proliferate even in aversive feeding conditions, independently of the InR/PI3K/TORC1 signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the lack of nutriments may affect the molecular profile of the specified cell-types, consequently modifying the cellular state and composition of the larval brain. Therefore, identifying genetic responses during brain development in normal feeding condition versus starvation may allow a better and more complete understanding of the processes regulated by the intake of nutrients at early life stages.</p><p>The simplicity in cell number, in comparison to other animals, makes <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva an ideal candidate to establish a comprehensive catalogue of brain cell-types based on morphologies, developmental trajectories and synaptic connections between each other. Recently, the advent of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) analysis further provides a high-resolution transcriptomic approach to decipher the molecular footprint at cellular resolution, as done to reveal the cell atlas of the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Konstantinides et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we used a single-cell transcriptomic approach to establish a molecular cell atlas of the first instar larval brain. In this way, we identified five major cell-types: neural progenitor cells, neurons, glial cells, undifferentiated neurons and non-neural cell-types. Among differentiated cells we characterized expression and co-expression of distinct types of neurotransmitters, neuromodulators and neuropeptides, as well as distinct types of glial cells. We differentiated three major classes of neural progenitor cells (NPCs): neuroblasts, optic lobe precursors as well as mushroom body neuroblasts. We further analyzed non-neural cells from tissues that are anatomically closely associated with the brain, such as the prothoracic gland, the ring gland, <italic>corpora allata</italic>, fat body and muscles. Moreover, we observed the presence of presumptive undifferentiated neurons. For the various classes of brain cell-types and subtypes, our work further extended the list of previously described marker genes, which in turn may be used for developmental or functional studies. Finally, we described single-cell changes at the transcriptional level in the larval brain driven by starvation. We identified different cell clusters that show strong responses in gene expression upon starvation. Expectedly, the most striking differences were observed in NPCs, glial cells and undifferentiated cells. Interestingly, the response to starvation differed between distinct clusters, suggesting the presence of cell specific programs to nutritional changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain reveals different categories of characteristic cell-types</title><p>To investigate cellular and molecular diversity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain, we performed single-cell transcriptomics analysis by applying 10X Genomics technology. In short, we dissected the CNS of late first instar larvae and separated the brain lobes from the VNC to enrich for cells populating the larval brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We obtained a cell atlas of the first instar larval brain with a total of 9353 cells and a median of 1658 genes per cell. The atlas is composed by cells from two different feeding conditions, normal feeding and 4 hr starvation prior brain dissection. Each experimental condition was treated separately and the libraries obtained were sequenced, aggregated and processed according to the standard pipeline for 10X single cell gene expression. In summary, the normal dataset comprised 4708 cells with a median of 1434 genes per cell and 836,393 mean reads per cell. While the starvation dataset comprised 4645 cells with a median of 1962 genes per cell and 545,512 mean reads per cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular composition of the Larval brain by Single-Cell RNA-Seq.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experimental procedure. <italic>Drosophila</italic> late first instar larval brains/ventral nerve cords (VNC) were dissected and the VNCs were removed.

The resulting 4349 cells, with 12,942 genes detected, were later clustered generating 29 initial cell-clusters that were subsequently visually represented using a novel learning technique for dimensional reduction, Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Clusters were manually annotated based on previously identified marker genes for specific cell-types, typically assessing the top 10 differentially expressed genes across clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). Among the 29 clusters, we distinguished five main cell type categories: differentiated neurons, NPCs, glial cells, undifferentiated neurons and a group of non-neural cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Differentiated neurons could be defined by the expression of the pan-neuronal marker <italic>embryonic lethal abnormal vision</italic> (<italic>elav)</italic>, presynaptic genes or widely expressed neurotransmitters, NPCs by <italic>Notch</italic> (<italic>N)</italic> or <italic>deadpan</italic> (<italic>dpn</italic>) expression, and glial cells by the expression of <italic>reversed polarity</italic> (<italic>repo)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Some of these cells displayed particular overlaps between their expression profiles, enabling a more simplified version of the UMAP plot with only 15 clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Within these clusters we distinguished mushroom body Kenyon Cells (KC), neurons expressing distinct peptides and neurotransmitter-releasing neurons, among the differentiated cells. While in the group of non-neural cells, we could differentiate cells coming from the ring gland, <italic>corpora allata</italic>, imaginal discs, hemolymph, lymph gland and fat tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The identification of these last category demonstrates that during the dissection protocol, while the VNC was removed, different organs remained at least partly attached to the brain. Interestingly these cells clustered separately, further highlighting the power of the methodology.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Mapping neural progenitor cell diversity reveals presence of characteristic neurogenic cell-types</title><p>Several clusters showed prominent expression of key genes involved in different steps of neurogenesis.

We observed that the different NPCs displayed distinct cell-cycle marker genes, resulting in a heterogenic population of cells. We found a larger number of cells in G1 and G2/M phases, in comparison to S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). These results further support recent observations, where G2 phase was shown to be an entry point to quiescence, alongside G0 phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otsuki and Brand, 2018</xref>). Surprisingly, a relevant number of NPCs expressing marker genes for S phase were observed, indicating that these cells may be replicating their genomic content in order to proliferate.

The recent publications on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> adult brain cell atlas re-opened this subject, by providing a list of co-expressed neuroactive molecules in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croset et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nässel, 2018</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the phenomenon of dual or multiple transmitter neurons in the larval brain. We analyzed all the possible combinations of the four very well-known marker genes for neurotransmitters: <italic>VGlut; VAChT; Gad1</italic> and <italic>Vmat</italic>. Remarkably, we found an overlap in all combinations, although the occurrence of these events represents a small fraction in the whole dataset. Dual-transmitter neurons were more frequent than triple-transmitter neurons, with the three highest overlap occurring between <italic>VGlut</italic> and <italic>Vmat</italic> (3%), followed by <italic>VGlut</italic> and <italic>VAChT</italic> (2%) and <italic>VGlut</italic> and <italic>Gad1</italic> (2%). Triple-transmitter expressing neurons only represent approximately 1% of the total of neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).

To characterize these cell-types, we analyzed their expression profiles and we found that Neurons X exhibited a combination of different neurotransmitters that could be further subdivided into smaller clusters based on the expression of particular neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, a subset of cells of different neurotransmitter identities respond probably in a similar way so that they now form a joint cluster. Nevertheless, it is also possible that cells populating these clusters were stochastically lost during sample preparation and its posterior manipulation.</p><p>The second cluster missing upon starvation was UNs 2, which showed an overall similarity with the non-altered UNs 1 cluster. Both expressed genes involved in TORC1 signaling pathway: <italic>Repressed by TOR</italic> (<italic>REPTOR</italic>), <italic>REPTOR-binding partner</italic> (<italic>REPTOR-BP</italic>) and <italic>Thor</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In addition to these genes, we observed expression of <italic>hdc</italic> and <italic>unk</italic>, whose products form a complex and regulate cell cycle progression trough binding TORC1 components, in response to nutrient intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, transcripts of genes involved in cell growth regulation were also detected, such as <italic>charybde</italic> (<italic>chrb</italic>) and <italic>scylla</italic> (<italic>scyl)</italic>. Therefore, UNs 2 appear to be more sensitive to starvation conditions than the remaining cell types, explaining their absence after starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Since <italic>hdc</italic> was found to be expressed in both NPCs and UNs, but only enriched in UNs, we quantified <italic>hdc</italic> expression in normal and starved brains. We observed a decreased number of <italic>hdc</italic> positive UNs upon starvation, as suggested in silico. In addition, these cells displayed lower levels of the pan-neuronal marker <italic>elav</italic>, in comparison to the surrounding mature neurons. These results suggest that UNs can be characterized by a combination of high levels of <italic>hdc</italic> expression an low levels of <italic>elav</italic> expression; and that in fact these group of cells were severely affected by the lack of nutrients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In early larval stages neuroblasts are arrested in G0 or G2 phases of the cell-cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Otsuki and Brand, 2018</xref>) and a complex signaling mechanism between fat-body, glial cells and neuroblasts triggers their reactivation upon nutrient-sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chell and Brand, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sousa-Nunes et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, we evaluated how cell-cycle marker genes expression was affected by the lack of nutrients. We observed that the above described cell-cycle heterogeneity was maintained upon starvation, but the proportion among cell cycle phases was altered. In addition, we noticed a decreased number of cells in G2M phases, and an increase in G1 and S phases; suggesting that upon starvation neuroblasts do not exit quiescence and therefore less cells undergo mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Transcriptional responses to starvation</title><p>Once cell identities were assigned, we investigated changes at the transcriptional level. First we analyzed the expression of genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zinke et al., 2002</xref>). We found <italic>withered</italic> (<italic>whd</italic>), a carnitine O-palmitoyltransferase, being primarily upregulated in glial cells upon starvation. Moreover, other genes with key roles in fat catabolism were also upregulated, as was the case of the long-chain-fatty-acid-CoA ligase, <italic>pudgy</italic> (<italic>pdgy</italic>) and the <italic>Lipase 4</italic> (<italic>Lip4</italic>). Among genes that were downregulated after starvation we found the <italic>fatty acid synthase 1</italic> (<italic>FASN1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These results indicate that under nutrient-stressful conditions, glial cells potentiate catabolic pathways to survive, and pause anabolic pathways to avoid energy waste.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Variation in gene expression upon starvation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genes involved in fat acid metabolism are up and downregulated upon starvation in glial cells.

To identify outliers, we calculated the average fold change across conditions. We observed that the expression profile of differentiated cells, like neurons releasing neurotransmitters, remained invariable; indicating that their expression programs were not affected by the lack of nutrients. We found that upon food deprivation many neuropeptides were upregulated, which are known to regulate feeding behavior. <italic>Leucokinin</italic> (<italic>Lk</italic>) and <italic>Adipokinetic hormone</italic> (<italic>Akh</italic>) expression appeared upregulated after starvation, a predictable result since <italic>Lk</italic> negatively regulates food intake and <italic>Akh</italic> triggers accumulation and availability of storage lipids and glycogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gáliková et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yurgel et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, the neuropeptides <italic>Hug</italic> and <italic>SIFa</italic>, controlling growth and metabolism and promoting feeding behavior upon hunger signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martelli et al., 2017</xref>), respectively; were both upregulated after starvation. Additionally, the upregulated neuropeptides identified in our dataset were also regulating water homeostasis and locomotor activity, as it was the case for the <italic>Ion transport peptide</italic> (<italic>ITP</italic>). In contrast, other neuropeptides were downregulated as <italic>Allatostatin A</italic> (<italic>AstA</italic>), which has been previously reported to reduce feeding and promote sleep, regulated by <italic>Pdf</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). These results suggest that cells involved in feeding behavior and homeostasis are more sensitive to starvation than the remaining cell types, and that genes associated to these mechanisms show the strongest and fastest response to food deprivation in order to alert larvae about their stressful environment.</p><p>Additionally, we observed different lncRNAs being affected by the lack of nutrients. Specially, we noticed that <italic>lncRNA:CR40469 and lncRNA:CR42862</italic> were upregulated in starved glial cells and NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Similarly, we detected changes in the expression levels of <italic>lncRNA:CR42491 and lncRNA:CR44832</italic> in NPCs and glial cells upon starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Then, we tested whether components of the TORC1 signaling pathway were affected in the larval brain upon starvation. The TORC1 complex, composed by <italic>Target of rapamycin</italic> (<italic>Tor</italic>) and <italic>Raptor</italic> (<italic>raptor</italic>), was lowly expressed in both conditions in different cell-types of the larval brain. Since TORC1, under nutrient stress condition, is inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>); we wondered if the change was detectable already at mRNA levels. We did not observe substantial changes at the transcriptional level upon starvation. However, as previously mentioned, two genes known to be acting downstream of TORC1: <italic>REPTOR</italic> and <italic>REPTOR-BP,</italic> showed to respond to starvation. Upon TORC1 inactivation, <italic>REPTOR</italic> is dephosphorylated and translocated to the nucleus, where it binds <italic>REPTOR-BP</italic> to form a complex and mediate transcriptional responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>). We found that <italic>REPTOR</italic> expression levels were not significantly different upon starvation, but we noticed an increase in the number of cells expressing this gene, particularly in glial cells. To confirm these findings, we investigated the expression levels of the genes downstream of the <italic>REPTOR/REPTOR-BP</italic> complex. U<italic>nk</italic>, <italic>Thor</italic>, <italic>nop5</italic>, <italic>CG16721</italic>, <italic>CG6770</italic> and <italic>CG11658</italic> among other genes were affected upon starvation, as the number of positive cells for these genes showed to be different after starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Finally, knowing that <italic>REPTOR and forkhead box, sub-group O</italic> (<italic>foxo</italic>) have overlapping target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>), we expected to observe an upregulation of <italic>foxo</italic> upon starvation. Indeed, we detected higher levels of <italic>foxo</italic> transcripts in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Thus, we could not detect changes in the expression levels of TORC1 components, but we did observe responses due to starvation in genes acting downstream of it, possibly indicating the presence of additional mechanisms mediating this activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we have introduced an extensive cell atlas of the first instar larval brain at single cell resolution applying 10X Genomics technology, across two different conditions: normal feeding and starvation. Single-cell RNA sequencing has innovated the way in which tissues, organs and entire organisms are studied. Accessibility to the transcriptome of individual cells results in cell-type recognition and a better understanding of cellular processes and biological mechanisms. But large tissues display a greater number of cells, while smaller organisms are capable of performing a variety of tasks with a simplified cellular composition. Thus, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been chosen to better understand the composition of the brain. While the adult fly brain has been extensively described, we decided to fill the existent gap regarding the composition of the brain at early developmental stages. With only about 2000 cells in the brain, a more complete coverage may be achieved more rapidly. Our data set comprises about 9400 cells, suggesting that we have likely close to a 5x cell-coverage of the larval brain.</p><p>Unsupervised cluster analysis led us to identify major cell-type categories as well as more resolved cell-types. Canonical markers (e.g. <italic>Notch</italic>, <italic>elav</italic>) grouped all cells into major categories, which based on subtype makers (e.g. <italic>ChAT</italic>, <italic>dpn</italic>, <italic>alrm</italic>) further divide them into different cell-types. This analysis further allowed the depiction of putatively novel and intriguing biological features. An example of this is the multiple-neurotransmitter-releasing neurons, which express more than one neurotransmitter, as previously found in the adult brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Croset et al., 2018</xref>). Even though these cells represent a small fraction of the total of cells populating the larval brain, it is interesting to understand the need of a neuron to produce different neurotransmitter types. Even more, deciphering the biological processes, in which these neurons are involved and the regulation behind the co-releasing phenomenon, opens a new field that requires further investigation. Similarly, co-expression of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides appears to be a common feature among peptidergic cells, suggesting different modalities of intercellular communication.</p><p>Interestingly cells of the mushroom body are closer to the neurogenic population in the UMAP plot than to the remaining differentiated neurons. Looking in detail to this group of cells, one can observe cells at different stages of differentiation: neuroprogenitors, cells undergoing differentiation and mature neurons. Knowing that the mushroom body neuroblasts continuously divide from the embryonic to the late pupal stage, and that they produce a specific neuron type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kunz et al., 2012</xref>), could partially explain the localization of this cluster of cells closer to undifferentiated cells. In addition to the MBNBs, which are constantly proliferating, a subset of NPCs showed to be actively replicating its genomic content at 16 hr ALH, indicating that neuroblasts in the brain may exit their quiescent state earlier than what has been previously reported.</p><p>An intriguing, yet not fully understood, cell-type are the UNs, which in the UMAP plot locate in close proximity with NPCs. While these cells show expression of neuronal differentiation markers such as <italic>elav</italic> or <italic>Syt-1,</italic> they lack expression of genes required for neurotransmitter synthesis. Similarly, a recent study revealed a new quite abundant, neuronal cell-type. These cells identified as small undifferentiated neurons (SUs), are characterized by reduced dimensions, a dense heterochromatin and the absence of synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrade et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that our UNs may correspond to the previously described SUs. It is intriguing to speculate that <italic>hdc</italic> and <italic>unk</italic>, two genes previously described to restrict cell cycle progression in response to nutrition restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2019</xref>), present in neurogenic cells but enriched in UNs, have a role in maintaining these cells undifferentiated.</p><p>Moreover, we explored the changes in the larval brain caused by starvation at single-cell resolution. Food intake has a critical effect on survival and development. Nevertheless, how the brain composition and cellular programs are affected upon food deprivation remains largely unknown. The cellular content showed to be almost invariable, only few clusters disappeared after starvation. The remaining cell-types clustered together, independently of the experimental condition, indicating that cell-type identity is maintained once it has been established. Moreover, and as it was observed with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davie et al., 2018</xref>), the effects of starvation are cell specific; transcriptional programs in neurons remained unaffected, while glial cells, NPCs and undifferentiated neurons experienced changes at the transcriptional level or even disappear due to stressful conditions. Additionally, the most susceptible genes are those involved in fat metabolism as well as some lncRNAs, which we hypothesize may have a regulatory function. Neuropeptides are also sensitive to nutritional levels. As expected, when cells face nutrient deficiency, protein synthesis is affected. In this case, cells favor the production of those neuropeptides involved in food intake and water homeostasis, downregulating the remaining ones in an attempt to survive. Nevertheless, is important to also consider and not exclude the possibility that these cell types could have been loss during sample preparation and subsequent manipulation. To confidently address this point, further repetitions are required.</p><p>Starvation is directly linked to TORC1, which integrates information about nutrient conditions of individual cells to trigger physiological responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dibble and Manning, 2013</xref>). We did not observe substantial changes at the transcriptional level for the genes in the TORC1 upon food deprivation, suggesting that cells regulate TORC1 activity at the protein level rather than at the transcriptional level. It is interesting to analyze those genes downstream of TORC1. We focused on the TORC1 signaling pathway, rather than in the insulin pathway, in an attempt to better understand nutrient sensing responses in a cell-autonomous fashion and not at a systemic level. Recently, REPTOR and REPTOR-BP were shown to be transcription factors responsible for mediating some of the responses of reduced TORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tiebe et al., 2015</xref>). As expected, REPTOR and its binding protein are both upregulated upon starvation, as well as their target genes. Under limited nutrient conditions, larvae have to choose between anabolic or catabolic processes. Here, we observe that under our extreme starvation condition, larvae have no other option than to catabolize their storages to obtain some energy and survive as long as possible. Even though intracellular nutrient-sensing activates TORC1, extracellular sensing must also be required to mount a complete physiological response. In this way, integration between different signaling pathways, Insulin-Foxo and TORC1-REPTOR, must be required.</p><p>Furthermore, the availability of the wildtype brain cell atlas as well as the starvation induced changes provide a resource for further functional analysis of neural circuits of the larval brain as well as developmental studies at the fundamental unit of biological organization: the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Regev et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GFP <break/>(Chicken polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat# ab13970, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_300798">AB_300798</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-GFP <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fischer</td><td>Cat# A-6455, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_221570">AB_221570</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Dpn (Guinea pig polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spéder and Brand, 2014</xref></td><td/><td>IF(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Dlg (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Iowa H.B.</td><td>Cat# 4F3, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_528203">AB_528203</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-Fas2 (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Iowa H.B.</td><td>Cat# 1D4, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_528235">AB_528235</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-hdc (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Iowa H.B.</td><td>Cat# U33, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10659722">AB_10659722</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:5)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-repo (Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Iowa H.B.</td><td>Cat# 8D12, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_528448">AB_528448</ext-link></td><td>IF(1:20)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-prt (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>David E.

The tubes containing the brains were centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was carefully removed and replaced with 200 µl of <italic>collagenase</italic> (1 mg/ml Sigma-Aldrich C9722) and incubated for 1 hr at 25°C with continuous agitation. To guarantee full brain digestion, the suspension was pipetted up and down each 10 min. The enzymatic reaction was arrested by diluting the suspension with 1 ml of PBS 0.04% BSA (Thermo Fischer Scientific AM2616). After washing the cells, the cell suspension was filtered through a 40 µm Flowmi Cell strainer (Bel-Art H13680-0040). The filtered suspension was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 5 min at 4°C. The supernatant was discarded, cells were resuspended in 50 µl of PBS 0.04% BSA and further dissociation was ensured by gently pipetting the entire volume, approximately 200 times. Cell concentration was determined using a hemocytometer (Neubauer improved – Optik Labor) under a Leica DM 100 led microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>10x genomics and sequencing</title><p>scRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Library and Gel Bead Kit v3 (10X Genomics), according to the manufacturer’s protocol (User Guide). Chips were loaded after calculating the accurate volumes using the ‘Cell Suspension Volume Calculator Table’. With an initial single-cell suspension concentration equal to 1000 cells/µl, we targeted to recover approximately 10,000 cells. Once GEMs were obtained, reverse transcription and cDNA amplification steps were performed. Sequencing was done on Illumina NovaSeq 6000 S2 flow cell generating paired-end reads. Different sequencing cycles were performed for the different reads, R1 and R2. R1, contained 10X barcodes and UMIs, in addition to an Illumina i7 index. While R2 contained the transcript-specific sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>10x data processing</title><p>The sequenced libraries were processed according to Cell Ranger (version 2.2.0) count and aggr (aggregation) pipelines, provided by 10X Genomics. The reference genome was built based on the 3<sup>rd</sup> 2018 FlyBase release (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> r6.22). The number of cells detected at the end of each experiment was determined by Cell Ranger with the number of barcodes associated with cell-containing partitions, estimated from the barcode UMI count distribution. Two final datasets were obtaining upon aggregation of individual experiments, non-starved and starved datasets, producing single feature-barcode matrices. The first one was built aggregating the libraries from three biological replicates, corresponding to larvae kept in conventional cornmeal agar medium prior to dissection (considered as the normal condition). This dataset resulted in a total of 4708 cells with a median of 1434 genes per cell. The second dataset was built in a similar way, but aggregating libraries from two biological replicates, corresponding to larvae starved for 4 hr prior to dissection (considered as the starvation condition), resulting in a dataset of 4645 cells with a median of 1962 genes per cell. The different aggregations were carried without specifying any normalization mode.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Seurat data processing</title><p>Seurat version 3.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Satija et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stuart et al., 2018</xref>) pipeline was adapted and executed on the normal (non-starved) dataset and on a combination of both conditions: ‘normal’ and ‘starvation’ datasets. The matrices produced by cell ranger were processed and duplets, or eventually multiplets, were discarded based on the overall gene expression per cell. Cell quality was assessed by the percentage of mitochondrial gene expression per cell. Thus, cells with unique feature counts between 200 and 4500, and with less than 20% of mitochondrial genes were kept for downstream processing. Additionally, genes expressed in at least one cell were considered for the analysis. The final processed datasets resulted in 4349 and 4347 cells with a total of 12,942 and 13,589 identified genes, for the non-starved and starved datasets, respectively. Once Seurat objects were built, pre-processing steps were performed before downstream analysis. First, a log-normalization with a scale factor of 10,000 was applied to normalize gene expression of individual cells by the total gene expression of each dataset. Second, a linear transformation was executed to remove unwanted source of variation. Lastly, highly variable genes were determined applying FindVariableFeatures function with default parameters, producing a total of 2000 variables genes following the R package developer’s recommendations.</p><p>Upon preprocessing, the highly variable genes were considered for the dimensional reduction analysis to highly biological significance. To define the true dimensionality of the dataset, several approaches were considered: Elbow-Plot and JackStraw-Plot tests together with an evaluation of PC-heatmaps. Finally, principal components (PCs) were selected visually by carefully inspecting Elbow-Plots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) in order to assess the percentage of variance explained by each PC. In this way, 31 PCs were considered to identify cell clusters with a graph-based approach. To better resolve clusters, we modified the resolution, as increasing this parameter helps to subdivide existing clusters and gain granularity. Therefore, we used a resolution equal to two based on the number of cells and a carefully inspection of the dataset. Then, a non-linear dimensional reduction was performed to visualize the results in UMAP plots. Lastly, cluster identities were assigned after determining top 10 differentially expressed genes across cell clusters using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. Some of these clusters were later subset and re-analyzed for further characterization.</p><p>Integration between conditions was performed by identifying common anchors across both datasets, normal and starvation, to later combine them into a single Seurat object by applying the ‘IntegrateData’ function, which produced a batch-corrected expression matrix. The pipeline was applied with default parameters. Downstream analysis was performed as described above. Finally, Identification of differentially expressed genes across conditions was achieved by comparing the expression profile of each cluster across experimental conditions. These results were later represented in scatter plots to visualize outliers. For simplicity, only genes with a fold change higher than one or smaller than −1 were labeled in these representations. In the case where many genes resulted as outliers, only the top 10 genes with the highest scored were included in the graphs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata1">Source data 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Cell-cycle scoring</title><p>Cell cycle phase scores were assigned by applying ‘CellCycleScoring’ function from Seurat R package, by providing a list of marker genes for S and G2 and M (G2/M) phases. Cells that did not express marker genes for neither phases S nor G2/M, were considered to be in G1 phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Re-clustering and further seurat analyisis</title><sec id="s4-11-1"><title>Neural progenitor cells</title><p>Cells characterized as neurogenic were reanalyzed and subclustered, keeping only those cells with more than 200 expressed genes per cell. The data was normalized and a new PCA was computed. Then, 13 PCs were chosen, as previously described, and clusters were visualized in a UMAP plot, with a resolution equal to 1. Identities were assigned after analyzing differentially expressed genes, following the same principle described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11-2"><title>Glial cells</title><p>For glial cells, a similar analysis was performed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors lay out single-cell transcriptome maps in the first instar larval brain under two conditions – nutritionally normal and starved. This attempt is very extensive and substantial, as the map covers ~1.75x of two CNS lobes. Single-cell RNAseq in this study illuminates more representative transcriptional landscape of cellular composition than other similar studies (for example, Davie et al., 2018 in Cell- more sequenced cell numbers but 1x coverage) by exploiting the model organism with reasonable neuronal complexity and the size benefit. By analyzing the seq data, Avalos et al. confirmed that the maps are consistent with information available in the literature, highlighting that the resource offered by the study will be a useful and dependable reference for future studies.</p><p>In the cells from the nutritionally normal condition the authors identify 14 clusters of cells that correspond to five cell types – 1) Neural stem cells, 2) Differentiated neurons, 3) Immature neurons 4) Glia, and 5) Non-neural cells.</p><p>Amongst the neural stem cells, the author distinguished optic lobe precursors and all other stem cells. They focus on neurotransmitter identity of the neurons and show that glutamatergic neurons are the most abundant, followed by cholinergic, GABAergic and monoaminergic. They find low levels of co-expression of neurotransmitters, which has also been reported in other scRNA data from adult brains. They also identify the peptidergic PDF neurons, insulin-producing cells, and corazonin positive cells and identity some markers for some of them. They show that most of the peptidergic neurons are also glutamatergic. In their glial cluster, they identify surface glia, cortex glia, astrocytes and chiasm glia based on known molecular markers.</p><p>Finally, they analyse the cells from the starved condition. Interestingly, they identify two clusters that were absent upon starvation. One of these clusters consists of differentiated neurons of various neurotransmitter identities, the other of immature neurons – they don't discuss these further. Instead, they look at the transcriptome of all remaining cell types and show that genes involved in fatty acid metabolism are upregulated and those involved in fatty acid synthesis are downregulated in glial cells. They also show upregulation, downregulation and 'mis'-regulation of many neuropeptides and long non-coding RNAs in many cells, including glia upon starvation.</p><p>While the paper can be a considerable contribution to the field of neurogenesis and metabolic neuroscience, several concerns need to be addressed. In particular, the description of the experiments are inadequate and this makes it hard to properly assess the quality of the data, and therefore the results.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the entire manuscript relies on single-cell sequencing, we would like to have seen a more rigorous description of the quality of data they obtained. It's possible that the authors have done these quality checks but have not mentioned it in the manuscript. But, given that this is a rapidly improving technology, we would request the authors to please present this aspect of their data. For example:</p><p>– Have they done replicates of their experiments? How were batch effects between the two runs (which could arise due to various factors such as changes in sequencing depth, RNA capture efficiency, RNA-&gt;cDNA conversion efficiency, etc.) accounted for, particularly when comparing gene expression between normal and starved conditions? Was this automatically done by Seurat, and if so, was this done with Seurat's default settings?</p><p>– How many reads do they have per cell? Based on the text, the numbers don't add up. If the authors have 764,000 reads in total, they have anywhere between 70-200 reads per cell (depending on the answer to the next question). This cannot correspond to 1500 genes, unless they are pooling reads within clusters – are they?</p><p>– Have they sequenced the normal and starved brains in the same run or different runs? If the latter, then, could the authors provide more information about each individual sequencing run, namely, the median number of genes obtained in the starved and fed cases? Currently, paragraph one of subsection “Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain reveals different categories of characteristic cell-types” does not convey information about the individual libraries.</p><p>– 3000 odd cells per condition seem rather low given that other similar experiments get 20,000-60,000 (Corset et al., 2018; Davie et al., 2018; Konstntinides et al., 2018).</p><p>2) The authors identify 28 clusters of cells, which they manually annotate. Their source data shows the top 10 genes they've used for this purpose. Could the authors please edit this table to include (a) the names of each cluster, (b) whether the markers used are based on prior literature or reported in this work based on in-silico considerations, and (c) the number of cells in each cluster for both the conditions?</p><p>3) The Supplementary file 2 shows average gene expression as scatter plots for each cluster of cells of the normal and starved conditions. These plots are very useful in visually identifying outliers. However, the criterion for identifying outliers seems to change between panels. Could the authors please explain what made them pick some genes on the outer boundaries of the scatter-plot as outliers, and others not? To clarify this, could the authors please compute the fold-change in mean expression between fed- and starved- (or the other way around) conditions and add this information to the statements made in paragraph two of subsection “Transcriptional responses to starvation” –. Alternately, they could define a criterion to define outliers as genes where the fold-change in mean expression between fed- and starved- conditions was greater than X, where X is 2 or 3?</p><p>4) The loss of the UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> clusters is quite striking! An expected response to starvation at that stage is the failure of neural stem cells to exit quiescence and re-enter cell division. This could show up as clusters of cells missing. However, more mundane possibilities that would be useful to rule out would be: (1) that UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> are cell types that are very rare in the larval brain, and hence, could stochastically be lost during sample processing from the starved larvae, and (2) that cells from the UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> clusters are indeed present in the data, but due to a low read depth from those cells, have been assigned to other clusters that are present in the starvation condition?</p><p>5) In the VNC, the neural stem cells that exit quiescence at 15hours ALH are the G2 arrested stem cells. Have the authors considered looking at their neural stem cell cluster in the fed vs starved conditions to see if they can distinguish G0 and G2 arrested stem cells, and the effect of starvation on them?</p><p>6) Are there any molecular markers in the UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> clusters, that the authors could use in vivo to demonstrate the loss of those cell types upon starvation?</p><p>7) A few aspects in the description of the methodology is lacking in detail in order to be able to reproduce the analyses in the paper for future readers. Specifically:</p><p>– Results section “Altogether, our datasets displayed a median of 764,000 reads and</p><p>1500 genes per cell, and in total of about 12,000 of genes were detected”; – Is this the total number of reads, or the number of mapped reads?</p><p>– Paragraph three of subsection “Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain reveals different categories of characteristic cell-types” –: Can the authors state how many cells (what proportion) finally fell into non-neuronal clusters?</p><p>– Paragraph two of subsection “Mapping neural progenitor cell diversity reveals presence of characteristic neurogenic cell-types” –: How was the similarity of expression profiles quantified? Was it in terms of which genes had non-zero expression? &quot;…examined the top differentially expressed genes…&quot;? Is this the top 10 differentially expressed genes, or a different number than 10?</p><p>– Subsection “Seurat data processing” –: Can the authors describe how many genes and cells were finally considered for analyses in the paper after the filtering criteria mentioned were imposed? Or are the numbers described in the first paragraph – of the Results section obtained after the filtering criteria are imposed?</p><p>– Subsection “Seurat data processing” –: The sequence of operations carried out is unclear. Was the PCA calculated by taking all genes in each cell into account, or only based on the 2000 most highly variable genes? If it was the latter, could the authors explain why the PCA wasn't done with all genes wasn't performed, and add this to the Materials and methods section? On the other hand, if the PCA was calculated with the expression of all genes in each cell, could they explain why the set of the 2000 most variable genes was constructed? Was this set of variable genes used for identifying marker genes or for clustering?</p><p>– Subsection “Seurat data processing”: – What is the linear transformation that was applied before PCA was carried out? Why was this linear transformation needed?</p><p>– In the same section – it appears that three different methodologies were considered for choosing the number of principal components. Could the authors mention which methodology was finally followed for choosing the number of principal components? It will be useful to add these plots as a supplemental figure. Alongside this, could the authors also explain the amount of variance captured each time a given number of principal components is chosen?</p><p>– UMAP resolution – could the authors add a couple of sentences explaining the impact of increasing or decreasing the UMAP resolution used for clustering? Is this supposed to aid in sub-clustering?</p><p>– Finally, in the interest of reproducibility, it would be nice to make available (through a URL) the scripts that were used to carry out the analyses in the manuscript.</p><p>8) Cell numbers: If we go with their estimate of 2000 cells per brain, and they analyse 3500 cells (after filtering), then they are sampling the brain with less than a two-fold coverage. Given the tremendous diversity in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS it would seem that this minimal coverage risks missing a whole range of rare cell types. And this of course has major bearing on the comparison to the starvation conditions as well, which was also less than two-fold. Granted, they do identify some rare cells, such as PDF neurons, but nevertheless, a less than two-fold coverage of an extremely diverse system risks resulting in misinterpretations, especially when comparing between conditions.</p><p>9) 4-hour starvation seems very short for getting any major transcriptomic changes, and indeed the changes appear to be minor. Is there any evidence for any physiological effect of a 4-hour starvation? Why was a 4-hour starvation chosen? Previously published larval nutrient restriction schemes have been e.g., 24-36 hours (e.g., PMID 21346761). As it now stands, it is difficult to relate the transcriptional changes to any physiological effect(s), and this brings down the impact of the study. Any progress in this area would have greatly strengthened the study.</p><p>10) Related to this issue, studies by the Alex Gould and Andrea Brand labs have revolved around the role of starvation in gating how/when neural progenitors emergence from quiescence during larval stages. This has revealed input from InR, PI3K, Akt, Alk/Jeb and TOR signalling, and some unknown signals, in part provided from the periphery, possibly relayed via CNS surface glia and onto progenitors. The authors of the current study, intriguingly, do find TOR signalling components altered, but do not relate this to the previous studies from Brand and Gould. In fact, somewhat disconcertingly, none of these seminal publications, in Nature, Cell, CellRep, are even mentioned in the current study (PMIDs: 21346761, 21816278, 23478023, 21183078). By analysing responses to starvation separately in glia versus progenitors, the authors have a golden opportunity to shed further light on this intriguing issue, but do not even appear to be aware of the literature in this field.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Single cell transcriptome atlas of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval brain&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the revised version of this manuscript, the authors have addressed and satisfied most of the reviewers' concerns. They have clarified and explained most of the text that made interpretation of their data difficult. They have also added the second replicate of their starved condition. In light of these changes, their work is both interesting and valuable to the field and is recommended for publication.</p><p>A couple of important points comment, though. There might be an error in their supplementary xls sheet for marker genes. The log-fold changes and p-values associated with some genes in the xls sheet do not seem plausible: there are astronomically high log-fold changes and p-values that are greater than one. For example, consider genes #6,#8, #9 from the &quot;cholinergic neurons 1&quot; cluster. These genes have log-fold-changes of 129,541,248,584,619, 0.616 and 107,496,381,242,778, with associated adjusted p-values of 8.63e-35, 3.49e-17 and 6.24e07.</p><p>It's possible that these large values occur partly due to the transformations applied to the read counts of the genes in each cell.</p><p>P-values – adjusted or otherwise – cannot exceed 1, but the p-value of gene #9 is 62.4 million.</p><p>One might expect p-values to decrease as log-fold-changes increase. So, gene #8, with a fold-change of 0.616, would be expected to have a larger (less significant) p-value than gene #9, which has a fold-change of 107,496,381,242,778. But instead, we see that gene #6 has a p-value of 3.49e-17 while gene #9 has an implausible p-value of 62.4 million.</p><p>2) Introduction section: &quot;nutriments&quot; should be &quot;nutrients&quot;</p><p>3) Results section paragraph one: I find the mean reads/cell to be very high. From our own experience, and from numerous papers, you typically detect 25,000-50,000 gene reads/cell, resulting in the detection of 1000-2500 genes/cell. They list &quot;836,393 mean reads per cell&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50354.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because the entire manuscript relies on single-cell sequencing, we would like to have seen a more rigorous description of the quality of data they obtained.

For the normal condition, the total number of reads is equal to 3,937,742,005 and the estimated number of cells is 4708 with 836,393 mean reads per cell.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Have they sequenced the normal and starved brains in the same run or different runs? If the latter, then, could the authors provide more information about each individual sequencing run, namely, the median number of genes obtained in the starved and fed cases? Currently, paragraph one of subsection “Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the Drosophila larval brain reveals different categories of characteristic cell-types” does not convey information about the individual libraries.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid point and we apologize for not including this information before. We have now included a supplementary table with all the sequencing metrics for each experiment (Supplementary file 1). In this file, we describe: total number of reads, mean reads per cells, expected number of cells, total number of genes detected, sequencing saturation among other parameters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– 3000 odd cells per condition seem rather low given that other similar experiments get 20,000-60,000 (Corset et al., 2018; Davie et al., 2018; Konstntinides et al., 2018).</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed additional single-cell experiments for each condition. Summarizing, now the normal and starved conditions consist of three and two biological replicas, respectively. In total, our dataset now comprises of 9353 cells. We hereby have an approximate 5x coverage of the first instar larval brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors identify 28 clusters of cells, which they manually annotate. Their source data shows the top 10 genes they've used for this purpose. Could the authors please edit this table to include (a) the names of each cluster, (b) whether the markers used are based on prior literature or reported in this work based on in-silico considerations, and (c) the number of cells in each cluster for both the conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. We feel that such data may provide a valuable resource for various topics and have now included further details to Figure 1—source data 1, in order to clarify the annotation process. In this table, one can find the top 10 marker genes used to identify cell types. In a second sheet, we have specified the number of cells per cluster. And, in a third sheet, we added a table illustrating the literature-based approach used during the annotation step. In addition, we now include a new source file for Figure 7 (Figure 7—source data 1), containing the number of cells per cluster and per condition.</p><p>Moreover, to further gain experimental support for the cluster analysis and annotation we have extended the analysis of neurotransmitter co-expression. We now show immunostainings supporting co-expression of Glutamate and GABA as well as GABA and Acetylcholine (Figure 3—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The Supplementary file 2 shows average gene expression as scatter plots for each cluster of cells of the normal and starved conditions. These plots are very useful in visually identifying outliers. However, the criterion for identifying outliers seems to change between panels. Could the authors please explain what made them pick some genes on the outer boundaries of the scatter-plot as outliers, and others not? To clarify this, could the authors please compute the fold-change in mean expression between fed- and starved- (or the other way around) conditions and add this information to the statements made in paragraph two of subsection “Transcriptional responses to starvation”. Alternately, they could define a criterion to define outliers as genes where the fold-change in mean expression between fed- and starved- conditions was greater than X, where X is 2 or 3?</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid point and we apologized for the missing information. To address this point, we have now adapted the result section and included a more detailed description in the Materials and methods section. Previously, we had labeled those genes that appeared to be visual outliers. Now, we calculated the logFC and represented those with a higher value than 1 or lower than -1. In the case of a large number of outliers, we represented the top 10 genes with the highest variability. These genes are labeled in the scatter plots. Moreover, we have included a complete table of the genes (Supplementary file 2—source data 1) that are differentially regulated for all clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The loss of the UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> clusters is quite striking! An expected response to starvation at that stage is the failure of neural stem cells to exit quiescence and re-enter cell division. This could show up as clusters of cells missing. However, more mundane possibilities that would be useful to rule out would be: (1) that UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> are cell types that are very rare in the larval brain, and hence, could stochastically be lost during sample processing from the starved larvae, and (2) that cells from the UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> clusters are indeed present in the data, but due to a low read depth from those cells, have been assigned to other clusters that are present in the starvation condition?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate that the reviewers brought this point to our attention. Indeed, we cannot exclude the possibility that these cells could stochastically have been lost during sample processing. We have therefore included this possibility in the respective section (“Starvation effects on larval brain cellular composition”) as well as in the Discussion. Nevertheless, among replicates the loss of these clusters continues to be consistent. However, we reason that the sequencing depth is high enough with a saturation higher than 90%.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the VNC, the neural stem cells that exit quiescence at 15hours ALH are the G2 arrested stem cells. Have the authors considered looking at their neural stem cell cluster in the fed vs starved conditions to see if they can distinguish G0 and G2 arrested stem cells, and the effect of starvation on them?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting suggestion and we addressed this <italic>in-silico</italic> and <italic>in-vivo</italic>. We have now incorporated an analysis for the NPCs cell cycle. In additions, we have performed EdU incorporation experiments to demonstrate the reactivation of a subset of neuroblasts prior to 16 hours ALH. Moreover, we have also analyzed the effects of starvation on the NPCs cell-cycle scores upon starvation. This data has been included in the result section and can be now visualized in Figure 2 and Figure 7—figure supplement 3.</p><p><italic>6) Are there any molecular markers in the UN-2 and neurons<sup>-1</sup> clusters, that the authors could use</italic> in vivo <italic>to demonstrate the loss of those cell types upon starvation?</italic> </p><p>This is a very important and challenging point. Neurons<sup>-1</sup> (now labeled as Neurons X) represents a cluster of neurons expressing a combination of different neurotransmitters, however we could not identify any unique or cluster-specific marker. Similarly, it remains challenging to distinguish UN2s from “classical” neurons.</p><p>However, we performed an experiment supporting the loss of UN2s:</p><p>We found that <italic>hdc</italic>, was preferentially expressed in UNs in comparison to the remaining cell-clusters, which we confirmed using anti-Hdc immunostaining. Thus, we quantified its expression in normal and starved brains. We found a decreased number of <italic>hdc</italic> positive UNs, a result that supports our <italic>in-silico</italic> observations. Nevertheless, we could only assed this for a combination of UNs1 and UNs2, as for either cluster cell-type specific markers remain unknown. These results were added to the corresponding section (“Starvation effects on larval brain cellular composition”) and are shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) A few aspects in the description of the methodology is lacking in detail in order to be able to reproduce the analyses in the paper for future readers. Specifically:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these suggestions and have incorporated the required changes to the manuscript. As this point consists of several subpoints, we have addressed each of them individually.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Results section “Altogether, our datasets displayed a median of 764,000 reads and</p><p>1500 genes per cell, and in total of about 12,000 of genes were detected”; Is this the total number of reads, or the number of mapped reads?</p><p>– Paragraph three of subsection “Single-Cell RNA-Seq of the Drosophila larval brain reveals different categories of characteristic cell-types”: Can the authors state how many cells (what proportion) finally fell into non-neuronal clusters?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the missing information and have now added a supplementary table with all the sequencing metrics (Supplementary file 1). Regarding the proportion of cells, approximately 60% of the cells were classified in neuronal clusters, the remaining 40% were assigned to glial cell, NPCs, UNs and nonneural cells. In addition, we have now incorporated a table with the number of cells per cluster (Figure 1—source data 1) and per condition (Figure 1—source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Paragraph two of subsection “Mapping neural progenitor cell diversity reveals presence of characteristic neurogenic cell-types”: How was the similarity of expression profiles quantified? Was it in terms of which genes had non-zero expression? &quot;…examined the top differentially expressed genes…&quot;? Is this the top 10 differentially expressed genes, or a different number than 10?</p></disp-quote><p>The annotation of each cluster was possible by examining the list of differentially expressed genes, output from “FindAllMarkers” Seurat function. Later, the top 10 genes for each cluster were analyzed to finally confer cluster-identities. We have now modified Figure 1—source data 1 to contain information about the top 10 differentially expressed genes for each cluster, number of cells per cluster and example references that were used to confer cell identity. This information can also be found in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Seurat data processing”: Can the authors describe how many genes and cells were finally considered for analyses in the paper after the filtering criteria mentioned were imposed? Or are the numbers described in the first paragraph of the Results section obtained after the filtering criteria are imposed?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for not being clear. We have now modified this section and we include both, the raw and filtered number of cells, as well as the total number of genes detected. We first introduced the raw numbers and then described the final number of cells kept for downstream analysis.</p><p>“These cells were filtered, scaled and normalized… The resulting 4349 cells, with 12,942 genes detected, were later clustered generating…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Seurat data processing”: The sequence of operations carried out is unclear. Was the PCA calculated by taking all genes in each cell into account, or only based on the 2000 most highly variable genes? If it was the latter, could the authors explain why the PCA wasn't done with all genes wasn't performed, and add this to the Materials and methods section? On the other hand, if the PCA was calculated with the expression of all genes in each cell, could they explain why the set of the 2000 most variable genes was constructed? Was this set of variable genes used for identifying marker genes or for clustering?</p></disp-quote><p>We clarified the processing pipeline by introducing a more detailed description in the Materials and methods section. In brief, 2000 genes were selected based on the recommendations of the R package provider, in order to assess real biological features. These 2000 genes were later considered for downstream processing and analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Subsection “Seurat data processing”: What is the linear transformation that was applied before PCA was carried out? Why was this linear transformation needed?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the brief description and we have now extended the pipeline description this in the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>“First, a log-normalization with a scale factor of 10,000 was applied to normalize gene expression of individual cells by the total gene expression of each dataset. Second, a linear transformation was executed to remove unwanted source of variation”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– In the same section it appears that three different methodologies were considered for choosing the number of principal components. Could the authors mention which methodology was finally followed for choosing the number of principal components? It will be useful to add these plots as a supplemental figure. Alongside this, could the authors also explain the amount of variance captured each time a given number of principal components is chosen?</p></disp-quote><p>This is valid point and it is known the complexity of the process of determining the real dimensionality of a single-cell RNA-seq dataset. Therefore, we have described how we finally determined the number of relevant PCs:</p><p>“To define the true dimensionality of the dataset, several approaches were considered: Elbow-Plot and JackStraw-Plot tests together with an evaluation of PC-heatmaps. Finally, principal components (PCs) were selected visually by carefully inspecting Elbow-Plots in order to assess the percentage of variance explained by each PC. In this way, 31 PCs were considered to identify clusters of cells on graph-based approach. To better resolve clusters, a resolution equal to 2 was considered, this parameter helps to subdivide existing clusters and increase the granularity.”</p><p>In addition, we have also incorporated a new supplement file containing different Elbow-plots in order to facilitate this process to other researchers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– UMAP resolution – could the authors add a couple of sentences explaining the impact of increasing or decreasing the UMAP resolution used for clustering? Is this supposed to aid in sub-clustering?</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct and we apologize for not describing it previously. This information can be now found in the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“In this way, 31 PCs were considered to identify cell clusters with a graph-based approach. To better resolve clusters, we modified the resolution, as increasing this parameter helps to subdivide existing clusters and gain granularity. Therefore, we used a resolution equal to 2 based on the total number of cells and after carefully inspecting different values.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Finally, in the interest of reproducibility, it would be nice to make available (through a URL) the scripts that were used to carry out the analyses in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a great suggestion and we now provided the scripts used for the analysis as supplementary information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Cell numbers: If we go with their estimate of 2,000 cells per brain, and they analyse 3500 cells (after filtering), then they are sampling the brain with less than a two-fold coverage. Given the tremendous diversity in the Drosophila CNS it would seem that this minimal coverage risks missing a whole range of rare cell types. And this of course has major bearing on the comparison to the starvation conditions as well, which was also less than two-fold. Granted, they do identify some rare cells, such as PDF neurons, but nevertheless, a less than two-fold coverage of an extremely diverse system risks resulting in misinterpretations, especially when comparing between conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid point and we have performed new single-cell RNA-seq experiments for each condition, adding new biological replicates to each dataset. Now, we have a cell atlas of the first instar larval brain consisting of 9353 cells, representing an approximate 5x coverage of the larval brain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) 4-hour starvation seems very short for getting any major transcriptomic changes, and indeed the changes appear to be minor. Is there any evidence for any physiological effect of a 4-hour starvation? Why was a 4-hour starvation chosen? Previously published larval nutrient restriction schemes have been e.g., 24-36 hours (e.g., PMID 21346761). As it now stands, it is difficult to relate the transcriptional changes to any physiological effect(s), and this brings down the impact of the study. Any progress in this area would have greatly strengthened the study.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very relevant point and we thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have introduced a more detailed description explaining why we decided on the 4 hours starvation.</p><p>Since first instar larvae are particularly susceptible to starvation, we could not extend the starvation time. To illustrate this, we have included an experiment showing that after 4 hours of starvation 45.2% of the larvae died. This can be visualized in Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Nevertheless, we strongly agree with the reviewers and we are considering analysis different time points for future experiments, most likely moving to third instar larvae.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) Related to this issue, studies by the Alex Gould and Andrea Brand labs have revolved around the role of starvation in gating how/when neural progenitors emergence from quiescence during larval stages. This has revealed input from InR, PI3K, Akt, Alk/Jeb and TOR signalling, and some unknown signals, in part provided from the periphery, possibly relayed via CNS surface glia and onto progenitors. The authors of the current study, intriguingly, do find TOR signalling components altered, but do not relate this to the previous studies from Brand and Gould. In fact, somewhat disconcertingly, none of these seminal publications, in Nature, Cell, CellRep, are even mentioned in the current study (PMIDs: 21346761, 21816278, 23478023, 21183078). By analysing responses to starvation separately in glia versus progenitors, the authors have a golden opportunity to shed further light on this intriguing issue, but do not even appear to be aware of the literature in this field.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this indeed valid point. We have now included the mentioned references in our analysis. On the other hand, by analyzing the population of glial cells we observed changes in fat acid metabolism, which can be observed in Figure 8A.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) In the revised version of this manuscript, the authors have addressed and satisfied most of the reviewers' concerns. They have clarified and explained most of the text that made interpretation of their data difficult. They have also added the second replicate of their starved condition. In light of these changes, their work is both interesting and valuable to the field and is recommended for publication.</p><p>A couple of important points comment, though. There might be an error in their supplementary xls sheet for marker genes. The log-fold changes and p-values associated with some genes in the xls sheet do not seem plausible: there are astronomically high log-fold changes and p-values that are greater than one. For example, consider genes #6,#8, #9 from the &quot;cholinergic neurons 1&quot; cluster. These genes have log-fold-changes of 129,541,248,584,619, 0.616 and 107,496,381,242,778, with associated adjusted p-values of 8.63e-35, 3.49e-17 and 6.24e07.</p><p>It's possible that these large values occur partly due to the transformations applied to the read counts of the genes in each cell.</p><p>P-values – adjusted or otherwise – cannot exceed 1, but the p-value of gene #9 is 62.4 million.</p><p>One might expect p-values to decrease as log-fold-changes increase. So, gene #8, with a fold-change of 0.616, would be expected to have a larger (less significant) p-value than gene #9, which has a fold-change of 107,496,381,242,778. But instead, we see that gene #6 has a p-value of 3.49e-17 while gene #9 has an implausible p-value of 62.4 million.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Indeed, we missed that some values were unexpectedly altered after transforming an R output file into a csv file in the previous version of “Figure 1—source data 1”. We have now corrected the error and carefully inspected the numbers in the updated “Figure 1—source data 1”. We apologize for the mistake.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Introduction section: &quot;nutriments&quot; should be &quot;nutrients&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point and we have now corrected this typo in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Results section paragraph one: I find the mean reads/cell to be very high. From our own experience, and from numerous papers, you typically detect 25,000-50,000 gene reads/cell, resulting in the detection of 1000-2500 genes/cell. They list &quot;836,393 mean reads per cell&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, since the larval brain has fewer cells than the adult counterpart we decided to sequence deeper than it was previously done for the adult brain, we therefore expected a higher number of reads per cell. In the supplementary file we detailed this information for each experiment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
