We show here that emperipolesis is a dynamic process mediated actively by both lineages, in part through the β2-integrin/ICAM-1/ezrin pathway. Tethered neutrophils enter in membrane-bound vesicles before penetrating into the megakaryocyte cytoplasm. Intracytoplasmic neutrophils develop membrane contiguity with the demarcation membrane system, thereby transferring membrane to the megakaryocyte and to daughter platelets. This phenomenon occurs in otherwise unmanipulated murine marrow in vivo, resulting in circulating platelets that bear membrane from non-megakaryocytic hematopoietic donors. Transit through megakaryocytes can be completed as rapidly as minutes, after which neutrophils egress intact. Emperipolesis is amplified in models of murine inflammation associated with platelet overproduction, contributing to platelet production in vitro and in vivo. These findings identify emperipolesis as a new cell-in-cell interaction that enables neutrophils and potentially other cells passing through the megakaryocyte cytoplasm to modulate the production and membrane content of platelets.</p></abstract><kwd-group

platelets. Derived from hematopoietic stem cells, developing MKs undergo multiple rounds of endomitosis to become highly-polyploid cells averaging 20 to 100 μm in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levine et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machlus and Italiano, 2013</xref>). Mature MKs develop a complex network of intracytoplasmic membrane, termed the demarcation membrane system (DMS), that provides a membrane reservoir to enable platelet generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulze et al., 2006</xref>). MKs then protrude pseudopodial extensions of this membrane via the marrow sinusoids into the bloodstream, where shear stress releases fragments that become the mature platelets required for hemostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Junt et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Representing less than 0.3% of hematopoietic cells in bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Levine et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Machlus and Italiano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winter et al., 2010</xref>), MKs interact with other hematopoietic lineages. MKs provide a niche for plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Winter et al., 2010</xref>), promote neutrophil egress via production of CXCR2 ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Köhler et al., 2011</xref>), and regulate hematopoietic stem cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bruns et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Almost 50 years ago, it was observed that MKs can engulf other hematopoietic cells, most commonly neutrophils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen, 1970</xref>). Examination of fresh aspirates revealed movement of these cells within MKs, giving rise to the name emperipolesis from the Greek, <italic>em</italic> inside, <italic>peri</italic> around, <italic>polemai</italic> wander about (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Humble et al., 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen, 1970</xref>). Emperipolesis is observed in healthy marrow and increases with hematopoietic stress, including in myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cashell and Buss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mangi and Mufti, 1992</xref>), myelofibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centurione et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schmitt et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Spangrude et al., 2016</xref>), gray platelet syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Buduo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larocca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monteferrario et al., 2014</xref>), essential thrombocythemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cashell and Buss, 1992</xref>), and blood loss or hemorrhagic shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dziecioł et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sahebekhitiari and Tavassoli, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tavassoli, 1986</xref>). Its mechanism and significance remain unknown. It has been speculated that MKs could represent a sanctuary for neutrophils in an unfavorable marrow environment, or a route for neutrophils to exit the bone marrow, but more typically emperipolesis is regarded as a curiosity without physiological significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sahebekhitiari and Tavassoli, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tavassoli, 1986</xref>).</p><p>Recently, we identified evidence for a direct role for MKs in systemic inflammation, highlighting the potential importance of the interaction of MKs with immune lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cunin and Nigrovic, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunin et al., 2017</xref>). Whereas the preservation of emperipolesis in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stahl et al., 1991</xref>), mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centurione et al., 2004</xref>), rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 1996</xref>), and cats and dogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scott and Friedrichs, 2009</xref>) implies evolutionary conservation, we sought to model this process in vitro and in vivo to begin to understand its biology and function. We show here that emperipolesis is a tightly-regulated process mediated actively by both MKs and neutrophils via pathways reminiscent of leukocyte transendothelial migration. Neutrophils enter MKs within membrane-bound vesicles but then penetrate into the cell cytoplasm, where they develop membrane continuity with the demarcation membrane system (DMS) to transfer membrane to MKs and thereby to platelets, accelerating platelet production. Neutrophils then emerge intact, carrying MK components with them. Together, these data identify emperipolesis as a previously unrecognized type of cell-in-cell interaction that mediates a novel form of material transfer between immune and hematopoietic lineages.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In vitro modeling of emperipolesis reveals a rapid multi-stage process</title><p>Whole-mount 3-dimensional (3D) immunofluorescence imaging of healthy C57Bl/6 murine marrow revealed that ~6% of MKs contain at least one neutrophil, and occasionally other bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). Emperipolesis was similarly evident upon confocal imaging of unmanipulated human marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To model this process, we incubated cultured murine or human MKs with fresh bone marrow cells or peripheral blood neutrophils, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Murine MKs, derived either from bone marrow or fetal liver cells, were efficient at emperipolesis (~20–40% of MKs).

After neutrophil uptake into the emperisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), the vacuolar space between neutrophil and MK was resorbed such that neutrophil and MK membranes became closely apposed, resulting in a structure composed of two membrane leaflets surrounding the neutrophil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). This structure was often associated with the appearance of neutrophilic protrusions deeper into the host MK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Areas in which the membranes approximated very closely, becoming indistinct for short stretches, were sometimes observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Subsequently, only a single bilipid membrane came to separate the neutrophil cytoplasm from the MK cytoplasm, a finding that echoed the loss of CD41 staining observed by immunofluorescence, confirming dissolution of the emperisome and thereby translocation of the neutrophil to an intracytoplasmic location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Whereas CD18 and Ly6G but not CD41 were preserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> above), this remaining membrane is most likely primarily of neutrophil origin.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Emperipolesis is mediated by active actin cytoskeleton rearrangement in both megakaryocyte and neutrophil</title><p>To assess the cytoskeletal processes underlying this intriguing cell-in-cell interaction, we employed targeted inhibitors. The microtubule polymerization inhibitor nocodazole showed a negligible effect, but emperipolesis was dramatically curtailed by inhibitors of actin polymerization, cytochalasin D and latrunculin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This effect was observed when either MKs or marrow cells were exposed to these inhibitors, confirming obligate active cytoskeletal engagement by both participants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, controls of actin inhibition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with these results, neutrophils entering MKs exhibited a polarized appearance, while MKs developed a transcellular cup similar to that observed in endothelial cells during transendothelial migration of leukocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carman and Springer, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ley et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>).

Blocking antibodies targeting P-selectin, glycoprotein VI (GPVI), PECAM-1, CD44, and CXCR2 had no effect (not shown). However, blockade of the β2 integrin CD18, expressed by neutrophils but not MKs, strongly impaired emperipolesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Confocal microscopy showed that ICAM-1 is expressed by a population of human and murine MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). In agreement with previous observations in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tanaka et al., 1997</xref>), emperipolesis by ICAM-1-deficient MKs was significantly impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In further support of this mechanism, we evaluated the role of ezrin, which mediates the attachment of the intracellular tail of ICAM-1 to the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Heiska et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). Inhibition of ezrin phosphorylation impaired emperipolesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, controls of ezrin inhibition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2E</xref>). By confocal microscopy, ezrin could be detected only at sites of MK contact with tethered neutrophils, where it co-localized strongly with ICAM-1, consistent with its role as a bridge to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). By contrast, ezrin could not be visualized in MKs not tethered to leukocytes, or with only internalized leukocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Together, these data show that emperipolesis is mediated in part by an interaction between neutrophil β2 integrins and MK ICAM-1/ezrin during neutrophil entry. However, absence or blockade of these factors resulted in only partial impairment of emperipolesis, indicating a role for alternate mechanisms not yet defined.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Emperipolesis mediates membrane transfer from neutrophil to megakaryocyte</title><p>As observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Centurione et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thiele et al., 1984</xref>), neutrophils engaged in emperipolesis frequently localized to the DMS, the intracytoplasmic membrane network implicated in platelet production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Close examination of this interaction demonstrated membrane contiguity between the neutrophil and the DMS, suggesting that neutrophils might be able to serve as membrane donors to MKs and potentially to platelets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). To test this possibility, we employed membrane labeling. Marrow cells were stained with the lipophilic dye CellVue maroon and then co-cultured with unstained MKs. Confocal microscopy showed substantial loss of CellVue maroon staining in neutrophils inside but not outside MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

By contrast, no fluorescence was detected on MKs cultured with supernatant from PKH67-stained marrow cells, rendering unlikely a role of marrow cell-derived microparticles, exosomes or apoptotic bodies in membrane transfer from neutrophils to MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Thus, neutrophils transfer plasma membrane to MKs via emperipolesis, while reciprocal membrane exchange from MKs to neutrophils likely occurs primarily via MK microparticles, a phenomenon of interest not explored further here.</p><p>We then sought to determine whether membrane transfer mediates exchange of surface proteins. We performed surface biotinylation of MKs and marrow cells, and then co-cultured these cells with unstained marrow cells or MKs, respectively. Using streptavidin, we could not detect biotin on neutrophils incubated with biotinylated MKs, suggesting the absence of bulk surface protein transfer from MKs to neutrophils (not shown). However, surface biotin could be detected on some MKs after incubation with biotinylated marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), confirming that membrane exchange from neutrophils to MK transfers proteins. The nature of these proteins remains to be determined since MKs remained negative for hallmark neutrophil proteins such as CD18 and Ly6G (not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Neutrophil membranes transferred in emperipolesis emerge on circulating platelets</title><p>Platelets are generated by MKs via the DMS network, an impressively extended network of membrane whose biogenesis remains incompletely understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckly et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schulze et al., 2006</xref>). EM had demonstrated membrane continuity between cytoplasmic neutrophils and the DMS. We therefore tested whether emperipolesis could transfer neutrophil membrane to platelets. MKs require shear stress for physiological platelet biogenesis, rendering the in vivo context most suitable for these studies. MKs stained with the cytoplasmic dye Green-CMFDA were incubated with marrow cells stained with the lipid marker CellVue Maroon and then engrafted intravenously into congenic recipient mice, in which production of CMFDA+ platelets was monitored by serial phlebotomy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuentes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Remarkably, most platelets produced by donor MKs (i.e. CMFDA+) were also positive for CellVue Maroon, indicating a high frequency of incorporation of donor leukocyte membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The intensity of CellVue Maroon staining remained constant over time, suggesting that donor membrane was employed continuously over an extended period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similar findings were obtained with lipid stainer PKH67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To exclude experimental artifact related to lipid stains, we employed donor marrow from mT/mG mice bearing membrane fluorescence mediated by fluorochrome associated with the inner membrane leaflet. Confocal imaging confirmed that membrane fluorescence from mT/mG marrow cells efficiently transferred into MKs in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Membrane fluorescence was also detected on platelets produced in vivo by WT MKs incubated with mT/mG marrow donors, albeit with weaker signal since membrane fluorescence is less intense that with lipid stains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We similarly investigated transfer of intracellular or surface protein. Marrow cells were stained with the intracellular protein stain CellTrace Violet and then co-cultured with CMFDA +MKs. Interestingly, platelets emerging in vivo contained CellTrace violet, consistent with cytoplasmic protein transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). Together, these results demonstrate that lipids and intracellular proteins are transferred from marrow cells not only to MKs but also to their daughter platelets. Of note, we could not detect biotin on emerging platelet when MKs were previously co-cultured with surface-biotinylated marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, platelets were negative for neutrophil surface proteins Ly6G, CD11b, CD18 and CD88 (not shown). We cannot exclude the possibility that other surface proteins not directly assessed may still transfer in quantities too modest to be detected by bulk biotin-streptavidin staining.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44031.017</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Neutrophil membranes transferred in emperipolesis emerge on circulating platelets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CMFDA+ MKs are co-cultured with either CellVue maroon (CVm) or unstained marrow cells, and injected i.v.

Indeed, platelets with the expected intermediate fluorescent phenotype were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), albeit only in relatively small numbers, potentially because of the weak fluorescence in the mT/mG system and because WT→WT, mT/mG→mT/mG, and WT→mT/mG transfer events remain undetectable. Examination of BM MKs identified examples of fluorescent neutrophils contributing membrane to non-fluorescent MKs from an intracellular location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

Platelet production can occur in a cell-intrinsic manner, as for example by MKs cultured in isolation ex vivo. However, physiological platelet generation proceeds in a complex multicellular environment. The present studies establish a pathway through which this cellular context modulates thrombocytogenesis. During emperipolesis, neutrophils and other hematopoietic lineages penetrate into the MK cytoplasm, a process mediated actively by both host and donor. This process is distinct from phagocytosis since the neutrophil actively penetrates into the MK and survives to exit intact. Cytoplasmic neutrophils transfer membrane and cytosolic contents to MKs and to platelets, thereby enhancing platelet production. Donor neutrophils receive membrane in turn before they exit intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, emperipolesis represents a previously unrecognized pathway through which neutrophils and other hematopoietic cells engage with MKs to modulate the composition and production of circulating platelets.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44031.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Neutrophil transit through megakaryocytes in emperipolesis mediates membrane transfer and enhanced platelet production – proposed model.</title><p>(1) Neutrophils expressing β2 integrin and MKs expressing ICAM-1 are positioned to engage, including via MK tethers.

These proteins also mediate another form of transcellular passage, the migration of neutrophils through the cell bodies of endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ley et al., 2007</xref>). Unlike emperipolesis, endothelial transcellular migration is not known to involve penetration into the host cytoplasm. It remains unknown whether other mechanisms are shared between emperipolesis and transendothelial migration, such as fusion of caveolin vesicles to create an intracellular channel for passage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Millán et al., 2006</xref>). Tavassoli and colleagues had previously postulated that emperipolesis could represent a pathway of neutrophil egress from the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dziecioł et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tavassoli, 1986</xref>). Transit of some neutrophils through MKs over the course of just a few minutes lends plausibility to this hypothesis. Our data do not exclude the possibility that some neutrophils pass through MKs without a cytoplasmic ‘detour,’ thereby resembling endothelial transcellular migration even more closely.</p><p>Mechanisms of MK-emperipolesis have remained entirely obscure for almost 50 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsen, 1970</xref>). Electron microscopy observations previously raised the possibility that neutrophils are not internalized by MKs but rather enter directly through the DMS, which is continuous with the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eckly et al., 2014</xref>), to reside within DMS dilated cavities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Breton-Gorius and Reyes, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thiele et al., 1984</xref>). Consistent with these observations, myeloid cells are often found at the cell surface entrance of the DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thiele et al., 1984</xref>), and increased emperipolesis has been reported in models with dilated and enlarged DMS or after pharmacological modification of the DMS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Overholtzer and Brugge, 2008</xref>). However, our confocal and electron microscopy images demonstrate that neutrophils enter MKs directly, through a vacuole, ultimately taking up residence inside the MK cytoplasm. Emperipolesis is nevertheless strikingly heterogeneous. For example, emperipolesis can be observed in MKs of all sizes and can last just minutes to over an hour. MKs may enclose a single neutrophil or encompass as many as 50 neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These observations strongly suggest that there may be different types of emperipolesis, involving different molecular pathways and serving distinct functions that remain to be defined.</p><p>Because the mechanistic pathways identified in our study are not specific to emperipolesis (e.g. β2 integrin binding, actin polymerization), we have so far been unable to interrupt this phenomenon with selectivity in vivo. To address its function, we employed a combination of approaches, focused here on platelet production. This focus is justified by the enhanced frequency of emperipolesis in diseases associated with high platelet count, including essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cashell and Buss, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vytrva et al., 2014</xref>), or with high platelet demand (gray platelet syndrome, blood loss or hemorrhagic shock [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Buduo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dziecioł et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Larocca et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monteferrario et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sahebekhitiari and Tavassoli, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tavassoli, 1986</xref>]). Further, enhanced emperipolesis in chronic myeloproliferative disorders positively correlates with the peripheral platelet count (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Thiele et al., 1984</xref>). We establish that emperipolesis accelerates platelet production both in vitro and in vivo. The quantitative importance of this contribution, and whether it reflects enhanced access to lipid membrane or some other mechanism, remains to be established.</p><p>Since platelets generated through emperipolesis bear donor membrane as well as parent MK membrane, it is likely that they will be different in function. Consistent with this possibility, we found enhanced expression of surface phosphatidylserine on emperipolesis-derived platelets in our chimeric WT-mT/mG mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Given the role of β2 integrins in emperipolesis, it is plausible to suspect that activated neutrophils will preferentially engage in emperipolesis, suggesting the possibility that ‘angry neutrophils make angry platelets’. The identity of lipids and proteins transferred from neutrophils and other cells to MKs and platelets, and the resulting changes in cell function, will be important topics for future study.</p><p>The impact of emperipolesis is unlikely to be restricted to MKs and platelets. Our videomicroscopy data confirm that exiting neutrophils can carry MK membrane with them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), potentially translating into altered function. These effects are more difficult to study in vitro because of the capacity we identified for MKs to transfer membrane to nearby cells via MK microparticles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Our prior work had identified MK microparticles as potent pro-inflammatory vectors implicated in the delivery of IL-1 during systemic inflammatory disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cunin et al., 2017</xref>). The present findings thus extend the understanding of MK microparticles as signaling vectors. Further, by establishing transfer of membrane not only from donor cell to MK but also reciprocally, followed by release of viable cells back into the intercellular milieu, these studies identify emperipolesis as a mechanism through which MKs may be able to ‘groom’ neutrophils and other immune lineages.</p><p>We are unable at present to define conclusively the proportion of circulating platelets that bear neutrophil membrane. The mT/mG chimera experiments will not accurately reflect this fraction, because only one of 4 possible donor-host pairs yields detectable platelets (mT/mG neutrophil→WT MK) and because mT/mG fluorescence is weak, such that transfer events will likely often be invisible. We note that many platelets released by MKs co-cultured with membrane-labeled marrow donors expressed membrane label (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Given the speed with which cells enter and exit MKs, a snapshot prevalence of 6% is compatible with the possibility that many or even most MKs, and many neutrophils, experience emperipolesis over time, perhaps repeatedly. If this is the case, and labeling experiments accurately reflect the efficiency of membrane transfer, then emperipolesis-derived membrane could be common in circulating platelets. Alternately, if transfer were inefficient, and/or only a subset of MKs engaged in emperipolesis, then emperipolesis-modulated platelets could represent simply a small (but potentially still functionally important) subset of the circulating pool.</p><p>We recognize other limitations to these studies. Unique functional contributions of emperipolesis-derived platelets remain to be established. The mechanisms through which neutrophils escape emperisomes to enter the cytoplasm, home intracellularly to the DMS, and then egress without violating MK outer membrane integrity remain to be defined. Cells deficient in β2 integrins retain the capacity to enter MKs, albeit with reduced efficiency, revealing that other ligand/receptor pairs can mediate entry. The signals driving enhanced emperipolesis in the setting of experimental stress, during hemorrhagic shock, and in aberrant marrow environments such as in hematopoietic malignancies, remain to be established. Despite these limitations, the current studies identify emperipolesis as a novel cell-in-cell interaction that mediates reciprocal transfer of membrane and other cellular components, defining thereby a new mechanism of interchange between immune and hematopoietic systems.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice </title><p>C57Bl/6, CD45.1 B6 mice, <italic>cd18</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, mT/mG mice and Tg-FcγRIIA mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Megakaryocyte emperipolesis mediates membrane transfer from intracytoplasmic neutrophils to platelets&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Reinhard Fässler as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Markus Sperandio (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript reports on the mechanism and significance of emperipolesis, a phenomenon by which megakaryocytes (MKs) engulf neutrophils or, to a lesser extent, other hematopoietic cells. The authors established in vitro cultures, with which they define a series of events demonstrating that neutrophils are taken up by MKs in membrane-bound vesicles, are then released into the cytoplasm where they form a membrane continuity with the MK demarcation membrane system, which leads to membrane transfer from neutrophils to MK-derived platelets and to an acceleration of platelet production (shown in inflammation models, LPS treatment and IgG-mediated thrombocytopenia).

These are important questions, raised also in our Discussion, and we anticipate that they will occupy the lab for better part of the next decade. We agree that the present manuscript will be strengthened by data showing that there is likely to be such impact.</p><p>Accordingly, we have now added data reporting the phenotype of hybrid platelets generated in our chimeric WT/mTmG mouse. We show that these platelets express normal levels of the activation marker CD62P (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1H) and show a marginal band of β1-tubulin coil (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1I) excluding an abnormal activation phenotype (Moskalensky et al., 2018; Sadoul, 2015). However they express substantially higher levels of phosphatidylserine, as reflected in Annexin V staining (new Figure 5F and G, control of Annexin V staining specificity in new Figure 5—figure supplement 1G). Surface phosphatidylserine creates a scaffold for clotting factors and is a hallmark of pro-coagulant platelets (Heemskerk et al., 2013; Nagata et al., 2016). This result thereby supports the possibility that emperipolesis-derived platelets are functionally distinct, and potentially pro-thrombogenic, motivating future studies in this direction.</p><p>Studies of platelet function, as outlined by the reviewers, will require development of a whole new set of experimental systems. In particular, the WT/mTmG hybrid platelets are identified using a permeabilization strategy to recognize the Tomato stain on the inner membrane leaflet, and so are not suitable for functional work. We are currently experimenting with novel platelet bioreactor systems that will enable generation of platelets in quantities sufficient for studies of activation to diverse ligands, aggregation, and cytokine release. These studies are very important but, we suggest, not essential to the impact of the present paper which focuses on emperipolesis as a novel cell biological phenomenon.</p><p>We added the findings related to hybrid platelets phenotype in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“Of note, we observed an important fraction of the “red-intermediate” platelets in the mT/mG / WT chimeric mice expressing phosphatidylserine (Figure 5F and G; control for Annexin V staining in Figure 5—figure supplement 1G), while we observe normal levels of CD62P and a marginal band of β1-tubulin by microscopy (Figure 5—figure supplement 1H-I), excluding an abnormal activation phenotype (Moskalensky et al., 2018; Sadoul, 2015). […] This result suggests the possibility that emperipolesis-derived platelets could be functionally distinct, potentially including enhanced thrombogenic capacity.”</p><p>We modified the Figure 5 and Figure 5—figure supplement 1 legends accordingly:</p><p>Figure 5: “F. Annexin V MFI in WT, mT/mG, and chimeric platelets (control for binding specificity in Figure 5—figure supplement 1G). G. Frequency of Annexin V positive events among WT, mTmG and chimeric platelets. F-G. Representative of 3 experiments.”</p><p>Figure 5—figure supplement 1: “E. MKs stained with Cell Tracker Deep Red and co-cultured with surface-biotinylated BM cells were injected i.v. After 1 hour, circulating platelets are stained with Dylight 488-streptavidin. […] I. Platelets from chimeric mice were sorted basted on tdTomato expression and stained with anti-CD41 (green) an anti-β1 tubulin (blue). Representative of 2 experiments. Scale bars represents 1µm.”</p><p>We have to date observed no evidence by flow cytometry for neutrophil surface proteins on platelets generated via EP, as determined in platelets generated from MKs engrafted into mice after undergoing this process (not shown). This is in fact the expected result because platelets are generally negative for markers such as CD18, Ly6G, and CD45. Further, studies of emperipolesis of surface-biotintylated bone marrow cells, not included in the original submission but added here in revision, showed that neutrophil surface proteins emerge on MKs but not platelets as determined by streptavidin staining (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). Note that these studies do not exclude the possibility that some proteins not studied specifically may still transfer from neutrophils to platelets, and are planning proteomic studies that will specifically address this question.</p><p>We report the absence of neutrophil surface proteins on emerging platelets in the Results section as follows:</p><p>“We similarly investigated transfer of intracellular or surface protein. Marrow cells were stained with the intracellular protein stain CellTrace Violet and then co-cultured with CMFDA+ MKs. […] Moreover, platelets were negative for neutrophil surface proteins Ly6G, CD11b, CD18 and CD88 (not shown), although we cannot exclude the possibility that other surface proteins not directly assessed may still transfer from marrow cells to platelets in quantities too modest to be detected by bulk biotin-streptavidin staining.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The cytochalasinD and latrunculin experiments should be better controlled: a positive control (that both drugs effectively disrupt F-actin), quantified by microscopy or FACS, and inactive structural analogs as negative controls.</p></disp-quote><p>Cytochalasin D (CD) and latrunculin A (LA) are commonly-used reagents that alter the state of actin polymerization by different mechanisms. LA binds actin monomers and prevents them from polymerizing, while also accelerating actin depolymerization (Fujiwara et al., 2018a; Fujiwara et al., 2018b). CD binds actin filaments and blocks their elongation (Brieher, 2013; Cooper, 1987). Both products are cell-permeable and can be used on living cells, and their potential to disrupt the actin cytoskeleton has been established for decades (Cooper, 1987; Lin et al., 1980). While we agree that caution is always appropriate when applying chemical inhibitors, we highlight that the original submission had already featured such an experiment. Specifically, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A showed the efficiency of LA and CD on cytoskeleton disruption using labelled phalloidin, which binds F-actin. This experiment strongly supports the well-established use of these compounds in the way that we have employed them here. Regrettably, we are unaware of inactive structural analogs for LA and CD, though we do not consider this necessarily a limitation of our experimental design given the negative and positive controls already incorporated in our experiments.</p><p>In Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, we had chosen to confirm LA and CD efficiency by microscopy using phalloidin because flow cytometry provides information only on the overall quantity of F-actin, which may fail to reflect the true extent of cytoskeleton impairment. For example, cell treatment with CD induces an increase in F-actin signal because CD inhibits F-actin polymerization at a lower rate than it inhibits F-actin depolymerization (Rao et al., 1992; Shoji et al., 2012). However, to address the reviewer request, we repeated the experiment in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A but used flow cytometry to monitor F-actin. As expected, we found that F-actin signal is reduced with LA, while CD induces an increase of F-actin signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A and B</xref>). Our preference is to include this information for the reviewers only, rather than in the manuscript itself, because we believe that the existing Figure 3—figure supplement 1A better reflects the biologic impact of these inhibitors.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Marrow cells were treated with 1µM latrunculin A, cytochalasin D, or DMSO.</title><p>Inhibitors were either left in culture (<bold>A</bold>), or thoroughly washed after 2 hours (<bold>B</bold>).

The observation of neutrophil polarization during entry into MK (e.g. Video 2), and the formation of a transmembrane cup on MK surface (e.g. Videos 2 and 5) had strongly implicated both MK actin and neutrophil actin in emperipolesis. Further, confocal microscopy demonstrated particularly prominent actin polymerization at the MK surface where neutrophils are attached, as well as around “emperisomes” containing neutrophils (Figure 3C) where F-actin colocalized strikingly with the CD41 marker that delineates this vacuole (Figure 3C and Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Taken together, we suggest that these data conclusively establish the role of actin in emperipolesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should demonstrate that the neutrophil membrane transfer does not result in an inside-out orientation, which would expose, among other molecules, phospatidylserine and potentially mark the cells for apoptotic uptake by macrophages.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this intriguing question. To our estimation, the topology of emperipolesis would not particularly favor inversion of the neutrophil membrane during either cytoplasmic entry or membrane fusion with the demarcation membrane zone. Similarly, we observed no visible alterations in neutrophils following their exit from MKs. In particular, these neutrophils retain a normal nucleus shape and continue to diapedese freely among the other bone marrow cells in the culture. Thus none of our data to date suggest a role of emperipolesis in neutrophil clearance, though our data also do not formally exclude this possibility, and we remain very intrigued by the ways that trans-MK passage alters neutrophil function and fate.</p><p>We therefore sought to address the question experimentally. We labeled marrow cell with the membrane dye CellVue maroon to track membrane transferred during emperipolesis. Bone marrow cells were then co-cultured with MKs in the presence of FITC-labelled lactadherin (also known as MFGE8), an opsonin that binds specifically to phosphatidylserine in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent manner (Hanayama et al., 2002). While we could again demonstrate membrane transfer to the MK DMS, we failed to observe lactadherin binding to these membranes, confirming that the transfer of membrane does not result in phosphatidylserine exteriorization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> and new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Moreover, neutrophils do not overexpress phosphatidylserine when co-cultured with MKs, as evidenced by the absence of Annexin V signal on their surface by flow cytometry (New Figure 4—figure supplement 1F). Thus, while we cannot yet exclude that MK passage labels neutrophils for accelerated clearance via phagocytes, we do not observe any evidence cells are so labeled via enhanced phosphatidyserine exposure.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Bone marrowcells were stained with CellVue Maroon prior to co-culture with MKs, as in Figure 4B.</title><p>2µM of labelled lactadherin (LD, also known as MFGE8) was added in the culture.
