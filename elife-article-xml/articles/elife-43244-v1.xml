homeostasis. Additional pathways respond to ER stress, but how they help counteract protein misfolding is incompletely understood. Here, we develop a titratable system for the induction of ER stress in yeast to enable a genetic screen for factors that augment stress resistance independently of the UPR. We identify the proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 and show that it cooperates with the UPR. Rpn4 abundance increases during ER stress, first by a post-transcriptional, then by a transcriptional mechanism. Induction of <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription is triggered by cytosolic mislocalization of secretory proteins, is mediated by multiple signaling pathways and accelerates clearance of misfolded proteins from the cytosol. Thus, Rpn4 and the UPR are complementary elements of a modular cross-compartment response to ER stress.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum stress</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>Rpn4 regulon</kwd><kwd>proteasome biogenesis</kwd><kwd>protein degradation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Heidelberg Biosciences International Graduate School</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Rolf M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 81</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schmidt</surname><given-names>Rolf M</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuck</surname><given-names>Sebastian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schessner</surname><given-names>Julia P</given-names></name><name><surname>Borner</surname><given-names>Georg HH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA 1764/2-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borner</surname><given-names>Georg HH</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Endoplasmic reticulum stress in yeast activates not only the UPR but also Rpn4, promoting the clearance of misfolded proteins from the cytosol as part of a modular cross-compartment stress response.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells continuously produce a large variety of proteins. To fulfill their functions, these proteins need to be properly folded, post-translationally modified, assembled into complexes and delivered to their final subcellular destinations. If errors occur in these maturation steps, compartment-specific quality control machineries clear the resulting misfolded or mislocalized proteins through refolding or degradation. These machineries are regulated by specialized adaptive responses, which adjust the folding and degradation capacity of particular organelles to ensure efficient elimination of aberrant proteins. If unresolved, protein misfolding in one compartment can disrupt overall cell homeostasis and threaten survival.</p><p>Protein maturation in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), particularly in budding yeast, has served as a powerful paradigm to elaborate these general principles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patil and Walter, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlowe and Miller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berner et al., 2018</xref>). Newly synthesized polypeptides containing ER sorting information, for example N-terminal signal sequences, are recognized by targeting factors such as signal recognition particle (SRP) and inserted into the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aviram and Schuldiner, 2017</xref>). The process of protein insertion into the ER, termed translocation, is mediated by channel-forming translocon complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rapoport, 2007</xref>). Translocation additionally requires ER-lumenal chaperones such as the highly abundant Kar2, which therefore have dual roles in protein import and folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gething, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Young et al., 2001</xref>). Other components of the ER-resident folding machinery include oxidoreductases and glycosyltransferases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Braakman and Hebert, 2013</xref>). Proteins that have attained their native conformation are sorted into ER-to-Golgi transport carriers. Proteins that fail to fold properly become subject to ER-associated degradation (ERAD). Key steps in ERAD are protein retrotranslocation into the cytosol with the help of the AAA ATPase Cdc48, followed by degradation by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berner et al., 2018</xref>). If these mechanisms are insufficient, misfolded proteins accumulate. This condition constitutes ER stress and activates an adaptive response called the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). The UPR is triggered when misfolded proteins are sensed by the ER transmembrane protein Ire1. Activated Ire1 initiates non-conventional cytosolic splicing of the <italic>HAC1</italic> mRNA, enabling production of the transcription factor Hac1. In turn, Hac1 induces numerous genes involved in ER function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Travers et al., 2000</xref>). The resulting increase in ER protein folding capacity resolves ER stress, closing a homeostatic feedback loop. The physiological significance of the UPR is demonstrated by yeast mutants lacking Ire1 or Hac1. When challenged by ER stress, these mutants exhibit a variety of defects in translocation, glycosylation, ERAD and ER-to-Golgi transport, and rapidly lose viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spear and Ng, 2003</xref>).</p><p>A number of UPR-independent pathways respond to, and help mitigate, ER stress. These pathways include MAP kinase signaling through Slt2/Mpk1 and Hog1, the Hsf1-dependent heat shock response and protein kinase A (PKA) signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonilla and Cunningham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu and Chang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bicknell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>). However, exactly how they counteract ER stress has been difficult to determine. For instance, ER stress is alleviated by augmented ER-to-Golgi transport and enhanced elimination of reactive oxygen species downstream of the heat shock response and also by reduced protein synthesis downstream of PKA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu and Chang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>). Yet, these mechanisms only partially explain the beneficial effects of the signaling pathways controlling them. Finally, the UPR can, by unknown means, be amplified by Ire1-independent induction of <italic>HAC1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Leber et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, it remains to be fully defined which pathways cooperate with the UPR and how they contribute to ER stress resistance.</p><p>Here, we identify the proteasome biogenesis regulator Rpn4 as an important UPR-independent factor that promotes resistance to ER stress in yeast. We show that protein misfolding induces Rpn4 activity by post-transcriptional and transcriptional mechanisms, and provide evidence that Rpn4 complements the UPR by enhancing protein quality control in the cytosol.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A titratable system for the induction of ER stress</title><p>To identify pathways cooperating with the UPR, we searched for genes that can augment resistance to ER stress in UPR-deficient cells. Mutants lacking Ire1 or Hac1 grow normally under optimal conditions but cannot proliferate under even mild ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Spear and Ng, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schuck et al., 2009</xref>). We hypothesized that UPR mutants can be protected against ER stress by overexpression of genes that complement the UPR. If so, such genes should be identifiable through a screen based on cell growth phenotypes.</p><p>To implement this idea, we established a titratable system for the induction of ER stress. We used CPY*, a folding-defective variant of the soluble vacuolar carboxypeptidase Y (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Finger et al., 1993</xref>). We chose an HA-tagged mutant variant of CPY* that lacks all of its four N-glycosylation sites and is here referred to as non-glycosylatable (ng) CPY*. After translocation into the ER, this variant is unable to fold properly and is neither efficiently cleared by ERAD nor exported to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knop et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spear and Ng, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kostova and Wolf, 2005</xref>). As a result, ngCPY* accumulates in the ER lumen and burdens the ER protein folding machinery. We placed ngCPY* under the control of the <italic>GAL</italic> promoter and the artificial transcription factor Gal4-ER-Msn2 (GEM). This system allows regulation of gene expression with the exogenous steroid Î²-estradiol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>). Estradiol-driven expression of ngCPY* caused dose-dependent activation of the UPR as measured with a <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing obtained withÂ â¥100 nM estradiol was similar to that elicited by 0.5 Âµg/ml of the general ER stressor tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). For all estradiol concentrations tested, <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing declined at later time points, suggesting that cells adapted to the stress and inactivated the UPR. Estradiol-induced expression of glycosylatable CPY*, which is degraded through ERAD and can be exported from the ER, yielded much weaker and more transient UPR activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Cycloheximide chase experiments confirmed that ngCPY* was substantially more resistant to degradation than glycosylatable CPY*, as reported (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Knop et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, ngCPY* tagged with superfolder GFP (sfGFP) was largely retained in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, CPY*(N479Q)-sfGFP, which lacks the glycosylation site required for efficient ERAD but contains the three glycosylation sites needed for ER export, escaped to the vacuole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawaguchi et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43244.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A titratable system for the induction of ER stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometric measurement of GFP levels in cells harboring the <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing reporter and expressing ngCPY* under the control of the estradiol-inducible <italic>GAL</italic> promoter system.

Furthermore, estradiol-induced expression of ngCPY* in wild-type cells caused only modest growth defects on solid media, even at the highest estradiol concentration tested. In <italic>âhac1</italic> cells, however, induction of ngCPY* expression with increasing concentrations of estradiol strongly retarded and eventually prevented cell proliferation. Growth assays in liquid media yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). To determine whether the lack of proliferation of <italic>âhac1</italic> cells reflected a growth arrest or cell death, we assayed cell viability after expression of ngCPY*. No loss of viability of <italic>âhac1</italic> cells occurred, even with estradiol concentrations that completely blocked proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Hence, expression of ngCPY* merely caused a growth arrest. In summary, this estradiol-controlled system can be titrated to induce defined levels of ER stress and can be used to prevent growth of UPR-deficient cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A screen for genes promoting ER stress resistance in UPR mutants</title><p>We exploited the ngCPY*-induced growth arrest in UPR mutants to conduct a multicopy suppression screen. Cells lacking <italic>HAC1</italic> and containing the titratable ER stress system were transformed with a genomic library in a high-copy vector. Transformants were first allowed to form colonies on estradiol-free solid medium and then replicated onto media containing a range of estradiol concentrations sufficient to block growth of the parental strain. Plasmids were retrieved from transformants able to grow on estradiol-containing plates and their inserts were sequenced. The obtained candidate genes were individually subcloned into the same high-copy vector and tested for their ability to suppress the toxicity of ngCPY* in <italic>âhac1</italic> cells.</p><p>As expected, the strongest suppressor was <italic>HAC1</italic>, which complemented the <italic>HAC1</italic> deletion in the parental strain. The next strongest suppressors as judged by growth assays on solid and in liquid media were <italic>RPN4</italic>, <italic>PDR1</italic> and <italic>SSZ1</italic>. Additional, but weaker, suppressors were <italic>YAP1</italic>, <italic>CAD1</italic>, <italic>SAF1</italic>, <italic>MUM2</italic> and <italic>NOP56</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Rpn4 is a transcription factor that localizes to the cytosol and the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tkach et al., 2012</xref>). Its primary function is the induction of genes encoding proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dohmen et al., 2007</xref>). Pdr1 is another transcription factor, controls genes involved in multidrug resistance and induces <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owsianik et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prasad and Goffeau, 2012</xref>). Ssz1 is part of the ribosome-associated chaperone complex and its overproduction activates Pdr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hallstrom et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conz et al., 2007</xref>). Yap1 is a third transcription factor, mediates the oxidative stress response and also induces <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Owsianik et al., 2002</xref>). Considering these links, we tested whether Pdr1, Ssz1 and Yap1 enhanced ER stress resistance by raising Rpn4 levels. We generated <italic>âhac1</italic> cells in which the <italic>RPN4</italic> gene was controlled by the constitutive <italic>CYC1</italic> promoter and thus uncoupled from its normal regulation. We then overexpressed <italic>RPN4</italic>, <italic>PDR1</italic>, <italic>SSZ1</italic> or <italic>YAP1</italic> and assayed growth in the presence ngCPY*. Overexpression of all four genes promoted growth under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Hence, Pdr1, Ssz1 and Yap1 can enhance ER stress resistance also when they are unable to activate the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter. It therefore appears likely that Pdr1 and Yap1 relieve ER stress in our system by inducing target genes other than <italic>RPN4</italic>. In the case of Pdr1, candidates include genes for multidrug transporters such as <italic>PDR5</italic>, <italic>PDR10</italic> and <italic>PDR15</italic>, which may export estradiol from cells and thereby lower the levels of ngCPY*.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43244.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Multicopy suppression of ngCPY* toxicity in <italic>âhac1</italic> cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Growth assay on solid media of wild-type (WT) and <italic>âhac1</italic> cells expressing ngCPY* under the control of the estradiol-inducible <italic>GAL</italic> promoter system and overexpressing <italic>RPN4</italic>, <italic>SSZ1</italic> or <italic>PDR1</italic> from extrachromosomal plasmids where indicated.

However, the entirety of genes controlled by Rpn4, here referred to as the Rpn4 regulon, encompasses many genes beyond those encoding proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mannhaupt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jelinsky et al., 2000</xref>). Rpn4 may therefore counteract ER stress by more than one mechanism. Indeed, the <italic>RPN4</italic> regulator Yap1 is itself activated by Rpn4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mannhaupt et al., 1999</xref>) and may aid stress resistance by preventing oxidative damage. Furthermore, we directly tested the Rpn4 target gene <italic>CDC48</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosis et al., 2010</xref>), even though it was not found in the screen. Overexpression of <italic>CDC48</italic> also restored growth of <italic>âhac1</italic> cells expressing ngCPY*, although weakly compared to overexpression of <italic>RPN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-E</xref>). Overall, the outcome of the screen suggests that Rpn4 activity becomes limiting for cell proliferation during ER stress, at least in UPR mutants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rpn4 and the UPR cooperate to counteract ER stress</title><p><italic>RPN4</italic> is not controlled by Hac1 and hence not a UPR target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Travers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>). This lack of a direct link suggests that Rpn4 acts in parallel to, rather than downstream of, the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ng et al., 2000</xref>). To better understand the interplay between Rpn4 and the UPR, we manipulated Rpn4 levels in wild-type and â<italic>hac1</italic> cells and challenged these cells with ngCPY* or tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>RPN4</italic> in wild-type cells increased resistance to both stressors. This observation indicates that Rpn4 activity becomes limiting for cell proliferation during ER stress also when the UPR is intact. Conversely, deletion of <italic>RPN4</italic> caused a general growth defect and sensitized cells to ngCPY* and tunicamycin, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016</xref>).

The synthetic sickness phenotype of <italic>âhac1 ârpn4</italic> cells agrees with earlier reports and shows that Rpn4 and the UPR are functionally linked (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ng et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hou et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The slow growth of <italic>âhac1 ârpn4</italic> double mutants compared with <italic>ârpn4</italic> single mutants implies that the UPR is constitutively active and physiologically important in Rpn4-deficient cells. Indeed, <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing was elevated in untreated <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells, consistent with high throughput data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jonikas et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, quantitative real-time PCR showed that mRNA levels of the UPR target genes <italic>KAR2</italic> and <italic>SIL1</italic> were higher in <italic>ârpn4</italic> mutants than in wild-typeÂ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). To further characterize the effect of <italic>RPN4</italic> deletion, we compared the proteomes of wild-type and <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells by quantitative mass spectrometry. As expected, the abundance of proteasome subunits was reduced in cells lacking Rpn4, while the abundance of proteins encoded by UPR target genes was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>). Many other proteins were changed significantly, illustrating the profound impact of loss of Rpn4. First, Cdc48 levels were lower in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells. Second, the levels of the stress-inducible proteasome assembly chaperone Tma17 and its activator Slt2/Mpk1 were elevated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hanssum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016</xref>). Third, cytosolic protein folding machinery was upregulated and the abundance of many ribosomal proteins was suppressed, indicating a broad stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). Fourth, many proteins that are involved in sterol synthesis and constitutively turned over by different ERAD pathways were more abundant in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells. These proteins included Erg1, 3, 5, 9, 11, 25, 27, 28 and Hmg2, although only Erg1 and Erg3 met our stringent criteria for significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hampton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foresti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foresti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hitchcock et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Khmelinskii et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christiano et al., 2014</xref>). Their accumulation implies generally impaired ERAD in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells. Importantly, neither Erg1 nor Erg3 are regulated by the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Travers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>), arguing against the possibility that their increased abundance can be explained by the constitutive activation of the UPR in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells. In sum, cells lacking Rpn4 suffer from chronic ER stress, likely because inefficient ERAD leads to an accumulation of misfolded and redundant proteins in the ER. In response, they activate the UPR, augment proteasome assembly capacity, enhance cytosolic protein folding and attenuate protein synthesis.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43244.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Loss of Rpn4 activates the UPR and triggers a broad adaptive response.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Flow cytometric measurement of GFP levels relative to cytosolic BFP in wild-type (WT) and <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells harboring the <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing reporter.

To test whether the inverse is true and cells compensate the lack of a functionally sufficient UPR by activating the Rpn4 regulon, we monitored Rpn4 abundance. Rpn4 is a short-lived protein that is rapidly turned over by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</xref>). When proteasome capacity becomes limiting, Rpn4 accumulates and promotes proteasome biogenesis until its degradation is restored. This negative feedback loop homeostatically adjusts proteasome activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dohmen et al., 2007</xref>). The levels of chromosomally tagged Rpn4-HA in wild-type and <italic>âhac1</italic> cells were similar at steady state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Upon treatment with 2 Âµg/ml tunicamycin, they increased two-fold within 15 min. Subsequently, Rpn4 abundance continued to climb but did so more quickly in <italic>âhac1</italic> cells, reaching more than four-fold basal levels after 60 min. To determine whether this rise involved an upregulation of <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription, we analyzed <italic>RPN4</italic> mRNA by quantitative real-time PCR. In wild-type cells, tunicamycin treatment for up to 60 min induced the UPR target genes <italic>KAR2</italic> and <italic>SIL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>), but not <italic>RPN4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, under these conditions, Rpn4 accumulates through a post-transcriptional mechanism, presumably by slowed degradation. In <italic>âhac1</italic> cells, tunicamycin treatment induced <italic>KAR2</italic> and <italic>SIL1</italic> less strongly than in wild-type cells but increased <italic>RPN4</italic> mRNA levels. While we cannot rule out changes in mRNA stability, we assume that this rise reflects enhanced transcription. This response likely contributes to the more pronounced stress-induced upregulation of Rpn4 abundance in <italic>âhac1</italic> cells. Importantly, prolonged ER stress upon treatment with 5 Âµg/ml tunicamycin raised <italic>RPN4</italic> mRNA levels also in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Accordingly, the protein abundance of proteasome subunits and all detectable proteasome assembly chaperones was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4âsource data 1</xref>). Hence, during ER stress, cells augment the UPR by enhancing Rpn4 activity and promoting proteasome biogenesis. Interestingly, proteasome subunit abundance still increased during ER stress in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5âfigure supplement 2</xref>), possibly reflecting a recently suggested post-transcriptional mechanism mediated by Slt2/Mpk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the levels of proteasome subunits in ER-stressed <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells remained below even those of untreated wild-type cells.

The stronger increase in Rpn4 abundance and the more sensitive <italic>RPN4</italic> transcriptional response in <italic>âhac1</italic> cells may reflect more severe ER stress in these mutants. To test this assumption, we used protein translocation as readout for ER function. When the capacity of ER chaperones is exhausted, they can no longer assist protein import. As a result, translocation is compromised, including that of Kar2 itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Vogel et al., 1990</xref>).

ER protein misfolding causes increased flux through the ERAD pathway, which strains proteasome capacity and inhibits efficient protein degradation (1). In addition, the UPR is activated (2). Severe ER stress leads to translocation defects, causing mislocalization of secretory proteins to the cytosol, where they cannot fold properly (3). These cytosolic misfolded proteins further burden the proteasome (4). As a result, Rpn4 is stabilized, the Rpn4 regulon is activated and proteasome biogenesis is enhanced. If cytosolic misfolded proteins persist, the <italic>RPN4</italic> gene is induced (5), providing a second mechanism to increase Rpn4 abundance and augment proteasome biogenesis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-43244-fig8-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Given that ER stress triggers the general stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pincus et al., 2014</xref>), we asked whether Msn2/4 downstream of PKA can activate the <italic>RPN4</italic> gene. We used a strain in which the PKA isoforms Tpk1/2/3 had been modified such that their enlarged ATP binding pockets allowed specific inhibition of these kinases with the bulky ATP analog 1NM-PP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hao and O'Shea, 2012</xref>). 1NM-PP1 treatment of cells harboring the analog-sensitive <italic>tpk1/2/3-as</italic> alleles induced both the <italic>RPN4</italic> reporter and the endogenous <italic>RPN4</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>).

Based on our findings, we propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Protein misfolding in the ER burdens the proteasome by increased flux through the ERAD pathway, activates the UPR and eventually impairs protein translocation into the ER. As a result, secretory proteins mislocalize to the cytosol, where they are unable to fold properly and further strain proteasome capacity. Inefficient proteasomal degradation leads to an increase in Rpn4 abundance and activation of the Rpn4 regulon, which enhances proteasome biogenesis to clear misfolded ER and cytosolic proteins. Furthermore, persistent cytosolic protein misfolding induces the <italic>RPN4</italic> gene through the transcription factors Msn2/4, Yap1 and Hsf1. The resulting rise in Rpn4 protein levels reinforces activation of the Rpn4 regulon.</p><p>Rpn4 abundance is controlled by rapid proteasomal turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Xie and Varshavsky, 2001</xref>) and by <italic>RPN4</italic> gene activity. ER stress initially increases Rpn4 protein levels. Persistent ER stress, however, additionally raises <italic>RPN4</italic> mRNA levels. These observations suggest a biphasic Rpn4 response. First, when misfolded proteins occupy the proteasome, Rpn4 is spared from degradation and activates its target genes, but <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription remains unchanged. This scenario likely applies to early phases of ER stress and cases of mild stress. For instance, expression of the misfolded ER membrane protein Ste6* activates the Rpn4 regulon but not <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Metzger and Michaelis, 2009</xref>). If slowed Rpn4 degradation is insufficient to resolve the stress, <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription is upregulated in a second phase of the response, which provides another boost in Rpn4 target gene induction. Msn2/4, Yap1 and Hsf1 contribute to the stress-induced upregulation of <italic>RPN4</italic>, indicating that parallel pathways communicate protein misfolding to the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter. This situation is distinct from <italic>RPN4</italic> induction after glucose starvation or heat shock, which requires Hsf1 but not Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hahn and Thiele, 2004a</xref>). Interestingly, the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter does not contain a canonical stress response element as binding site for Msn2/4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">MartÃ­nez-Pastor et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, it is not clear whether Msn2/4 bind to the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter directly, although high throughput data hint at this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harbison et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Huebert et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, it remains to be determined exactly how cytosolic misfolding is sensed by Msn2/4, Hsf1 and Yap1. While the detection of misfolded cytosolic proteins by Hsf1 has been studied extensively, it is unknown how protein kinase A, which controls Msn2/4 and possibly also Hsf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Verghese et al., 2012</xref>), may monitor protein folding. Finally, it is unclear whether Yap1 is directly activated by misfolded proteins. Alternatively, its contribution to <italic>RPN4</italic> activation could reflect the fact that <italic>YAP1</italic> is an Rpn4 target gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mannhaupt et al., 1999</xref>) and may reinforce <italic>RPN4</italic> transcription as part of a positive feedback loop.</p><p>Rpn4 controls genes involved in many processes, including proteasome biogenesis, protein ubiquitination and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mannhaupt et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jelinsky et al., 2000</xref>). Hence, the Rpn4 regulon could increase ER stress resistance through a combination of functional outputs. However, it has been shown that the sensitivity of <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells to various stresses, including ER stress, results from their impaired induction of proteasome genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). Enhanced proteasome biogenesis is therefore likely to be critical for the promotion of ER stress resistance by Rpn4. Accordingly, overexpression of the Rpn4 target genes <italic>YAP1</italic> or <italic>CDC48</italic> increases ER stress resistance of UPR mutants much more weakly than <italic>RPN4</italic> overexpression. Therefore, the relevant functions of Rpn4 must extend beyond inducing Yap1-driven oxidative stress tolerance or Cdc48-dependent ERAD, and our data support the notion that enhancing degradation of cytosolically mislocalized secretory proteins is a major factor. Nevertheless, the relative contributions of different components of the Rpn4 regulon to ER stress resistance remain to be delineated.</p><p>An effective UPR requires sufficient proteasome capacity to remove misfolded proteins through ERAD. Yet, the UPR does not control genes encoding proteasome subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Travers et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, the only proteasome-related genes among the 102 genes we defined as core UPR targets were <italic>PBA1</italic> and <italic>ADD66</italic>, which encode proteasome assembly chaperones. Conversely, the Rpn4 regulon comprises most genes for proteasome subunits but only a few genes involved in ER protein folding, such as <italic>PDI1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mannhaupt et al., 1999</xref>). Hence, the transcriptional programs activated by the UPR and Rpn4 are largely distinct. They are, however, functionally complementary and represent two cooperating modules. This functional complementarity explains the strong negative genetic interaction between <italic>HAC1</italic> and <italic>RPN4</italic>. Remarkably, ER stress activates a second signaling pathway that promotes proteasome biogenesis. The Slt2/Mpk1 MAP kinase, which augments ER stress resistance, controls chaperones responsible for 19S regulatory particle assembly and increases the abundance of complete 26S proteasomes during stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bonilla and Cunningham, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016</xref>). Taken together, it is evident that proteasome biogenesis is an important UPR-independent process that enhances resistance to ER stress.</p><p>ER homeostasis and proteasome biogenesis are coupled also in higher eukaryotes, as shown by activation of the mammalian UPR upon proteasome inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Nishitoh et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Obeng et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, the mechanisms adjusting proteasome abundance in yeast and mammals share extensive similarities. Proteasome inhibition, which mimics proteasome overload, induces proteasome genes also in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mitsiades et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meiners et al., 2003</xref>). This response is mediated by the transcription factor Nrf1 and the Slt2/Mpk1 homolog Erk5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rousseau and Bertolotti, 2016</xref>). Similar to Rpn4, Nrf1 is short-lived and activates many proteasome genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Radhakrishnan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>). Remarkably, Nrf1 is constitutively turned over by ERAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Steffen et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, when ER stress overburdens ERAD, Nrf1 is stabilized and can promote proteasome biogenesis. Another intriguing parallel involves the mammalian proteasome assembly chaperones PAC1/2. As mentioned above, expression of their yeast counterparts <italic>PBA1</italic> and <italic>ADD66</italic> is induced by the UPR. PAC1/2 protein abundance also increases during ER stress, although this is achieved by iRhom1-mediated stabilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). Understanding the links between the UPR and proteasome biogenesis is relevant for human disease. Multiple myeloma cells suffer from chronic ER stress and are highly sensitive to proteasome inhibition, implying that proteasome capacity is limiting for survival of these cells. This insight has led to major improvements in the treatment of plasma cell cancer through the use of proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goldberg, 2012</xref>).</p><p>A simple perspective on adaptive responses is that protein misfolding in a particular subcellular compartment triggers a dedicated program that enhances quality control specifically in the troubled organelle. Our work supports a more holistic view that emphasizes two additional concepts: functional modularity and cross-compartment coordination. Regulated proteasome biogenesis is a functional module that serves as part of the cellular response to ER stress. Interestingly, proteasome biogenesis is also activated by impaired mitochondrial protein import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang and Chen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boos et al., 2019</xref>). It may therefore be a functional module that is commonly employed when stress necessitates clearance of mislocalized proteins from the cytosol. Autophagy and global attenuation of translation may be other such modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, adaptive responses are not restricted to the compartment where stress initially arises. For example, as shown here, ER stress activates the UPR but also the Rpn4 regulon to safeguard against protein misfolding in the cytosol. Second, certain types of mitochondrial stress trigger the mitochondrial unfolded protein response but also activate the cytosolic heat shock response and promote proteasome biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wrobel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boos et al., 2019</xref>). Third, cytosolic folding stress activates the Hsf1-dependent heat shock response, which promotes protein folding in the cytosol but also controls the expression of major chaperones that function elsewhere, including Kar2 in the ER and Ssc1 in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamamoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahn et al., 2004b</xref>). Fourth, the UPR regulates genes that function in the entire secretory pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Travers et al., 2000</xref>). Many additional links between different organelle quality control systems exist in yeast and higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Higuchi-Sanabria et al., 2018</xref>). A driving force for the evolution of these links may have been the need to prevent the spread of protein folding problems throughout the cell. Overall, it emerges that adaptive responses, although triggered by stress in one compartment, engage a combination of functional modules for comprehensive cell protection across compartment boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain (S. cerevisiae)</td><td>W303</td><td>other</td><td/><td>see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (E. coli)</td><td><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genomic library in YEp13 E. coli</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nasmyth and Tatchell, 1980</xref></td><td>ATCC 37323</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rat monoclonal anti-HA (clone 3F10)</td><td>Roche</td><td>Cat#11867423001; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390918">AB_390918</ext-link></td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-mCherry</td><td>Biovision</td><td>Cat#5993; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1975001">AB_1975001</ext-link></td><td>(1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>rabbit polyclonal anti-Kar2</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schuck et al., 2009</xref></td><td/><td>(1:50000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>mouse monoclonal anti-Pgk1 (clone 22C5)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat#Ab113687; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10861977">AB_10861977</ext-link></td><td>(1:50000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-mouse HRP</td><td>Thermo FisherÂ Scientific Pierce</td><td>Cat#31432; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_228302">AB_228302</ext-link></td><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>goat anti-rabbit HRP</td><td>Thermo FisherÂ Scientific Pierce</td><td>Cat#31462; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_228338">AB_228338</ext-link></td><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>donkey anti-rat HRP</td><td>Jackson</td><td>Cat#712-035-153; RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2340639">AB_2340639</ext-link></td><td>(1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>plasmids</td><td>other</td><td>doi:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.n20d476">10.5061/dryad.n20d476</ext-link></td><td>see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>NEBuilder HiFi DNA assembly master mix</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>Cat#E2611L</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>BCA assay kit</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific Pierce</td><td>Cat#23225</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>ProtoScript II cDNA Synthesis kit</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>Cat#E6560L</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>SensiFAST SYBR No-ROX kit</td><td>Bioline</td><td>Cat#BIO-98050</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ã-estradiol</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#E8875; CAS: 50-28-2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td valign="bottom">1NM-PP1</td><td>Merck</td><td>Cat#529581â1 MG; CAS: 221244-14-0</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>tunicamycin</td><td>Merck</td><td>Cat#654380â50 MG; CAS: 11089-65-9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>cycloheximide</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat#C7698; CAS: 66-81-9</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>complete protease inhibitor</td><td>Roche</td><td>Cat#04693116001</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="bottom">Growthcurver</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sprouffske and Wagner, 2016</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>MaxQuant</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox et al., 2014</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Perseus</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>CMAC stain</td><td>Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td>Cat#C2110</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>mass spectrometry proteomics data</td><td>this study</td><td>PRIDE database, PXD012867</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>Plasmids are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Tunicamycin was added to the remainder of each culture at a final concentration of 5 Âµg/ml, cells were grown for 4 hr, and 5 ODs of cells were harvested as treated samples. Cells were collected by centrifugation and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Samples from four independent experiments were used for proteomic analysis. Cells were resuspended in ice-cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1x Roche complete protease inhibitors) and disrupted by bead beating. Proteins were solubilized by adding SDS to a final concentration of 1.8% (w/v) and heating to 95Â°C for 10 min. Protein concentrations were determined with a BCA assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Per sample, 200 Âµg protein was precipitated with acetone and resuspended in digestion buffer (8 M Urea, 50 mM Tris pH 8.5, 1 mM DTT) to a concentration of 4 mg/ml. 40 Âµg protein was alkylated using 5 mM iodoacetamide for 1 hr, digested with LysC (enzyme to proteinÂ =Â 1:50 (w/w)) for 5.5 hr, diluted to 2 M Urea, and digested with Trypsin (1:50 (w/w)) for another 13 hr at room temperature.

Downstream analysis was performed in Perseus version 1.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). LFQ intensities based on fewer than 2 MS/MS counts were removed from the dataset. The remaining intensities were log-transformed. For the pairwise analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5F</xref>, further quality filtering was applied. Only proteins that were quantified in all four replicates of at least one of the compared conditions were retained. Missing values were then imputed from a normal distribution (width 0.3 SDs, down-shifted by 1.8 SDs). For statistical analysis, a two-sided studentâs t-test with permutation based false discovery rate control (FDRÂ =Â 1%) and an S0 parameter of 0.2 was performed. The category annotation enrichment was calculated with the 1D annotation enrichment tool in Perseus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>), using mean log<sub>2</sub> expression differences.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: David Pincus (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use a titratable ER stress inducing system in yeast to identify specific stress-responsive pathways that coordinate with the UPR to protect cells against ER stress. In a suppressor screen, they show that overexpression of <italic>RPN4</italic> (and many other genes known to regulate <italic>RPN4</italic>) rescues growth defects in yeast deficient in the UPR-associated transcription factor treated with different types of ER stress. <italic>RPN4</italic> is the yeast transcription factor primarily responsible for regulating proteasome activity. They go on to show that <italic>rpn-4</italic> and <italic>hac-1</italic> synthetically influence yeast growth in the absence and presence of stress, suggesting cooperative protective activities for these transcription factors. In response to ER stress, the authors propose that impaired ERAD and the accumulation of mislocalized ER proteins in the cytosol challenge proteasome activity resulting in <italic>RPN4</italic> activation. Initially, <italic>RPN4</italic> is post-transcriptionally regulated, likely through impaired proteasomal degradation, but at later points, <italic>rpn-4</italic> is transcriptionally induced in a process dependent on multiple stress-responsive transcription factors including <italic>HSF1</italic> and <italic>YAP</italic>. Ultimately, the authors propose that <italic>RPN4</italic> and <italic>HAC1</italic> represent two complementary signaling mechanisms involved in coordinating the cellular response in response to ER stress.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting manuscript addressing important questions related to the coordination of stress-pathways in response to diverse insults. The experiments are generally well performed and the conclusions are supported by the experimental data. However, we have identified three points that we feel must be addressed in revision and also ask you to consider (at your discretion) other points that came up in review, provided they can may be addressed in short order.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Drawing on point 1 of reviewer 1 and 2 we note that the genetic link to Rpn4 is a key conclusion of the paper. As you speculate that some of the other hit in the high-dose suppressor screen may encode genes that operate upstream of Rpn4, we think it is reasonable to ask that you apply genetic tests to examine this point.</p><p>2) Drawing on point 2 of reviewers 1 and 2, and also referred to by reviewer 3, we feel that the question whether Rpn4 upregulation impacts favourably on the well-being of ER stressed cells by helping restore protein folding homeostasis in the ER or by some other mechanism is a key element of the paper. Therefore, we ask that you try to address this point further. Whether you do so by measuring the level of <italic>IRE1</italic> activity (with a splicing reporter) or by directly measuring the buildup of unfolded proteins, or by some other more clever means, will be up to you.</p><p>3) Drawing on point 4 of reviewers 2 and the comments of reviewer 3, we ask that you extend the analysis beyond Rpn4 and examine the effects of unmitigated ER stress on expression of proteasome subunits and other genes in the proteasome biogenesis sphere.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This paper presents a thorough analysis of the interactions between protein quality control pathways in the yeast ER and cytosol. The key insights have been gleaned from application of an unbiased technique: a genomic high dose suppressor library. This genome wide screen revealed the capacity for enhanced expression of Rpn4 (a transcription factor concerned with activation of genes important for proteasomal biogenesis) and potentially allied genes, to buffer the consequence of deficiencies in the UPR in ER-stressed yeast.</p><p>The findings here give rise to some interesting, unanticipated conclusions. Notably that the aforementioned buffering occurs despite the fact that the transcriptional control of genes that enhance the protein folding capacity of the ER and the genes involved in proteasome biogenesis occurs by parallel pathways.</p><p>There two points of critique that I feel should be addressed:</p><p>The authors present a strong case that in the unbuffered state (e.g. tunicamycin-treated â<italic>hac1</italic> yeast) activation of Rnp4 arises by the presence in the cytosol of proteins that would otherwise find their way into the ER. This begs the question if the buffering of the growth defect arising from Rnp4 over-expression reflects predominantly the role of the proteasome in alleviating this cytosolic problem, or if the presumptive enhanced proteasomal function of Rpn4(+) cells also reflects a cross compartment effect, whereby the Rpn4(+); E2-treated ngCPY*; â<italic>hac1</italic> cells also experience lower levels of ER stress; lower than the comparison group in which Rpn4 is not over-expressed? It may be possible to gage the level of unfolded protein stress in the ER by monitoring the state of Ire1p activity. I'm not sure if it is possible to monitor endogenous Ire1p phosphorylation in budding yeast, but perhaps this question can be answered by introducing an inert Hac1 splicing reporter into the experimental system.</p><p>The authors speculate on the possibility that buffering observed by Pdr1 and Ssz1 over-expression may be channelled through their role in raising the levels of Rpn4, thus providing a unifying mechanism of action for the top hits in this screen. Can this notion be tested? Is the buffering by Pdr1(+) and Ssz1(+) of E2-treated ngCPY*; â<italic>hac1</italic> cells eliminated by âRpn4?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use a titratable ER stress inducing system in yeast to identify specific stress-responsive pathways that coordinate with the UPR to protect cells against ER stress.

The experiments are generally well performed and the conclusions are supported by the experiments. However, I have a few specific comments primarily pertaining the relationship between <italic>RPN4</italic> activation and specific biologic functions during ER stress that should be addressed prior to publication. I outline these comments below.</p><p>1) The authors suggest that other genes identified in their screen (e.g., <italic>PDR1, SSZ1</italic>, and <italic>YAP1</italic>) promote cellular growth of <italic>hac1</italic>-deficient cells in the presence of ER stress through activation of <italic>RPN4</italic>. If this is the case, one would predict that overexpression of these genes would not rescue growth in <italic>rpn4</italic>-deficient yeast incubated with increasing amounts of ER stress. This would provide further evidence that these genes function in the screen through the upregulation of <italic>RPN4</italic>, as suggested. Alternatively, this could function through alternative mechanisms. Either way, it would be interesting to define the specific dependence of gene rescue from these different hits on <italic>RPN-4</italic>.</p><p>2) The authors suggest that the increased UPR afforded by ER stress in <italic>rpn-4</italic> deficient yeast results from the ER buildup of misfolded ERAD substrates. This is probably true, but it would be good to see the increased ER accumulation of these proteins to confirm this model.</p><p>3) The authors suggest that accumulation of ER proteins through either increased ERAD or impaired translocation is responsible for the increased <italic>RPN4</italic> activity observed during ER stress. They do a nice job of testing the impaired translocation using the <italic>sec65</italic> mutant. However, it would be interesting to define the importance of ERAD in this process using <italic>hrd-1</italic> deficient yeast. If ERAD is required, one would expect that overexpression of <italic>RPN4</italic> should not rescue growth under these conditions. It would be nice to complete the study by testing this alternative mechanism of increased cytosolic protein load afforded by increased ERAD.</p><p>4) The idea is that increases in <italic>RPN4</italic> coordinate with the UPR by upregulating proteasome biogenesis (i.e., increasing proteasome capacity). However, increased expression of proteasome subunits and measures of proteasome activity are not provided (although they do show modest increases in the degradation of cytosolic proteins in cells following <italic>RPN4</italic> overexpression). If <italic>RPN4</italic> is protective during ER stress through increased proteasome biogenesis, shouldn't there be a measurable increase in proteasome capacity? Also, shouldn't there be an increase in proteasome subunit expression? This type of information should be provided to support the overall model proposed in panel 7F.</p><p>5) Along the same lines as #3, does ER stress induce proteasome biogenesis in mammalian cells? There are lots of transcriptional profiles available, and it would be interesting to see if this model is conserved in higher eukaryotes. If not, are there other mechanisms involved that perform a similar function such as the iRHom regulation during ER stress in flies reported by Lee et al., 2015?</p><p>6) The authors show that they can suppress the transcriptional upregulation of <italic>RPN4</italic> by deletion of <italic>MSN2/4</italic> and removal of the YRE and HSE from the <italic>rpn-4</italic> promoter. Can they use this approach to define the relative importance of posttranscriptional and transcriptional regulation of <italic>RPN4</italic> during ER stress? It would be interesting to define the specific dependence of yeast protection against ER stress on these two aspects of <italic>RPN4</italic> regulation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This paper by Schmidt and Schuck is a valuable contribution to our understanding of cellular stress response signaling. The major conclusion is that the accumulation of unfolded proteins in the lumen of the ER does not merely activate the UPR(er), but rather triggers a chain of events that results in mistargeting of ER clients to the cytosol where they trigger a secondary set of proteostasis pathways. These pathways converge on the transcription of <italic>RPN4</italic>, which encodes the master transcriptional regulator of proteasome biogenesis, thereby promoting protein degradation. The experiments are well executed and clearly presented in the text and figures, and the data are convincing.</p><p>To arrive at their conclusions, the authors develop a titratable induction system in yeast that allows them to tune the level of unfolded proteins in the ER, and they couple it to fluorescent reporters that allow them to measure activity in the UPR and other stress response pathways. In my opinion, this system now represents the gold standard for physiological/homeostatic probing of the UPR and should be refactored and ported to mammalian cells. They also nicely connected the dots between ER stress and overload to cytosolic mistargeting using a Kar2-SS cleavage assay and a <italic>sec65</italic>-ts mutant.</p><p>The only aspect of the paper that is wanting is the end, where the authors bash the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter and use analog sensitive PKA and <italic>msn2/4</italic>â strains to attempt to define the signals that activate <italic>RPN4</italic>. The approach here is a bit muddled and as such the conclusion is not clear. To bring this home, I would recommend doing a clean necessary/sufficient scan of the TF binding sites in the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter. Start with 1kb upstream of <italic>RPN4</italic>: there are 6 STREs, 2 PDREs, 1 YRE and 1 HSE (I am happy to send my analysis of where the STREs are, as apparently the authors could not find them). In addition to the PDRE, YRE and HSE mutants the authors have, order a GBlock lacking the STREs and do the RT-qPCR. This will complete the necessity set. For sufficiency, just order 4 Gblocks that have only the 6 STREs, 2PDREs, the YRE or the HSE. Then add Tm and induced ngCPY* and measure <italic>RPN4</italic> expression and growth in this set. The PKA/<italic>msn2/4</italic> mutants, while clever, don't make the point as clearly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43244.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Drawing on point 1 of reviewer 1 and 2 we note that the genetic link to Rpn4 is a key conclusion of the paper.

A comparison of wild-type and <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells at steady state showed a reduction in proteasome subunit abundance and chronic UPR activation, as expected. Furthermore, we observed that untreated <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells accumulate proteins normally degraded by ERAD, upregulate proteasome assembly factors, mount a constitutive heat shock response and attenuate ribosome biogenesis, illustrating a broad adaptive response (see the second paragraph of the aforementioned subsection and new Figure 4D).

This is probably true, but it would be good to see the increased ER accumulation of these proteins to confirm this model.</p></disp-quote><p>As part of our proteomic analyses (see point 4 below), we found that deletion of <italic>RPN4</italic> increases the abundance of several proteins that are involved in sterol synthesis and constitutively turned over by different ERAD pathways (subsection âRpn4 and the UPR cooperate to counteract ER stressâ, second paragraph and new Figure 4D). This observation supports the model that lack of Rpn4 activity leads to a buildup of ERAD substrates and subsequent UPR activation. Importantly, the alternative explanation that lack of Rpn4 activity causes UPR activation by a different mechanism and in this way upregulates expression of the above ERAD substrates is unlikely because the genes encoding these ERAD substrates are not regulated by the UPR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors suggest that accumulation of ER proteins through either increased ERAD or impaired translocation is responsible for the increased RPN4 activity observed during ER stress. They do a nice job of testing the impaired translocation using the sec65 mutant. However, it would be interesting to define the importance of ERAD in this process using hrd-1 deficient yeast. If ERAD is required, one would expect that overexpression of RPN4 should not rescue growth under these conditions. It would be nice to complete the study by testing this alternative mechanism of increased cytosolic protein load afforded by increased ERAD.</p></disp-quote><p>It appears that we misled the reviewer by our inaccurate portrayal of the role of <italic>HRD1</italic> in ERAD. While important, Hrd1 is not âessentialâ for ERAD as we had phrased it, because several ERAD pathways exist even in yeast (mediated by the ubiquitin ligases Hrd1, Doa10 and Asi1/2/3). Therefore, the suggested epistasis experiment of completely blocking ERAD and asking whether now <italic>RPN4</italic> overexpression no longer rescues growth is difficult to do and outside the scope of this revision. However, the fundamental point raised by the reviewer remains valid and it will be interesting to determine whether the increased cytosolic protein folding load that activates and is mitigated by Rpn4 arises from impaired translocation, increased ERAD, or both.</p><p>We originally included <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing in <italic>âhrd1</italic> cells merely as a reference point for the <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing seen in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells. Since the qPCR data (Figure 4B and C) and proteomics data (new Figure 4D) clearly show constitutive UPR activation in <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells, we would like to avoid any confusion and have removed <italic>âhrd1</italic> cells from Figure 4A. The figureâs conclusion, i.e. that there is elevated <italic>HAC1</italic> splicing in <italic>rpn4â</italic> cells, is unaffected by this change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The idea is that increases in RPN4 coordinate with the UPR by upregulating proteasome biogenesis (i.e., increasing proteasome capacity). However, increased expression of proteasome subunits and measures of proteasome activity are not provided (although they do show modest increases in the degradation of cytosolic proteins in cells following RPN4 overexpression). If RPN4 is protective during ER stress through increased proteasome biogenesis, shouldn't there be a measurable increase in proteasome capacity? Also, shouldn't there be an increase in proteasome subunit expression? This type of information should be provided to support the overall model proposed in panel 7F.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point, we performed proteomic analyses of untreated and tunicamycin-treated wild-type and <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells. As anticipated from the activation of Rpn4 by ER stress, the expression levels of proteasome subunits and proteasome assembly chaperones rose in tunicamycin-treated wild-type cells (subsection âRpn4 and the UPR cooperate to counteract ER stressâ, last paragraph and new Figure 5F). A comparison of wild-type and <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells at steady state showed a reduction in proteasome subunit abundance and chronic UPR activation, as expected. Furthermore, we observed that untreated <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells accumulate proteins normally degraded by ERAD, upregulate proteasome assembly factors, mount a constitutive heat shock response and attenuate ribosome biogenesis, illustrating a broad adaptive response (subsection âRpn4 and the UPR cooperate to counteract ER stressâ, second paragraph and new Figure 4D). Finally, we found that, surprisingly, <italic>ârpn4</italic> cells still elevate proteasome subunit abundance during ER stress (subsection âRpn4 and the UPR cooperate to counteract ER stressâ, last paragraph, and new Figure 5âfigure supplement 2). However, this response is insufficient to reach the levels seen in wild-type cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Along the same lines as #3, does ER stress induce proteasome biogenesis in mammalian cells? There are lots of transcriptional profiles available, and it would be interesting to see if this model is conserved in higher eukaryotes. If not, are there other mechanisms involved that perform a similar function such as the iRHom regulation during ER stress in flies reported by Lee et al., 2015?</p></disp-quote><p>Prompted by this query and also the comment of reviewer #1 above, we expanded the section on mammalian cells in the Discussion and included the Lee et al. paper mentioned above (Discussion, fifth paragraph). We use Nrf1 and the iRhom1-regulated PAC1/2 as examples to illustrate how ER stress can induce proteasome biogenesis in mammals. A systematic analysis of transcriptional profiles would certainly be interesting but is outside the scope of this revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors show that they can suppress the transcriptional upregulation of RPN4 by deletion of MSN2/4 and removal of the YRE and HSE from the rpn-4 promoter. Can they use this approach to define the relative importance of posttranscriptional and transcriptional regulation of RPN4 during ER stress? It would be interesting to define the specific dependence of yeast protection against ER stress on these two aspects of RPN4 regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>It would indeed be of interest to understand the relative contribution of the post-transcriptional and transcriptional regulation of Rpn4 to ER stress resistance. However, since it remains to be established how Msn2/4 activate the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter (also see response to the first comment of reviewer #3 below), the only way currently available to block the transcriptional induction of <italic>RPN4</italic> involves deletion of Msn2/4, which will by itself cause stress sensitivity. Hence, this question cannot be addressed cleanly at this point.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] The only aspect of the paper that is wanting is the end, where the authors bash the RPN4 promoter and use analog sensitive PKA and msn2/4â strains to attempt to define the signals that activate RPN4. The approach here is a bit muddled and as such the conclusion is not clear. To bring this home, I would recommend doing a clean necessary/sufficient scan of the TF binding sites in the RPN4 promoter. Start with 1kb upstream of RPN4: there are 6 STREs, 2 PDREs, 1 YRE and 1 HSE (I am happy to send my analysis of where the STREs are, as apparently the authors could not find them). In addition to the PDRE, YRE and HSE mutants the authors have, order a GBlock lacking the STREs and do the RT-qPCR. This will complete the necessity set. For sufficiency, just order 4 Gblocks that have only the 6 STREs, 2PDREs, the YRE or the HSE. Then add Tm and induced ngCPY* and measure RPN4 expression and growth in this set. The PKA/msn2/4 mutants, while clever, don't make the point as clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Direct communication with the reviewer established that there is no canonical STRE in the <italic>RPN4</italic> promoter, so the suggested experiments cannot be done.</p></body></sub-article></article>
