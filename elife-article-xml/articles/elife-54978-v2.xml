Pairing this behavior with the wealth of <italic>Drosophila’s</italic> genetic tools offers the possibility to study motor control at single-neuron resolution, and soon throughout entire circuits. As an entry to these circuits, we provide detailed anatomy of proboscis motor neurons, muscles, and joints. We create a collection of fly strains to individually manipulate every proboscis muscle through control of its motor neurons, the first such collection for an appendage. We generate a model of the action of each proboscis joint, and find that only a small number of motor neurons are needed to produce proboscis reaching. Comprehensive control of each motor element in this numerically simple system paves the way for future study of both reflexive and flexible movements of this appendage.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>motor control</kwd><kwd>neural circuit</kwd><kwd>proboscis</kwd><kwd>directed reach</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd><kwd>motor neuron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Janelia Research Campus</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McKellar</surname><given-names>Claire E</given-names></name><name><surname>Siwanowicz</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name><name><surname>Dickson</surname><given-names>Barry</given-names></name><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Julie H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new collection of fly strains comprehensively targets the motor neurons of the proboscis, allowing separate control of every muscle to determine how this appendage achieves flexible, directed reaching.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>To interact with the world, many organisms rely on an ability to reach an appendage towards a target, yet much remains to be discovered about how neural circuits control this prototypical goal-directed behavior. Here we investigate the fly proboscis (mouthparts), a segmented appendage homologous to a limb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridges and Dobzhansky, 1933</xref>). The proboscis is capable of directed reaching towards a specifically placed food target, using gustatory information from taste receptors on the legs as they move and contact food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dethier, 1976</xref>). Besides feeding, the proboscis also extends during courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sturtevant, 1915</xref>), grooming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szebenyi, 1969</xref>), flight-associated respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lehmann and Heymann, 2005</xref>), and wing expansion after eclosion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Truman, 2002</xref>), suggesting that it is a multifunctional appendage that can be employed flexibly.</p><p>A good starting point for mapping circuits underlying motor control is to identify motor neurons, since they are the outputs upon which higher order circuits must act. In adult flies, most muscles are innervated by only one or a few motor neurons (see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baek and Mann, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O'Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rajashekhar and Singh, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Trimarchi and Schneiderman, 1994</xref>). Identifying many or all of the motor neurons involved in proboscis extension should be feasible with available genetic tools. Groups of neurons can be activated and silenced to determine their behavioral phenotypes using collections of GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>), which reproducibly target different groups of neurons. Previous efforts using GAL4 lines with broader expression patterns, or stochastic techniques to refine GAL4 lines, identified some of the critical motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon and Scott, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>). Here we use the split GAL4 technique, which intersects two expression patterns to genetically target only the cells in common between the two (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Luan et al., 2006</xref>), to provide more precise and reproducible targeting of particular neurons. We create a collection of split GAL4 fly strains to identify and separately target the primary motor neurons for every proboscis muscle.</p><p>To support this collection of genetic reagents, we provide detailed anatomy of the proboscis from a variety of imaging techniques. We show each proboscis muscle in new detail, propose a systematic nomenclature to resolve earlier discrepancies, and use muscle insertion sites to predict function. We predict that 8 of the 16 proboscis muscles should be involved in proboscis positioning (such as reaching), and the other half should be involved in the proboscis’ other main function, pumping food through the pharynx (investigated by others; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tissot et al., 1998</xref>). Here we focus on the predicted positioning muscles and define their roles by genetic activation and silencing of their motor neurons. Altogether, we achieve genetic control over every muscle involved in this form of directed reaching, and provide detailed anatomy of this appendage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anatomy of the proboscis and its joints</title><p>Our first goal was to use updated imaging techniques to display the overall anatomy of the proboscis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Anatomy of the proboscis.</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Thick sagittal sections of fly heads with proboscis in various states of extension.

Food is sucked in through the lip-like labella at the tip, then pumped through the pharynx, traveling through two segments of the proboscis, first the haustellum then the rostrum. Inside the head, food then enters the esophagus, which passes through a foramen in the brain, and carries food towards the gut. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows these structures by confocal imaging of thick sections of fly heads with the proboscis in different degrees of extension.</p><p>In the retracted state, the rostrum rests near the brain inside the head, and the haustellum is folded up against the rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When the rostrum extends, it is protracted ventrally out of the head capsule. The outer cuticle of the rostrum is largely unsclerotized, giving it flexibility to fold like skin; support for several muscles therefore comes from an internal skeleton of rigid cuticular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The haustellum extends and flexes from its joint with the rostrum. These movements were confirmed in live flies by filming proboscis extension in a synchrotron particle accelerator, using x-rays to render flies partly transparent and show the movement of the segments inside the head capsule (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-54978-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Synchrotron x-ray video of proboscis extension.</title><p>Looping video of proboscis extension in a fly tethered with head glued, in a synchrotron x-ray beam, sagittal view, 1/100 speed.

Gluing the head and one proboscis joint shows only the movement of the remaining joint: the rostrum pivots around a point on the anterior head that we designate the rostrum joint (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>, and also visible in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), and the haustellum pivots around a point near the rostrum-haustellum junction (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). We digested soft tissues from the thick slices of fly heads, leaving the rigid external and internal cuticle to visualize the locations of the articulation points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Without implying genetic homology, a useful analogy is that the rostrum and haustellum move somewhat like the human upper arm and lower arm, the first segment swinging away from the body and the second unfolding from the first. (The movements of the rostrum are called protraction vs. retraction, whereas the movements of the haustellum are extension vs. flexion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miller, 1950</xref>]). For this study, we focused on movements in only two dimensions, in the vertical plane - reaching up and down with respect to the body axis.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-54978-video2.mp4"><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Proboscis joint movements in response to sucrose.</title><p>Sagittal view of a tethered fly (anterior: up) reaching the proboscis towards a droplet of sucrose presented to the legs. 1/30 speed.

We had observed that, for a freely moving fly to feed, the proboscis must extend ventrally if the food is on the surface on which the fly is standing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). In contrast, we find that a male courting a female on a flat surface typically extends his proboscis anteriorly towards the female for courtship licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). To quantify reaching in these particular situations, the angles of the head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and haustellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) were measured. Both the head and the rostrum were angled higher (more anteriorly) in the courtship experiments than in feeding, on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–F</xref>). The haustellum was more extended for ventral feeding, and more flexed for anterior courtship licking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The proboscis is thus capable of reaching to ethologically relevant targets in different locations, making use of the head, the rostrum and the haustellum.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The fly proboscis as a model system for directed reaching.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A fly extending the proboscis towards food on the surface of an experimental chamber (sagittal view).

We thus quantified proboscis reaching to food targets placed in different locations with respect to the head of a tethered fly. When the sucrose was placed low or high (more ventral or more anterior, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–J</xref>), the proboscis was indeed capable of low vs. high reaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>), with decent aim (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). Although individual flies could angle joints differentially to different targets (gray lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>), only the haustellum showed a mean difference across target positions (black bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>), suggesting that the haustellum can be independently controlled to aid reaching. Each of the three body parts (rostrum, haustellum and head) is capable of at least some degree of independent movement, since if two of the three parts were glued, the remaining part could still move (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>). Reaching was guided not by a visual target (due to filming under invisible infrared light) but by contact between the waving legs and the sucrose target; the relevant sensory stimuli are therefore: 1) taste, and 2) proprioception about leg position at the time of sucrose contact.</p><media id="video7" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-54978-video7.mp4"><label>Video 7.</label><caption><title>Proboscis reaching to targets in different locations.</title><p>Proboscis and head movements reaching towards a sucrose target in high or low (anterior or ventral) locations.

In the larva, the primary excitatory motor neurons are called Type Ib and Is; the motor neurons here most closely resemble the majority of larval Type Ib neurons in that they innervate only a single muscle, unlike the more promiscuous larval type Is (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Budnik and Ruiz-Canada, 2006</xref>). (We did not seek modulatory motor neurons, analogous to type II and III in larva, which are characterized by small boutons on thin axons projecting to multiple muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Prokop, 2006</xref>], and are known to exist in the adult proboscis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pauls et al., 2018</xref>].) To determine whether this collection was complete, we stained each line with nc82, considered a pan-synaptic marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wagh et al., 2006</xref>). All the boutons on the relevant muscle were indeed completely occupied by the labeled motor neurons (examples in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2, N</xref> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), with two exceptions: muscle 3 is covered by separate lines (mn3M and mn3L) so was not expected to show complete occupancy, and mn10 was never labeled bilaterally in the split GAL4 line we selected (see Methods). All other synaptic sites were occupied, and since the synaptic marker does label primary motor neuron synapses, we conclude that this collection includes every primary motor neuron. The coverage of all a muscle’s synaptic sites by only one or a few motor neurons per hemisphere shows that single motor neurons must branch to many or all of the separate fibers that make up a muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Organization of motor neuron dendrites in the brain</title><p>While the axons of motor neurons innervate muscles, their dendrites are located in the subesophageal zone of the brain.

One (m13) inserts at the junction between the salivary duct and the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and is predicted to open a valve for salivation. The seven others insert on the pharynx wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), either directly or through tendons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). During feeding, furrows (pseudotrachea) on the labella may channel fluid to the opening of the pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Because the seven muscles attached to the pharynx are arrayed along the pharynx in series, we predict that sequential contraction would cause a traveling local dilation of the pharynx wall to move a bolus of fluid through the proboscis (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">Video 13</xref>), acting against the elasticity of the pharynx wall rather than antagonistic muscle counterparts. After food has been pumped through the pharynx to the esophagus, a ring of muscles surrounding the esophagus suggests that peristaltic action takes over (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Three muscles (1, 2D, 2V) could act as rostrum retractors based on their origins on the posterior wall of the head, and insertions near the distal end of the rostrum where they could potentially withdraw the rostrum into the head capsule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M–O</xref>). Activation of the motor neurons for the largest of these, muscle 1, indeed retracted the proboscis into the head further than where it sits at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), by retraction of the rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) but not the haustellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Activating mn1 while the proboscis was extended for feeding triggered both retraction of the rostrum and flexion of the haustellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref>). Whereas activation triggered retraction, silencing mn1 showed the opposite phenotype, impairing the retraction of the proboscis at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref>). Consistent with the effects of muscle 1 on more than one joint in the activation experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>), the impaired retraction in silencing experiments could not be attributed to one specific joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G–H</xref>). In sum, muscle 1 is a retractor, located in the rostrum but with additional effects on the haustellum.</p><media id="video15" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-54978-video15.mp4"><label>Video 15.</label><caption><title>Behavioral roles of rostrum retractor.</title><p>First part: activation of the main rostrum retractor (mn1) with CsChrimson, in frames noted, compared to CsChrimson control, beginning with the proboscis in the extended position during feeding.

They showed distinct roles; mn2V activation caused rostrum retraction from rest, whereas mn2D activation caused retraction from the extended position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,D</xref>). Silencing mn2V caused a small impairment in how retracted the rostrum is at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). Other silencing phenotypes for mn2V and mn2D were not observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–H</xref>), suggesting that they may be at least partly redundant. In sum, muscles 2D and 2V are accessory rostrum retractors. Silencing the retractor muscles, 1, 2D or 2V, did not impair the extension of the rostrum or the haustellum during feeding, thus we conclude that these muscles are not required for proboscis extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I–J</xref>), only for retraction.</p><p>Combining these behavioral results with anatomical results, we propose a model of the action of the rostrum. Imaging the rostrum in different positions shows that its extension correlates with the movement of an apodeme, a large part of cuticle within the rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P–Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video16">Video 16</xref>). Only one point of the apodeme attaches to the external cuticle; this point forms the joint around which the rostrum rotates, seen in <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>. Muscle 9 causes rostrum protraction by anchoring on the head capsule and pulling on the free dorsal arm of the apodeme (via a tendon visible in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), swinging it ventrally out of the head capsule. To counteract this protraction, retraction is controlled by muscles 1, 2D and 2V, whose dorsal ends anchor on the head capsule, and whose ventral ends insert not on the apodeme, but on cuticle near its ventral end, where their contraction can draw the rostrum back into the head (and potentially aid haustellum retraction, discussed below). Their role in rostrum retraction is supported by their decreased length in the retracted state, their decreased distance between sarcomeres (muscle striations) in the retracted state (consistent with contraction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7P–Q</xref>), and by the behavioral results. In sum, for the rostrum, we find evidence that muscle 9 controls protraction, and that three muscles control retraction (1, 2D, 2V).</p><media id="video16" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-54978-video16.mp4"><label>Video 16.</label><caption><title>Mechanism of rostrum movement.</title><p>Head (blue), muscles involved in rostrum movement (green), and apodeme within rostrum (white).

Although it was affected by rostrum muscles described above, the haustellum can also move independently of the rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Video 4</xref>). We determined that the muscle responsible for haustellum extension is the previously uncharacterized muscle 4; activation of mn4 elicited haustellum extension both from the rest position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C,K,L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Video 17</xref>) and from the extended position during feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), resulting in an overall change in proboscis position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). (Raw angles available in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). These activation phenotypes were specific to the haustellum, not affecting the rostrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,D</xref>). Silencing instead of activating mn4 caused a defect specific to haustellum extension during feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video17">Video 17</xref>). Muscle 4 therefore shows both activation and silencing phenotypes for haustellum extension. Since haustellum extension during feeding was virtually abolished by silencing mn4, its muscle may be the only one required for haustellum extension. Although silencing mn9 also abolished haustellum extension, that may be because it also blocks rostrum extension, making haustellum extension more difficult mechanically.</p><media id="video17" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-54978-video17.mp4"><label>Video 17.</label><caption><title>Behavioral roles of haustellum extensor.</title><p>First part: activation of haustellum extensor (mn4) with CsChrimson, in frames noted, compared to CsChrimson control, beginning with the proboscis in the resting (retracted) position.

Before behavioral testing, we stained 139 different combinations of split GAL4 lines to attempt to target mn3 (data not shown). None cleanly targeted motor neurons for all fibers of muscle 3, but its lateral fibers and medial fibers could be separately targeted (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). (Muscles are often made up of multiple fibers; when only a single primary motor neuron controls that muscle, it branches to boutons on each muscle fiber. We describe these lateral and medial fibers of m3 as one muscle since all have adjacent insertions and origins). One split GAL4 line targeted the lateral fibers (mn3L) cleanly, with no other proboscis motor neurons present. No lines cleanly targeted motor neurons for the medial fibers, thus we selected two imperfect lines, each of which targeted one additional proboscis motor neuron type, ‘mn3M&amp;1’ and ‘mn3M&amp;7’. The function of muscle 3M could be inferred if a phenotype were found in both these lines, and not in both of the clean lines for the contaminating cell types (1 or 7).</p><p>Activating mn3 demonstrated that it acts as a haustellum flexor. mn3M&amp;1, mn3M&amp;7 and mn3L all triggered haustellum flexion during feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,M,N</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video18">Video 18</xref>). Although the contaminating cell type mn1 does so as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), the contaminating mn7 does not (Figure 9N), suggesting that muscle 3 is responsible. From the resting proboscis position, all mn3 lines could trigger additional proboscis retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), although that could not be attributed to a specific joint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–C</xref>).

Silencing mn3 lines otherwise did not produce consistent phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F–J</xref>), possibly because mn3L and mn3M were not both targeted together. In sum, by examining three different lines for mn3, we conclude that muscle 3 is a haustellum flexor.</p><p>Combining these behavioral results with anatomical results, we propose a model of the action of the haustellum. Imaging the haustellum in different positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O–P</xref>) shows that its extension correlates with the rotation of a Y-shaped apodeme found within the joint. Of the three arms of the Y, the ventroposterior arm was continuous with the external cuticle of the rostrum, the anterior arm was continuous with the external cuticle of the haustellum, and the dorsal arm was free. We propose that a muscle pulling against the free dorsal arm could rotate the haustellum anteriorly away from the rostrum. Indeed, we found that muscle 4 originates from a rigid part of the rostrum and inserts upon the free dorsal arm of the Y, where its contraction would cause rotation of the apodeme and thus haustellum extension. Behavioral experiments above did show that muscle 4 was a haustellum extensor.</p><p>Another muscle, 2V, inserts upon the anterior arm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O–P</xref>) where it could rotate the apodeme back in the other direction, dorsally. This muscle showed no haustellum phenotype, but its insertion site is suggestive enough to bear further future investigation for a role in haustellum flexion, possibly masked here by muscle redundancy. (Not included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O–P</xref> is muscle 1, because although it had an activation phenotype on the haustellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), this was possibly an indirect effect such as coupling, since there were no silencing effects and the muscle is not located in a position to control haustellum flexion). Instead, another muscle, 3, was ideally located to act as a flexor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O–P</xref>); coming from the anterior rostrum, it crosses the joint with the haustellum so that it could pull on the haustellum to fold it in towards the rostrum. In behavioral experiments (above), muscle 3 indeed triggered haustellum flexion. In sum, we find evidence that muscle 4 controls haustellum extension and that muscle 3 (possibly also 2V) controls flexion. Indeed, based on distances between sarcomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8O–P</xref>), muscle 4 appears more contracted when the haustellum is more extended, and 2V and 3 appear more contracted when the haustellum is more flexed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Muscles that control labellar movements</title><p>The remaining two muscles (6 and 7) of the eight tested for roles in proboscis positioning were both found to insert upon on the lip-like labella (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9A–C</xref>). Muscle 6 shows both activation and silencing phenotypes for labellar extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video19">Video 19</xref>). Muscle 7 shows activation and silencing phenotypes for labellar abduction (the opening of the two lobes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video20">Video 20</xref>). Although mn7 activation also induced labellar extension (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>), that may be a side effect of abduction; muscle 7 showed no effect on labellar extension when silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9H</xref>). The line contaminated with mn7, mn3M&amp;7, showed similar phenotypes to mn7 but at lower penetrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F–I</xref>), likely due to the fact that mn7 was not labeled in all flies of that line (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Future work must also examine the cooperative action of multiple motor neurons, rather than just their effects in isolation.</p><p>Computational brain alignment suggests that motor neuron dendrites are not found in close proximity to several known cell types involved in feeding. Unknown circuit layers between sensory and motor neurons likely aid with functions such as pattern generation or command-like roles. Although certain mechanosensory neurons have been investigated in the proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>), the role of sensory feedback in proboscis reaching remains to be explored; the approach used here could also be applied to the isolation of proprioceptive neurons.</p><p>With this motor neuron collection, we provide a description of the muscles that act at each proboscis joint. It extends previous efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>) by using a stronger neuronal silencer to find silencing phenotypes for more cell types (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>), tissue clearing techniques that show more neurons than were thought to be present in GAL4 lines (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), and split GAL4 lines for more specificity. While the kinematics of proboscis reaching remains to be explored, the comprehensive genetic tools we describe provide the means to do so.</p><p>We discover unexpected complexity of phenotypes from rostrum motor neurons. Both mn9 and mn1 are located near the rostrum, not in a position to control the haustellum directly, yet showed phenotypic effects on the haustellum as well. These may represent examples of biomechanical coupling. We were struck by how common ‘side effects’ like this were – another example is that, although mn7 is responsible for labellar abduction (with both activation and silencing phenotypes), its activation also triggers labellar extension. We speculate that optogenetically forcing the movement of one body part may cause a fly to move another in response, even if the activated motor neuron is not directly involved in the latter at all, or that forced movement about a joint may cause afferent feedback that leads to activation of other motor neurons. Intrinsic biomechanical properties, such as passive joint forces, are also known to provide non-neural (and rapid) aid during motor responses to mechanical perturbations, for example in cockroach, locust and stick insect legs during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ache and Matheson, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jindrich and Full, 2002</xref>).</p><p>These possible side effects of optogenetic activation highlight the utility of combining activation and silencing data to deduce muscle roles, since both methods can have pitfalls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yoshihara and Yoshihara, 2018</xref>). By incorporating activation, silencing, and insertion site data, we derive interpretations of muscle roles (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>) that differ in several respects from those of a previous work based mainly on activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schwarz et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It will be of interest to determine how flexibility is achieved in the recruitment of proboscis muscles. Several muscles were innervated by only a single primary motor neuron, but in the case where two were present, it is possible that they control slow twitch and fast twitch fibers, as found in both the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azevedo et al., 2019</xref>) and in mammalian muscle, to fine-tune the strength of a muscle response. Regardless, the dramatic numerical simplicity of only one or two primary motor neurons per muscle in flies presents an experimental advantage for future circuit studies. Given that the proboscis has a varied repertoire of movements in feeding and courtship (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Manzo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McKellar et al., 2019</xref>), one exciting avenue would be to decipher the circuit logic of how different movements with multiple behavioral functions can arise from these few motor neurons. Activation and inactivation experiments of individual proboscis motor neuron types support a model of separable control, enabling articulated movements that allow flexibility.</p><p>Directed reaching occurs in different forms: humans show sophisticated, learned arm and hand movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Parker, 1974</xref>), yet newborns show a more basic, innate form of intentional reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bower et al., 1970</xref>). In primates, work on the neural coding of goal-directed behavior has often focused on how its features might be encoded by firing properties of single neurons or single brain areas, particularly within the cerebral cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kalaska, 2019</xref>). Forms of reaching exist in smaller animals such as rodents and cephalopods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gutnick et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Peterson, 1934</xref>). We propose that proboscis reaching in flies could present a new model for understanding the neural circuit basis of goal-directed movement. <italic>Drosophila</italic> has rich behavior, a smaller nervous system, and powerful genetic tools. Additionally, a whole-brain synaptic connectome is underway (see flywire.ai, based on the images of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>) that can help map how diverse interneurons may converge upon this small set of motor neurons to produce a repertoire of flexible motor behaviors from a single appendage.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">mouse mAb anti-bruchpilot (nc82)</td><td valign="top">Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank</td><td valign="top">Cat#nc82;

Heads were fixed in this solution overnight at 4°C, then incubated in PBS with 1% triton X-100, 0.5% DMSO and Escin (0.05 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich, E1378) containing Texas Red-X Phalloidin (1:50, Life Technologies #T7471) and a chitin-binding dye Calcofluor White (0.1 mg/ml, Sigma-Aldrich #F3543-1G) at room temperature with agitation for up to 5 days. Long incubation times and the presence of surfactants assured better penetration of phalloidin into the muscles. The samples were then washed in PBS/1% triton (4 × 1 hr) and fixed for 4 hr in 2% paraformaldehyde to reduce leaching of bound phalloidin from muscles during the subsequent ethanol dehydration step. To avoid artefacts caused by osmotic shrinkage of soft tissue, samples were gradually dehydrated in glycerol (2–80%) and then ethanol (20% to 100%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ott, 2008</xref>) and mounted in methyl salicylate (Sigma-Aldrich #M6752) for imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Preparation of head sections for muscle and cuticle imaging</title><p>Heads were prepared as described above, washed, embedded in 7% agarose (SeaKem, Lonza #50002) in PBS and sectioned sagittally on a vibratome (Leica VT1000s) at 0.3 mm.

For this rendering and for computational alignment of brain images used where noted, brain images were registered using the Computational Morphometry Toolkit (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://nitrc.org/projects/cmtk">http://nitrc.org/projects/cmtk</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>), to a standard brain template (‘JFRC2014’) mounted and imaged with the same conditions, which had been corrected by a z scaling factor of 1.568 to match the true proportions of a fly brain (obtained from frontal vs. horizontal stacks of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ito et al., 2014</xref>]).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Occupancy experiments</title><p>Head staining (described above) was used to determine whether the collection included every primary motor neuron of the proboscis. To be sure that every axon terminal was accounted for, we stained each motor neuron line one by one, and inspected every bouton in the 3D stack. All the boutons on the relevant muscle were indeed completely occupied by the labeled motor neurons. The lack of unoccupied boutons suggests that modulatory motor neurons’ boutons in the proboscis may not be labeled by the synaptic marker used here, or may not be visible as separate punctae since modulatory boutons can lie directly on top of primary motor neuron terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rivlin et al., 2004</xref>). Incomplete occupancy of the boutons of muscle 3 was to be expected, since no line could be found to cover all its motor neurons, so separate lines were used that targeted muscle 3’s medial and lateral fibers. For muscle 10, a bilateral motor neuron pair was never observed in 6 stained heads, only a single unilateral neuron that could be found in either hemisphere. Since it did not occupy all boutons on muscle 10, we infer that it is not an unpaired neuron, but stochastic expression in a pair of motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Cameras and lighting</title><p>Behavior was filmed with Basler A622f cameras at 30 Hz, controlled by gVision software developed at Janelia (Gus Lott). Ambient lighting was provided by white light, or by two infrared security spotlights (Phenas) for CsChrimson experiments. For CsChrimson activation, a 656 nm LED spotlight (Mightex PLS-0656–101 C) was controlled through a NIDAQ board and Labview software (National Instruments, Austin, TX). An 880 nm infrared LED (Fairchild Semiconductor Corporation #QEE123) was connected to a fiber optic in the field of view, to indicate when the stimulus was on, since a long-pass 830 nm filter in front of the camera prevented the stimulus light from obscuring the behavior video. Each stimulus was 2 s of constant light at 100 µW/mm<sup>2</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Freely moving behavior</title><p>To compare proboscis extension during feeding vs. courtship, flies were placed in oval chambers, 3 mm high, 9 mm wide and 12 mm long, to provide a flat segment along the wall in which to film proboscis extension from the side. For feeding, wildtype males were starved with access to water for 24 hr, then loaded into chambers with 10% sucrose/2% agarose painted onto a segment of the wall. Proboscis angles were scored in the frame of greatest proboscis extension during one proboscis extension event (event = time from extension to retraction), in events where the fly was orthogonal to the camera, contacting the sucrose on the wall. Courtship was filmed in chambers of the same dimensions but with a virgin female present. Proboscis extension was likewise scored in the frame of maximum extension, in courtship licking events occurring when the male was orthogonal to the camera and directly behind the female on the flat segment of wall.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Tethered fly behavior</title><p>Flies were anesthetized using cold, and mounted by the thorax to a pin with UV-cured glue (LED-200 UV gun, Electro-Lite Corp.). The same glue was used in experiments in which proboscis segments were glued. Mounted flies were allowed to recover for a few minutes before CsChrimson stimulation experiments, or alternatively were deprived of food and water for 5 hr before sucrose presentation experiments.</p><p>For sucrose presentation, a small 100 mM sucrose droplet was presented to the legs from a syringe on a manipulator, holding the target at a distance that prevents proboscis contact. The proboscis is extended repeatedly in search of the sucrose, moving through a range of angles (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). The legs are not in contact with the ground and wave almost continuously, therefore rapidly encounter the sucrose. The proboscis reaching is guided not by vision but by leg contact, since the assay is performed under infrared illumination not visible to the fly. Visually-guided proboscis reaching was never observed in these conditions; the proboscis never extended before the legs tasted the sucrose.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Proboscis, head and target angle measurements</title><p>Joint angles for the head, rostrum and haustellum were measured from individual video frames in ImageJ by marking the points shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>. The rostrum angle is closer to 180° than 0° at rest, so is expressed as subtracted from 180° so that values are smaller at rest than during proboscis extension. When the haustellum is drawn into the head, its angle cannot be directly measured, but can be extrapolated by trigonometry, using the law of cosines with the distance from the rostrum joint to the end of the haustellum, and assuming that the rostrum and haustellum lengths are fixed proportions of the measured size of the head.</p><p>Measures of joint angles were chosen to best suit each assay. Due to the challenge of gluing flies to pins manually, the camera view varied, leading to variability in the measured raw angles of the joints. To overcome this variability, within-fly normalization was performed wherever possible, subtracting food- or CsChrimson-stimulated extension angle from the angle immediately before stimulation. Note that normalization was not possible for resting state angles, since there is no change from baseline. Analysis of raw joint angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>) shows similar relations between motor neurons and joint angles as the normalized data but with greater inter-fly variability, as expected from the range of starting positions, so the main figures use normalized values as follows. Wildtype joint angles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M–O</xref>) were measured in the frame 200 ms after the beginning of proboscis movement elicited by sucrose. For CsChrimson stimulation from rest, angles were measured in the frame of maximal proboscis movement during the stimulus and subtracted from the frame before the stimulus to report change in angle. For CsChrimson stimulation during ongoing feeding, angles were measured in the frame 200 ms after the stimulus start and subtracted from the frame before the stimulus. For TNT silencing, angles were measured at rest (where noted in figures), or during feeding (as the difference in angle from the start of proboscis extension to 200 ms later). During CsChrimson activation from rest, proboscis change is total extension of proboscis (farthest point on back of head to tip of labellum) at maximum movement divided by at rest (frame before stimulus).</p><p>During TNT silencing, proboscis position provides a measure of how retracted the proboscis is at rest, and is measured as the distance from back of head to tip of labellum divided by this value averaged across controls, after first normalizing the size of the fly (using measured height of head). Labellar extension and abduction were quantified as binary values, occurring or not occurring.</p><p>The angle of the sucrose target was measured from a line along the posterior-anterior axis of the fly (drawn from a point on the thorax marked by the humeral bristles, to the center of the eye), in the first frame of leg contact with the sucrose. A target at 90°=directly ventral to the eye.</p><p>Mean reach angle was measured by creating a stack in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/">https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>) of the trial video frames, and generating an average intensity projection, creating a cloud of pixels where the proboscis had moved. In the region where the proboscis tip had moved, the pixel of maximum brightness was taken as the mean location of the tip over the trial. Mean reach angle was calculated from this proboscis tip location, with respect to a line along the posterior-anterior axis of the fly (drawn from the humeral bristles to the center of the eye).</p><p>To determine the accuracy of reaching, aim deviation was calculated as mean reach angle minus target angle, so that a deviation above 0° would represent reaching above the target in the dorsoventral plane, and aim below 0° would be below. Physical constraints may affect aim; flies appear to reach too high to low targets, and too low to high targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>). For proboscis reaching in wildtype flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), occasional flies were excluded if they did not appear hungry after the deprivation period (no proboscis extension to sucrose).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Speed, velocity, length and distance measurements</title><p>Points were manually drawn on video frames in ImageJ to acquire coordinates, which were converted to lengths by basic trigonometry. Frame 1 was taken to be the frame of the first rapid acceleration of the proboscis after sucrose contact. Target location was taken to be site of leg contact with sucrose in most recent frame of contact before proboscis extension. Reach speed = distance proboscis tip traveled per ms (involving both proboscis and/or head motion, in any direction). Proboscis velocity = tip displacement towards target minus head displacement towards target, per ms. Proboscis length = distance from rostrum joint to tip, subtracting mean length at start to set starting length to zero. Proboscis distance from target = distance from tip to target.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical information</title><p>Experiments were blinded for scoring by assigning random identifications and only unblinding after all scoring. T-tests were two-tailed. Kolmogorov–Smirnov tests were first used to confirm that the data were consistent with a normal distribution. Error bars are standard error of the mean (SEM). In jitter plots, horizontal bars represent the mean. Outliers were not excluded. Sample size and other statistical information is provided in each relevant figure legend or Methods section. Asterisks: *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001, N.S.: not significant. All replicates are biological, testing different flies, not retesting the same individuals as technical replicates. Benjamini-Hochberg multiple testing correction used a false discovery rate of 0.1, and was applied across every genotype tested (across all motor neuron testing figures). In comparing mean reach angle to high and low targets, an a priori power analysis was performed in G*Power software using an effect size of 0.7 (estimated from a pilot study), an alpha error probability of 0.05, one tail, and a power of 0.8, giving a required sample size of 28 per group.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>For fly strains, we thank Barret Pfeiffer, Gerry Rubin, and Vivek Jayaraman.

interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ronald Calabrese as the Reviewing Editor, Senior Editor and Reviewer #2.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a co-submission of two papers. The goal of the first work is achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis, and it is accomplished convincingly. The degree of success constructing split Gal4 lines that label only a single bilateral pair of motor neuron corresponding to each muscle of the proboscis is really remarkable, and there is no doubt that these tools will be of tremendous use in defining the neuronal networks responsible for reaching movements of the proboscis and indeed the sucking movements also. The anatomical data presented is beautiful. After achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis, the authors in the second work systematically test every motor neuron that inserts on cuticle (including apodemes) and is thus likely to move the proboscis (rather than inserting on the pharynx and likely involved in sucking) with activation and inactivation experiments. By combining kinematics and some biomechanics, the authors arrive at a functional role for each of the proboscis inserting muscle and their motor neurons. The data presented is comprehensive and convincing. When combined these two papers, very clearly supersede a previous attempt (Schwarz et al., 2017) at such tool development and analysis with several important corrections and many major refinements.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Upon careful review of these two co-submitted papers (henceforth referred to a Paper 1 and Paper 2) it was the clear consensus of the reviewers that neither paper alone is strong enough for <italic>eLife</italic> and we would understand if you chose to take the paper(s) elsewhere. If on the other hand, you chose to submit the two papers to <italic>eLife</italic> as one joint paper, then we would ensure that they were sent to the same reviewers, and we think that there is a high chance of publication with a short turn-around. No new experiments or analyses are needed.</p><p>If you take the <italic>eLife</italic> route the papers should be combined and focused. One paper will be easier for the authors to present and for the reader to comprehend. One could not read the Paper 2 without constantly referring to Paper 1 and the Paper 2 contains much repetition of the findings of Paper 1.</p><p>There are several ways that the papers can be fitted together as detailed in the individual expert reviews.</p><p>One potential path:</p><p>1) The theme presented for Paper 1 of rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors is not effectively exploited nor can it be given the data presented. Likewise, the comparison to human reaching in Paper 2 seems premature and focusing the combined single paper on the tools developed and the wonderful anatomy and first-pass functional analysis seems more fruitful. The data Figure 9 Paper 1 seems premature and underdeveloped for publication as does the data of Figure 8 Paper 2. They are presented is support of the rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors and human reaching themes and are not compelling. We recommend removing these figures to focus the paper.</p><p>2) Efficiency with the figures would help. Figure 1 of Paper 2 could benefit from comparison directly to Figure 1 of Paper 1. Figure 2 of Paper 1 should be supplementary and fits thematically with Paper 2 material. The expert reviews suggest other figure fusions and changes.</p><p>3) The data of Figure 7 Paper 1 is reminiscent of data in Schwarz et al., 2017, albeit with corrections but need not be elaborated and could be perhaps combined with Figure 8 Paper 1, which is somewhat underdeveloped.</p><p>4) Discussions can be shortened and in Paper 2 shifted away from detailed comparison to in Schwarz et al., 2017.</p><p>5) All Essential revisions in the expert reviews should all be addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In two related papers, McKellar and colleagues present the results of a screen to genetically label and optogenetically activate each motor neuron that innervates muscles in the proboscis of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.</p><p>In the first manuscript, entitled &quot;Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis&quot;, they present genetic driver lines for each motor neuron together with careful anatomy of cuticular structures and musculature. Ten proboscis muscles and their associated motor neurons control the position of proboscis parts and are involved in the proboscis extension response (PER), while the remaining eight muscles control the constriction of the pharynx. In the course of this work, the authors identify several new muscles.</p><p>Once the authors develop split-Gal4 genetic labels for each motor neuron, they can drive the expression of CsChrimson to activate, or Tetanus toxin to silence, each motor neuron. They present the results of these experiments in a second paper entitled &quot;Motor neuron control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis reaching&quot;. The main advances of this work are the resulting genetic tools and a more comprehensive knowledge of how particular muscles insert onto cuticular structures to extend or flex proboscis parts about joints. These advances clarify the results of past investigations similar into motor control of the proboscis (in particular, Schwarz, Motor control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> feeding behavior).</p><p>Across both papers, the images of motor neuron and musculature anatomy are illustrative and quite beautiful. Optogenetic activation of individual motor neurons confirms the role each plays in controlling the proboscis segment. Together, these data allow the authors to articulate a model of how motor neuron activation and muscle contraction enables the fly to extend its proboscis.</p><p>Although the tools and data in these papers are detailed and valuable, the papers do not effectively show what new insight has been gained relative to previous studies. There is also a large experimental gap: while the authors create the necessary genetic tools, they do not investigate the neural control and natural dynamics of proboscis movement beyond artificial optogenetic stimulation. In the absence of such data, the main contribution of these papers is the clear and thorough anatomy. However, the convoluted organization of the two manuscripts require the reader to sift through disparate data to reach a clear understanding of how the proboscis motor system is organized. These manuscripts would need to be significantly reorganized and streamlined to be understood by a general neuroscience audience.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not clear to why these manuscripts are separate. The basis for separating them seems to be to avoid one behemoth paper but the division between tools and function obscures the take-home message of the work. For example, many of the descriptions of musculature in &quot;Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis&quot; (called paper 1 below) are critical for understanding the optogenetic activation of motor neurons in &quot;Motor neuron control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis reaching&quot; (called paper 2 below), resulting in an unnecessary duplication of effort between the manuscripts to understand how the proboscis is moved. Take mn9, for example: it is hard to know what to take from Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 9 in paper 1, if the critical proof to show that mn9 extends the proboscis is in paper 2. (Past work has shown m9 to be involved in proboscis protraction, so you could argue that a knowledgeable reader may know this, but that undercuts the purpose of Figure 2 in paper 2). There are also examples of data in primary figures that do not advance the author's case. For example, in paper 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6 and Figure 8 are supplementary figures. Figure 2: The images of FlyLight Gen 1 Gal4 lines are unhelpful, fly researchers can find these and they are not helpful to a non-Drosophilist. Figure 3: I commend the authors for including images of the entire nervous system, not often shown, but again, these are supporting information. Figure 6 can support Figure 5. Figure 8 does suggest that MNs likely do not receive direct information from sensory neurons or other previously described interneurons, but these hypotheses are not tested further, so Figure 8 can support Figure 7.</p><p>By the same token, paper 2 would benefit from schematics of muscles and an overview of reaching related vs. pharyngeal motor neurons. This distinction is helpful, and since it is consistent with past work. Because the function of pharyngeal muscles is not explored further, it would not detract from the message of paper 2. paper 2 contains functional data that can be combined: e.g. protraction (Figure 2) and retraction (Figure 3) of the rostrum could be one figure, together with anatomical data from paper 1. Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 also contain many panels of different metrics, normalized or baseline subtracted. It is not necessary to show all these data in this form, and it detracts from the message. My suggestion would be to combine Figure 2 Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 haustellum and rostrum images. Figure 7 is beautiful! But it should be split up to accompany the data in Figure 2 and Figure 3 and Figure 4 and Figure 5.</p><p>In addition, much of the introductions of both manuscripts are either unnecessary or misleading (see below), so combining the data into a single manuscript will also help to eliminate those problems. In summary, I do not see a clear reason to split data across papers.</p><p>2) The optogenetic activation data that the authors present do not provide insight into how reaching kinematics are produced: 2 second stimulation of motor neurons is not a naturalistic manipulation, and resulting proboscis trajectories are collapsed into single numbers in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4, Figure 5 and Figure 6 of paper 2. Schwarz et al., also concluded that reaching is the result of precise temporal patterns of activation of proboscis motor neurons. The authors have all the tools to explore this further with calcium imaging or electrophysiology, though it is understandably beyond the scope of this paper. I anticipate another paper that begins with the observations in Figure 8 of paper 2 and then uses the tools shown here to explore how these searching movements are created.</p><p>3) A related aspect of reaching is the treatment of what the authors call &quot;coupling&quot; of distinct parts of the proboscis, as when mn9 is activated and extends the haustellum in addition to the rostrum. Is this coupling mechanical, neural, or driven by proprioceptive feedback? The activation of additional motor neurons could be ruled out by silencing haustellum extending mns while activating mn9. The authors do not discuss sensory feedback, or the role of proprioception in determining the location of the target. This would be an interesting direction to pursue to draw closer connections to reaching in other organisms.</p><p>4) The authors state at various times that these genetic tools could help to make neural control of the proboscis a model for (1) rhythmic vs. discrete movements, and (2) a model of reaching in humans. These statements appear in the abstract and introductions of both papers, with little scholarship or links to literature that may prime the reader as to functional features that are similar in both models. The data to support these assertions are that proboscis speed is a bell shaped curve as a function of time and that proboscis reaching pauses to enter a second phase of slow approach. These observations seem rather trivial; what is the alternative? As the authors point out, proboscis reaching is already thought to be more complex than simply a reflex.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Achieving genetic control over motor neurons for every muscle of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis is the laudable goal of this work, and it is accomplished convincingly. Surely there are nits to pick over the failure the achieve split Gal4 lines that label only a single bilateral pair of motor neuron corresponding to each muscle of the proboscis, BUT the degree of success is really remarkable, and there is no doubt that these tools will be of tremendous use in defining the neuronal networks responsible for reaching movements of the proboscis and indeed the sucking movements also. The anatomical data presented is beautiful. When combined with the companion paper (Motor neuron control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis reaching) it is very clear that this work supersedes a previous attempt (Schwarz et al., 2017) at such tool development and analysis with several important corrections and many major refinements</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Upon carefully reviewing this paper (henceforth referred to a Paper 1) and its companion by the exact same authors (Motor neuron control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis reaching – henceforth referred to as Paper 2), I do not recommend that they be published independently. One paper will be easier for the authors to present and for the reader to comprehend. I could not read the Paper 2 without constantly referring to Paper 1 and the Paper 2 contains much repetition of the findings of Paper 1. The theme presented for Paper 1 of rhythmic vs. discrete behaviors is not effectively exploited nor can it be given the data presented so much of the rationale for an independent paper is lost. There are several ways that the papers can be fitted together. Efficiency with the figures would help. Figure 1 of Paper 2 could benefit from comparison directly to Figure 1 of Paper 1. Figure 2 of Paper 1 should be supplementary and fits thematically with Paper 2. The VNC confocal projection of Figure 3 Paper 1 are distracting, convey little information useful to the general reader, and can certainly be supplementary. The data of Figure 7 Paper 1 is reminiscent of data in Schwarz et al., 2017, albeit with corrections but need not be elaborated and could be perhaps combined with Figure 8 Paper 1 which is somewhat underdeveloped. The data Figure 9 Paper 1 seems premature for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work provides tools that target every type of motor neurons in the proboscis, as evidenced by the fact that all muscle types are covered by the domains of neuromuscular junctions. Proximity of motor neuron dendrites to other neurons provide hints as to the interaction of sensory and central circuits with the motor neurons. These tools can now be used for functional studies, an example of which is provided in the accompanying manuscript. I found this to be really nice manuscript that will certainly be very useful for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> neural circuit community, particularly those working on feeding behavior. It really fills a missing dataset, complementing the numerous sensory neuron lines that are available, as well as the increasing number of interneuronal lines that have been used for feeding behavior analysis. My comments are not of the major kind, focusing more on presentation style.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Controlling every muscle for directed reaching of the fly proboscis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The change in angle from rest to feeding appears to be 80 deg (Figure 7I and Figure 7J). Activating mn9 does not further increase the rostrum feeding angle in Figure 7D. One might then attempt to compare angles in Figure 7I and Figure 7D, but the authors are thinking about this differently. Their logic is that activation (Figure7D) happens after the proboscis is extended, so the change should be about 0, whereas the positive 80 deg change during feeding does not occur when mn9 is silenced.</p><p>I suggest that instead of displaying the change in rostrum and haustellum angle during feeding, the authors should plot rostrum and haustellum angle during feeding. The authors should also explain the rationale behind the units in the legend. It is possible that chrimson expression in mn9 actually causes a different feeding angle to begin with, which would be interesting. If the proboscis was more extended, this would suggest an increase in baseline excitation. If it was more flexed and retracted, it could imply compensatory feedback to combat overexcitation.

The basis for separating them seems to be to avoid one behemoth paper but the division between tools and function obscures the take-home message of the work. For example, many of the descriptions of musculature in &quot;Comprehensive genetic tools to target motor neurons for each muscle of the fly proboscis&quot; (called paper 1 below) are critical for understanding the optogenetic activation of motor neurons in &quot;Motor neuron control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis reaching&quot; (called paper 2 below), resulting in an unnecessary duplication of effort between the manuscripts to understand how the proboscis is moved. Take mn9, for example: it is hard to know what to take from Figure 1, Figure 4 and Figure 9 in paper 1, if the critical proof to show that mn9 extends the proboscis is in paper 2. (Past work has shown m9 to be involved in proboscis protraction, so you could argue that a knowledgeable reader may know this, but that undercuts the purpose of Figure 2 in paper 2). There are also examples of data in primary figures that do not advance the author's case. For example, in paper 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 6 and Figure 8 are supplementary figures.</p></disp-quote><p>Now reorganized.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: The images of FlyLight Gen 1 Gal4 lines are unhelpful, fly researchers can find these and they are not helpful to a non-Drosophilist.</p></disp-quote><p>now removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: I commend the authors for including images of the entire nervous system, not often shown, but again, these are supporting information.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6 can support Figure 5.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made room in other ways so that this can remain a main figure, since it is a key theme of the paper that insertion sites predict muscle function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 8 does suggest that MNs likely do not receive direct information from sensory neurons or other previously described interneurons, but these hypotheses are not tested further, so Figure 8 can support Figure 7.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By the same token, paper 2 would benefit from schematics of muscles and an overview of reaching related vs. pharyngeal motor neurons. This distinction is helpful, and since it is consistent with past work. Because the function of pharyngeal muscles is not explored further, it would not detract from the message of paper 2. paper 2 contains functional data that can be combined: e.g. protraction (Figure 2) and retraction (Figure 3) of the rostrum could be one figure,</p></disp-quote><p>now combined</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>together with anatomical data from paper 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Done.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4 and Figure 5 also contain many panels of different metrics, normalized or baseline subtracted.

The authors have all the tools to explore this further with calcium imaging or electrophysiology, though it is understandably beyond the scope of this paper.

Is this coupling mechanical, neural, or driven by proprioceptive feedback? The activation of additional motor neurons could be ruled out by silencing haustellum extending mns while activating mn9. The authors do not discuss sensory feedback, or the role of proprioception in determining the location of the target. This would be an interesting direction to pursue to draw closer connections to reaching in other organisms.</p><p>4) The authors state at various times that these genetic tools could help to make neural control of the proboscis a model for (1) rhythmic vs. discrete movements, and (2) a model of reaching in humans. These statements appear in the abstract and introductions of both papers, with little scholarship or links to literature that may prime the reader as to functional features that are similar in both models. The data to support these assertions are that proboscis speed is a bell shaped curve as a function of time and that proboscis reaching pauses to enter a second phase of slow approach. These observations seem rather trivial; what is the alternative?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure now removed, as per editor’s suggestion, and topics now moved to Discussion as future areas of research.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As the authors point out, proboscis reaching is already thought to be more complex than simply a reflex.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Upon carefully reviewing this paper (henceforth referred to a Paper 1) and its companion by the exact same authors (Motor neuron control of <italic>Drosophila</italic> proboscis reaching – henceforth referred to as Paper 2), I do not recommend that they be published independently.
