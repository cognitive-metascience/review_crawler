Although pathways controlling the establishment, maintenance and removal of DNA methylation are known, relatively little is understood about how DNA methylation influences gene expression. Here we identified a METHYL-CpG-BINDING DOMAIN 7 (MBD7) complex in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> that suppresses the transcriptional silencing of two <italic>LUCIFERASE</italic> (<italic>LUC)</italic> reporters via a mechanism that is largely downstream of DNA methylation. Although mutations in components of the MBD7 complex resulted in modest increases in DNA methylation concomitant with decreased <italic>LUC</italic> expression, we found that these hyper-methylation and gene expression phenotypes can be genetically uncoupled. This finding, along with genome-wide profiling experiments showing minimal changes in DNA methylation upon disruption of the MBD7 complex, places the MBD7 complex amongst a small number of factors acting downstream of DNA methylation. This complex, however, is unique as it functions to suppress, rather than enforce, DNA methylation-mediated gene silencing.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19893.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19893.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>α-crystallin domain (ACD)</kwd><kwd>HSP20</kwd><kwd>Methyl-CpG-Binding Domain (MBD)</kwd><kwd>DNA methylation</kwd><kwd>RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM)</kwd><kwd>transcriptional gene silencing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Dongming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Glenn Center for Aging Research at the Salk Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palanca</surname><given-names>Ana Marie S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007028</institution-id><institution>Leona M. and Harry B.

modification that is associated with gene silencing and plays critical roles in imprinting, transposon repression, and diverse developmental processes in eukaryotic organisms. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, methylated regions of the genome can be separated into two main categories: (1) transposons and repeats that are heavily methylated at cytosines in all sequence contexts (namely CG, CHG and CHH where H indicates A, T or C), leading to gene silencing, and (2) body-methylated genes that harbor methylation exclusively in the CG context but remain highly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lister et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cokus et al., 2008</xref>). These global patterns of cytosine methylation reflect a balance between pathways controlling de novo methylation, maintenance methylation and demethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Law et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>).</p><p>De novo methylation of cytosines in all sequence contexts requires the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Law et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>), which utilizes both 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (24-nt siRNAs) and long non-coding RNAs to target the de novo methyltransferase, DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2), to repetitive regions of the genome. Production of both 24-nt siRNAs and non-coding RNAs requires specialized RNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haag and Pikaard, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Pol IV transcripts were recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2015a</xref>) and these short non-coding RNAs are processed into 24-nt siRNAs in a one precursor, one siRNA fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhai et al., 2015</xref>) and then loaded into the ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) clade of effector proteins. Pol V also generates non-coding RNAs at RdDM targets and these RNAs serve as a scaffold for the recruitment of many downstream RdDM factors, including siRNA-loaded AGO4 effector complexes and DRM2, ultimately leading to the deposition of DNA methylation and the establishment of gene silencing.</p><p>After the initial establishment of DNA methylation, several maintenance DNA methylation pathways are in place to ensure the faithful inheritance of DNA methylation patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Law et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Matzke and Mosher, 2014</xref>). Briefly, maintenance of CG methylation requires DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1), whereas maintenance of CHG methylation (and some CHH methylation) relies on the activity of two related DNA methyltransferases, CHROMOMETHYLASE 2 and 3 (CMT2 and CMT3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stroud et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zemach et al., 2013</xref>). Finally, the remaining CHH methylation is maintained by DRM2 via the continuous action of the RdDM pathway.</p><p>Acting in opposition to the DNA methylation machinery are several DNA glycosylases, REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1) and three paralogs: DEMETER (DME), DEMETER-LIKE 2 (DML2), and DEMETER-LIKE 3 (DML3). These glycosylases specifically remove methyl-cytosine bases, resulting in a net loss of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu, 2009</xref>). While DME plays an essential role during plant reproduction, ROS1, DML2, and DML3 act in a semi-redundant manner to remove DNA methylation in vegetative tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lister et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penterman et al., 2007</xref>). These proteins tend to remove DNA methylation in regions that flank genes, and in <italic>ros1 dml2 dml3</italic> (<italic>rdd</italic>) triple mutants a subset of these genes are silenced, leading to a model in which ROS1, DML2 and DML3 function to remove DNA methylation and prevent transcriptional gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lister et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penterman et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to interpret the patterns of DNA methylation, there are two large families of methyl-DNA binding proteins in plants, both of which are conserved in mammals: the SET AND RING ASSOCIATED (SRA) domain family, and the METHYL-CpG-BINDING domain (MBD) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Defossez and Stancheva, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fournier et al., 2012</xref>). While specific roles for several SRA domain proteins in the establishment and/or maintenance of DNA methylation in plants and mammals have been determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Woo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bostick et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sharif et al., 2007</xref>), roles for plant MBDs remain largely unknown. In mammals, MBD proteins function as part of large protein complexes associated with histone deacetylase and methyltransferase activities important for the establishment of repressive chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jones et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fuks et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 1999</xref>). In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, there are 13 proteins that contain MBD domains (MBD1-13) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grafi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zemach and Grafi, 2007</xref>). Of these MBD proteins, early studies demonstrated that MBD5, MBD6 and MBD7 bind methylated DNA in vitro and localize to highly methylated, peri-centromeric regions of the genome in vivo, suggesting roles for these factors in gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zemach and Grafi, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Scebba et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ito et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zemach et al., 2005</xref>). A better understanding of how the MBD proteins bridge the gap between DNA methylation and gene regulation, however, is just beginning to emerge. For example, MBD6 and MBD10 play roles in nucleolar dominance and rDNA silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Preuss et al., 2008</xref>), whereas MBD7 has been implicated in DNA demethylation based on genetic connections with the DNA demethylase, ROS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Compared to the wealth of mechanistic detail regarding the proteins and pathways required to establish, maintain and even remove DNA methylation, relatively little is known about the events occurring downstream of DNA methylation.

In addition, mutations in <italic>ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN 5</italic> and <italic>6</italic> (<italic>atxr5</italic> and <italic>atxr6</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jacob et al., 2009</xref>) were also found to release gene silencing without significantly altering the pattern of DNA methylation. These findings suggest that there are factors that function downstream (or independently) of DNA methylation to facilitate gene silencing though unknown mechanisms. On the other hand, only one factor, SU(VAR)3–9 HOMOLOG 1 (SUVH1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>), has been identified to act downstream of DNA methylation to enable the transcription of methylated loci.</p><p>In the present study, we demonstrate a role for MBD7 and its associated proteins (LOW IN LUCIFERASE EXPRESSION (LIL) and REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 5 (ROS5), two Alpha Crystallin Domain (ACD) proteins, as well as REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 4 (ROS4)), in the suppression of gene silencing at methylated luciferase (<italic>LUC</italic>) reporter transgenes. In addition, we show that MBD5 co-purifies with a distinct set of ACD proteins but, unlike MBD7, is not required for <italic>LUC</italic> expression, suggesting different roles for the MBD5 and MBD7 complexes. To gain mechanistic insights into the role of the MBD7 complex in regulating gene expression, the DNA methylation and <italic>LUC</italic> expression levels at the reporter transgenes were determined in <italic>mbd7</italic>, <italic>lil, ros4</italic> and <italic>ros5</italic> mutants. These analyses revealed that members of the MBD7 complex function to promote luciferase expression without significantly altering DNA methylation levels. Furthermore, genome-wide characterization of DNA methylation patterns in <italic>mbd7, lil</italic>, and <italic>rdd</italic> mutants revealed little to no overlapping changes in DNA methylation. Together, these findings support a role for the MBD7 complex in the suppression of gene silencing that is primarily downstream of DNA methylation. While several proteins have been identified that reinforce gene silencing downstream of DNA methylation, the MBD7 complex is unique in its ability to overcome the silencing effects of DNA methylation, enabling the expression of several transgenes despite high levels of promoter methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of two luciferase (<italic>LUC</italic>)-based transcriptional gene silencing reporters</title><p>To identify genes that suppress transcriptional gene silencing in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, forward genetic screens were conducted using two <italic>LUC</italic>-based reporters, <italic>LUCH</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Won et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>YJ</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>), that were introduced into the <italic>rdr6-11</italic> mutant background to prevent post-transcriptional silencing.

In addition to their copy number, these transgenes also differ in their integration sites, which may further contribute to their DNA methylation and expression profiles. Despite these differences, both reporters share a common feature that distinguishes them from most endogenous methylated loci: they contain genes that harbor high levels of promoter methylation but are not fully silenced. This feature makes these reporters well suited to screen for proteins that suppress gene silencing at methylated loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>LIL</italic> suppresses silencing at two <italic>LUC</italic> reporters</title><p>To identify factors that suppress gene silencing at the <italic>LUC</italic> reporters, two independent genetic screens using either the <italic>YJ</italic> or the <italic>LUCH</italic> reporter line, were performed.

Quantification of DNA methylation at this region was assessed either in its entirety (923–1318), to best evaluate the change in methylation at the <italic>LUCH</italic> reporter, or in a more limited region (923–1004) that encompasses most of the methylation observed in the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter.

These findings demonstrate that the two methods of bisulfite sequencing gave similar results. However, unlike the MethylC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>), the traditional bisulfite sequencing definitively shows that the changes in DNA methylation observed in the <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> mutants occur at the <italic>35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>LUC</italic> expression. Furthermore, the traditional bisulfite sequencing offers the added benefit of determining whether the average percent methylation across the <italic>35S</italic> promoter represents a uniform distribution of methylation or a bimodal distribution (i.e., some promoters showing high methylation levels and others showing low methylation levels). These analyses revealed a uniform distribution of methylation at the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Specifically, the MethylC-seq method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Urich et al., 2015</xref>) was employed to determine the methylation profiles of paired sets of mutant and control lines at an average of ~30x coverage with ≥97% conversion rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1E and 1F</xref>). Altogether, methylation was profiled in two alleles of <italic>LIL</italic> (<italic>lil-1</italic> and <italic>lil-2</italic> in the <italic>YJ</italic> and <italic>LUCH</italic> backgrounds, respectively), two alleles of <italic>MBD7</italic> (<italic>mbd7-3</italic> and <italic>mbd7-4</italic>, both in the <italic>YJ</italic> background), and the triple DNA demethylase mutant (<italic>rdd</italic> introgressed into the Col background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Penterman et al., 2007</xref>)). In addition, three biological replicates of <italic>lil-1</italic> (<italic>lil-1</italic>_r1, <italic>lil-1</italic>_r2, and <italic>lil-1</italic>_r5), each with their own controls, were profiled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1E</xref>). Using this MethylC-seq data, differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were called using methods very similar to those described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stroud et al. (2013)</xref>. In both DMR calling pipelines, an initial set of DMRs were called using the same requirements: an absolute change in methylation of ≥40% for CG, ≥20% for CHG, and ≥10% for CHH with an FDR &lt; 0.01 between the mutant and control samples across 100 bp, non-overlapping regions of the genome. However, the two methods used analogous, though not identical, approaches to account for natural variation in DNA methylation, which is known to occur even amongst siblings of the same ecotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Becker et al., 2011</xref>). While <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stroud et al. (2013)</xref> sequenced three biological replicates of a wild-type sample and only included DMRs observed between a given mutant and all three wild-type controls, we instead included a control sample for each biological replicate and/or each mutant allele and then only included DMRs conserved between these replicates. Although thousands of DMRs were identified in each of the <italic>lil-1</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> datasets, mostly in the CG and CHH contexts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2A</xref>), the vast majority of these DMRs were not in common between the different alleles or even between biological replicates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2B-F</xref>, see orange highlighted comparisons). Indeed, when the DMRs from the three <italic>lil-1</italic> replicates were compared with the DMRs identified in <italic>lil-2</italic>, <italic>mbd7-3</italic> and <italic>mbd7-4</italic>, only 33 hyper and one hypo DMRs remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2F</xref>; 6-way DMR overlaps, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2G-J</xref>), and these regions converged on 20 loci (19 displayed hyper-methylation and one showed hypo-methylation [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>]).

DMRs that behaved similarly in all samples were then identified via a clustering analysis and filtered to remove body-methylated genes, which as a group are known to display a higher degree of natural variation in DNA methylation levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schmitz et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2Q-U</xref>; Relaxed_DMR_lists and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).

This demonstrates that both methodologies are converging on a similar, small set of genomic loci that are hyper-methylated in both <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> mutants. When changes in methylation regardless of the sequence context were combined, these DMRs converged on 323 genomic regions that are distributed across the five chromosome arms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 2V and 2W</xref>; hyper_mC_merged).

These findings, along with genome-wide analyses showing that only a small number of loci displayed a consistent hyper-methylation phenotype in <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> mutants, support an alternative hypothesis regarding the role of the MBD7 complex. Rather than functioning as part of the DNA demethylation pathway, as has been previously hypothesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), our results suggest that the MBD7 complex may function in a manner largely downstream of DNA methylation. As very few proteins have been characterized that function downstream of DNA methylation, further characterization of this complex offers the potential to gain much needed insight into the mechanisms by which DNA methylation affects gene expression. Below, we summarize the current knowledge regarding the function and composition of MBD complexes from this and several previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qian et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>).

Recently, additional anti-silencing factors have been identified through genetic screens and biochemical approaches revealing unanticipated connections between proteins that bind methylated DNA (MBD7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>] and ROS4/IDM1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>]) and proteins with alpha crystallin domains (ACDs) (LIL/IDL1/IDM3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>] and ROS5/IDM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qian et al., 2014</xref>]) in regulating the expression of methylated genes. As part of these screening efforts, the methylation status of one endogenous locus (<italic>At1g26400</italic>) and four reporter transgenes have been characterized. In all these cases, similar changes in DNA methylation and gene expression were observed in mutants of the demethylation machinery (either <italic>ros1</italic> single, or <italic>rdd</italic> triple mutants) or the MBD7 complex (<italic>mbd7</italic>, <italic>lil</italic>, <italic>ros4</italic>, and <italic>ros5</italic> mutants). Given this consistent genetic connection, previous studies have concluded that the various MBD and ACD proteins function in a common demethylation pathway with ROS1 to prevent hyper-methylation and enable gene expression, despite the fact that only modest increases in DNA methylation were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qian et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Here we show that the observed hyper-methylation and gene expression defects can be genetically uncoupled at the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter since <italic>LUC</italic> expression levels remain high in <italic>ago4</italic> and <italic>nrpe1</italic> mutants despite hyper-methylation patterns that are identical to those observed in <italic>mbd7</italic>, <italic>lil</italic>, or <italic>rdd</italic> mutant backgrounds. Furthermore, we show that on a genome-wide scale, the genetic connections between MBD7, LIL, and the demethylase machinery are no longer observed. Not only are there very few loci that show a consistent hyper-methylation phenotype across the various <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> datasets, but these loci represent a tiny fraction of the hyper-methylated loci in <italic>rdd</italic> mutants. Thus, while we cannot fully rule out a role for the MBD7 complex as a highly locus-specific regulator of the DNA demethylation pathway, nor do we know the extent to which other MBD-ACD complexes might function redundantly with the MBD7 complex and mask its role at endogenous targets and/or connections with the demethylase machinery, we currently favor a model based on our extensive transgene analysis in which the MBD7 complex functions largely downstream of DNA methylation to promote gene expression through a yet unknown mechanism.</p><p>Further support for the notion that the primary function of the MBD7 complex is downstream of DNA methylation comes from a comparison of the reporter transgenes used to identify components of this complex. While all these reporters contained <italic>35S</italic> promoters driving the expression of genes that are repressed in mutants of the MBD7 complex, no commonalities in the hyper-methylated regions were identified. For the <italic>YJ</italic> and <italic>LUCH</italic> reporters, hyper-methylation is restricted to the 3’ end of the <italic>d35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>LUC</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). Interestingly, this hyper-methylation corresponds to two TGACG motifs previously shown be bound by a tobacco protein in a methylation sensitive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kanazawa et al., 2007</xref>). However, this same region does not appear to be hyper-methylated in the <italic>d35S</italic> promoters present in the <italic>SUC2</italic> or <italic>NPTII</italic> reporters. At the <italic>SUC</italic> reporter the hyper-methylation is instead observed at the 5’ end of the <italic>35S</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>) and the hyper-methylation at the <italic>NPTII</italic> reporter is downstream of the <italic>NPTII</italic> gene, in the <italic>NOS</italic> terminator region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, as there is no clear consensus region that is hyper-methylated amongst these reporters, we posit that the hyper-methylation patterns may represent indirect effects caused by disruption of the MBD7 complex rather than locus specific regulation of DNA methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Composition of MBD and ACD/HSP20-like complexes</title><p>In the present study, MBD5 and MBD7 were found to associate with distinct sets of alpha crystallin domain (ACD)-containing proteins. Furthermore, MBD7 and its associated proteins, but not MBD5, were found to suppress the silencing of methylated luciferase (<italic>LUC</italic>) reporter transgenes, suggesting different roles for the MBD5 and MBD7 complexes. In addition to these purifications, each component of the MBD7 complex (MBD7, ROS4/IDM1, LIL/IDL1/IDM3, and ROS5/IDM2) has now been individually affinity purified and the co-purifying factors and their approximate relative abundances have been determined using Mass Spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> and refs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>]). With the exception of our 3xHA tagged MBD7 purification, all these Mass Spectrometry experiments yielded peptides corresponding to all four factors. However, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al. (2015)</xref> the purification of MBD7 yielded the most peptides matching LIL/IDM3, with relatively fewer hits to IDM1 and ROS5/IDM2, suggesting there may be a stable sub-complex of MBD7 and LIL/IDM3 in addition to the larger MBD7 complex. Taken together, these data demonstrate the existence of multiple MBD complexes, expanding the number of known MBD-ACD complexes, and revealing a functional difference between MBD5 and MBD7 complexes.</p><p>As a complement to the affinity purifications, many of the pair-wise interactions between the various MBD and ACD proteins have been determined using Y2H assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qian et al., 2014</xref>). In several cases, subdomains important for these interactions have been mapped, revealing additional insights into the organization of these protein complexes. For example, the two ACD domain-containing proteins (LIL/IDL1/IDM3, and ROS5/IDM2) interact directly with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>), with MBD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and with ROS4/IDM1(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qian et al., 2014</xref>), whereas MBD7 and ROS4/IDM1 fail to show a direct interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). This suggests the ACD-domain proteins may function to bridge the association between MBD7 and ROS4/IDM1. Furthermore, the interaction domains between ROS4/IDM1 and either LIL/IDL1/IDM3 or ROS5/IDM2 map to different regions of the ROS4/IDM1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>) suggesting that both these ACD domain proteins could interact with ROS4/IDM1 at the same time. Similarly, Lang et al. and this study show that two adjacent regions in MBD7 are each sufficient to interact with LIL/IDL1/IDM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, one can envision scenarios in which the two ACDs could compete for binding to the interaction domains in ROS4/IDM1 or MBD7, or cooperatively bind given their affinities for each other. Beyond these pair-wise interactions, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al. (2014)</xref> demonstrated that ROS5/IDM2 forms higher-order structures that migrate at ~670 kDa after gel filtration, consistent with a 16-mer complex. This finding demonstrates that at least ROS5/IDM2, and possibly other ACD proteins, have the ability to oligomerize in a manner similar to canonical HSP20 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Scharf et al., 2001</xref>). Although it remains unclear which interactions and structural features are required for the function of the MBD7 complex, the fact that loss of any component abolishes activity suggests a close tie between structure and function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of gene expression downstream of DNA methylation</title><p>While our understanding of the mechanisms through which gene expression is regulated downstream of DNA methylation remains quite limited, several factors have been shown to release gene silencing while having minimal effects on DNA methylation.

Finally, it will also be important to assess the relative contributions of the enzymatic and structural features associated with these complexes in modulating the local chromatin environment.

Homer ‘TagDirectory’ files cataloging the DNA methylation levels in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts for each MethylC-seq experiment were generated using the wiggle files generated during the MethylC-seq mapping process (see <bold>Genome-wide MethylC-seq mapping and quantification of DNA methylation levels</bold>) at a precision level of three decimals (-precision 3). The methylation level over each DMR was then calculated using the annotatePeaks.pl script with the following options (none -ratio -noadj -size given -nogene -len 1 –ghist). Heatmaps were generated using Cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Hoon et al., 2004</xref>) with the following options (-m a -g 4 -e 0) and were visualized in Java Treeview.

Several papers have recently been published on the function of MBD7 and interacting proteins (Lang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Want et al., 2015). These papers concluded that MBD7 functions at ROS1 targets to promote DNA demethylation. This is despite the fact that the overlap between <italic>ros1 dml2 dml3</italic> hypermethylated regions and <italic>mbd7</italic> hypermethylated regions is actually quite low. The data presented here are similar, but have the benefit of extensive replication. A very different conclusion is reached – that MBD7 does not promote DNA demethylation. Although this paper does not determine how the MBD7 complex is affecting transgene expression, this is an important contribution to understanding the function (or excluding potential functions) of α-crystallin domain and MBD7 proteins.</p><p>Specific comments to address:</p><p>For the LUCH and YJ methylation profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, how were reads mapped to the nearly identical d35S sequences upstream of LUC and NPTII? How were 24nt sRNAs uniquely mapped? It is essential to know whether or not the LUC gene has promoter methylation, as the system is described as one where genes have high promoter methylation but are expressed. (This may be in the legend but it was cut-off.) This also applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It seems that this is eventually addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for YJ, but providing additional clarity in the main text is recommended. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> please also show the methylation profiles using uniquely-mapping reads only. It remains unclear whether LUCH has a hypermethylated promoter.</p><p>In the subsection “Genetic uncoupling of the hyper-methylation and LUC expression phenotypes at the YJ reporter” the authors conclude that hypermethylation of the 3' end of the d35S promoter is not sufficient to cause LUC gene silencing. This is because <italic>nrpe1</italic> and <italic>ago4</italic> mutants are also hypermethylated, yet LUC expression is higher. <italic>nrpe1</italic> and <italic>ago4</italic> mutants only have higher methylation in the CG context, and have lower CHH methylation than the other genotypes. The counter-argument is that CHH methylation alone is sufficient to cause LUC gene silencing. The authors should modify this conclusion to be more inclusive of the data presented.</p><p>The arguments about a LIL transgene not complementing the identified methylation differences (subsection “Genome-wide profiling shows that MBD7 and LIL have minimal effects on DNA methylation”, third paragraph) are not fully convincing because the LIL transgene does not appear to fully complement the LUC expression phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A/B</xref>).</p><p>Why do the authors conclude that the MBD7 complex functions downstream of DNA methylation (subsection “Genome-wide profiling shows that MBD7 and LIL have minimal effects on DNA methylation”, last paragraph and others)? Functioning entirely independent of methylation seems as likely. Independence is occasionally mentioned, but seem to be used interchangeably with downstream in the text, when biologically these would seem to mean two very different things. Just because the YJ and LUCH transgenes are methylated does not mean that the complex exclusively regulates expression of methylated regions of the genome. There may be some other feature about these transgenes that causes the complex to act on them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The study presented here reports a forward genetic screen for anti-silencing factors identifying LIL, an Arabidopsis gene also known as IDM3/IDL1. Through Y2H and Co-IP experiments, the authors recover the different interacting partners of LIL, highlighting a putative complex containing MBD7, ROS4/IDM1 and ROS5/IDM2. This particular complex is thought to participate in the recruitment of the ROS1 protein to DNA so it can excise methylated cytosine thereby promoting transcription (Lang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015). The present work suggests that the MBD7-LIL complex promotes transgene transcription independently of any variation of DNA methylation, contrasting with previous studies. For this, the authors thoroughly examine the hyper-methylation phenotype of the mutants and conclude that it is inconsequential for the transgene silencing and barely significant genome-wide when comparing between replicates and controls. While this study brings compelling evidence for a new mechanism of the MBD7-LIL complex in transgene regulation, I would suggest the two following points be addressed before considering publications:</p><p>1) Since the most important conclusion for this paper comes from two independent transgenes, it would be important to demonstrate the binding of MBD7 to the methylated promoters of at least one of these reporter genes. Since the authors already have introduced tagged versions of MBD7 in their YJ reporter line, a ChIP-qPCR could easily confirm a direct role for the complex in promoting transgene expression.</p><p>2) A genome-wide ChIP experiment has revealed thousands of binding sites for MBD7 in transposable elements and genes (Lang et al., 2015). Yet in the present study, RNAseq experiment fails to identify any target in <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> mutants. To prove the biological relevance of their proposed methylation-independent promotion of transcription, it would be interesting to investigate changes in expression further. Since the genes involved in the MBD7 complex appear to have high expression in seed (according to eFP browser and genevestigator), targeted expression survey (based on loci identified in previous studies) could be conducted rapidly in these tissues for at least one mutant background. It would also be essential to show that the changes in expression are independent of DNA methylation changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Recent publications indicate that the MBD7 and IDM3 enhance transcription through demethylation. This manuscript present contradictory data that suggest these components instead activate transcription from methylated targets without altering methylation. While this alternative viewpoint is important to consider and the MethylC-seq analysis is very compelling, I am not convinced that the authors have ruled out alternative explanations. In particular, issues of redundancy between MBD-ACD complexes is not addressed, nor is there evidence for transcriptional activation of endogenous loci in the absence of MBD7-IDM3. As is often the case when attempting to argue against published conclusions, the data are extensive and complex, and might not be appropriate for a general scientific publication.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Because the MBD7d3 construct does contain a tiny overlap with the StkC domain, it remains possible that this bit of StkC is mediating interaction with IDM3. Since the MBD7-IDM3 interaction was previously mapped to the StkC domain with Y2H, the authors should include that construct in their analysis to directly compare interaction affinities.</p><p>Although MethylC-seq and Bisulfite/sanger sequencing indicate that there is little to no change in methylation of the YJ transgene, it remains possible that the subtle change in methylation of one small region is responsible for the observed change in transcription. Unfortunately, the <italic>nrpe1</italic> and <italic>ago4</italic> mutants do not completely rule out this possibility due to the possible &quot;compensatory effects&quot; that the authors acknowledge (subsection “Genetic uncoupling of the hyper-methylation and LUC expression phenotypes at the YJ reporter”, last paragraph).</p><p>Is there the possibility that loss of the MBD7 complex causes misregulation of methylation such to increase variation in methylation across the genome? This could account for the large number of DMRs identified in each dataset that were not conserved between replicates. With so many control samples, it should be possible to determine the variation in the controls and compare it with the variation in the mutants to detect any possible increase in variation.</p><p>If the MBD7 complex functions as the authors suggest – countering DNA methylation to allow transcription, then why aren't genes differentially expressed in the <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> backgrounds (subsection “Genome-wide profiling shows that MBD7 and LIL have minimal effects on DNA methylation”, third paragraph)? I'm afraid that this might be a fatal flaw – the assertion that MBD7 regulates transcription without changing methylation is based on a lack of changes in DNA methylation, but there is a similar lack of change in gene expression.</p><p>The authors offer no evidence that MBD-ACD don't function redundantly at most genomic loci, making it difficult to agree with the authors' key conclusion at the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “The MBD7 complex and the DNA demethylation machinery”.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19893.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>Below are the points that should be addressed upon revision.

A ChIP-qPCR experiment would confirm that.</italic> </p><p>To address this question we carried out numerous ChIP-qPCR and ChIP-seq experiments using different transgenic lines expressing tagged versions of MBD7 or LIL under the control of their endogenous promoters (e.g. pMBD7::MBD7-3xHA, pMBD7::MBD7-3xFlag, and pLIL::9xMyc-LIL). Despite extensive optimization of different experimental conditions (in vivo vs. in vitro crosslinking, Formaldehyde (FD) vs. ethylene glycol bis succinimidyl sussinate (EGS) +FD crosslinking, tissue quantities up to ~5 g, and several published ChIP protocols), no enrichment was observed either at the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter or at other genomic loci. However, using a previously published, GFP tagged MBD7 construct driven by a 35S promoter, we were able to observe modest, but consistent and reproducible enrichment of MBD7 at the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter, specifically at the methylated <italic>d35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>LUC</italic> expression. We have now added this data as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and have added the following text to the Results section:</p><p>“As these findings reveal a correlation between the presence of a functional MBD7 complex and the DNA methylation status of the YJ reporter, several chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments were conducted to determine whether the MBD7 complex associates with this reporter. […] Taken together, these methylation and ChIP analyses are consistent with the hyper-methylation phenotype observed in the methyl-cutting assays and suggest a direct role for the MBD7 complex in regulating expression at the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter.”</p><p><italic>2) It is suggested that you choose candidate genes that came up positive in ChIP in previous studies and assay for a mutant effect on expression in seed, where the MBD7 complex is highly expressed, and show that the effect is independent of methylation. However, given the complexity of seed tissue, we recognize that this kind of experiment might be challenging to interpret.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for this very nice suggestion, however as detailed below, we were not able to identify any target genes with altered gene expression in seeds.</p><p>As suggested, we collected a list of 23 candidate genes that were either shown to be mis-expressed or to be bound by MBD7 in previous publications. After testing each primer set on gDNA, RNA was extracted from dry seeds to make cDNA. Of the 23 candidate genes only 8 were expressed in dry seeds and none showed altered expression in <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> mutants.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19893.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of putative MBD7 targets in dry seeds.</title><p>Quantification of transcript levels by RT-qPCR using pooled dry seeds.

We agree that it is important to know how multi-mapping reads are treated, and indeed had included statements addressing this point at the ends of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> legends, but the legend for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> was cut off calling this issue to our attention. The following statement is now present in both legends “Note that two <italic>d35S</italic> promoters driving <italic>LUC</italic> and <italic>NPTII</italic> are 94% identical in sequence, thus the DNA methylation data includes both multi-mapping and unique reads”.</p><p>We have also made this point more clear in the Methods, under the “MethylC-seq analysis at the <italic>YJ</italic> and <italic>LUCH</italic> transgenes” section, by including the following sentence: “Since the <italic>d35S</italic> promoters driving the expression of the <italic>LUC</italic> and <italic>NPTII</italic> genes are 94% identical, both unique and multi-mapping reads were included, with the maximum number of equal best hits set to 2 (-w 2).”</p><p>In addition, as suggested by reviewer 1, we have also included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> the DNA methylation and 24nt siRNA profiles allowing only uniquely mapped reads. Along with this new data, we have added the necessary information to the Methods section and to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">2</xref>.</p><p>Finally, as also suggested by reviewer 1, we further altered the main text in two places to further clarify issues posed by the 94% identical <italic>d35S</italic> promoters. First, in the section describing the characterization of the two reporters, we made the following alteration:</p><p>“Given the known role of DNA methylation in regulating <italic>LUC</italic> expression at the <italic>LUCH</italic> reporter [Won et al., 2012], the DNA methylation and siRNA profiles for both <italic>LUCH</italic> and <italic>YJ</italic> reporters were determined by MethylC-sequencing (MethylC-seq) and small RNA sequencing (smRNA-seq), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 1A-D</xref>), allowing either multi-mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) or unique reads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).”</p><p>Second, in the section detailing the traditional bisulfite sequencing, we made the following alteration to emphasize that such analysis is required to assess the methylation specifically at the <italic>d35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>LUC</italic> expression, independently of both the 94% identical <italic>d35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>NPTII</italic> expression in the YJ transgene and similar <italic>d35S</italic> promoters in the T-DNA mutant lines.</p><p>“Thus, to specifically assess DNA methylation at the <italic>d35S</italic> promoter driving the <italic>LUC</italic> gene, without interference from the 94% identical <italic>d35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>NPTII</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>) or the similar <italic>d35S</italic> promoters present in the T-DNA insertion mutant backgrounds, traditional bisulfite conversion assays coupled with Sanger sequencing were conducted.”</p><p>“These findings demonstrate that the two methods of bisulfite sequencing are comparable and, unlike the MethylC-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,E</xref>), definitively show that the changes in DNA methylation observed in the <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> mutants occur at the <italic>35S</italic> promoter driving <italic>LUC</italic> expression.”</p><p><italic>4) With respect to the insufficiency of d35S promoter 3'-end hypermethylation to cause LUC gene silencing, the possibility needs to be considered that CHH methylation alone is sufficient to cause silencing.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this is an important point. Thus, we have modified the main text to soften our conclusion, as shown below, and have included a more detailed visual representation of the traditional bisulfite sequencing using cymate, which we hope will aid in the data interpretation. However, we would like to raise the point that if CHH methylation alone was enough to account for all the gene silencing, then one would expect higher LUC expression in the <italic>YJ nrpe1</italic> and <italic>YJ ago4</italic> backgrounds as compared to the YJ control, which is not what we observed. Thus, a more complicated compensatory model would need to be invoked.</p><p>“While compensatory effects on gene expression due to decreased non-CG methylation at other regions of the <italic>d35S</italic> promoter in the <italic>ago4</italic> and <italic>nrpe1</italic> mutants cannot be fully excluded, these findings suggest that the hyper-methylation at the 3’ end of the <italic>d35S</italic> promoter region alone is not sufficient to cause gene silencing.”</p><p>“Secondly, we demonstrated that hyper-methylation at the 3’ end of the <italic>d35S</italic> promoter in the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter does not appear to be sufficient to cause gene silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As such, the MBD7 complex joins a small number of factors including MOM1, MORC1, MORC6, ATXR5, and ATXR6, that can act primarily downstream of DNA methylation.”</p><p>“Furthermore, we found that while mutations in components of the MBD7 complex led to increased DNA methylation at the d35S promoter driving LUC expression, this methylation alone did not appear to be sufficient to cause LUC silencing.”</p><p>“Conversely, all three mutants (<italic>ago4-6, nrpe1-11</italic> and <italic>rdd</italic>) showed a hyper-methylation phenotype similar to that observed in the <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> mutants at the 3’ end of the <italic>35S</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p><p><italic>5) With respect to the inability of a LIL transgene not complementing the identified methylation differences, the arguments presented should take into account the partial complementation seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</italic> </p><p>We agree that the level of complementation should be taken into account when interpreting the MethylC-seq data. Therefore, we have added the following sentence to the main text.</p><p>“In general, the complementing lines more closely resemble the <italic>YJ lil-1_r7</italic> mutant line than the <italic>YJ_r7</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting minimal complementation overall. Although the possibility of partial complementation at some loci cannot be excluded, even at the most robust set of DMRs, only 1 of 33 DMRs returned to control levels of DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>, hyper-CHH site 1).”</p><p><italic>6) Can downstream function of the MBD7 complex be distinguished from independent function? These distinct possibilities need to be explicitly discussed.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out that we were not clear enough in our usages of the terms “downstream” and “independent”. Based on the 5 AZA experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> we have shown that, at least at the <italic>YJ</italic> and <italic>LUCH</italic> transgenes, the anti-silencing functions of the MBD7 complex are dependent on DNA methylation (i.e. expression is only lower in the <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> mutants when methylation is present). Thus, we conclude that they act downstream rather than independently of DNA methylation at these loci. However, in several other places in the main text we state that the MBD7 complex function/acts in a manner that is “largely independent of changes in DNA methylation”. In hindsight, we now appreciate that this caused confusion, and have reworded the following statements for clarity.</p><p>“Given the absence of endogenous targets transcriptionally regulated by the MBD7 complex, it is likely that this complex functions redundantly with other MBD-ACD complexes and/or is required only under specific conditions. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate that this complex has the ability to regulate gene expression in a manner largely downstream of DNA methylation at <italic>LUC</italic> reporters.”</p><p>“Rather than functioning as part of the DNA demethylation pathway, as has been previously hypothesized [Lang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015], our results suggest that the MBD7 complex functions in a manner largely downstream of DNA methylation.

To further address this question we have now taken the suggestion of reviewer 2 and added a visual representation of all the traditional bisulfite sequencing as a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Providing this data should make it easier to interpret the data presented here and aid in future re-analysis of the data as the field progresses and we gain a deeper understanding of how DNA methylation controls gene expression.</p><p><italic>9) Global misregulation of methylation caused by loss of the MBD7 complex might be detected by looking an increase in variation of methylation in the mutants.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this interesting point. However, as there are many ways to both define and assess variation in methylation, this is a quite difficult question to definitively address. To begin addressing this question, we did investigate the variation in the control vs experimental samples by looking at the variation in the number of DMRs amongst the sample sets. The data is plotted below:<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19893.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Investigation into variation in DNA methylation.</title><p>Comparisons of the average number of DMRs observed between all pairwise combinations of three YJ replicates (YJ_r1, YJ_r5 and YJ_r7) or between all pairwise combinations of these controls and their corresponding YJ_lil data sets.

Thus, we feel it would be premature to make statements regarding methylation variation based on our current datasets. This is especially true as no proteins or pathways have been identified that serve to increase the variation in methylation patterns and thus the burden of proof for such a claim would be very high.</p><p><italic>10) Could there be redundancy with other MBD-ACD proteins?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the assessment that MBD-ACD proteins/complexes could function redundantly when it comes to regulating endogenous loci and thank the reviewers for calling to our attention that we should emphasize this more clearly in the manuscript. In its original form, this possibility was mentioned twice in the Discussion, but not mentioned in the Results section. We have now edited and/or added the following statements in the Results to more clearly acknowledge the possibility of redundant functions between the various MBD and ACD proteins at endogenous loci.</p><p>“Thus, although there are clear genetic connections between MBD7, LIL and ROS1 in the regulation of several transgenic reporters [Lang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015], as a general rule, the demethylation pathway does not appear to function in a manner that depends solely on either MBD7 or LIL.”</p><p>“Given the absence of endogenous targets transcriptionally regulated by the MBD7 complex, it is likely that this complex functions redundantly with other MBD-ACD complexes and/or is required only under specific conditions. Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate that this complex has the ability to regulate gene expression in a manner largely downstream of DNA methylation at LUC reporters.”</p><p>“Thus, while we cannot fully rule out a role for the MBD7 complex as a highly locus-specific regulator of the DNA demethylation pathway, nor do we know the extent to which other MBD-ACD complexes might function redundantly with the MBD7 complex and mask its role at endogenous targets and/or connections with the demethylase machinery, we currently favor a model based on our extensive transgene analysis in which the MBD7 complex functions largely downstream of DNA methylation to promote gene expression through a yet unknown mechanism.”</p><p><italic>11) Given the published results of MBD7 binding methylated genomic regions and influencing transcription at a similar time point as the one tested here, you should comment on these discrepancies.</italic> </p><p>To address this comment we have now added a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) and a separate section to the Results in which we provide additional details regarding our RNAseq data and also draw comparisons with the genes identified in previous studies. See below:</p><p>“Transcriptome profiling of <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> mutants</p><p>To further investigate the role of the MBD7 complex in gene regulation, we assessed the effects of the <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> mutants on gene expression by transcriptome profiling. […] However, perhaps differences in growth conditions and/or the differing sensitivities and normalization procedures of the assays used to assess gene expression levels (i.e. mRNA-seq vs qPCR), as well as the already low expression levels of the downregulated genes under our conditions, represent contributing factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).”</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Specific comments to address:</italic> </p><p><italic>For the LUCH and YJ methylation profiles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>, how were reads mapped to the nearly identical d35S sequences upstream of LUC and NPTII? How were 24nt sRNAs uniquely mapped? It is essential to know whether or not the LUC gene has promoter methylation, as the system is described as one where genes have high promoter methylation but are expressed. (This may be in the legend but it was cut-off.) This also applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It seems that this is eventually addressed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> for YJ, but providing additional clarity in the main text is recommended. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> please also show the methylation profiles using uniquely-mapping reads only. It remains unclear whether LUCH has a hypermethylated promoter.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 3, we have now included data showing methylation and siRNA levels at the YJ and LUCH reporters using only uniquely mapping reads and have further clarified the main text.</p><p><italic>In the subsection “Genetic uncoupling of the hyper-methylation and LUC expression phenotypes at the YJ reporter” the authors conclude that hypermethylation of the 3' end of the d35S promoter is not sufficient to cause LUC gene silencing. This is because nrpe1 and ago4 mutants are also hypermethylated, yet LUC expression is higher. nrpe1 and ago4 mutants only have higher methylation in the CG context, and have lower CHH methylation than the other genotypes. The counter-argument is that CHH methylation alone is sufficient to cause LUC gene silencing. The authors should modify this conclusion to be more inclusive of the data presented.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 4, we have amended the text to address this point.</p><p><italic>The arguments about a LIL transgene not complementing the identified methylation differences (subsection “Genome-wide profiling shows that MBD7 and LIL have minimal effects on DNA methylation”, third paragraph) are not fully convincing because the LIL transgene does not appear to fully complement the LUC expression phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A/B</xref>).</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 5, we have altered the main text to include the possibility that there could be some partial complementation.</p><p><italic>Why do the authors conclude that the MBD7 complex functions downstream of DNA methylation (subsection “Genome-wide profiling shows that MBD7 and LIL have minimal effects on DNA methylation”, last paragraph and others)? Functioning entirely independent of methylation seems as likely. Independence is occasionally mentioned, but seem to be used interchangeably with downstream in the text, when biologically these would seem to mean two very different things. Just because the YJ and LUCH transgenes are methylated does not mean that the complex exclusively regulates expression of methylated regions of the genome. There may be some other feature about these transgenes that causes the complex to act on them.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 6, the 5 aza experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> show that the function of the MDB7 complex is dependent on the presence of DNA methylation. This finding, along with the DNA methylation analyzes showing minimal changes in DNA methylation in the <italic>mbd7</italic> and <italic>lil</italic> mutants, lead us to conclude that the MBD7 complex functions largely downstream of DNA methylation. We have modified the main text as necessary to avoid confusion cause by use of the phrase “independent of changes in DNA methylation”.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] While this study brings compelling evidence for a new mechanism of the MBD7-LIL complex in transgene regulation, I would suggest the two following points be addressed before considering publications:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Since the most important conclusion for this paper comes from two independent transgenes, it would be important to demonstrate the binding of MBD7 to the methylated promoters of at least one of these reporter genes. Since the authors already have introduced tagged versions of MBD7 in their YJ reporter line, a ChIP-qPCR could easily confirm a direct role for the complex in promoting transgene expression.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 1, we have added MBD7-GFP ChIP-qPCR data showing enrichment of this protein at the <italic>YJ</italic> reporter as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) A genome-wide ChIP experiment has revealed thousands of binding sites for MBD7 in transposable elements and genes (Lang et al., 2015). Yet in the present study, RNAseq experiment fails to identify any target in mbd7 and lil mutants. To prove the biological relevance of their proposed methylation-independent promotion of transcription, it would be interesting to investigate changes in expression further. Since the genes involved in the MBD7 complex appear to have high expression in seed (according to eFP browser and genevestigator), targeted expression survey (based on loci identified in previous studies) could be conducted rapidly in these tissues for at least one mutant background. It would also be essential to show that the changes in expression are independent of DNA methylation changes.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 2, we were unable to show altered expression of candidate MBD7 targets in seeds from <italic>lil</italic> and <italic>mbd7</italic> mutants.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] Because the MBD7d3 construct does contain a tiny overlap with the StkC domain, it remains possible that this bit of StkC is mediating interaction with IDM3. Since the MBD7-IDM3 interaction was previously mapped to the StkC domain with Y2H, the authors should include that construct in their analysis to directly compare interaction affinities.</italic> </p><p>While we agree that this is possible, it seems unlikely given the limited overlap (only 11 amino acids), which is why in the main text we stated that our findings “…suggesting that the interaction between MBD7 and LIL can be mediated by several regions of the MBD7 protein…”.</p><p><italic>Although MethylC-seq and Bisulfite/sanger sequencing indicate that there is little to no change in methylation of the YJ transgene, it remains possible that the subtle change in methylation of one small region is responsible for the observed change in transcription. Unfortunately, the nrpe1 and ago4 mutants do not completely rule out this possibility due to the possible &quot;compensatory effects&quot; that the authors acknowledge (subsection “Genetic uncoupling of the hyper-methylation and LUC expression phenotypes at the YJ reporter”, last paragraph).</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 8, we agree that we cannot exclude the possibility that subtle changes in methylation could play important roles in regulating gene expression and have included a more detailed representation of our DNA methylation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) to help address this issue.</p><p><italic>Is there the possibility that loss of the MBD7 complex causes misregulation of methylation such to increase variation in methylation across the genome? This could account for the large number of DMRs identified in each dataset that were not conserved between replicates. With so many control samples, it should be possible to determine the variation in the controls and compare it with the variation in the mutants to detect any possible increase in variation.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 9, we feel it would be premature to make statements regarding methylation variation based on our current datasets and level of statistical expertise.</p><p><italic>If the MBD7 complex functions as the authors suggest – countering DNA methylation to allow transcription, then why aren't genes differentially expressed in the lil and mbd7 backgrounds (subsection “Genome-wide profiling shows that MBD7 and LIL have minimal effects on DNA methylation”, third paragraph)? I'm afraid that this might be a fatal flaw – the assertion that MBD7 regulates transcription without changing methylation is based on a lack of changes in DNA methylation, but there is a similar lack of change in gene expression.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 10, we feel that redundancy with in MBD and LIL families could account for the lack of expression defects at endogenous loci and have modified the text as specified to make this point more clear.</p><p><italic>The authors offer no evidence that MBD-ACD don't function redundantly at most genomic loci, making it difficult to agree with the authors' key conclusion at the end of the first paragraph of the subsection “The MBD7 complex and the DNA demethylation machinery”.</italic> </p><p>As detailed in Essential revisions point 10, we have now added a statement to the Results acknowledging that the MBD-ACD complexes may act redundantly at endogenous loci.</p></body></sub-article></article>
