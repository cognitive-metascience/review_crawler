pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23084.001</object-id><p>Mutations in human <italic>Atrophin1</italic>, a transcriptional corepressor, cause dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, a neurodegenerative disease. <italic>Drosophila Atrophin</italic> (<italic>Atro</italic>) mutants display many phenotypes, including neurodegeneration, segmentation, patterning and planar polarity defects. Despite Atro’s critical role in development and disease, relatively little is known about Atro’s binding partners and downstream targets. We present the first genomic analysis of Atro using ChIP-seq against endogenous Atro. ChIP-seq identified 1300 potential direct targets of Atro including <italic>engrailed</italic>, and components of the Dpp and Notch signaling pathways. We show that Atro regulates Dpp and Notch signaling in larval imaginal discs, at least partially via regulation of <italic>thickveins</italic> and <italic>fringe</italic>. In addition, bioinformatics analyses, sequential ChIP and coimmunoprecipitation experiments reveal that Atro interacts with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GAGA Factor, Trithorax-like (Trl), and they bind to the same loci simultaneously. Phenotypic analyses of <italic>Trl</italic> and <italic>Atro</italic> clones suggest that Atro is required to modulate the transcription activation by Trl in larval imaginal discs. Taken together, these data indicate that Atro is a major Trl cofactor that functions to moderate developmental gene transcription.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23084.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23084.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23084.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells with the same genetic information can look and behave differently to each other. This is because they can control the activity of their genes, changing the effects the genes have in the cell. Regulating genes in this way is important in allowing cells to adapt to their surroundings and to perform different tasks.</p><p>Proteins called transcription factors control the activity of genes through other proteins called transcriptional co-activators and co-repressors. Atrophins are a group of co-repressors found in many animals including humans and fruit flies. Atrophins suppress the activity of certain genes, reducing the effects that they have in the cell. Losing Atrophin from cells can lead to severe diseases, but how Atrophin causes these effects is currently not well understood.</p><p>Yeung et al. examined which genes Atrophin regulates in cells from the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. This investigation revealed that, amongst other genes, Atrophin controls several well-studied genes including <italic>engrailed</italic> and <italic>thickveins</italic>. These genes are important in allowing cells to communicate and co-ordinate before birth, ensuring cells work together to build complex tissues and organs. These results suggest Atrophin plays key roles in organising and shaping the body before birth.</p><p>Further examination revealed that Atrophin acts in partnership with another molecule called Trithorax-like. Inside the cell many genes are protected by structures called nucleosomes that make them difficult to access, and Trithorax-like helps Atrophin to gain access to these genes. Further work will examine whether Atrophin and Trithorax-like work directly together or if other molecules bring about their interaction. It will also be important to examine how Atrophins suppress the activity of the genes they control. Errors in Atrophin1 in humans result in a nerve-damaging disease known as DRPLA; this work could also help researchers to better understand this disorder.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23084.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23084.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Atrophin</kwd><kwd>GAGA Factor / Trithorax-like</kwd><kwd>engrailed</kwd><kwd>Dpp signaling</kwd><kwd>Notch signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN 143319</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNeill</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIRG-G1002186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fanto</surname><given-names>Manolis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stenberg</surname><given-names>Per</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Terry Fox Research Institute team grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNeill</surname><given-names>Helen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ChIP-seq and phenotypic analyses reveal Atrophin from <italic>Drosophila</italic> directly regulates Notch and Dpp signaling components, and <italic>engrailed</italic> gene expression, via interactions with GAGA Factor.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atrophin family transcription factors are conserved transcriptional corepressors essential for development. Humans have two <italic>Atrophin</italic> genes; <italic>Atrophin 1</italic> (<italic>ATN1</italic>) and <italic>Atrophin 2</italic>. A polyglutamine expansion in <italic>ATN1</italic> is responsible for dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy (DRPLA) a progressive disorder of ataxia, myoclonus, epilepsy, intellectual deterioration and dementia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koide et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nagafuchi et al., 1994</xref>). <italic>Drosophila</italic> has only one <italic>Atrophin</italic> (<italic>Atro</italic>) gene, and expression of polyglutamine expansion <italic>Atro</italic> also lead to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Napoletano et al., 2011</xref>).

Atro also affects epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), Decapentaplegic (Dpp) and Hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charroux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Despite regulating many pathways and processes, only three direct Atro targets have been defined (<italic>knirps</italic>, <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>dpp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Napoletano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). These targets cannot adequately explain the diverse phenotypes exhibited by loss of <italic>Atro</italic>.</p><p>Atro physically interacts with histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and the histone methyltransferase, G9a, through its SANT and ELM2 domains, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2008</xref>). These interactions are thought to contribute to Atro’s repressor activity. Atro also interacts with other cofactors such as the co-repressor, Scribbler (also called Brakeless) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haecker et al., 2007</xref>). Atro does not have a DNA-binding sequence and has been shown to interact with DNA via interactions with nuclear receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2006</xref>). We show here that a major means by which Atro regulates transcription is with the <italic>Drosophila</italic> GAGA factor, Trithorax-like (Trl, also called GAF). Trl is an essential transcription factor that directly binds to GA repeats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggin and Tjian, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Soeller et al., 1988</xref>).

Trl can interact with other transcription factors (e.g. Yorkie, Tramtrack) to regulate transcriptional targets in patterning and growth control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pagans et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23084.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Atrophin ChIP-seq results.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic of Atro protein is shown.

Trl is also required in transcriptional repression. This is supported by three pieces of evidence: First, Trl binds to Polycomb response elements, DNA sequences where Polycomb group proteins bind to repress transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horard et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busturia et al., 2001</xref>). Second, Trl can physically associate with Polycomb Repressive Complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Poux et al., 2001</xref>). Third, <italic>Trl</italic> mutations enhance Polycomb group mutations, indicating that Trl is required for Polycomb repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mahmoudi et al., 2003</xref>). In addition to Trl’s ability to regulate transcription, Trl binding leads to open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsukiyama et al., 1994</xref>) and Trl maintains open chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>), at least in part by interacting with chromatin remodeling complexes such as NURF and FACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Xiao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shimojima et al., 2003</xref>). Trl is also required for transcriptional pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>). A working model is that Trl first binds to DNA to maintain open chromatin and later associates with other proteins to activate or repress transcription (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Granok et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lehmann, 2004</xref>]).</p><p>Here, we identify the genome-wide targets of Atro by chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq).

Our genetic and phenotypic analyses of Atro show that Atro regulates Dpp and Notch signaling, via transcriptional regulation of <italic>thickveins</italic> and likely <italic>fringe</italic>, respectively. We find that Atro negatively modulates En expression, while Trl promotes En expression. Bioinformatic analyses reveal that Atro and Trl ChIP-seq data strongly overlap and sequential ChIP and coimmunoprecipitation experiments confirm Atro and Trl bind to the same loci simultaneously and associate with one another. These data indicate that Atro modulates developmental gene expression via Trl binding.

In the wing, a line of N signaling induces the expression of wing margin markers Wingless (Wg) and Cut (Ct) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Celis et al., 1996</xref>). N signaling in the wing can also be visualized with a N signaling reporter (NRE-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Housden et al., 2012</xref>), which expresses in a sharp line in the developing wing margin. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones that cross the wing margin disrupt the expression pattern of the NRE-GFP reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), resulting in diffuse expression of the NRE-GFP reporter. In addition, <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones that cross the wing margin cause a loss of wing margin markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In some cases, <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones induce ectopic Ct expression just outside of the posterior clonal border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, arrow). In contrast to the wing, <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones do not affect Ct expression in the antennal discs, where a requirement of N signaling for Ct expression has not been shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Atro binds to the <italic>fng</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2013</xref>]), and in situ hybridization shows <italic>Atro</italic> knockdown causes increased <italic>fng</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These observations suggest that Atro may be regulating <italic>fng</italic> and/or other factors to affect N signaling.</p><p>We also checked if Atro regulates N signaling in the eye. In larval eye discs, R8 photoreceptors differentiate from a three-cell equivalence group, which differentiates into R2, R5 and R8 photoreceptors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frankfort and Mardon, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tsachaki and Sprecher, 2012</xref>]). N signaling is required for lateral inhibition in this equivalence group, such that one cell receives the least amount of N signaling and differentiates into R8. Thus, N signaling loss of function mutants have extra R8’s. To see if Atro affects R8 development, we stained <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones with Senseless (Sens), an early R8 marker. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones have extra Sens positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), clustered together in groups of two to three cells, resembling the number and shape of the R2/5/8 equivalence group. This suggests that lateral inhibition is defective in <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones. However, we noticed that there is one cell that has more Sens staining than the rest within each Sens-positive cell cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrowheads). Although <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones can induce extra Sens-positive cells, these clones do not have an excess of cells marked with a late R8 marker, Bride of sevenless (Boss) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, N signaling is required for the differentiation of R7 photoreceptors and cone cells, and loss of N signaling results in a lack of R7 and cone cells in the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cooper and Bray, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Flores et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tomlinson et al., 2011</xref>).

We reasoned that analysis of the DNA sequences obtained from the Atro ChIP-seq could identify novel potential cofactors and binding motifs of Atro to gain insight into how Atro regulates developmental signaling. Therefore, we performed de novo motif analysis of our ChIP-seq data using MEME-ChIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The Trl binding motif is enriched within Atro ChIP peak summits, indicating strongest Atro binding. Other enriched motifs include Twin of eyeless (Toy) and Mad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we looked for overlap between the Atro ChIP-seq data with other ChIP datasets from S2 cells. We reasoned that we should see an increase of overlap between Atro and other ChIP data if we looked more specifically at genomic locations with higher Atro ChIP signal using Atro peaks from major chromosome arms (excluding heterochromatin). Therefore, we plotted the amount of Atro overlap with other transcription factors over that expected by chance against the number of genomic locations grouped according to the amount of Atro binding (using genomic data from modENCODE (downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://intermine.modencode.org/">http://intermine.modencode.org/</ext-link>), CBP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Philip et al., 2015</xref>], and Yki [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oh et al., 2013</xref>]). In this analysis, several factors, including Trl, CBP (Nejire), the replication proteins Orc2 and MCM, Yorkie (Yki) and Polycomb proteins, showed increased overlap with increasing Atro binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the strongest overlap was found with Trl, confirming the MEME-ChIP analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

However, only a direct few targets of Atro are known and it is unclear how Atro regulates many genes. Here, using genome-wide ChIP-seq and in vivo analyses we show that Atro directly binds a number of developmentally critical genes; specifically regulating En expression and Dpp and Notch signaling. Trl has been proposed to activate transcription by opening and maintaining open chromatin to allow additional transcription factors to bind (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Granok et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lehmann, 2004</xref>). We find that Atro and Trl participate in a complex and bind to the same loci simultaneously. Atro does not bind to DNA directly, while Trl has a DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Biggin and Tjian, 1988</xref>). Thus, our results suggest a model in which Atro binds to DNA via Trl, either directly or indirectly via someunknown cofactors, and Atro modulates transcriptional activation by Trl.</p><p>Our in vivo analyses of <italic>en</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> show that Trl is required to promote their expression while Atro negatively modulates expression levels. To explain these phenotypes, we propose a model in which Trl binding leads to open chromatin to allow transcription, and Atro binding, either by directly interacting with Trl or through some unknown factors, negatively modulates Trl’s activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Atro binds to Histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) and a histone methyltransferase (G9a) to close chromatin and repress transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2008</xref>), suggesting a mechanisms by which Atro is able to counteract Trl. Indeed, Atro- and Trl-binding sites at the <italic>en</italic>, <italic>tkv</italic> and <italic>fng</italic> loci overlap with HDAC1-binding sites (from modENCODE, RPD3-Q3451) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celniker et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, loss of Trl leads to loss of expression of <italic>en</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> where they are normally expressed. In the absence of Atro, Trl’s activity is no longer negatively modulated, and expression of target genes such as <italic>en</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> are increased. However, in regions where <italic>en</italic> and <italic>tkv</italic> are not endogenously expressed, loss of Atro cannot induce ectopic expression as Atro’s function is to negatively modulate the transcription of its target genes.</p><p>Interestingly, Trl is enriched at paused promoters and is involved in transcription pausing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fuda et al., 2015</xref>). Trl recruits the negative elongation factor NELF to paused genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2013</xref>), but the precise mechanism of how Trl affects pausing is unknown. Our data suggest that Atro is present to modulate Trl’s transcription activation role. Perhaps, Atro is part of the transcriptional machinery used by Trl to pause transcription. In support of this, we noted that Atro preferentially binds to genes with higher expression (in S2 cells, genes with high expression are likely to be paused, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilchrist et al., 2010</xref>). GO analysis of Atro targets shows enrichment of signaling and patterning genes, also consistent with a role in pausing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, data not shown). Notably, the pausing index for genes bound by both Atro and Trl is higher on average than for all expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwak et al., 2013</xref>]). This increase of pausing index is even higher than genes bound only by Trl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These data suggest that Atro may be involved in transcriptional pausing with Trl.</p><p>We note that there are some Atro-binding sites that are not co-occupied by Trl. Atro also binds to other transcription factors (such as Tailless and Cubitus Interruptus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>]) and Atro may interact with other factors to bind to sites not co-occupied by Trl. Visual inspection reveals strong Atro peaks that do overlap with Trl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>); however, on a genome-wide basis, Atro peaks that do not overlap with Trl peaks are slightly weaker than the ones that do, as judged from the MACS2 derived significance (-log(p-value)) and fold enrichment values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Atro maternal mutants have missing, malformed and/or expanded En stripes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>), while in discs Atro modulates En expression. A possible explanation is that En regulation changes at different developmental times. During early embryogenesis, Pair-rule genes are required to first establish <italic>en</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DiNardo et al., 1988</xref>). Atro is also required for the proper expression of Pair-rule genes such as <italic>fushi tarazu</italic> and <italic>even-skipped</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2002</xref>). This could explain why loss of Atro during early embryogenesis has more severe effects on <italic>en</italic> expression. However, from late embryogenesis on, En expression no longer requires Pair-rule genes but depends on Polycomb group genes and unidentified activators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Moazed and O'Farrell, 1992</xref>). We observed reduced En expression in <italic>Trl</italic> clones in antennal and wing imaginal discs, while <italic>Atro</italic> disc clones have increased expression. These results suggest that Trl and Atro are required for regulation of En expression from late embryogenesis through larval development.</p><p>Why is it important for Atro to moderate <italic>en</italic> expression? Intriguingly, expressing higher than normal levels of En in the posterior compartment leads to lethality and anterior-posterior patterning defects of the posterior wing, suggesting that moderating En levels is required for normal development, and high levels could be toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guillén et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tabata et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Our Atro ChIP data show that Atro binds to the <italic>tkv</italic> locus and our in situ analysis reveals Atro represses <italic>tkv</italic> expression.

Conversely, <italic>Trl<sup>R85</sup></italic> clones have lower pMad levels. We reason that this is caused by decreased Tkv within the <italic>Trl<sup>R85</sup></italic> clones, consistent with a peak in the <italic>tkv</italic> locus. These observations mirror what we have seen with <italic>en</italic>, where Trl is required for activation and Atro is required for repression of transcription.</p><p>A model for Atro and Trl regulation of Dpp signaling is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>. In wild-type wings, the expression patterns of Dpp (yellow shading) and Tkv (red line) cause pMad to be found in a broad stripe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, blue line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tanimoto et al., 2000</xref>). Tkv levels are increased in <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>, indicated by the shaded rectangle). Thus, pMad levels are increased along the interior border of the clone if the <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones are close enough to the Dpp source. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones further away would not cause changes to pMad levels. Trl has the opposite effect where <italic>Trl<sup>R85</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>, shaded rectangle) cause a decrease of Tkv and thus lower pMad levels. Interestingly, the Mad binding motif is enriched in the Atro ChIP, with a shift in distribution, suggesting Mad may bind adjacent to Atro, and that Atro-Mad interactions on chromatin may also affect Dpp signaling.</p><p>Although <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones can lead to ectopic <italic>dpp-LacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erkner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), we did not see increased Dpp in <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> wing clones. Additionally, loss of Atro away from the endogenous Dpp stripe does not induce ectopic pMad. Therefore, the increase of pMad staining in <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones matches the pattern that is expected if Atro regulates Dpp signaling via <italic>tkv</italic> and not via <italic>dpp</italic> regulation. Thus, we suggest that Atro regulates Dpp signaling in the wing primarily by regulating <italic>tkv</italic> transcription.</p><p>To our knowledge, this report also provides the first evidence that Atro regulates N signaling. Our ChIP-seq analysis revealed Atro binding in multiple N pathway components, and genetic and molecular analysis reveals disruption of N signaling in Atro clones in eye and wing discs. <italic>Atro</italic> knockdown results in upregulation of <italic>fng</italic> transcripts in larval wings. Interestingly, <italic>patched-Gal4-</italic>driven overexpression of <italic>fng</italic> leads to an autonomous loss of wing margin marker expression as well as ectopic expression of wing margin marker on the posterior border of the Fng overexpressing region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panin et al., 1997</xref>). All <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones that cross the wing margin cause an autonomous loss of wing margin markers and large <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones can induce some ectopic wing margin marker expression on the posterior edge of the clone, mimicking <italic>patched-Gal4-</italic>driven Fng overexpression. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones also disrupt N signaling reporter expression. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones cause the N signaling reporter to express diffusely instead of in a sharp line. This diffuse expression pattern may be an indication of a loss of precise N signaling at the wing margin. Interestingly, Fng is crucial for N signaling at the margin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Celis and Bray, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Panin et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, Atro represses <italic>fng</italic> expression, and loss of <italic>Atro</italic> and <italic>patched-Gal4-</italic>driven overexpression of Fng have similar N-related phenotype in the wing.</p><p>Loss of <italic>Atro</italic> also leads to Notch loss of function in the eye. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones have extra cells with the early R8 marker, Sens, indicating a defect in lateral inhibition. Although there are extra Sens-positive cells in <italic>Atro</italic> clones, not all these cells express the late R8 marker, Boss, thus the extra Sens-positive cells do not differentiate into R8. Inspection of the Sens-positive cell clusters reveals there is one cell with more Sens than its neighbors in each cluster. We reason that the difference in Sens levels renders one cell with the most R8-like and this cell can express Boss. <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones also exhibit a loss of R7 and cone cell markers. Thus, Atro binds to the putative regulatory regions of genes that are connected to N signaling (such as <italic>emc</italic>, <italic>Dl</italic>, <italic>mam</italic>, <italic>fng</italic>, <italic>neur</italic>, <italic>numb,</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>), genetically interacts with N and regulates N target expression.</p><p>While the strongest overlap in our ChIP-seq peaks was seen between Atro and Trl, we also observed significant overlap of our Atro ChIP-seq data with ChIP data sets of Yorkie (Yki), the key transcriptional co-activator of the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, the atypical cadherin Fat regulates Yki activity via the Hippo pathway ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bennett and Harvey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Willecke et al., 2006</xref>] and reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Enderle and McNeill [2013]</xref> and planar polarity via Atro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Saburi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sharma and McNeill, 2013</xref>). Significantly, neurodegeneration by Atro has been shown to be mediated in part by Yki and the Hippo pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Napoletano et al., 2011</xref>). Thererfore, our finding that Yki and Atro are found at the same loci suggests a direct mechanism by which Atro may impact neurodegeneration, and suggests that Atro interactions with Yki may feed back into growth and patterning regulation by Fat cadherins.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first genome-wide analysis of Atrophin. Our genome-wide ChIP-seq and phenotypic analyses reveal many novel direct targets of Atro, and showed that Engrailed, Notch and Dpp signaling are directly regulated by Atro. Our analyses indicate that Atro preferentially binds to Trl binding sites. Interestingly, the fraction of paused genes is significantly more correlated with sites that bind both Atro and Trl, than just Trl alone, suggesting Atro may have a function in the regulation of pausing. Significantly, ChIP-re-ChIP experiments reveal that Atro and Trl bind to the same loci simultaneously, and phenotypic analyses indicate that Atro restricts expression of genes whose expression is promoted by Trl. Taken together, our data indicate that Atro is a critical component of developmental signaling and is an important general modulator of transcription activation by Trl.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Double crosslink ChIP and subsequent ChIP-seq</title><p>Two step crosslinking ChIP was required in order for ChIP to enrich for positive controls when using the SG2524 anti-Atro antibody (see below).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Atrophin controls developmental signaling pathways via interactions with Trithorax-like&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary and Essential revisions:</p><p>This is an interesting paper that uses an analysis of the genome-wide binding sites of the co-repressor Atrophin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to increase understanding of target genes under Atrophin control and to suggest a mechanism of Atrophin function as a cofactor regulating the activity of Trithorax-like (Trl). This is a valuable addition to our understanding of how signaling pathways are regulated.</p><p>Based on Atrophin binding peaks close to developmental pathway genes the authors explore the role of Atrophin in a number of pathways through analysis of Atrophin mutant clones. Evidence is presented implicating Atrophin as a regulator of engrailed, the Dpp pathway and Notch signalling. The binding data allow the inference of direct targets and this study is more comprehensive than prior analyses although Atrophin has been previously implicated in the regulation of engrailed and Dpp signalling.</p><p>Motif analysis on the Atrophin binding peaks indicates a strong enrichment for GA repeats, a motif associated with Trl. The majority of Atrophin binding peaks overlap Trl binding peaks and sequential ChIP experiments support the simultaneous binding of both Atrophin and Trl. Functional experiments on Atrophin targets, engrailed and thick veins, indicate that they are also regulated by Trl. All this forms an association between Atrophin and Trl and supports the authors' model that Atrophin can act to modulate gene activation by Trl.</p><p>The question is then how close is the association between Atrophin and Trl? The authors test this by co-IP and report no evidence for interaction in conventional extracts, however they do show co-IP following chromatin solubilisation using micrococcal nuclease. The authors conclude that Atrophin and Trl participate in a complex and suggest that Atrophin is a major Trl cofactor. Whilst there is good evidence for a co-localisation of Atrophin and Trl on chromatin the evidence for direct interaction seems weak. It remains plausible that Trl is associated with open chromatin regions where Atrophin may be recruited by a number of transcription factors and it is not clear that a direct interaction with Trl is required.</p><p>Although the association between Atrophin and Trl, both at the binding and functional levels, is interesting we do not think sufficient evidence is provided for the involvement of Atrophin in a clear mechanism as a direct cofactor of Trl. The discussions should appropriately be toned-down.</p><p>This paper is relatively straightforward and presents a consistent picture about the role of Atrophin in transcriptional regulation. The data are of high quality and convincing and they support the authors' conclusions. Overall this is a valuable and significant addition to the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Minor Comments):</italic> </p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. How are the 1275 S1-3-5 peaks derived from the 1377 common peaks mentioned in the text?</p><p>2) Subsection “Atro modulates developmental gene expression during larval development”, first paragraph: &quot;two strong Atro peaks&quot; upstream of the en TSS are described as being &quot;in the en promoter&quot;. What are the limits of the en promoter and has it been defined? Similarly, subsection “Atro directly regulates Dpp signaling via <italic>thickveins</italic>”: &quot;Atro bind's tkv's regulatory region&quot;; what is this region and has it been defined?

How are the 1275 S1-3-5 peaks derived from the 1377 common peaks mentioned in the text?</italic> </p><p>The 1275 peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> are only the peaks in the major chromosome arms from the 1377 common peaks. The peaks in the heterochromatin regions (e.g. chr3Rhet) are excluded, hence there are less peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> than the common 1377 peaks. This has been clarified in the main text and in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>2) Subsection “Atro modulates developmental gene expression during larval development”, first paragraph: &quot;two strong Atro peaks&quot; upstream of the en TSS are described as being &quot;in the en promoter&quot;. What are the limits of the en promoter and has it been defined? Similarly, subsection “Atro directly regulates Dpp signaling via thickveins”: &quot;Atro bind's tkv's regulatory region&quot;; what is this region and has it been defined? Also similarly, subsection “Atro is required for Notch signaling and directly regulates Notch pathway gene expression”, second and last paragraphs: &quot;Atro binds to the regulatory region of fng&quot; and &quot;regulatory regions of multiple N signaling components&quot;; what is the evidence these are regulatory regions?</italic> </p><p>Corresponding sources for promoter and regulatory gene regions have now been cited in the main text. For genes whose regulatory regions were not formally defined, these were changed to near putative regulatory regions of potential target genes instead of regulatory regions.</p><p><italic>3) The clonal analysis data is not always compelling; particularly the enhancement in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 B</xref>' is difficult to see in the image provided.</italic> </p><p>In the wing, endogenous En is expressed very strongly in the wing pouch. Hence, it is difficult to see a clear upregulation caused by <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> clones. To counter this problem, we generated new <italic>Atro<sup>35</sup></italic> wing clones and visualized En using weaker fluorescent secondary antibody to show a clearer upregulation of En. Accordingly, this new figure replaced the old <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) As the suggestion of a direct complex between Atro and Trl seems to me to be a major, or the major, point of interest in the paper, why is the critical co-IP experiment in a supplementary figure?</italic> </p><p>We agree with this point, which was brought up by both reviewers 1 and 2. In response to their comment, we have moved the coIP experiment to the main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. Although most Atro peaks overlap Trl peaks, a sizeable minority do not. Is this just a genomic data thresholding issue or is there good evidence for Atro binding in the absence of Trl? The peak the authors use in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> seems to be a clear example but it would be good if the authors could comment in general on the Atro sites that lack Trl and how they fit in their model.</italic> </p><p>We believe that Atro can interact with other transcription factors other than Trl to associate to DNA. For example, Atro was shown to physically interact with Tailless and Cubitus Interruptus (Wang et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2013). Thus this may explain why some Atro peaks do not intersect with Trl.</p><p>In addition to the above, we also believe that some Atro peaks that do not intersect with Trl in our analysis are weaker than the peaks that do. In order to test this we used the data generated by MACS2 peak calling:</p><p>MACS2 provides a –log(pvalue) value for each corresponding peak. This value ranks the significance of each of the peaks, where MACS2 assigns a higher –log(pvalue) for highly significant peaks. Using this data, we plotted box plots for all Atro peaks that intersect Trl and all Atro peaks that do not intersect with Trl, and then compared the two. The plots show that Atro peaks that do not intersect with Trl have slightly less –log(p-value) than that of Atro peaks that intersect Trl (Wilcoxon test p-value &lt; 0.001). MACS2 also generated a fold-enrichment value for each of the called peaks and we plotted box plots using these values as well. We saw that Atro peaks that do not intersect with Trl have less fold enrichment than Atro peaks that do (Wilcoxon test p-value &lt; 0.001). These data suggest that the Atro peaks that do not overlap with Trl are less significant than those that intersect.</p><p>Therefore, we believe that the Atro peaks that do not intersect Trl can be explained by: 1) Atro interacting with factors other than Trl and 2) Atro peaks that do not intersect with Trl tend to be less significant than the peaks that do intersect. The above points have been added to the main text and the plots have been added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Minor Comments):</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The choice about which data to include in the supplemental figures sometimes seems odd. For example, the co-IP data seem central to their conclusions and so I don't understand why they are relegated to a supplemental figure.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers regarding this and in response, we have moved the co-IP figure to the main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Perhaps it's there somewhere, but I can't readily find the source of the genomic data that was used to generate the graph shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>.</italic> </p><p>The sources of the genomic data are from modencode.org, and Philip et al., 2015 and Oh et al., 2012 for CPB and Yki, respectively. Only Atro peaks from major chromosome arms (e.g. heterochromatin excluded) were used for this figure. This information has been added to the main text as well as in the figure legends.</p><p><italic>3) Does bioinformatic analysis give any clue as to the difference between the Trl peaks that bind Atro and those that do not?</italic> </p><p>To address this, we repeated our bioinformatics analyses on Atro for Trl peaks. We first looked at the distribution of Trl peaks that do not intersect with Atro and Atro peaks that intersect with Trl to verified genomic regions (e.g. promoters, introns). However, we could not see any obvious differences between the two sets of data.</p><p>We also performed principal component analysis (PCA) of Atro peaks and the PCA indicated that Atro peaks can be grouped into 3 different classes. The PCA is now included as a figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We note that more experiments are needed to reveal the biological significance of these 3 groups.</p><p><italic>4) Given that the co-IP analysis was performed on MNase treated crude lysates, the interaction between Atro and Trl could be very indirect. Do the authors think it depends on the presence of chromatin fragments in the lysates?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the interaction could be indirect and we have toned down our discussion accordingly. Currently, we do not know if the Atro-Trl interaction requires the presence of chromatin but the requirement of MNase to see a coIP of Atro and Trl suggests that Atro and Trl are interacting near chromatin.</p><p><italic>5) Some of the ChIP experiments used double cross-linking. Is this because they found that the double cross-linking enhanced their signal?</italic> </p><p>Double cross-linking was crucial for the ChIP with the SG2524 anti-Atro antibody. Without double cross-linking, the Atro ChIP could not enrich for positive controls during the ChIP optimization. This point has been clarified in the Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
