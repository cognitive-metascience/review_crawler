potential requires synchronous opening of multiple Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Yet the mechanisms that coordinate this simultaneous opening during every heartbeat are unclear. Here, we demonstrate that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters that undergo dynamic, reciprocal, allosteric interactions. This ‘functional coupling’ facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx by increasing activation of adjoined channels and occurs through C-terminal-to-C-terminal interactions. These interactions are initiated by binding of incoming Ca<sup>2+</sup> to calmodulin (CaM) and proceed through Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 pre-IQ domain. Coupling fades as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases, but persists longer than the current that evoked it, providing evidence for ‘molecular memory’. Our findings suggest a model for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx amplification that unifies diverse observations about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in the heart, and challenges the long-held view that voltage-gated channels open and close independently.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05608.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05608.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05608.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To pump blood around the body, the muscle cells within the heart must contract and relax together with a regular rhythm. A contraction begins when proteins called Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels embedded in the cell membranes of heart cells open to allow calcium ions to enter the cells. The calcium ions that enter through these Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels trigger the release of calcium ions from storage compartments within the cells, which leads to the heart contracting. However, to trigger this release of calcium ions, many Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels have to open at the same time and we do not yet know how this is co-ordinated.</p><p>Dixon et al. studied Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in heart muscle cells from mice. The experiments show that these proteins are arranged in clusters of eight, on average, in the cell membrane. When calcium ions enter the cell they bind to a protein called calmodulin, which in turn binds to a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel. This allows the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within a cluster to interact with each other. The physical association between Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within clusters enables them to work cooperatively; they open at the same time to allow more calcium ions to enter and then close together to allow the cell to relax.</p><p>Dixon et al. found that even when levels of calcium ions in the cells declined, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within clusters remained open for a little while longer before they closed. This suggests that the interactions between the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels act as a type of ‘molecular memory’ that may alter how the cells respond to future activity.</p><p>These results challenge the previously held view that the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels open and close independently of one another. Future studies will seek to understand the molecular details of how these channels cluster together, and how this clustering affects changes in heart rate and heart abnormalities like long QT syndrome.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05608.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05608.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>coupled gating</kwd><kwd>calcium sparklet</kwd><kwd>EC coupling</kwd><kwd>calmodulin</kwd><kwd>voltage-gated calcium channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL085870</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santana</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000968</institution-id><institution>American Heart Association (AHA)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14GRNT18730054</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Navedo</surname><given-names>Manuel F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HL085686</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santana</surname><given-names>Luis F</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS077863</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Binder</surname><given-names>Marc D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven functional coupling of CaV1.2 channels is a mechanism of channel memory that may modulate the amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are composed of a pore-forming α<sub>1</sub> subunit and four additional accessory subunits (α<sub>2</sub>, β, γ, δ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Catterall, 1995</xref>). Four different α<sub>1</sub> subunits have been identified to date, one of which, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2, is expressed in neurons as well as cardiac and arterial smooth muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koch et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Navedo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Four distinct genes encode L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel β-subunits, each with multiple splice variants. In addition, four α<sub>2</sub>δ genes have been identified. Both cell- and tissue-specific combinations of these Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 subunits endow the channels with distinct functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Catterall, 2000</xref>).</p><p>A prominent characteristic of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is the tight regulation of their activity by the Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals they produce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Johny and Yue, 2014</xref>). For example, increases in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> have been implicated in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 facilitation; this Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation (CDF) is a form of positive feedback that amplifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. An increase in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) has also been proposed to exert the opposite effect—Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation (CDI). Thus, the balance between CDF and CDI of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels plays a key role in regulating the magnitude of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The general consensus is that CDF and CDI involve Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to calmodulin (CaM) in the IQ domain in the C-terminal tail of these channels.</p><p>During excitation-contraction (EC) coupling, membrane depolarization opens Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in the sarcolemma of ventricular myocytes. This allows a small amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to enter ventricular myocytes that can be detected optically in the form of a ‘Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklet’, raising local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> beyond the threshold for activation of ryanodine receptors (RyRs) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2001</xref>). Synchronous activation of multiple RyRs by Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels produces a global rise in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> that initiates myocardial contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>EC coupling in ventricular myocytes is remarkably reproducible, with each action potential (AP) invariably evoking a whole-cell [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient that results in contraction. At the membrane potentials reached during the plateau of the ventricular AP (approximately +50 mV), the driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry at physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (∼2 mM) is so low that opening of a single Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel is not sufficient to raise local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> beyond the RyR activation threshold. However, the probability of RyR activation during this phase of the AP is very high (&gt;0.9). This degree of reliability would presumably require 5–10 Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels to open simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue and Bridge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobie and Ramay, 2009</xref>). However, because the maximum open probability (<italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub>) of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels at physiological [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> is ∼0.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Josephson et al., 2010</xref>), the probability of 5–10 independently gating channels opening simultaneously is extremely low (i.e., 0.3<sup>5</sup> to 0.3<sup>10</sup>). This raises a fundamental question: if the probability of coincident openings of the requisite number of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is so low, why is the probability of RyR activation during the cardiac AP so high? Answering this question is critical for understanding the mechanistic basis of reliable cardiac performance.</p><p>A potential answer to this conundrum lies in the recently proposed concept that clusters of Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 channels can be functionally coupled to one another through physical interactions between their C-terminal tails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). This interaction enables physically linked channels to coordinate their gating, leading to amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, Ca<sup>2+</sup> current facilitation, and EC coupling in ventricular myocytes. Importantly, this model challenges the long-held assumption that Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 channels, like other classes of voltage-gated channels, function exclusively as monomers that gate independently of one another. To date, however, the mechanism underlying functional Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling has remained unknown.</p><p>Here, using a combination of super-resolution nanoscopy, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-imaging, electrophysiology and two methodologically distinct assays of protein–protein interaction, we have assembled a body of evidence that significantly alters our current understanding of Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM regulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels and reconciles diverse observations about Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in ventricular myocytes. We discovered that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to CaM induces C-terminal-to-C-terminal Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel interactions that increase the activity of adjoined channels, facilitating Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents and increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Notably, we found that functional coupling outlasts the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current that evokes it, providing evidence for a type of ‘molecular memory’ that could transiently shape the response of the cell to subsequent APs. We propose that cooperative gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is a new general mechanism for the regulation of excitability and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in cardiac myocytes and suggest that this concept can be extended to other excitable cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions augment functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels</title><p>We began our study by expressing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels in tsA-201 cells and recording elementary Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 currents from cell-attached patches. Currents were elicited with a step depolarization to −30 mV with Ba<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The mean amplitudes of i<sub>Ca</sub> and i<sub>Ba</sub> were 0.50 ± 0.02 (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and 1.45 ± 0.01 pA (<italic>n</italic> = 6), respectively. All-points histograms revealed that multi-channel openings were more likely with Ca<sup>2+</sup> than with Ba<sup>2+</sup>. Accordingly, the activity (<italic>n</italic>P<sub>o</sub>), defined as the number of channels (<italic>n</italic>) times the open probability (P<sub>o</sub>), of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within a patch, was significantly higher with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.24 ± 0.10) than Ba<sup>2+</sup> (0.02 ± 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Closer inspection of the multi-channel openings revealed that, with Ca<sup>2+</sup> as the charge carrier, multiple channels frequently opened together instantaneously and subsequently closed together. For example, in the enlarged trace in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, four channels opened simultaneously, followed by the opening of four additional channels. The eight channels remained open for a time (∼11.5 ms), then all closed simultaneously. This apparent coordinate gating of multiple Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels was not observed when Ba<sup>2+</sup> was used as the charge carrier. These results challenge the long-held and generally accepted view that individual Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels gate independently, and instead strongly suggest that these channels frequently exhibit ‘cooperative gating’. An additional implication is that Ca<sup>2+</sup> itself increases the probability of cooperative Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05608.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Single-channel electrical and optical recordings of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Representative <italic>i</italic><sub>Ba</sub> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>i</italic><sub>Ca</sub> (<bold>B</bold>) traces recorded from Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-expressing tsA-201 cells during step depolarizations from −80 to −30 mV.

A multi-Gaussian fit to the all-points histogram of the calibrated Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal obtained with 20 mM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>o</sub> revealed quantal amplitudes of 36.8 ± 4.2 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), in excellent agreement with the ∼38 nM reported previously for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets in arterial smooth muscle cells and tsA-201 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Navedo et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2006</xref>). Consistent with our single-channel data, we frequently observed multi-quantal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets corresponding to the simultaneous opening of several Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. We next applied a coupled Markov chain model to determine whether these Ca<sup>2+</sup>-influx events were solely attributable to stochastic, independently gating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels or instead reflected cooperative channel gating. The model assigns a coupling coefficient (κ) value to each Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklet site, ranging from 0 for independently gating channels to 1 for channels that gate exclusively in a cooperative manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung and Kennedy, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>). Using κ &gt; 0.1 as a threshold for cooperative gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Navedo et al., 2010</xref>), we found that the majority of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklet sites displayed cooperative or ‘coupled’ gating behavior, consistent with our hypothesis. Together, these data suggest that functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phenomenon.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mov" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-05608-media1.mov"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05608.004</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Cardiomyocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets.</title><p>Stack of 2D images acquired at 100 Hz from a whole-cell patch-clamped adult ventricular myocyte held at −80 mV and dialyzed with Rhod-2 via the patch pipette.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.05608.004">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.05608.004</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters in ventricular myocytes</title><p>If the trigger for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling were a local elevation in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> resulting from the opening of a single channel, then the efficacy of this signal in recruiting a nearby channel would be critically dependent on the distance separating the channels.

To test this idea, we co-expressed mCherry-sec61β (a general ER marker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zurek et al., 2011</xref>)) in tsA-201 cells together with Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Super-resolution imaging revealed that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel cluster distribution was not restricted to regions of the surface membrane where the ER was located (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead, these channels were broadly distributed along the PM surface. It is possible that the lack of organization of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels along ER junctions in tsA-201 cells reflects a lack of contact points or excessive distance between the ER and the PM. In ventricular myocytes, the membrane binding protein junctophilin-2 (JPH2) has been suggested to tether the jSR to the t-tubule membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takeshima et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, we attempted to anchor the ER to the PM by co-transfecting tsA-201 cells with JPH2. However, even in the presence of JPH2, the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel cluster distribution was not limited to PM-ER junctions in the manner that they are in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data suggest that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel clustering occurs independently of SR/ER microdomains.</p><p>To determine the number of channels within Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters, we injected mice with an adeno-associated virus serotype 9 (AAV9) designed to express photo-activatable-GFP–tagged Ca<sub>v</sub>β<sub>2a</sub>, and examined ventricular myocyte Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters 5 wk later using single-particle photobleaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ulbrich and Isacoff, 2007</xref>). Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>2a</sub> is a palmitoylated peripheral membrane protein that binds to the α<sub>1</sub> pore-forming subunit of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 with a 1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dalton et al., 2005</xref>); therefore, photo-activation of this protein with 405-nm light provides a fluorescent marker of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Single Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 were identified and excited using total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. The number of channels in each cluster was determined by continuous photobleaching and counting of stepwise decreases in fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). A preponderance (47%) of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters displayed 1 to 6 stepwise decreases in fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). A single photobleaching step was observed in only 1% of the spots analyzed. Indeed, the mean number of bleaching steps per cluster was 7.91 ± 0.23 (<italic>n</italic> = 25). This suggests that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels preferentially cluster in groups of about 8 channels in adult ventricular myocytes. We did not discriminate cluster size based on location; thus, our estimate of 8 channels/cluster combines dyadic and extra-dyadic populations.</p><p>Similar stepwise photobleaching experiments were performed on enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP)-tagged Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels heterologously expressed in tsA-201 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). TIRF imaging showed that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 clusters displayed a mean of 5.07 ± 0.15 (<italic>n</italic> = 10) discrete bleaching steps.

In isolation, VN155(I152L) and VC155 are non-fluorescent; however, when brought into close proximity by interacting proteins, they can reconstitute a full, fluorescent Venus protein.

Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VN and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-VC channels with an I1654E mutation in their IQ domains were able to fuse upon membrane depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). This isoleucine residue is crucial for CaM binding to the IQ motif. Previous in vitro studies have reported that the I1654E (or the human homolog I1624E) mutation decreases the affinity of the IQ motif for CaM by ∼100-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zühlke et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">2000</xref>). Thus, our results suggest that CaM binding to the IQ-motif is not required for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling. To investigate the role of the pre-IQ motif in channel interactions, we exchanged a 33-amino-acid segment of the pre-IQ domain for 33 non-identical amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4A</xref>). A similar segment exchange performed on human Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels expressed in tsA-201 cells was previously shown to impair channel clustering on the PM and reduce P<sub>o</sub> compared to wild-type (WT) channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kepplinger et al., 2000</xref>).

An illustration of our proposed model for coupled gating of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–D</xref>. In our formulation, CDI and CDF are interrelated processes, both dependent on the coupling state of adjacent Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. The C-terminal tail of the channel serves a dual role: inducing the functional coupling of adjacent channels via protein-to-protein interactions and regulating channel open probability. The physical interaction between clustered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is tightly regulated by local and global [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. The cascade of events that culminates in the coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels during an action potential begins with the gating of an individual channel within a cluster. The resulting Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklet induces the binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to CaM in the pre-IQ domain of the channel, which promotes physical interactions between contiguous channels. This increases the activity of adjoined channels, elevating local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. As individual channels within a cluster undergo VDI and CDI and close, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases and coupled channels disassemble. This, in turn, decreases channel opening probability and terminates Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux. Thus, the overall activity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels within a cluster depends on the number of channels that form dimers or higher-order oligomers.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.05608.018</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Mechanism and proposed model for the functional coupling of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are arranged into clusters in the PM of excitable cells; for simplicity, a cluster of two channels is shown. At the resting membrane potential (e.g., −80 mV), [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> are low; hence, the majority of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels are non-interacting. (<bold>B</bold>) During an action potential, the PM becomes depolarized, increasing the <italic>P</italic><sub>o</sub> of independently gating Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. Ca<sup>2+</sup> flows into the cell through these active channels, producing an elevation in local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> and increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to CaM. (<bold>C</bold>) Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM binding to the C-terminal pre-IQ domain of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel promotes physical interactions between adjacent channels. This functional coupling increases the activity of adjoined channels and thus amplifies Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. (<bold>D</bold>) Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels undergo VDI and CDI, and [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> declines once more. However, the channels remain coupled in a ‘primed’, non-conducting state for a finite time. If the membrane is depolarized again when the channels are still primed, the amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx will be immediate; otherwise, if [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> remains at resting levels beyond the lifetime of the primed state, the coupling dissolves and the cycle begins again.

EC coupling starts with membrane depolarization. According to our model, membrane depolarization increases the probability of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklet occurrence. Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 sparklets elevate local [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, thereby increasing the number of channels that form dimers or higher-order oligomers. This physical coupling increases the probability of synchronous, coincident openings of channels within a cluster (∼5–10 channels) to reliably activate nearby RyRs through Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Inoue and Bridge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sobie and Ramay, 2009</xref>). Accordingly, the strength of cardiac contraction would depend, at least in part, on the number of physically and functionally coupled Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels.</p><p>Our data further suggest that the degree of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 coupling varies within the physiological range of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> reached in ventricular myocytes during a cardiac cycle. We found that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling is dynamic and has an apparent K<sub>d</sub> of ∼250 nM. While the model assumes that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-to-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 coupling is initiated by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklet, it could also be induced by a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark resulting from the opening of a small cluster of closely apposed RyRs. This could induce local Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-to-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 coupling, even if transiently, priming these channels for opening during the action potential. Note, however, that because Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark activity is very low during diastole, the number of coupled Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels would likely be low. However, at the peak level of the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transient (∼700 nM) during EC coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Santana et al., 2002</xref>), the cell would have reached a maximal level of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-to-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 coupling.</p><p>An important finding in our study is that, while Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling fades as [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreases, it persists longer than the current that evoked it. This is important because Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity remains elevated for as long as the channels remain coupled. Thus, by outlasting the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> signal that evoked it, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling acts as a type of ‘molecular memory’ that might serve to augment Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx during repetitive membrane depolarization. As a consequence, an increase in action potential frequency can enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx via two mechanisms: first, it can increase [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, thereby increasing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling; and second, if an AP arrives while a subpopulation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels remain coupled, which could occur even if [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> had decreased to basal levels owing to the molecular memory phenomenon, it would encounter a cell with a higher number of coupled—that is, more active—channels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E,F</xref>). This molecular memory might also manifest itself as Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Marban and Tsien, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Argibay et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gurney et al., 1989</xref>). In the case of cardiac muscle, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 current facilitation augments contractile force during increases in heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pieske et al., 1999</xref>). In neurons, facilitation of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels has been suggested to contribute to an intrinsic amplification of synaptic current and the enhancement of neuronal excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Powers and Binder, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Striessnig et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our data support the view that Ca<sup>2+</sup> current facilitation in ventricular myocytes requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and CaM, but has CaMKII-dependent and -independent components. The latter likely involve Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CaM-induced Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling. Future experiments should investigate if CaMKII facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in neurons and cardiac muscle by a similar mechanism.</p><p>Dynamic, [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>-dependent Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel coupling could have pathological repercussions. For example, coupling of a mutant channel with a higher intrinsic open probability to a WT channel could increase Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. One condition associated with aberrantly high Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating is Timothy syndrome (TS), also known as long-QT syndrome 8. TS is an autosomal-dominant, multi-organ disorder caused by de novo gain-of-function missense mutations in exon 8 or an alternatively spliced exon 8A of Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Splawski et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">2005</xref>). Forced physical interactions between Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 channels have an intriguing effect on adjoined channels: fusion of intrinsically hyperactive Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-TS channels to WT channels induces these latter channels to function like TS channels. These findings have important implications. If TS channels can form stable interactions with neighboring WT channels in TS patients, then these mutant channels, which constitute only ∼23% of the total cardiac Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 population, could have a disproportionally large effect on Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. We previously tested this idea in ventricular myocytes expressing our fusible Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 channels and found that fusion of TS channels with WT channels led to the development of arrhythmogenic spontaneous SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release events in addition to increasing the amplitude of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> transients and contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dixon et al., 2012</xref>). These findings support the hypothesis that physical interactions between the C-termini of TS and WT channels produce a disproportionally large Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx that ultimately induces arrhythmogenic changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>. Consistent with this, we found that the relationship between the level of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2-TS channel expression and the probability of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> wave is non-linear, suggesting that even low levels of these channels are sufficient to induce maximal changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drum et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mutations in CaM have recently been linked to severe forms of long-QT syndrome, which are associated with life-threatening arrhythmias that occur very early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Limpitikul et al., 2014</xref>). Expression of these CaMs increases Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 activity and open times, effects similar to those produced by the TS mutation. Because CaM regulates many other Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel subtypes, including those that predominate in neurons, these mutant CaMs could lead to a multi-system disorder similar to TS. An important direction for future experiments will be to investigate whether Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 channel dysfunction is associated with aberrant TSTS or TS-WT Ca<sub><sc>v</sc></sub>1.2 channel coupling or coupling of channels with mutant CaM to channels with WT CaM.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that dynamic, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-driven physical interactions among clustered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels lead to cooperative gating of adjacent channels and enhanced Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. The physical proximity afforded by clustering of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels is necessary, but not sufficient, for functional coupling of the channels and occurs whether the channels are functionally coupled or not. Future studies should investigate the mechanisms that dictate the clustered arrangement of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels. It is likely that cooperative Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel gating also plays an important role in physiological functions as diverse as neuronal excitability and rate-dependent increases in cardiac contraction, as well as pathological conditions such as long-QT syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Isolation of ventricular myocytes</title><p>WT C57BL/6 mice were euthanized with a single lethal dose of sodium pentobarbital delivered via intraperitoneal injection, as approved by the University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).

The core Leica DMI6000 B TIRF microscope in this system is capable of functioning outside of GSD SR imaging mode as a conventional TIRF microscope. Cells were illuminated with 488-nm laser light, and image stacks of 2000 frames were acquired at 30 Hz. The first five images after the shutter was opened were averaged, and a rolling-ball background subtraction was applied using ImageJ/Fiji. This image was then low-pass filtered with a 2-pixel cut-off and high-pass filtered with a 5-pixel cut-off (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2D and 3D</xref>). Thresholding was then applied to identify connected regions of pixels that were above threshold. The ImageJ/Fiji plugin ‘Time Series Analyzer v2.0’ was then used to select 4 × 4 pixel regions of interest (ROIs) centered on the peak pixel in each spot. Next, z-axis intensity profiles (where z is time) from these ROIs were examined over the entire image stack.

Successful gene transfer was confirmed by photo-activating the Ca<sub>V</sub>β<sub>2</sub>-PA-GFP with 405 nm laser light. Prior to photo-activation, no GFP fluorescence emission was detected upon excitation with 488 nm laser light, but after photo-activation, robust GFP fluorescence emission was observed in the z-lines of isolated ventricular myocytes (data not shown).

A TTL pulse generated by the TILL imaging system was used to trigger the onset of each voltage sweep. The cell TIRF footprint was illuminated using 491-nm light throughout each voltage sweep, and PM-localized Venus fluorescence emission was monitored in a TIRF movie acquired at a rate of 100 Hz. The final six frames of each movie were averaged to generate a single image for each voltage sweep. These images were median filtered (1 pixel radius) then divided by the −60 mV image to obtain Venus F/F<sub>0</sub> images. Finally, the images were smoothed and pseudo-colored using the ‘red hot’ lookup table in ImageJ/Fiji.

Mouse hearts were homogenized in a lysis buffer solution containing 20 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8.0), 2 mM EDTA, 2 mM EGTA, 2 mM DTT, PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and cOmplete, Mini protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche Diagnostics). Hearts were subjected to three 5 s pulses at 12,000–17,000 rpm using a PRO200 Homogenizer Unit (Pro Scientific, Oxford, CT). The homogenate was centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 10 min and the resultant supernatant was collected and assayed for CaMKII activity as per the manufacturers instructions. To determine the effect of MLCKp on CaMKII activity, 0.1 or 1 μM MLCKp was added to the reaction.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Joshua Vaughan for help with super-resolution imaging procedures and analyses.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor) and Robert Kass (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The present work is a follow up of a previous study by the same group published in 2012 (Dixon et al., PNAS) and in which they showed that Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels form clusters in ventricular myocytes and that oligomerisation of L-type calcium channels via their C-termini result in the amplification of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into cells. In the present work, the authors use a combination of super resolution nanoscopy, Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging, electrophysiology and two methodologically distinct assays of protein-protein interaction to investigate the molecular basis for Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channels oligomerisation and its functional impact. The goal of this work is to determine the mechanisms allowing the simultaneous opening of calcium channels near the junctional SR in order to explain the high probability of RYR activation during the cardiac AP. The main findings of this study are that: i) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels form clusters containing 5 channels in tsA201 cells and 8 channels in mouse ventricular myocytes; ii) within these clusters, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels interact with each other via their C-termini and this interaction, which can occur in presence of elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, requires Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through L-type calcium channels; iii) CaM molecules are involved in Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2-to-Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 interaction via their C-termini by binding to a pre-IQ sequence and this is also required for Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels clustering; iv) the functional impact of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel coupling within a cluster consists in the instantaneous opening of channels together (and subsequent closing together) which is associated with multi-quantal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparklets. Also, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels coupling transiently persists after L-type calcium current has entered the cell and this is associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent facilitation in cardiac myocytes. In addition, the possible dynamic clustering and de-clustering of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels provides a mechanism of molecular memory, in which, the temporal limitation of channel disassociation following a first event could facilitation the activation of the subsequent events. These data provide novel insights of intracellular signaling networks of facilitation and are reminiscent of long-term potentiation and synaptic plasticity in neuronal networks.</p><p>This is an excellent paper that has no substantial flaws.

Epithelial tsA-201 cells (derived from HEK293 cells) are neither excitable nor contractile and lack a specialized ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release mechanism. Accordingly the tsA-201 cells do not possess the same specialized architecture or couplon structures observed in cardiac myocytes. Further, these cells do not express detectable levels of endogenous Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels (Perez-Garcia et al., 1995) or ryanodine receptors (Rossi et al., 2002; Tong et al., 1999). Nonetheless, we concede the possibility that heterologous expression of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels in these cells might result in their co-localization with ER structures that are present in the cells. To address this question, we used super-resolution imaging to examine Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel-expressing tsA-201 cells double labeled with antibodies directed against: (i) Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels and, (ii) mCherry-Sec61β (a general ER marker; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zurek et al., 2011</xref>). The results of these experiments, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1A</xref>, revealed that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clusters are not preferentially co-localized to tsA-201 ER structures. We further explored this idea by co-transfecting tsA-201 cells with the membrane-binding protein Junctophilin-2 (JPH2). This protein is known to stabilize the junctional membrane complex in cardiomyocytes by tethering the junctional SR membrane to the t-tubule membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Takeshima et al., 2000</xref>). We used JPH2-GFP to increase anchor points between the ER and PM in tsA-201 cells. However, even in the presence of JPH2, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clusters were not distributed along the PM-ER junctions in the manner that they are in cardiomyocytes. These data, now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1B</xref>, suggest that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel clustering occurs independently of SR/ER microdomains.</p><p>We performed additional imaging experiments on tsA-201 cells expressing Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels with the ‘pre-IQ swap’ mutation that prevents Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channel interactions (assayed with BiFC and presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4–figure supplement 4</xref>). In these experiments, we found that Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2(pre-IQ swap) channels still formed clusters in tsA-201 cells, despite their inability to interact functionally. Indeed, under identical imaging conditions (i.e., using the same fixative and TIRF penetration depth), Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 (pre-IQ swap) channel cluster areas were not significantly different from those of WT channels. These results suggest that while the physical proximity of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels is necessary for channel interactions, it is not sufficient for their functional coupling. These data have now been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4–figure supplement 5</xref>. The implications of these new data are that the clustered arrangement of Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2 channels may be dictated by another unknown protein scaffold. The identity of these proteins will be sought in future studies.</p><p><italic>2) The authors bring up an interesting concept of “molecular memory”, in which following the termination of the first event, Ca</italic><sub><italic>v</italic></sub><italic>1.2 de-clustering persist and this lag time could transiently facilitate an increase in the Ca</italic><sup><italic>2+</italic></sup><italic>-sensitivity and activation of subsequent events.

We want to clarify that we are not suggesting that channels dynamically cluster and de-cluster but rather that channels within pre-defined clusters dynamically and functionally interact with one another during calcium influx events. This is how we considered the reviewers question in our response. We now include additional experiments designed to address these questions. Specifically, we measured I<sub>2</sub>/I<sub>1</sub> current amplitude ratios with interpulse intervals ranging from 0.05 to 1.6 s in control ventricular myocytes and in myocytes dialyzed with 100 nM or 1 μM MLCKp. In control myocytes, peak levels of I<sub>Ca</sub> facilitation were apparent with an interpulse interval of 300 ms and declined thereafter whereas facilitation was absent at all interpulse-interval durations in myocytes superfused with Ba<sup>2+</sup> or dialyzed with 1 μM MLCKp. These results are consistent with our hypothesis that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions, not Ba<sup>2+</sup> ions, augment Ca<sub>V</sub>1.2 channel activity, likely by increasing the number of functionally coupled channels. Furthermore, these experiments reveal the “priming” phenomenon that we had proposed based on our FRET experiments. These new and exciting data have now been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>.</p><p><italic>References</italic>:</p><p>Perez-Garcia, M.T., Kamp, T.J., and Marban, E. (1995).
