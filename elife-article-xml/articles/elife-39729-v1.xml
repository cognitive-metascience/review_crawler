by exogenous agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manner is essential for the function of the epithelial lining. Over extended periods, baseline release of mucin can exceed quantities released by stimulated secretion, yet its regulation remains poorly characterized. We have discovered that ryanodine receptor-dependent intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations effect the dissociation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein, KChIP3, encoded by <italic>KCNIP3</italic> gene, from mature mucin-filled secretory granules, allowing for their exocytosis. Increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, or depleting KChIP3, lead to mucin hypersecretion in a human differentiated colonic cell line, an effect reproduced in the colon of <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. Conversely, overexpressing KChIP3 or abrogating its Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing ability, increases KChIP3 association with granules, and inhibits baseline secretion. KChIP3 therefore emerges as the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that negatively regulates baseline mucin secretion. We suggest KChIP3 marks mature, primed mucin granules, and functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation-dependent brake to control baseline secretion.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

Specialized epithelial goblet cells secrete gel-forming mucins (MUC2, MUC5AC, MUC5B and MUC6) that control the rheological properties of the mucus layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Dickey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kreda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>). Mucins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where they undergo core glycosylation and reach up to 500 kDa in apparent molecular weight. The fully assembled mucins are then exported to the Golgi complex where, after extensive glycosylation, they reach sizes of up to 2.5 million daltons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sheehan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>). These heavily glycosylated mucins are then packed into secretory granules that can be up to a micron in size and occupy almost 75% of the cytoplasmic volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Curran and Cohn, 2010</xref>). The granules mature to produce highly condensed mucins and finally a subset of granules fuse with the plasma membrane by SNARE-mediated fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2013</xref>). In the extracellular space, condensed mucins undergo a change in their organization to a gel-like form to compose a layer of mucus that coats the extracellular surface of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Mucin granule exocytosis is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated process that can occur at basal level (Baseline Mucin Secretion, BMS) and by an exogenously supplied agonist dependent release (Stimulated Mucin Secretion, SMS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rossi et al., 2004</xref>). Importantly, baseline mucin secretion could be the preponderant mode of goblet cell mucin release in healthy tissue, and may contribute predominately to mucus formation in allergic and infectious inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties of the well-characterized Synaptotagmin 2 (Syt2: low affinity and high cooperativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Xu et al., 2007</xref>)) provide the high fidelity necessary for stimulated secretion. Syt2, however, does not have a role in baseline mucin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tuvim et al., 2009</xref>). What then is the identity of the corresponding high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor required for baseline (agonist-independent) mucin secretion?</p><p>Our genome-wide screen identified new proteins that regulate mucin secretion, such as TRPM5, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel that controls extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>). Also identified in the pool of hits from this screen, was a high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein, KChIP3 (potassium voltage-gated channel interacting protein 3), also known as DREAM and Calsenilin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">An et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buxbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>), which is encoded by the gene <italic>KCNIP3</italic>. KChIP3 is a member of the neuronal Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor protein (NCS) family that codes a 29 kDa multifunctional Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>). It has three functional EF hands and can bind two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions with high affinity and another with lower affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lusin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Osawa et al., 2005</xref>). Curiously, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> regime under which KChIP3 senses Ca<sup>2+</sup>, at &lt; 1 µM, is an order of magnitude lower than the levels required to regulate stimulated secretion, which is estimated at 10 µM in the vicinity of the exocytic machinery in goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rossi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yu et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore reasoned that KChIP3 could be the key to controlling baseline mucin secretion ordinarily associated with lower intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations. In other words, while Syt2 functions in stimulated secretion as a low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>sensor, KChIP3 could be the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline secretion.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that KChIP3 is the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensing brake that controls agonist-independent baseline mucin secretion in tissue culture colonic goblet cells and in the mouse colon.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>KChIP3 is required for baseline mucin secretion in colonic goblet cells</title><p>Previously, we showed that differentiation of HT29-18N2 cells into mucin-secreting cells results in upregulation of mucins and many of the genes that are required for its secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>). We re-tested mRNA levels of KChIP3 in differentiated HT29-18N2 goblet cells compared to undifferentiated cells. The data reveal a 3.3-fold increase in the mRNA levels of KChIP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we generated a stable HT29-18N2 cell line depleted of KChIP3 (KChIP3-KD) and a stable HT29-18N2 cell line expressing KChIP3 tagged with GFP at the C-terminus (KChIP3-GFP). RNA was extracted from differentiated control, KChIP3-KD and KChIP3-GFP HT29-18N2 cells and the levels of KChIP family members monitored by qPCR. KChIP3-KD cells showed an 80% reduction in <italic>KCNIP3</italic> mRNA levels, while levels of the other KChIP family members were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In addition, expression of KChIP3-GFP, which was confirmed by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), did not significantly affect the levels of the other KChIP family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The commercial antibodies do not detect endogenous levels of KChIP3, therefore we can only provide a value of how much KChIP3 is overexpressed in KChIP3-GFP cell line compared to endogenous KChIP3 at the mRNA level. We used these cell lines to measure MUC5AC secretion in the absence (baseline) or presence (stimulated) of the physiological stimulus ATP (100 µM in a solution containing 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). After 30 min at 37°C, extracellular medium was collected and dot blotted with anti-MUC5AC antibody as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>). Within 30 min, our results reveal a strong (2.5-fold) increase in baseline mucin secretion from KChIP3-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), but there was no effect on agonist (ATP)-induced (stimulated) MUC5AC secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of KChIP3 (KChIP3-GFP cells) produced a 30% reduction in baseline MUC5AC secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), without affecting ATP-dependent MUC5AC secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39729.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>KChIP3 levels regulate baseline MUC5AC secretion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) KChIP3 RNA levels from undifferentiated (UD) and differentiated (DF) HT29-18N2 cells normalized by <italic>GAPDH</italic> values.

Although MUC5AC is expressed at low levels in the gastrointestinal tract and upregulated in pathological conditions such as ulcerative colitis or parasitic infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forgue-Lafitte et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hasnain et al., 2011</xref>), under physiological conditions colonic goblet cells secrete MUC2. This raises the obvious question: is KChIP3 involved in baseline MUC2 secretion? We used the same procedure as described above to test MUC2 released into the medium in the absence of agonist, from differentiated KChIP3-KD, KChIP3-GFP and control HT29-18N2 cells. In accordance with our results with MUC5AC, KChIP3 levels significantly affected baseline MUC2 secretion. KChIP3-KD cells showed a 5.7-fold increase in baseline secretion compared to control cells, while KChIP3-GFP cells presented a strong decrease (70.2% reduction compared to control cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). These findings indicate that the secretion of gel-forming mucins from colonic goblet cells might follow a similar mechanistic pathway. Even though the effects of MUC2 secretion are higher, for the sake of simplicity, availability and the cost of reagents, we have monitored the release of MUC5AC in the following experiments, unless otherwise mentioned.</p><p>Is the effect on MUC5AC secretion by KChIP3 depletion or overexpression perhaps due to changes in MUC5AC protein levels? Total cell lysate from KChIP3-KD, KChIP3-GFP and control cells was dot blotted with anti-MUC5AC antibody and we did not observe any obvious difference in the total MUC5AC intracellular levels, compared to control HT29-18N2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). We then tested whether loss or overexpression of KChIP3 affected production of MUC5AC-containing secretory granules. Cells were imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy with anti-MUC5AC antibody and analysed using FIJI software.

Our results show that increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (EGTA treatment) correlate with increased baseline mucin secretion (60% higher than control), while fewer Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, in cells treated with 10 µM dandrolene, result in reduced baseline secretion (40% reduction) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Furthermore, EGTA treatment abolished the differences in mucin secretion between control and KChIP3-KD cells (2.1 <italic>vs.</italic> 2.5 fold increase, respectively), suggesting that removal of KChIP3 brings cells close to their maximal baseline mucin secretion. Additionally, decreasing the number of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (dandrolene treatment) equally reduced baseline mucin secretion in both control and KChIP3-KD cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are key to baseline mucin secretion and that in the absence of these Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals, KChIP3 disengages its function as modulator of baseline mucin secretion.</p><p>Second, to test whether the link between KChIP3 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations to regulate baseline mucin secretion relates to the Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding capability of KChIP3 we generated a stable HT29-18N2 cell line overexpressing an EF-hand mutant KChIP3 (KChIP3-MUT), which is unable to bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>) (expression levels were tested by western blot, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Under normal basal Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>), differentiated KChIP3-MUT cells showed a similar reduction in baseline MUC5AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and MUC2 secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>) as KChIP3-GFP cells (37% and 47% decrease compared to control, respectively) compared to control cells. However, increasing intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations (0.5 mM EGTA treatment) induced different behaviour of WT and mutant KChIP3-expressing cells. While KChIP3-GFP cells showed increased secretion of MUC5AC identical to control cells (47.1% increase in control cells <italic>vs.</italic> 47.6% in KChIP3-GFP cells), KChIP3-MUT cells only showed an 11.1% increased secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

Knocking down KChIP3 increases while overexpression of KChIP3 decreases baseline mucin secretion. In addition, the role of KChIP3 in mucin secretion depends on basal intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals and the ability of KChIP3 to sense such Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals. Under conditions of low expression of KChIP3 (therefore a reduced brake capability and, consequently higher baseline mucin secretion), there is no further effect on secretion even with an increase in Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. On the contrary, overexpression of KChIP3 (increased brake capability) inhibits secretion and this effect is reverted by increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, mainly in cells overexpressing KChIP3-GFP, but not KChIP3-MUT. We therefore conclude that both Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations and KChIP3 function in the same pathway of baseline mucin secretion and Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations likely control KChIP3 function. However, to completely discard the second possibility raised above, we tested whether KChIP3 had a role in the generation or maintenance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations.</p><p>We measured intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by Fura2-AM in HT29-18N2 cells depleted of KChIP3 (KChIP3-KD) or cells overexpressing KChIP3 (KChIP3-GFP) under baseline (15 min in 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) or stimulated conditions (10 min, 1.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 µM ATP).

Specialized goblet cells release heavily glycosylated mucins from stored granules via exogenously applied agonist-dependent and -independent pathways. The former pathway is a form of acute response to protect epithelial lining when exposed to pathogens or allergens. The agonist-independent pathway however, is for chronic, continuous release of mucins at a low rate. Recent studies suggest that baseline secretion can release mucins in quantities that exceed several-fold, the amounts released by the agonist-mediated process over a 24 hr period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). While both of these pathways are poorly studied, our understanding of how cells control baseline mucin secretion is relatively even more primitive. In a nutshell, all that is known at present about baseline mucin secretion in human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse trachea is the involvement of SNAP23 and Munc13-2, which also regulate stimulated secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhu et al., 2008</xref>). It is also known that baseline mucin secretion is independent of Syt2 and sensitive to mechanical stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). But how is baseline mucin secretion controlled to prevent pathological quantities of secreted mucins?</p><p>Our data reveal a linear pathway whereby spontaneous cellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations trigger KChIP3 detachment from mucins granules and promote mucin secretion in an agonist-independent manner. We propose KChIP3 as the high-affinity calcium sensor to control baseline mucin secretion. KChIP3 according to our data is a negative regulator of baseline mucin secretion. Syt2, on the other hand, is the low-affinity calcium sensor that acts positively to regulate stimulated mucin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tuvim et al., 2009</xref>). Why is baseline mucin secretion controlled by a negative regulator? One possibility is that mature granules for baseline secretion are already docked at plasma membrane and ready to release their contents. The only means, therefore, to prevent their fusion is by employing a brake –a negative regulator– such as KChIP3. Another possibility that we cannot exclude is that KChIP3 competes with a positive regulator, like synaptotagmins, to control baseline mucin secretion.</p><p>In addition, we propose that even though there are notable differences in the proposed mechanisms of mucin secretion between colonic and airway cells, the function of KChIP3 is conserved in mucin secreting goblet cells regardless of the tissue. For example, both stimulated and baseline secretion in the airways are affected by shear stress (airflow and mucus movements promoted by ciliated cells), but are independent of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Dickey, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tuvim et al., 2009</xref>). In the intestine, there are two layers of mucus, an outer loose layer and an inner adherent layer of MUC2 (which is free of pathogens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Johansson et al., 2011</xref>), and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for stimulated secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, mucin secretion in both airways and the colon requires intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Altogether, this suggests the existence of a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for stimulated secretion and a high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline secretion regardless of the tissue type. KChIP3, as the high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor, therefore likely plays an important role in the physiology and pathophysiology of colon, the airways and consequently in mucin related pathologies such as asthma, cystic fibrosis and COPD.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations control baseline mucin secretion in colonic cells</title><p>The first key, novel data presented here are the exhibition of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in goblet cells. These oscillations arise from Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from internal stores (mainly ER), in a ryanodine receptor (RYR)-dependent manner. By modulating the frequency of Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, we could perturb the release propensity of mucin granules in goblet cells. It is known that RYRs promote Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, which is necessary for several Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent intracellular functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Van Petegem, 2012</xref>). Our findings reveal an important new function of these intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations as a means to control quantities of mucin secreted by goblet cells. We propose that goblet cells exhibit regulated secretory activity in two different regimes of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>: 1) a steady, moderated release (baseline) using intracellular stores to mildly elevate Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (oscillations) and, 2) a burst of secretion (stimulated) in response to potent physiological stimuli (ATP, for example) or pathogenic insults (for instance, allergenic) with a sizable influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This also helps resolve the controversy on the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for mucin release: extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is used to control stimulated release, whereas intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is employed to manage baseline mucin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KChIP3 links Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations to mucin secretion</title><p>In neurons, KChIP3 alters ER calcium content and RYR-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) by direct interaction with RYR receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lilliehook et al., 2002</xref>). As shown here, in HT29-18N2 goblet cells, modulating KChIP3 levels did not perturb intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis, but the localization of KChIP3 to granules is controlled by Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. It is reported that ER is in close proximity to mucin granules in goblet cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tuvim et al., 2009</xref>), which presents the possibility that by directly interacting with RYR, the activity and location of KChIP3 is affected by an ER-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. KChIP3 in this manner couples Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from ER to baseline mucin secretion. Thus, the second discovery presented here is that KChIP3 localization to granules and its function is linked to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Increasing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillation frequency reduces the fraction of mucin granules bearing KChIP3, which correlates with an increase in baseline mucin secretion. Furthermore, overexpressing KChIP3 or a mutant KChIP3 that cannot bind Ca<sup>2+</sup> reduces baseline mucin secretion. Loss of KChIP3, on the other hand, creates mucin hypersecretion. Based on our findings, we suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound KChIP3 is soluble and cytoplasmic: under these conditions the cells release more mucins from the secretory granules. This hypersecretory phenotype is mimicked by cells having more Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, with a concomitant decrease in the number of KChIP3 containing granules. Cells overexpressing KChIP3-GFP on the other hand release less mucins and accumulate apical mucin granules. It could be argued that modulation of calcium oscillations changes mucin granule’ composition and this somehow affects KChIP3 localization. This is unlikely because the location of KChIP3-MUT, which cannot bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>, is unaffected by perturbing Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Whereas, the wild type KChIP3-GFP location changes as per the status of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Also, the fast kinetics of the recruitment and release of KChIP3 under our experimental conditions strongly suggest that the changes in KChIP3 location presented here are unlikely due to in changes in granule composition.</p><p>How does the attachment of KChIP3 to the granules inhibit their release propensity? We suggest a parsimonious model, that granule-bound KChIP3 inhibits events leading to SNARE-mediated fusion. Whether this is by sequestering Ca<sup>2+</sup>, competing with the proteins of the SNARE complex or with regulators of the SNARE assembly such as Munc13-2, is an important new challenge. It is known that proteins like synaptotagmins act as low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor in the agonist-dependent release at the nerve terminal and in non-excitable goblet cells. KChIP3, we propose, is the high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that controls release propensity of mucin granules in non-excitable goblet cells in the absence of stimuli. It is possible that KChIP3 also has a role at the nerve terminal and in the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> independent release of cargoes that are stored in secretory granules.</p><p>Altogether, we suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations generated in the proximity of mucin granules from the ER, and not small increases in mean cytoplasmic calcium concentration, reach a certain threshold (provided by KChIP3’s Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding properties) to trigger baseline mucin secretion. We hypothesize that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to KChIP3 changes its conformation thereby affecting its interaction to mucin granules. This, we suggest, is analogous to KChIP3’s association to DRE sites where it acts as a transcriptional repressor. In this scheme, KChIP3 bound to Ca<sup>2+</sup> dissociates from DRE sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carrión et al., 1999</xref>). However, further work is needed to assess whether this proposed Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent conformational change that triggers dissociation from the granules is due to changes in the binding affinity of KChIP3 to granules or a change in its binding partners at the granules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Loss of KChIP3 causes mucin hypersecretion in vivo</title><p>It is satisfying to note that the effects of loss of KChIP3 on mucin hypersecretion by colonic goblet cells in culture are replicated in the colon of <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse. Both in the medial and distal colons of 12 week old <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice, there is a clear increase in the mucus layer thickness, from an average of 40 µm in wild type to 80 µm in <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice. However, the increased extracellular pool of mucins in <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse in the images shown might be perceived not to correlate to a decrease in intracellular mucin content within the goblet cells. The likely reason for this apparent disconnect is our inability to distinguish between mucins secreted into the colonic crypt and the intracellular mucins in the colonic epithelium. This can only be addressed reliably in cells isolated from the colon of the wild type and <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse followed by separating extracellular pool of mucins from the cells, and subsequently quantitating the intracellular and extracellular pool by dot blotting as we have shown here for the colonic cancer cells. This is technically extremely challenging, but regardless of this potential shortcoming, the data clearly point to a significant increase in the extracellular pool of colonic mucins in <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mouse compared to their wild type counterparts. Additionally, the colonic mucus layer in <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice seems denser (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), suggesting that the viscoelastic properties of the gel-forming mucins are also altered. Accumulated mucin in <italic>Kcnip3</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mice colon creates a more compact mucous, which is likely to be detrimental for overall gut physiology.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>KChIP3: a mark of maturity</title><p>Based on the data presented here, we propose the following model for the regulation of mucin granule secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39729.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Model of KChIP3 function.</title><p>Post biogenesis at the Golgi, mucin granules undergo maturation and are placed on path to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents.

The cells were then permeabilized by incubation in a buffer (IB) containing 20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 110 mM KOAc (Potassium acetate), 2 mM MgOAc (Magnesium acetate) and 0.5 mM EGTA (adapted from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lorenz et al., 2008</xref>]) with 0.001% digitonin for 5 min on ice, followed by washing for 7 min on ice with the same buffer without detergent. Cells were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min, further permeabilized for 5 min with 0.001% digitonin in IB and blocked with 4% BSA/PBS for 15 min. The anti-MUC5AC antibody was then added to the cells at 1:5000 in 4% BSA/PBS overnight at 4°C; anti-KChIP3 antibody was added to the cells at 1:500 in 4% BSA/PBS overnight at 4°C, and the anti-GFP antibody was added to the cells at 1:1000 in 4% BSA/PBS overnight at 4°C. After 24 hr, cells were washed with PBS and incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with a donkey anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 555 (for GFP), anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647 (for MUC5AC or KChIP3) (Life Technologies), diluted at 1:1000 in 4% BSA/PBS, and DAPI (1:20000). Finally, cells were washed in PBS and mounted in FluorSave Reagent (Calbiochem, Billerica, MA). Images were acquired using an inverted Leica SP8 confocal microscope with a 63x Plan Apo NA 1.4 objective and analysed using ImageJ ((FIJI, version 2.0.0-rc-43/1.51 g) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

To determine the volume of KChIP3 positive elements, we used the 3D objects counter v2.0 tool from FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bolte and Cordelières, 2006</xref>). All images analysed were taken on the same day under the same conditions and the same Z-step (0.29 µm). The parameters used follow: a) Size filter between 100 – 37748736 voxels; b) Threshold was manually set at 19 for both KChIP3-GFP and KChIP3-MUT cells and maintained the same for all images.

PAS was used to stains neutral, acid-simple non-sulfated and acid-complex sulfated mucins (mucins are stained in purple/magenta). For the PAS-AB staining, it first stains the acidic mucins with Alcian blue; those remaining acidic mucins that are also PAS positive will be chemically blocked and will not react further. Those neutral mucins that are solely PAS positive will subsequently be demonstrated in a contrasting manner. Where mixtures occur, the resultant colour will depend upon the dominant moiety. For PAS-AB staining, acidic mucins are stained in blue, neutral mucins in magenta and mixtures in blue/purple.</p><p>Full images of PAS and PAS-AB stained sections were acquired by a NanoZoomer-2.0 HT C9600 scanner (Hamamatsu) at 20X magnification, in which one pixel corresponds to 0.46 µm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Measurement of the mucus layer thickness</title><p>The thickness of mucus layer was measured in medium and distal colonic tissue sections using the ruler tool of the NDP view + 2.50.19 software (Hamamatsu) in both PAS and PAS-AB stained sections. 20 different measures were performed in two different tissue sections per stain in both medium and distal colon.

In all cases a D’Agostino– Pearson omnibus normality test was performed before any hypothesis contrast test. Statistical analysis and graphics were performed using GraphPad Prism 6 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>) or SigmaPlot 10 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_003210">SCR_003210</ext-link>) software. For data that followed normal distributions, we applied either Student’s t test or one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey’s post hoc test. For data that did not fit a normal distribution, we used Mann–Whitney’s unpaired t test and nonparametric ANOVA (Kruskal–Wallis) followed by Dunn’s post hoc test. Criteria for a significant statistical difference were: *p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the Malhotra Lab, especially Ishier Raote, for valuable discussions.

In support of this notion, the authors showed that overexpression of KChIP3 WT or Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut inhibits baseline mucin secretion. Furthermore, the authors found that both KChIP3 WT and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut associate with MUC5AC granules. Increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations by EGTA treatments significantly reduced the granule localization of KChIP3 WT. In contrast, KChIP3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut showed no changes upon EGTA treatments. These findings have led the authors to conclude that KChIP3 is likely to be the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline mucin secretion, and they further propose that KChIP3 marks mature and primed mucin granules, and functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent brake for baseline mucin secretion.

This is important because the discovery of new participants in exocytic events at this point in time is challenging in view of the extensive research that has been done on molecular mechanisms of exocytosis during the past three decades. As a result, most current research focuses on refinement of understanding of the roles of known participants. However, there are multiple weaknesses in the way the work is interpreted and presented, and specific suggestions are offered here to present the story with greater scholarly precision and clarity.</p><p>1) A critical issue related to the experiments requires clarification. By measuring MUC5AC in cellular supernatants, the authors detect a 2.5-fold increase in baseline secretion (subsection “KChIP3 is required for baseline mucin secretion in colonic goblet cells”, first paragraph), and other changes up and down in subsequent assays. However, there should be no measurable change in baseline (steady state) secreted mucins unless there is a secondary change in mucin gene expression, which the authors rule out. This issue is addressed in detail in Ren et al., 2015, wherein alterations in baseline secretion were analyzed in airway mucous cells in SNAP23 heterozygous knockout mice. In that paper, heterozygous loss of SNAP23 results in spontaneous intracellular mucin accumulation without inflammation or increased mucin gene expression. The increased intracellular pool brings the rate of mucin release back to wildtype, which can be conceptualized in a hydrodynamic model illustrated in Figure 7 of that paper. In fact, if one thinks about it, the steady state of baseline secretion necessarily reflects the rate of mucin synthesis or cells would become engorged until they lysed or they reduced mucin synthesis if there were a reduction in baseline secretion, or the converse if there were an increase. These issues were further explored in Zhu et al., 2015. The same reasoning calls the in vivo results shown in Figure 4, into question, and in this regard it is concerning that there is not a clear depletion of intracellular mucin stores in the intestine. Intracellular mucin depletion should be the major phenotype of an increase in baseline secretion (opposite to the mucin accumulation phenotype observed in Zhu et al., 2008, and Ren et al., 2015, in baseline secretion defective mice). The authors should carefully measure intracellular mucin in WT and mutant mice, and fully address this issue.</p><p>2) In Figure 1E, the calculation of ATP-dependent secretion from the data in D as the difference between normalized baseline and stimulated secretion for each condition does not seem justified. In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the full blot should be shown so the relative level of the overexpressed KChIP3-GFP fusion can be compared to endogenous KChIP3 (also, it's cumbersome for the reader to label the top row a-DREAM, which is a synonym for KChIP3, even if that is the preferred name by the vendor). In Figure 1—figure supplement 1C, is overexpression of KChIP3 really 500-fold? The figure legends are very long.</p><p>3) Regarding calcium oscillations, are the authors certain that it is the oscillations themselves that are responsible for regulating mucin secretion versus mean cytoplasmic calcium concentrations?</p><p>4) First sentence of the Abstract &quot;Regulated secretion by specialized goblet cells in agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manners.…&quot;.</p><p>If secretion is &quot;regulated&quot;, then it should not occur in an agonist-independent manner, and it probably doesn't. The authors are correct when they assert that even baseline secretion is regulated, at least in airway cells, as demonstrated several ways. First, baseline secretion depends on the exocytic sensor of second messengers Munc13-2 (Zhu et al., 2008). Second, it depends on the second messenger calcium (Rossi, Sears and Davis, 2004). Third, it depends on the P2Y2 purinergic receptor (references in Davis and Dickey, 2008). Fourth, it depends on shear stress, probably mediated by ATP released mostly by neighboring ciliated cells during respiration (Zhu et al., 2015; Tarran R, Annu Rev Physiol, 2006). A simple way to frame this is in terms of low and high levels of agonists (or second messengers) rather than agonist-independent and agonist-dependent. Presumably there is a constitutive secretory pathway that exists in parallel to the baseline and stimulated regulated pathways, and this reviewer is aware of some presumptive molecular components of the constitutive pathway in unpublished work. (Oddly, the authors seem to have awareness of these issues because, in their prior work, Mitrovic et al., <italic>eLife</italic>2013, the authors correctly noted that &quot;fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the plasma membrane requires an external signal.&quot;). Please rewrite the Abstract and Introduction with care to make these points more clearly.</p><p>5) In the second to last sentence of the Abstract, the statement &quot;KChIP3 emerges as the long-sought high-affinity Ca<sup>2++</sup> sensor that regulates baseline mucin secretion&quot; is likely to confuse those in the field because KChIP3 appears to be purely a negative regulator. Syt2 was identified as the low-affinity calcium sensor in stimulated secretion in airway cells, as correctly noted by the authors. However, Syt2 is a positive regulator of stimulated secretion in both airway cells and neurons, because its deletion in airway mucous cells results in a severe reduction of ATP-stimulated mucin release (Tuvim et al., 2009) and its deletion in neurons results in a severe reduction of evoked release in neurons (Pang ZP, J Neurosci, 2006). Besides its positive activity, Syt2 also has a negative regulatory activity because its deletion in neurons results in increased asynchronous and spontaneous synaptic vesicle release, but whether it has a negative activity in mucous cells is not known. In any case, what has long been sought is the high-affinity calcium sensor that positively regulates baseline mucin secretion. While Cantero-Recasens et al. have apparently discovered an interesting regulatory pathway, they need to explain these differences with care as not to confuse the reader.</p><p>6) In the Discussion, it is stated, &quot;in a nutshell, all that is known (about baseline mucin secretion) is that it is independent of Syt2 and is sensitive to mechanical stress.&quot; However, we also know that SNAP23 mediates both baseline and stimulated secretion (Ren et al., 2015), and that Munc13-2 regulates both processes (Zhu et al., 2008). Please cite these papers.</p><p>7) The authors go back and forth between airway and intestinal goblet cells as if they have identical mechanisms mediating and regulating secretion when in fact they don't. To begin, airway secretion, both baseline and stimulated, depends upon shear forces (airflow in vivo, liquid flow in vitro) mediated by ATP release from neighboring cells, whereas in the intestine, there is an adherent layer of MUC2. Another example is that in the intestine, sentinel goblet cells at the entrance to crypts respond to TLR signaling with massive secretion (Birchenough GM, Science, 2016), whereas no such phenomenon has been detected in the airway. Therefore, the authors should better clarify what is known in the airway, what is known in the intestine, and what, exactly, they are modeling. There is space to do this.</p><p>8) Minor issues: Subsection “KChIP3<sup>-/-</sup> mice show increased colonic mucus layer under basal conditions”, second paragraph, it is stated that an increase in the mucus layer was detected in the medial colon of four out of five knockout mice; was the fifth mouse excluded from the data analysis? In the next paragraph, the comment in Results that &quot;our data showing an increased mucus layer in KO mice fit nicely with data obtained in vitro&quot; is more appropriate for Discussion.</p><p>9) In the Introduction, it is confusing to state, &quot;our genome-wide screen identified new proteins that control extracellular calcium entry into cells.… also identified was a high-affinity calcium-binding protein, KChIP3&quot;. This makes it sound as if KChIP3 regulates calcium entry, when it is subsequently demonstrated that it does not. It should also be pointed out that in airway mucous cells over short time frames, extracellular calcium does not contribute to the level of cytoplasmic calcium (referenced in Tuvim et al., 2009, and Davis and Dickey, 2008).</p><p>10) There is room for improvement in phrasing in nearly every paragraph, with some being important (see below) and some trivial, for example, starting with the Abstract, granules are not released, rather their contents are released, and this could simply be fixed as &quot;allowing for their exocytosis&quot;.</p><p>In the Introduction, they talk about &quot;a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated reaction to a gel-like form&quot;. This is likely to be very confusing to readers because the manuscript revolves around cytoplasmic calcium sensing, while the effect of calcium on mucus gel-like properties is an entirely different subject that does not come up elsewhere in the manuscript. It is true that calcium binds mucins within secretory granules, and then is exchanged for sodium in the extracellular space after mucin secretion, but it would be simplest to just drop this fact from the Introduction.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Introduction, it would be helpful to add a few words &quot;identified new proteins, including TRPM5&quot;, to orient the reader to the prior work. “entry into the cells” is better as &quot;entry into cells&quot;, and “vicinity of exocytic machinery” as &quot;vicinity of the exocytic machinery&quot;.</p><p>The choice of KChIP3-WT as the designation of the transgenic overexpressing line is confusing, because WT can refer either to WT sequence or WT level of expression; it would be better to designate it as OE for overexpressing or GFP since that is now inserted.</p><p>Subsection “KChIP3 is required for baseline mucin secretion in colonic goblet cells”, second paragraph, it would be helpful if the authors provided a short description of circumstances when MUC5AC is expressed in colonic epithelium, such as parasite infection or ulcerative colitis, as they did in Mitrovic.</p><p>The apparent rigor of statistical analysis is low.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Cantero-Recasens and colleagues presented an interesting study on the impact of KChIP3 on mucin secretion. They showed that knocking down of KChIP3 lead to mucin hypersecretion, indicating an inhibitory role of KChIP3 in baseline secretion. In support of this notion, the authors showed that overexpression of KChIP3 WT or Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut inhibits baseline mucin secretion. Furthermore, the authors found that both KChIP3 WT and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut associate with MUC5AC granules. Increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations by EGTA treatments significantly reduced the granule localization of KChIP3 WT. In contrast, KChIP3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut showed no changes upon EGTA treatments. These findings have led the authors to conclude that KChIP3 is likely to be the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline mucin secretion, and they further proposed that KChIP3 marks mature and primed mucin granules, and functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent brake for baseline mucin secretion. In general, the experiments in this study were carefully designed and well executed. The inhibitory activity of KChIP3 on baseline mucin secretion is nicely shown. A potential weakness of this study is the link between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the dissociation of KChIP3 from granules.</p><p>KChIP3 granule localization is interesting, and this appears to be the main evidence for the proposed mechanism underlying KChIP3 inhibition. However, it is unclear to this reviewer what is the mechanistic nature behind the reduction of KChIP3 localization upon the EGTA treatment. For example, KChIP3 is a multifunctional protein that binds proteins and DNA, and it regulates gene expression in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way. Can the authors exclude the possibility that the changes of KChIP3-granule localization are due to alterations of protein/membrane components of granules on a longer timescale? Also, have the authors tried to block granule exocytosis by knocking down SNAREs (e.g., VAMP8)? Does an impairment of granule exocytosis inhibit KChIP3 dissociation? At this stage, further evidence to support the model in Figure 5 would be helpful.</p><p>In Figure 3, the authors presented data on KChIP3 staining using permeabilized and washed cells. While it is clear that some KChIP3 proteins are co-localized with granules, the degree of KChIP3 granular/cytosolic localization is unclear. What percentage of total KChIP3 is on granules? Without washing, could the authors observe KChIP3 WT and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut on docked granules (e.g., by TIRF)? Does the EGTA treatment change KChIP3 localization in intact cells? It would be helpful to know whether the EGTA treatment alters KChIP3 distribution by triggering complete dissociation or by changing the tightness of KChIP3-granule interactions.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;KChIP3 coupled to Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations exerts a tonic brake on baseline mucin release in the colon&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The authors have very thoughtfully responded to the detailed reviewer comments. However, this monitoring editor would strongly encourage the authors to incorporate most of their responses directly into the manuscript text in the Results section. If a reviewer expert has a question or is confused, other readers will too, and discussion of the issues in the paper will greatly improve the manuscript. For example, please state in the legend, &quot;Shown are Z-stack projections but quantification utilized data from individual stacks using 3D analysis software.&quot; A reader should not need to go to the methods to figure this out.

Although it is true that PAS technique is also used for the detection of glycogen and other glycoproteins, the combination of both PAS and Alcian-Blue is, by far, the most sensitive method to detect mucins, since all mucins are detected regardless of their charge. Since our data (Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2) show that KChIP3 has similar effect on both MUC2 and MUC5AC export, staining the sections with a specific mucin antibody will not provide any valuable information. Another key issue is that due to hyperglycosylation of mucins (80% sugars and 20% polypeptide), their detection by immunohistochemistry is technically very challenging.

Our data show that in HT29 goblet cells, however, modulating KChIP3 levels does not alter intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis; but, instead, its localization to granules was regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations. Importantly, since ER is in close proximity to mucin granules in goblet cells (Tuvim, 2009), it is possible that there is a direct interaction between RYR and KChIP3, which could efficiently influence KChIP3 activity and localization by ER-based Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, for example, by promoting KChIP3 detachment from the granules and coupling ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release to baseline mucin secretion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 – blue versus black dots are hard to see.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the shape and color of blue dots.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1F – it is impossible to understand how you handled what looks to be a green smoosh and counted objects in control cells.

This is important because the discovery of new participants in exocytic events at this point in time is challenging in view of the extensive research that has been done on molecular mechanisms of exocytosis during the past three decades. As a result, most current research focuses on refinement of understanding of the roles of known participants. However, there are multiple weaknesses in the way the work is interpreted and presented, and specific suggestions are offered here to present the story with greater scholarly precision and clarity.</p><p>1) A critical issue related to the experiments requires clarification. By measuring MUC5AC in cellular supernatants, the authors detect a 2.5-fold increase in baseline secretion (subsection “KChIP3 is required for baseline mucin secretion in colonic goblet cells”, first paragraph), and other changes up and down in subsequent assays. However, there should be no measurable change in baseline (steady state) secreted mucins unless there is a secondary change in mucin gene expression, which the authors rule out. This issue is addressed in detail in Ren et al., 2015, wherein alterations in baseline secretion were analyzed in airway mucous cells in SNAP23 heterozygous knockout mice. In that paper, heterozygous loss of SNAP23 results in spontaneous intracellular mucin accumulation without inflammation or increased mucin gene expression. The increased intracellular pool brings the rate of mucin release back to wildtype, which can be conceptualized in a hydrodynamic model illustrated in Figure 7 of that paper. In fact, if one thinks about it, the steady state of baseline secretion necessarily reflects the rate of mucin synthesis or cells would become engorged until they lysed or they reduced mucin synthesis if there were a reduction in baseline secretion, or the converse if there were an increase. These issues were further explored in Zhu et al., 2015. The same reasoning calls the in vivo results shown in Figure 4, into question, and in this regard it is concerning that there is not a clear depletion of intracellular mucin stores in the intestine. Intracellular mucin depletion should be the major phenotype of an increase in baseline secretion (opposite to the mucin accumulation phenotype observed in Zhu et al., 2008, and Ren et al., 2015, in baseline secretion defective mice). The authors should carefully measure intracellular mucin in WT and mutant mice, and fully address this issue.</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 1F, knock-down of KChIP3 in HT29 cells results in a reduction of intracellular MUC5AC staining, in accordance with the phenotype of an increase in baseline secretion that should produce a depletion of intracellular mucins. In the colon of the KChIP3 KO mice we observed a clear increase in the colonic mucus layer thickness. However, it was not possible to measure intracellular mucin staining. The only possibility was to measure mucin staining of the colonic epithelia, which includes goblet cells, the epithelium lining and the mucins secreted in the colonic crypt tube using the Positive Pixel Count Algorithm. Briefly, a region of interest (ROI) of colonic epithelia was selected for each image and pixels segmented in positive (PAS or PAS-AB positive pixels) or negative (rest of the pixels), and then analyzed as the percentage of positive pixels (number of positive pixels*100/(positive pixels+negative pixels)). However, since it was not possible to distinguish between the mucins secreted into the colonic crypt tube and the intracellular mucins, there was no observable difference between the WT and KChIP3 KO mice.</p><p>Therefore, the only way to quantify the differences in intracellular mucins between the KO and the WT mice would be to isolate the colonic cells, harvest and visualize by immunofluorescence and/or dot blotting with anti-mucin antibodies (after extensive washing to remove all secreted mucins). However, this is technically challenging and likely to introduce artifacts: the process of isolation might trigger mucin release and yield a false report.</p><p>Importantly, we show that in the tissue culture cells, there are fewer intracellular granules in KChIP3 depleted cells, so it is very likely that this event is reproduced in the mouse KO, but at this stage beyond our abilities to test for the reasons stated above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1E, the calculation of ATP-dependent secretion from the data in D as the difference between normalized baseline and stimulated secretion for each condition does not seem justified.</p></disp-quote><p>We decided to use the difference between baseline and stimulated secretion to calculate the real contribution of KChIP3 to ATP-mediated mucin secretion since in our experimental approach stimulated secretion also includes baseline secretion. In the case of KChIP3-KD cells there is an apparent increase of stimulated mucin secretion, which is due to an increase in baseline secretion. We therefore calculated ATP-dependent mucin secretion as the difference between stimulated and unstimulated secretion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the full blot should be shown so the relative level of the overexpressed KChIP3-GFP fusion can be compared to endogenous KChIP3 (also, it's cumbersome for the reader to label the top row a-DREAM, which is a synonym for KChIP3, even if that is the preferred name by the vendor).</p></disp-quote><p>Using available commercial antibodies against KChIP3, we have been unable detect endogenous KChIP3 by WB.

Model of KChIP3 function</italic></p><p>Post biogenesis at the Golgi, mucin granules undergo maturation and are placed on path to fuse with the plasma membrane and release their contents. However, the mature granules recruit KChIP3 (unbound to Ca<sup>2+</sup>) and this event stalls their fusion to the plasma membrane. KChIP3 recruitment thus acts as a brake to control the number of granules that can fuse with the plasma membrane. Based on our findings we describe two situations: A) In absence of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, KChIP3 is bound to the granules preventing their secretion, and B) Upon a rise in intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> by RYR-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations, the KChIP3 on the granules binds Ca<sup>2+</sup> and subsequently detaches thereby triggering their SNARE dependent fusion to the plasma membrane. The cells have therefore evolved a mechanism by imposing the recruitment of empty KChIP3 to mucin granules to stall their progression leading to fusion with plasma membrane.

This threshold is reached by Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations generated upon RYR mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, which is in close proximity to mucin granules in goblet cells (Tuvim, 2009). So, Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations are likely generated in the proximity of mucin granules and not diffused throughout the cytoplasm. It is also possible that not all oscillations trigger mucin secretion, but only those that exhibit a higher level. Therefore small increases in mean cytoplasmic calcium concentration are likely not sufficient to trigger mucin secretion. Besides, KChIP3-KD cells show increased and KChIP3-GFP cells show decreased baseline mucin secretion despite presenting no differences in mean baseline cytoplasmic calcium concentration (Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) First sentence of the Abstract &quot;Regulated secretion by specialized goblet cells in agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manners.…&quot;.</p><p>If secretion is &quot;regulated&quot;, then it should not occur in an agonist-independent manner, and it probably doesn't. The authors are correct when they assert that even baseline secretion is regulated, at least in airway cells, as demonstrated several ways. First, baseline secretion depends on the exocytic sensor of second messengers Munc13-2 (Zhu et al., 2008). Second, it depends on the second messenger calcium (Rossi, Sears and Davis, 2004). Third, it depends on the P2Y2 purinergic receptor (references in Davis and Dickey, 2008). Fourth, it depends on shear stress, probably mediated by ATP released mostly by neighboring ciliated cells during respiration (Zhu et al., 2015; Tarran R, Annu Rev Physiol, 2006). A simple way to frame this is in terms of low and high levels of agonists (or second messengers) rather than agonist-independent and agonist-dependent. Presumably there is a constitutive secretory pathway that exists in parallel to the baseline and stimulated regulated pathways, and this reviewer is aware of some presumptive molecular components of the constitutive pathway in unpublished work. (Oddly, the authors seem to have awareness of these issues because, in their prior work, Mitrovic et al., 2013, the authors correctly noted that &quot;fusion of MUC5AC-containing granules with the plasma membrane requires an external signal.&quot;). Please rewrite the Abstract and Introduction with care to make these points more clearly.</p></disp-quote><p>Although both baseline and stimulated secretion are regulated processes that depend on secondary messengers, we use the term baseline secretion to describe mucin release in the absence of exogenously applied agonist (as previously defined in Zhu et al., 2015). However, we agree that referring to baseline secretion as agonist-independent event is not completely correct and may be confusing. Therefore, we have changed the first sentence of the Abstract as well as the corresponding points of the Introduction and Discussion as shown below:</p><p>Abstract</p><p>“Regulated mucin secretion by specialized goblet cells in exogenous agonist-dependent (stimulated) and -independent (baseline) manner is essential for the function and protection of the epithelial lining.”</p><p>Introduction</p><p>“Mucin granule exocytosis is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-regulated process that can occur at basal level (Baseline Mucin Secretion, BMS) and by an exogenously applied agonist-dependent release (Stimulated Mucin Secretion, SMS) (Adler et al., 2013; Rossi et al., 2004).”</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“Specialized goblet cells release heavily glycosylated mucins from stored granules via exogenously applied agonist-dependent and -independent pathways.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the second to last sentence of the Abstract, the statement &quot;KChIP3 emerges as the long-sought high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that regulates baseline mucin secretion&quot; is likely to confuse those in the field because KChIP3 appears to be purely a negative regulator. Syt2 was identified as the low-affinity calcium sensor in stimulated secretion in airway cells, as correctly noted by the authors. However, Syt2 is a positive regulator of stimulated secretion in both airway cells and neurons, because its deletion in airway mucous cells results in a severe reduction of ATP-stimulated mucin release (Tuvim et al., 2009) and its deletion in neurons results in a severe reduction of evoked release in neurons (Pang ZP, J Neurosci, 2006). Besides its positive activity, Syt2 also has a negative regulatory activity because its deletion in neurons results in increased asynchronous and spontaneous synaptic vesicle release, but whether it has a negative activity in mucous cells is not known. In any case, what has long been sought is the high-affinity calcium sensor that positively regulates baseline mucin secretion. While Cantero-Recasens et al. have apparently discovered an interesting regulatory pathway, they need to explain these differences with care as not to confuse the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence in the Abstract to: &quot; KChIP3 therefore emerges as the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor that negatively regulates baseline mucin secretion.&quot; Moreover, we have included a new paragraph in the Discussion to clarify the role of KChIP3 as a negative regulator of baseline mucin secretion.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“We propose that KChIP3 is the high-affinity calcium sensor to control baseline mucin secretion. KChIP3 is, however, a negative regulator of this process. Syt2, on the other hand, is the low-affinity calcium sensor that acts as a positive regulator of stimulated mucin secretion, since its deletion severely blocks ATP-stimulated mucin release in airways cells (Tuvim et al., 2009). Why is baseline mucin secretion controlled by a negative regulator? One possibility is that granules for baseline secretion are already docked to the membrane and ready to release their contents. The only means to prevent their fusion therefore is to employ a brake –a negative regulator– such as KChIP3. Another possibility that we cannot exclude is the existence of a positive regulator that competes with KChIP3 to regulate baseline mucin secretion.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In the Discussion, it is stated, &quot;in a nutshell, all that is known (about baseline mucin secretion) is that it is independent of Syt2 and is sensitive to mechanical stress.&quot; However, we also know that SNAP23 mediates both baseline and stimulated secretion (Ren et al., 2015), and that Munc13-2 regulates both processes (Zhu et al., 2008). Please cite these papers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included the references suggested in the text.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“In a nutshell, all that is known is that in human bronchial epithelial cells and mouse trachea, baseline mucin granule secretion is SNAP23 and Munc13-2 dependent (that also regulate stimulated secretion) (Ren et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2008), but independent of Syt2, which functions during agonist-induced mucin secretion, and it is sensitive to mechanical stress (Zhu et al., 2015). But how is baseline mucin secretion controlled to prevent mucin hyper- or hyposecretion thereby avoiding pathological quantities of secreted mucins?”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors go back and forth between airway and intestinal goblet cells as if they have identical mechanisms mediating and regulating secretion when in fact they don't. To begin, airway secretion, both baseline and stimulated, depends upon shear forces (airflow in vivo, liquid flow in vitro) mediated by ATP release from neighboring cells, whereas in the intestine, there is an adherent layer of MUC2. Another example is that in the intestine, sentinel goblet cells at the entrance to crypts respond to TLR signaling with massive secretion (Birchenough GM, Science, 2016), whereas no such phenomenon has been detected in the airway. Therefore, the authors should better clarify what is known in the airway, what is known in the intestine, and what, exactly, they are modeling. There is space to do this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a new paragraph on the Discussion.</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“In addition, we propose that the basic mechanism of KChIP3 regulating baseline secretion is shared between different tissues, although there are several differences regarding mucin secretion from colonic and airway cells. It is known that both stimulated and baseline secretion in the airways depend on shear stress (airflow and mucus movements promoted by ciliated cells) and are apparently independent of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Davis and Dickey, 2008; Tuvim et al., 2009). In the intestine, there are two layers of mucus organized by MUC2, an outer loose layer (where commensal bacteria live) and an inner adherent layer (which is free of pathogens) (Johansson et al., 2011), and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for stimulated secretion (Mitrovic et al., 2013). Additionally, the sentinel goblet cells in the colon respond to TLR (Toll-like receptor) ligands and release massive amounts of mucin (Birchenough GM, Science, 2016). Nevertheless, mucin secretion in both tissues is dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This necessitates a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for stimulated secretion and a high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline secretion.

This makes it sound as if KChIP3 regulates calcium entry, when it is subsequently demonstrated that it does not. It should also be pointed out that in airway mucous cells over short time frames, extracellular calcium does not contribute to the level of cytoplasmic calcium (referenced in Tuvim et al., 2009, and Davis and Dickey, 2008).</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed it: “Our genome-wide screen identified new proteins that regulate mucin secretion, such as TRPM5, a Na<sup>+</sup> channel that controls extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into cells (Mitrovic et al., 2013).”</p><p>We have stated that extracellular calcium does not contribute to airway mucin secretion in a new paragraph of the Discussion:</p><p>“In addition, we propose that the basic mechanism of KChIP3 regulating baseline secretion is shared between different tissues, although there are several differences regarding mucin secretion from colonic and airway cells. It is known that both stimulated and baseline secretion in the airways depend on shear stress (airflow and mucus movements promoted by ciliated cells) and are apparently independent of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Davis and Dickey, 2008; Tuvim et al., 2009). In the intestine, there are two layers of mucus organized by MUC2, an outer loose layer (where commensal bacteria live) and an inner adherent layer (which is free of pathogens) (Johansson et al., 2011), and extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for stimulated secretion (Mitrovic et al., 2013). Additionally, the sentinel goblet cells in the colon respond to TLR (Toll-like receptor) ligands and release massive amounts of mucin (Birchenough GM, Science, 2016). Nevertheless, mucin secretion in both tissues is dependent on intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This necessitates a low affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for stimulated secretion and a high affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline secretion. Thus, KChIP3 is likely to play an important role not only in the physiology and pathophysiology of colon but also in the airways and mucin related pathologies such as asthma or COPD.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) There is room for improvement in phrasing in nearly every paragraph, with some being important (see below) and some trivial, for example, starting with the Abstract, granules are not released, rather their contents are released, and this could simply be fixed as &quot;allowing for their exocytosis&quot;.</p><p>In the Introduction, they talk about &quot;a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mediated reaction to a gel-like form&quot;. This is likely to be very confusing to readers because the manuscript revolves around cytoplasmic calcium sensing, while the effect of calcium on mucus gel-like properties is an entirely different subject that does not come up elsewhere in the manuscript. It is true that calcium binds mucins within secretory granules, and then is exchanged for sodium in the extracellular space after mucin secretion, but it would be simplest to just drop this fact from the Introduction.</p><p>In the third paragraph of the Introduction, it would be helpful to add a few words &quot;identified new proteins, including TRPM5&quot;, to orient the reader to the prior work. “entry into the cells” is better as &quot;entry into cells&quot;, and “vicinity of exocytic machinery” as &quot;vicinity of the exocytic machinery&quot;.</p><p>The choice of KChIP3-WT as the designation of the transgenic overexpressing line is confusing, because WT can refer either to WT sequence or WT level of expression; it would be better to designate it as OE for overexpressing or GFP since that is now inserted.</p><p>Subsection “KChIP3 is required for baseline mucin secretion in colonic goblet cells”, second paragraph, it would be helpful if the authors provided a short description of circumstances when MUC5AC is expressed in colonic epithelium, such as parasite infection or ulcerative colitis, as they did in Mitrovic.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks, we have corrected them (Abstract and Introduction), we refer now KChIP3-WT cell line as KChIP3-GFP, and now we included the following:</p><p>“MUC5AC secretion by colonic cancer cells is a good model system to study the mucin secretory pathway and, although it is expressed at low levels in the gastrointestinal and upregulated in pathological conditions such as ulcerative colitis or parasitic infection (Forgue‐Lafitte et al., 2007; Hasnain et al., 2011), colonic goblet cells ordinarily secrete MUC2. This raises the obvious issue: is KChIP3 involved in baseline MUC2 secretion?”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The apparent rigor of statistical analysis is low.</p></disp-quote><p>The description of the statistical analysis is included in the Materials and methods and assessed to the best of our abilities.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cantero-Recasens and colleagues presented an interesting study on the impact of KChIP3 on mucin secretion. They showed that knocking down of KChIP3 lead to mucin hypersecretion, indicating an inhibitory role of KChIP3 in baseline secretion. In support of this notion, the authors showed that overexpression of KChIP3 WT or Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut inhibits baseline mucin secretion. Furthermore, the authors found that both KChIP3 WT and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut associate with MUC5AC granules. Increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-oscillations by EGTA treatments significantly reduced the granule localization of KChIP3 WT. In contrast, KChIP3 Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut showed no changes upon EGTA treatments. These findings have led the authors to conclude that KChIP3 is likely to be the high-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensor for baseline mucin secretion, and they further proposed that KChIP3 marks mature and primed mucin granules, and functions as a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent brake for baseline mucin secretion. In general, the experiments in this study were carefully designed and well executed. The inhibitory activity of KChIP3 on baseline mucin secretion is nicely shown. A potential weakness of this study is the link between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the dissociation of KChIP3 from granules.</p><p>KChIP3 granule localization is interesting, and this appears to be the main evidence for the proposed mechanism underlying KChIP3 inhibition. However, it is unclear to this reviewer what is the mechanistic nature behind the reduction of KChIP3 localization upon the EGTA treatment. For example, KChIP3 is a multifunctional protein that binds proteins and DNA, and it regulates gene expression in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent way. Can the authors exclude the possibility that the changes of KChIP3-granule localization are due to alterations of protein/membrane components of granules on a longer timescale? Also, have the authors tried to block granule exocytosis by knocking down SNAREs (e.g., VAMP8)? Does an impairment of granule exocytosis inhibit KChIP3 dissociation? At this stage, further evidence to support the model in Figure 5 would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we cannot completely rule out the possibility that KChIP3 localization is affected by alterations in the chemical composition of the granules, the fact that KChIP3-MUT (that cannot bind Ca<sup>2+</sup>) has a similar localization which is not affected by Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels points to a fast effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatments on KChIP3 localization. Also the time of our experiments (30 min) makes it unlikely that the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> treatment on KChIP3 localization is due to alterations in membrane compositions.</p><p>We have not tested the effect of SNAREs KD (like VAMP8, SNAP23 or the exocytic regulatory protein Munc13-2 that are known to control baseline mucin secretion) in KChIP3 cell lines. Interestingly, all these SNAREs identified so far control both baseline and stimulated mucin secretion in the airways. However, the specific Syntaxin for baseline or stimulated mucin secretion remains unknown. Our immediate goal is to identify the syntaxin protein involved in baseline secretion and then test whether its depletion triggers accumulation of granules in KChIP3 lacking cells. We also believe a better understanding of how KChIP3 is recruited to the granules by identification of its binding partners, will help address this issue more convincingly. But these studies are beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 3, the authors presented data on KChIP3 staining using permeabilized and washed cells. While it is clear that some KChIP3 proteins are co-localized with granules, the degree of KChIP3 granular/cytosolic localization is unclear. What percentage of total KChIP3 is on granules? Without washing, could the authors observe KChIP3 WT and Ca<sup>2+</sup> Mut on docked granules (e.g., by TIRF)? Does the EGTA treatment change KChIP3 localization in intact cells? It would be helpful to know whether the EGTA treatment alters KChIP3 distribution by triggering complete dissociation or by changing the tightness of KChIP3-granule interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>Our first experiments using non-cytosolic washed KChIP3-GFP cells showed cytosolic KChIP3 localization with some brighter punctae of KChIP3, so we decided to check its localization by first removing all non-membrane bound cytoplasmic protein.</p><p>We hypothesize that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to KChIP3 (provided by calcium oscillations that reach a certain threshold) changes its conformation and thereby affects its interaction to mucin granules. For example, it is known that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to KChIP3 releases it from DRE sites (where it acts as a transcriptional repressor) in neurons (Carrión, 1999). However, whether this possible conformational change after binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> triggers dissociation from the granules, alters the binding affinity of KChIP3 to granules, increases the probability of its release, or produces a change in its binding partners are beyond the scope of this paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
