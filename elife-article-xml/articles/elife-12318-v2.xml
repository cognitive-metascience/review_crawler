degradation. Unlike most eukaryotes, ticks possess an incomplete haem biosynthetic pathway and, together with other (non-haematophagous) mites, lack a gene encoding haem oxygenase. We demonstrated, by membrane feeding, that ticks do not acquire bioavailable iron from haemoglobin-derived haem. However, ticks require dietary haemoglobin as an exogenous source of haem since, feeding with haemoglobin-depleted serum led to aborted embryogenesis. Supplementation of serum with haemoglobin fully restored egg fertility. Surprisingly, haemoglobin could be completely substituted by serum proteins for the provision of amino-acids in vitellogenesis. Acquired haem is distributed by haemolymph carrier protein(s) and sequestered by vitellins in the developing oocytes. This work extends, substantially, current knowledge of haem auxotrophy in ticks and underscores the importance of haem and iron metabolism as rational targets for anti-tick interventions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12318.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12318.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ticks are small blood-feeding parasites that transmit a range of diseases through their bites, including Lyme disease and encephalitis in humans. Like other blood-feeders, ticks acquire essential nutrients from their host in order to develop and reproduce.</p><p>Iron and haem (the iron-containing part of haemoglobin) are essential for the metabolism of every breathing animal on Earth. Most organisms obtain iron by degrading haem and, reciprocally, most of the iron in cells is used to make haem. However, an initial search of existing genome databases revealed that ticks lack the genes required to make the proteins that make and degrade haem.</p><p>Perner et al. wanted to find out if ticks can steal haem from the host and use it for their own development. To achieve this, Perner et al. exploited a method of tick membrane feeding that simulates natural feeding on a host by using a silicone imitation of a skin and cow smell extracts (“l´odeur de vache”). Ticks were fed either a haemoglobin-rich (whole blood) or a haemoglobin-poor (serum) diet. This experiment revealed that ticks can develop normally without haemoglobin, but female ticks fed a haemoglobin-poor diet lay sterile eggs out of which no offspring can hatch.</p><p>Further investigation showed that haemoglobin is vitally important as a source of haem but not as a source of the amino acids needed to produce the vitellin proteins that nourish embryos. As ticks are not armed with the ability to degrade haem, they do not acquire iron from the host haem but rather from a serum transferrin, a major iron transporter protein found in mammalian blood. Further experiments revealed that ticks have evolved proteins that can transport and store haem and so make the obtained haem available across the whole tick body.</p><p>Overall, Perner et al.’s findings suggest that targeting the mechanisms by which ticks metabolise haem and iron could lead to the design of new “anti-tick” strategies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12318.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12318.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>haem auxotrophy</kwd><kwd>haem oxygenase</kwd><kwd>iron metabolism</kwd><kwd>haematophagy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>ticks</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-11043S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kopacek</surname><given-names>Petr</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grant Agency of the University of South Bohemia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>074/2014/P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perner</surname><given-names>Jan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Program of Sustainability</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LO1416</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sobotka</surname><given-names>Roman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-12816P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sima</surname><given-names>Radek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14-33693S</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sojka</surname><given-names>Daniel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Grantová Agentura České Republiky</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>13-27630P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hajdusek</surname><given-names>Ondrej</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The lack of haem biosynthetic and degradative pathways in ticks offers new strategies to combat these parasites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Haem, the heterocyclic tetrapyrrole that conjugates divalent iron, is an essential molecule for most aerobic organisms, as a prosthetic group of numerous enzymes involved in a variety of biological processes such as cellular respiration, detoxification of xenobiotics or redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furuyama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kořený et al., 2013</xref>). Most organisms synthesise their own haem by an evolutionarily conserved multi-enzymatic pathway occurring in the mitochondria and cytosol. Only a few haem auxotrophs lacking functional haem biosynthesis have been described to date. Among these rare organisms that are reliant on the acquisition of exogenous haem are, for instance, a protozoan parasitic apicomplexan <italic>Babesia bovis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brayton et al., 2007</xref>), and kinetoplastid flagellates of the genus <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> and <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kořený et al., 2010</xref>). Some haem auxotrophs, such as the filarial nematode parasite <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghedin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2009</xref>), acquire haem from their endosymbionts, while others, such as the free-living nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rao et al., 2005</xref>) obtain haem from ingested bacteria. The inability to synthesise haem <italic>de novo</italic> was also biochemically demonstrated for the cattle tick <italic>Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braz et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to its benefits, haem is also cytotoxic, where free haem catalyses the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), causing cellular damage, mainly through lipid peroxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jeney et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Klouche et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Graca-Souza et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, in all living organisms, free intracellular haem has to be maintained at a low level via strictly regulated homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ryter and Tyrrell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khan and Quigley, 2011</xref>). This task is a critical challenge for haematophagous parasites, such as the malarial <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, blood flukes or triatominae insects that acquire large amounts of haem from digested haemoglobin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Oliveira et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pagola et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Paiva-Silva et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toh et al., 2010</xref>). Maintenance of haem balance is even more demanding for ticks, as their blood meal exceeds their own weight more than one hundred times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonenshine and Roe, 2014</xref>). Despite its importance, the knowledge of haem acquisition, inter-tissue transport and further utilisation in ticks is fairly limited. Haemoglobin, the abundant source of haem for these animals, is processed intracellularly in tick gut digest cells by a network of cysteine and aspartic peptidases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sojka et al., 2013</xref>). Excessive haem is detoxified by aggregation in specialised organelles termed haemosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lara et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">2005</xref>) and its movement from digestive vesicles is mediated by a recently described ATP-binding cassette transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lara et al., 2015</xref>). Only a small proportion of acquired haem is destined for systemic distribution to meet the metabolic demands of tick tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maya-Monteiro et al., 2000</xref>).</p><p>In the present work, we have screened available tick and mite genomic databases and found that ticks have lost most genes encoding the haem biosynthetic pathway. All mites also commonly lack genes coding for haem oxygenase (HO) that catalyzes haem catabolism, raising the question of iron source for these organisms. Using in vitro membrane feeding of the hard tick <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kröber and Guerin, 2007</xref>), the European vector of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, we performed differential feeding of females on haemoglobin-rich and haemoglobin-depleted diets. These experiments conclusively proved that ticks completely rely on the supply of exogenous haem to accomplish successful reproduction and that iron required for metabolic processes in tick tissues does not originate from haem. We propose that the unique maintenance of systemic and intracellular haem homeostasis in ticks represents a specific adaptation to their parasitic life style, and as such offers promising targets for anti-tick intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ticks have an incomplete pathway for haem biosynthesis</title><p>The availability of the genome-wide database for the deer tick <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016</xref>) made it possible to analyse the overall genetic make-up for enzymes possibly participating in haem biosynthesis and compare this data with other mites and insects (Hexapoda). Complete haem biosynthetic and degradative pathways are present in insects, represented by the genomes of the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>) and the blood-feeding malaria mosquito, <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holt et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The canonical haem biosynthetic pathway is also fully conserved in the genomes of the herbivorous mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>, and the predatory mite <italic>Metaseiulus occidentalis</italic>, but is substantially reduced in the genome of the obligatory blood-feeding tick, <italic>I. scapularis</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The tick genome contains only genes encoding the last three mitochondrial enzymes of haem biosynthesis, namely, coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase (CPOX, [Vectorbase: ISCW010977], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX, [Vectorbase: ISCW023396, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and ferrochelatase (FECH, [Vectorbase: ISCW016187], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Corresponding orthologues could be also found in the <italic>I. ricinus</italic> transcriptome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kotsyfakis et al., 2015</xref>) (GenBank Ac. Nos JAB79008, JAB84046 and JAB74800, respectively). Phylogenetic analyses confirmed that these genes cluster together with other Acari homologues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>, respectively). Another two gene sequences related to 5-aminolevulinate synthase (ALAS, Vectorbase: ISCW020754) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD, Vectorbase: ISCW020804) are clearly bacterial and most likely originate from bacterial contamination of the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>, respectively). This conclusion was further corroborated by the fact that these genes do not contain introns and are flanked by other bacterial genes in the corresponding genomic regions.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Evolution of haem biosynthetic and degradative pathways.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) General scheme of haem biosynthetic and degradative pathways in the eukaryotic cell.

The lack of HO thus poses a question of the iron source for ticks. Iron availability in tick tissues was examined using two independent methods: (i) The presence of iron was indirectly tested by monitoring the levels of intracellular Ferritin 1 (<italic>Ir</italic>Fer1). Under iron deficiency, the translation of <italic>ir-fer1</italic>mRNA is suppressed by binding of the iron regulatory protein (IRP1) to its 5’-located iron-responsive element, whereas at high iron levels, the proteosynthesis of <italic>Ir</italic>Fer1 is up-regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kopáček et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hajdusek et al., 2009</xref>).

As this method is not able to distinguish between iron of haem and non-haem origins, only salivary glands and ovaries dissected from partially engorged BF and SF ticks were used for the analysis to avoid distortions caused by the presence of haemoglobin in the samples. Despite large variations within individual biological replicates, the average iron concentration in either tissue was independent of haemoglobin in the tick diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). These results conclusively proved that the bioavailable iron in tick tissues originates from host serum components rather than from haemoglobin-derived haem.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Haemoglobin-derived haem is transported from the gut to the ovaries</title><p>Guts dissected from partially-engorged <italic>I. ricinus</italic> females, and ovaries dissected 6 days after detachment (AD) from both BF and SF ticks displayed similar overall morphologies, except for colour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

This observation demonstrates that haem present in the haemolymph of fully engorged females originated only from the blood meal of adults, and not from previous feeding at the nymphal stage. We estimate that out of approximately 10 µmol of total haem acquired from a tick blood meal, only about 100 nmol (~1%) needs to be transported to the ovaries within a period of several days.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.016</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Appearance of the tick gut, digest cells, and ovaries from blood- and serum-fed ticks.</title><p>Whole guts from blood-fed (BF) and serum-fed (SF) partially engorged females (fed for 6 days) were dissected and semi-thin sections of digest cells were prepared and stained with toluidine blue.

We found that 5-aminolevulinate synthase, together with the whole cytoplasmic segment of the haem biosynthetic pathway, is completely missing in hard ticks, but is present in other mites. Therefore we hypothesise that during evolution, ticks have lost most of the genes encoding haem biosynthesis as a consequence of their strict haematophagy.</p><p>Only three genes encoding the vestigial mitochondrial enzymes of the haem biosynthetic pathway, namely PPOX, CPOX and FECH, have been retained in the <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gulia-Nuss et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and their orthologues were also identified in midgut and salivary gland transcriptomes of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kotsyfakis et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). PPOX transcripts were also found in salivary gland transcriptomes from various species of the genus <italic>Amblyomma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Karim and Ribeiro, 2015</xref>). The same partial reduction in genomic coding for haem biosynthesis has been reported for a unicellular parasite, <italic>Leishmania major</italic>, in which the intracellular amastigote form expresses an active PPOX that likely sequesters the haem precursor coproporphyrinogen III from the macrophage cytosol to complete synthesis of its endogenous haem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zwerschke et al., 2014</xref>). Another haem auxotroph, the nematode <italic>Brugia malayi</italic>, was suggested to bypass its incomplete haem biosynthetic pathway using tetrapyrrole intermediates from endosymbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wu et al., 2009</xref>). Two lines of evidence suggest that PPOX, CPOX and FECH are not involved in haem biosynthesis in adult ticks: (i) Earlier, it was reported for <italic>R. microplus</italic> that no radioactively labelled δ-aminolevulinic acid was incorporated into haem present in haemolymph and ovaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Braz et al., 1999</xref>); (ii) Recently, we have shown that RNAi-mediated silencing of the terminal FECH did not exert any effect on tick engorgement, oviposition, and larval hatching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hajdusek et al., 2016</xref>). This data suggests that these remnants of the haem biosynthetic pathway in <italic>I. ricinus</italic> do not contribute to the tissue haem pool that sustains successful reproduction. Therefore the reason for retaining genes encoding the last three enzymes of the haem biosynthetic pathway in ticks remains obscure and should undergo further investigation.</p><p>The differential in vitro membrane feeding of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> females on whole blood (BF) or haemoglobin-free serum (SF) allowed us to investigate the importance of haemoglobin acquisition and inter-tissue transport of dietary haem in the hard tick <italic>I. ricinus,</italic> in an as yet unexplored way. These experiments surprisingly revealed that haemoglobin, which makes up about 70% of total blood proteins, is not a necessary source of amino acids for vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, we have unambiguously demonstrated that haem in tick eggs originates entirely from host haemoglobin acquired during female feeding on hosts. Serum-fed <italic>I. ricinus</italic> were capable of full engorgement and oviposition, however embryonal development and larval hatching was aborted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The capability of tick embryos to develop viable progeny could be fully rescued by addition as little as about 1% of the physiological concentration of haemoglobin (0.1% in serum) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to ticks, serum-fed triatomine <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> were capable of laying eggs and giving rise to viable larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machado et al., 1998</xref>). As <italic>Triatominae</italic> insects possess a complete haem biosynthetic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>), they can apparently reproduce even in the absence of dietary haem.</p><p>In the majority of animals studied so far (including insect blood-feeders), haem degradation represents the main source of iron, and conversely, iron is mainly utilised for <italic>de novo</italic> haem biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gozzelino and Soares, 2014</xref>). Although it has been reported that, under certain conditions, haem can be degraded non-enzymatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Atamna and Ginsburg, 1995</xref>), haem degradation-based on haem oxygenase (HO) is the most physiologically relevant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Khan and Quigley, 2011</xref>). We found that the HO gene was missing in the tick genome and correspondingly, the haem degradation product, biliverdin IX, could not be found in <italic>I. ricinus</italic> gut homogenates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). We further noted that the absence of the HO gene is a common feature in other mite genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and respective HO orthologues could not been found even in non-Acari genomes: the chelicerate genome of <italic>Stegodyphus mimosarum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sanggaard et al., 2014</xref>) and the myriapode genome of <italic>Strigamia maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chipman et al., 2014</xref>). The apparent absence of HO transcripts in two color-polymorphic spiders of the genus <italic>Theridion</italic> is in agreement with the notion that these animals do not produce bilin pigments as haem degradation products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croucher et al., 2013</xref>). As HO gene is present in the genomes of Hexapoda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holt et al., 2002</xref>) and Crustacea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colbourne et al., 2011</xref>), we hypothesise that the loss of HO is an old ancestral trait of Chelicerata and Myriapoda that are phylogenetically supported as sister groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dunn et al., 2008</xref>). Such a finding raises the question of dietary iron source for these animals, since iron is an essential electron donor/acceptor involved in vitally important physiological processes such as energy metabolism, DNA replication, and oxygen transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hentze et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Earlier, we and others reported that successful tick development and reproduction is strictly dependent on the availability of iron and maintenance of its systemic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hajdusek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Galay et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that levels of intracellular ferritin, as an indicator of bioavailable iron, as well as the concentration of elemental iron, do not significantly differ in tick tissues dissected from BF and SF females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). These results further support the conclusion that bioavailable iron does not originate from haemoglobin-derived haem, but rather from serum iron-containing proteins, most likely host transferrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hajdusek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mori et al., 2014</xref>). However, an unequivocal identification of the source(s) of bioavailable iron for tick metabolic demands has to await the implementation of a chemically defined artificial tick diet, as recently reported for the mosquito <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Talyuli et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The entire dependence of ticks on haem derived from host haemoglobin underscores the importance of a deeper understanding of haem inter-tissue transport from the site of haemoglobin digestion in the gut to ovaries and other peripheral tissues. In the triatomine bug, <italic>R. prolixus</italic>, a 15-kDa haemolymphatic haem-binding protein (RHBP) was reported to transport haem to pericardial cells for detoxification and to growing oocytes for yolk granules as a source of haem for embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walter-Nuno et al., 2013</xref>). The haem transport and/or binding in ticks is mediated by HeLp/CPs and vitellins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maya-Monteiro et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Logullo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boldbaatar et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Kaufman, 2014</xref>), that belong to the family of large lipid transfer proteins (LLTP) known to facilitate distribution of hydrophobic molecules across circulatory systems of vertebrates, as well as invertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Smolenaars et al., 2007</xref>). Vitellogenins are reported to be expressed only in fertilised fully-fed females, whereas HeLp/CPs are expressed ubiquitously in various stages, including adult males, and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Donohue et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Donohue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Khalil et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith and Kaufman, 2014</xref>). Based on these criteria, we clearly distinguished the <italic>I. ricinus</italic> carrier protein <italic>Ir</italic>CP3 from two vitellogenins, <italic>Ir</italic>Vg1 and <italic>Ir</italic>Vg2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>) and demonstrated that during tick feeding, most haem in haemolymph is bound to <italic>Ir</italic>CP3. The haem is mainly transported to the developing ovaries during the off-host digestive phase, however the proportion of haem transported by <italic>Ir</italic>CP3 or vitellogenins remains to be investigated. In ovaries, haem is sequestered by vitellins serving as haem-storage proteins for embryonal development. Further studies of the native arrangement and haem-binding capabilities of tick vitellins are needed to determine whether one or both vitellin apoproteins are involved in haem binding.</p><p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that ticks lack functional haem biosynthesis, recycle dietary haem originating from digested haemoglobin, and the acquired haem does not contribute to the cellular iron pool. Therefore, haem and iron metabolism in ticks constitute a major departure from its canonical functioning described for other eukaryotic cells, where haem and iron homeostasis is based on balancing the flux between the opposing haem biosynthetic pathway and the HO-based degradative pathway. Further investigations of the exact molecular mechanisms involved in haem inter-tissue transport, intracellular trafficking, and compartmentation within the tick digest cells, promise to identify vulnerable targets in tick haem auxotrophy. This may lead to novel strategies for controlling ticks and the diseases that they transmit.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tick maintenance and natural feeding</title><p>A pathogen-free colony of <italic>Ixodes ricinus</italic> was kept at 24°C and 95% humidity under a15:9-hr day/night regime.

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Haem Acquisition and Distribution in Ticks&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a guest of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While one cannot fail to recognize the large amount of time and effort that went into the work and reviewers appreciate attention to an important topic, a number of substantial concerns were raised. The major and unanimous consensus is that the study, as it currently stands, is premature and that a substantial series of additional experiments will be required to draw meaningful conclusions from the key questions. In particular, experiments concerning the dependency of larval viability solely on haem and non-utilization of haemoglobin haem as a source of iron, as well as roles and relationship of carrier protein and vitellogenin in haem transport or other aspects of tick physiology, require additional critical controls and more careful interpretation of the data. While the <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome is incompletely annotated and data mining efforts possibly require careful extraction and analyses of trace files, there seems to be a missed opportunity in appropriate mapping of the orthologs in the haem biosynthetic pathway. The incomplete bioinformatics analyses thus precluded the formulation of tangible hypotheses, particularly one concerning the evolution of haem auxotrophy in ticks. Finally, the manuscript also needs improvement in textual organization, including with necessary details of certain result and methodological sections. Specific comments from the reviewers are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The haem biosynthetic pathway remains highly conserved across metazoan evolution, although certain eukaryotes, including cattle ticks, were shown to be haem auxotrophs. The current manuscript by Perner et al. extends these observations by identifying haem auxotrophy in another major tick vector, Ixodes spp., that transmits a number of human infections. The approaches are ingenious, and the manuscript contains much important information regarding haem and iron homeostasis in an important disease vector. However, much of the data could be improved upon to present more compelling evidence to support the authors' major conclusions, which are noted below.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) Paragraph one, subheading “Host blood haemoglobin is expendable for tick feeding and oviposition but essential for reproduction”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: What is truly interesting about this work is that haem seems to play a critical role in tick reproductive physiology. This speculation is derived from the key finding that unlike with blood, ticks fed on serum are unable to give rise to larvae. However, serum-fed ticks are not only deprived of hemoglobin from RBCs but also lack many other cellular/molecular components present in the blood. If haem is indeed the blood factor (absent in serum-fed ticks) that resulted in reproduction defects, then the authors could restore these defects with biochemical complementation by adding physiological concentrations of haem (or hemoglobin) to the serum used for tick feeding. This is a critical experiment that needs to be performed to support the authors' major conclusion.</p><p>2) Paragraph one, subheading “Haemoglobin is an indispensable source of haem, replaceable source of amino acids, and not a source of iron for ticks”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The proposition that haemoglobin is not a source of iron for ticks is another novel aspect of the study. However, the conclusion is based on indirect evidence that needs to be further substantiated. Iron concentration could be measured in tick tissues. The authors need to show that the amount of non-haem (serum) iron in blood-fed ticks is comparable to that of the total iron in serum-fed ticks.</p><p>3) The Method/Results section relevant to the in vitro membrane feeding system is severely deficient in details that would permit other labs to reproduce the work. The authors should mention the differences (in any) in feeding time, engorgement rates, percentage of egg-laying females in comparing blood with serum feeding. This would suggest how serum feeding impacts tick engorgement, growth, and embryogenesis.</p><p>4) The defect in larval hatching for serum-fed ticks is an interesting finding that also lack details and should be elaborated further. No evidence is provided other than an undefined image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom right panel) and a statement &quot;[…]whereas no larvae hatched out of SF ticks' eggs&quot;. If these represent immature eggs, at least a thorough histological analysis would be useful.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The main conclusions the authors draw are that 1) the tick <italic>I. ricinus</italic> is an obligate heme auxotroph and relies on hemoglobin from blood meals as a heme source; 2) Hemoglobin heme is not utilized as an iron source; 3) CP3 (HeLP) is the main hemoprotein in the hemolymph while vitellins bind heme in the ovaries. While the reliance on the hematocrit for larval viability is clear, it is not shown that this is specifically due to heme. While Hb heme may not be the preferred source of free-iron under normal conditions, mechanisms may exist to utilize heme as an iron source when iron becomes limiting. Finally, the requirement for CP3, Vg1, and Vg2 for inter-tissue heme transport or heme-dependent viability is poorly demonstrated, and maybe this is due to a lack of tractability of the tick model. In summary, new data are essential to support the major conclusions in this manuscript.</p><p>Major comments</p><p>1) While the authors show that blood cells are required for larval viability, it is not conclusively shown that this is heme-dependent. Exogenous heme can easily be added back into serum to establish whether hatching of progeny can be rescued, showing this phenotype is specifically due to a lack of heme and not due to another components of the hematocrit. Additionally, the efficiency of ferrochelatase knockdown is not shown. Protoporphyrin IX and iron can be added back to the serum to analyze whether the ferrochelatase is truly functional and lysates can be directly analyzed for FECH activity.</p><p>2) Genomic analyses and measuring ferritin levels is not sufficient to say the tick has no mechanism for removing iron from heme. There are examples of non-canonical heme oxygenases, for example in bacteria. To more definitively show that heme can utilized as an iron source, iron and heme-free serum should be supplemented with iron, heme, or both and then measurements of non-heme vs heme iron be performed in various tissues. Since HPLC data are already shown for heme levels, a direct measurement of heme degradation products / biliverdin can be made by HPLC. Changes in Ferritin levels are not a great indicator of iron levels, as mammalian Ftns are also acute phase proteins. Is Fer1/2 regulated by stress as by heme starvation?</p><p>3) The functional relationship between the homologs CP3, Vg1 and Vg2 is unclear. It is postulated that CP3 is the main heme carrier protein in the hemolymph but the reduction in heme content in eggs is minimal when CP3 is knocked-down, and it is not shown whether viable larvae arise from these eggs. If developing embryos are completely reliant on maternally-derived heme, there must be another mechanism for maternal heme delivery to ovaries. Does the <italic>ricinus</italic> genome code for additional CPs like scapulus? Additionally, if Vg1 and Vg2 bind heme after heme deposition in the ovaries, why would knockdown result in reduced heme in this tissue? What happens to intestinal heme content when CP3, Vg1 and Vg2 are knocked down? One might expect heme accumulation in the intestine or hemolymph if a heme carrier is depleted, depending on which tissue the carrier protein acquires heme.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper &quot;Haem Acquisition and Distribution in Ticks&quot; by Perner et al. describes and functionally dissects heme metabolic pathway in tick <italic>Ixoides scapularis</italic> and <italic>I. ricinus</italic> using combination of genomic analysis and manipulative experiments. Authors develop an evolutionary scenario explaining heme metabolism that would support changes in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> and <italic>I. ricinus</italic> genome reflecting gene loss in heme synthesis and heme catabolism pathway.</p><p>Although manipulative experiments are elaborate and describe the transport of heme to the eggs, evolutionary scenario suffers from incompleteness.</p><p>First, it is known that the genome of <italic>Ixoides scapularis</italic> is not completely finished and is not annotated at the level representing the standard in the field.</p><p>Authors claim that they mapped orthologs of heme biosynthetic pathway in <italic>I. scapularis</italic>. However, in their Material and Methods section they do not describe how they performed their analysis. They claim that only two genes in heme biosynthetic pathway exist in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome, namely: &quot;coproporphyrinogen oxidase [Vectorbase: ISCW010977] and ferrochelatase [Vectorbase: ISCW016187], were identified in the <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.&quot; They state that other genes including aminolevulinic acid synthase, porphobilinogen synthase, hydroxymethylbilane synthase, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, uroporphyrinogen III synthase, uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase and protoporphyrinogen oxidase that are part of heme biosintethic pathway are not present in the genome stating: &quot;Data mining of the available <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome revealed the absence of six out of eight conserved enzymes involved in haem biosynthesis in most eukaryotes.&quot; However, when the reviewer examined orthologs of listed genes in heme biosynthetic pathway from related chelicerate genome (two spotted spider mite, <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic>: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/Tetur;">http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/orcae/overview/Tetur;</ext-link> Grbic et al. 2011), isolated first by blasting spider mite proteome with <italic>Drosophila</italic> heme synthesis ortologs, contrary to the claim of authors following <italic>I. scapularis</italic> possible ortologs were found in the genome:</p><p>1) aminolevulinic acid synthase (using <italic>T.</italic> urticae ortolog tetur32g00320):</p><p>ISCW020754-PA 268 E-value: 1e-88</p><p>Identities = 130/263 (49%), Positives = 180/263 (68%), Gaps = 2/263 (1%)</p><p>2) uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (using <italic>T. urticae</italic> ortolog tetur19g03090)</p><p>ISCW020804-PA 215 E-value 3e-68</p><p>Identities = 125/336 (37%), Positives = 200/336 (60%), Gaps = 12/336 (4%)</p><p>3) protoporphyrinogen oxidase (using <italic>T. urticae</italic> ortolog tetur10g04900)</p><p>ISCW023396-PA protoporphyrinogen oxidase, putative|protein_cod… 55.3 1e-09</p><p>Identities = 36/105 (34%), Positives = 56/105 (53%), Gaps = 4/105 (4%)</p><p>Thus, 3 out of six genes claimed to be absent appear to be present in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome. Having in mind that all of listed genes were incompletely predicted and supported by few RNAseq (please compare <italic>T. urticae</italic> homologs) it cannot be excluded that the remaining 3 genes are present but in the portion of <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome that has not been completed or not well annotated.</p><p>This should provide just a guidance and authors should confirm all these cases by proper alignment etc.</p><p>Also authors propose the scenario that loss of heme oxygenase represents specific feature of ticks as adaptation on heme-rich diet: &quot;Therefore, we speculate that lack of haem oxygenase in ticks presents another unique feature of their adaptation to the haem-rich diet. This constitutes a major departure from the canonical functioning of haem and iron metabolism described for other eukaryotic cells, where haem and iron homeostasis is based on balancing flux between the opposing haem synthesis pathway and the haem oxygenase degradation pathway.</p><p>Authors conclude that &quot;The lack of haem catabolism given the absence of haem oxygenase apparently presents another unique feature of tick adaptation to the haem-rich diet.&quot;</p><p>The quick analysis of <italic>T. urticae</italic> genome shows that this species also lack heme oxygenase.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a guest member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>The newly resubmitted manuscript addressed a number of important issues brought up during the original review. While all reviewers agreed that there is a substantial improvement in the quality of the data and their presentation, and that this is a fascinating study, a number of substantial concerns were raised, most of which require major editorial revision of the manuscript. Specific comments from the reviewers that require your attention are appended below.</p><p>1) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> suggest critical involvement of hemoglobin in tick development. As the manuscript discuss heme auxotrophy, please clarify why reconstitution experiments involved supplementation of hemoglobin, rather than heme, to the SF media. Also clarify whether there is a correlation between numbers of live/hatched progeny with heme concentration. This is important because low heme may support hatching of larvae in the initial stages but may not be able to keep up as embryos utilize the limited supply of heme, as demonstrated by a previous article by Walter-Nuno et al., JBC 2013.</p><p>2) Perhaps the most interesting discovery here is that hemoglobin is required for embryo viability without serving as an iron or as an amino acid source. Then why is Hb required? Some additional experimentation could be conducted with their in vitro membrane feeding system, for example, adding other globular proteins or myoglobin to determine more specifically why Hb is required.</p><p>3) The proper way to determine whether a heme degradation system exists is to first deplete all sources of inorganic iron followed by supplementation of varying concentrations of heme as the sole iron source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Under these conditions, it is possible that ticks may be able to degrade heme to acquire iron. This result will indicate that heme degradation is conditional and induced when iron is limiting and that a non-canonical enzyme might be performing this function (as is found in several bacteria). Please clarify and discuss these possibilities.</p><p>4) The AAS result does not distinguish whether the iron was derived from Hb or other serum components (such as Tf). The result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> is just suggestive, because SF conditions have the same iron and BF. Again, the only way to demonstrate this is to remove all sources of heme and inorganic iron followed by titrating heme and/or iron back.</p><p>5) Please clarify this statement &quot;an efficient inter-tissue heme distribution system&quot;, when only 100 nmol of heme is being utilized from a blood meal to be transported to the ovaries. What was the method used to measure this?</p><p>6) The authors should discuss why the ticks have retained the last three enzymes in heme biosynthesis – could these enzymes serve another function? Could heme precursors from the host enter into this partial pathway? What is their expression over the course of tick feeding and development? Please refer to whether any of these genes (transcripts) were identified in published studies (especially recent RNA-Seq studies) involving Ixodes ticks.</p><p>7) The authors should provide some possibilities for where egg Fe is coming from if not Hb. They suggest other serum proteins such as transferrin. Could they test this by manipulating transferrin content in their in vitro assay?</p><p>8) The hypothesis stating that hemoglobin and serum proteins are endocytosed within gut cells via distinct mechanisms is not supported by solid experimental data, so please modify the statement.</p><p>9) Please clarify the statement &quot;These results collectively show that vitellins are the major haemoproteins&quot;. Does vitellin actually function with heme bound, or is it a storage molecule for heme?</p><p>10) The authors say &quot;these experiments revealed that haemoglobin was, surprisingly, not strictly required as a source of amino acids for vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).&quot; Please clarify why this is surprising.</p><p>Finally, the discussion needs to be more cohesive and better link various results on tick metabolism and development into one complete story.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p> <italic>While one cannot fail to recognize the large amount of time and effort that went into the work and reviewers appreciate attention to an important topic, a number of substantial concerns were raised. […] Specific comments from the reviewers are appended below.</italic> </p><p>Summary of the major changes, new data, and additional experiments carried out to improve the merit of our work presented in the new manuscript.</p><p>1) Data mining</p><p>In addition to the tick <italic>Ixodes scapularis</italic> genome, the genome-wide search has been performed in available genomes of other related mites namely the herbivorous mite <italic>Tetranychus urticae</italic> and the predatory mite <italic>Metaseiulus occidentalis.</italic> This mining, completed by a detailed phylogenetic analysis, confirmed that while non-hematophagous mites contain all genes coding for complete haem biosynthesis, the <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome has retained only three genes encoding vestigial mitochondrial enzymes of haem biosynthesis, namely coproporphyrinogen-III oxidase (CPOX), protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX) and ferrochelatase (FECH). Two other genes present in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome: δ- aminolevulinic acid synthase (ALAS) and uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase (UROD) are clearly of bacterial origin.</p><p>Another new discovery made by the genome wide searches was that gene coding for haem oxygenase is commonly missing also in other mites and possibly in chelicerates and myriapodes in general.</p><p>Therefore, we conclude that lack of haem oxygenase in ticks is not likely an evolutionary adaptation to the blood-feeding but rather an old ancestral trait of the last common ancestor of Chelicerata and Myriapoda.</p><p>2) Membrane feeding and rescue experiments</p><p>In-vitro membrane feeding of <italic>I. ricinus</italic> females was complemented by a rescue experiment performed by addition of different concentration of commercial bovine haemoglobin to the serum diet.</p><p>This conclusively confirmed that dietary haemoglobin is essential as a source of haem for embryonic development and tick reproduction. Full rescue of fertility is obtained with less than 1% of the physiological concentration of hemoglobin in blood.Under this condition, where haemoglobin contribution as an amino acid source is negligible, a significant amount of haem is still transferred to the eggs allowing normal embryo development. The embryonic development in tick eggs was examined by microscopy and the results are included in relevant figures.</p><p>3) The iron-level analysis in tick tissues</p><p>The analysis of elemental iron in tick peripheral tisssues was performed by a highly sensitive method of graphite-furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy (GF AAS) that allows determination of elemental iron concentration in a sub-milligram range of starting biological material (as is the case of pooled and dried tick tissues). Since GF AAS cannot distinguish between haem and non-haem iron, only ovaries and salivary glands dissected from partially engorged BF or SF ticks were analysed. The obtained results confirmed the previous data based on quantitative monitoring of ferritin 1 levels in tick tissues proving that haem is not a source of bioavailable iron for ticks.</p><p>4) Lack of haem oxygenase was confirmed by HPLC analysis of heam-derived pigments</p><p>In order to provide a stronger evidence that haem is not catabolised in ticks, we have adapted an HPLC method for detection of biliverdin IX in the tick gut homogenates. This analysis confirmed that no haem degradation product was present in the guts of fully engorged ticks, while we could detect biglutaminyl-biliverdin IX metabolite in homogenates from blood-fed mosquitoes, used as a positive control.</p><p>5) Removal of ferrochelatase functional assessment by RNAi</p><p>Data showing that RNAi-silencing of ferrochelatase had no effect on tick feeding success, oviposition, and reproduction, raised another questions about its physiological role, that we were not able to answer. As we felt that these data were contributing to a loss of focus on the main conclusions of this work, we used them in another manuscript with a distinct focus(Hajdusek et al. “Tick iron and heme metabolism -- new target for an anti-tick intervention”, currently under revision). We refer to these results in the Discussion with a tentative reference as (Hajdusek et al., submitted manuscript).</p><p>6) The manuscript was largely re-written to improve the overall readability, figures re-arranged to include new data, and the obtained results accordingly re-interpreted.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Major concerns:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Paragraph one, subheading “Host blood haemoglobin is expendable for tick feeding and oviposition but essential for reproduction”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>: What is truly interesting about this work is that haem seems to play a critical role in tick reproductive physiology. This speculation is derived from the key finding that unlike with blood, ticks fed on serum are unable to give rise to larvae. However, serum-fed ticks are not only deprived of hemoglobin from RBCs but also lack many other cellular/molecular components present in the blood. If haem is indeed the blood factor (absent in serum-fed ticks) that resulted in reproduction defects, then the authors could restore these defects with biochemical complementation by adding physiological concentrations of haem (or hemoglobin) to the serum used for tick feeding. This is a critical experiment that needs to be performed to support the authors' major conclusion.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the lack of experiment with addition of haem or haemoglobin into the serum diet to rescue tick reproduction was a critical drawback. We performed this experiment with addition of physiological concentration (10%) of pure bovine haemoglobin and demonstrated that the embryonic development and larvae hatching was fully restored (see bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, we performed this experiment with sub-physiological concentrations of haemoglobin (1% and 0.1%) and could demonstrate that as little as about one hundredth of haemoglobin levels in tick diet is sufficient to sustain their reproduction. We agree with the reviewer that supplementation the serum with haem (haemin) would be interesting. However, such an experiment requires a demanding optimization because of haem binding capacity of serum proteins (e.g. haemopexin, albumin).</p><p>Therefore simple addition of haemin into serum may lead to artefactual results which would be difficult to interpret.</p><p> <italic>2) Paragraph one, subheading “Haemoglobin is an indispensable source of haem, replaceable source of amino acids, and not a source of iron for ticks”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>: The proposition that haemoglobin is not a source of iron for ticks is another novel aspect of the study. However, the conclusion is based on indirect evidence that needs to be further substantiated. Iron concentration could be measured in tick tissues. The authors need to show that the amount of non-haem (serum) iron in blood-fed ticks is comparable to that of the total iron in serum-fed ticks.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the proof of bio-available iron content based on monitoring intracellular ferritin (Fer1) in tissues (such as used in our previous work, Hajdusek et al., PNAS, 2009) is indirect and requires substantiation. Therefore, we performed a determination of total elemental iron in tick tissues by GF AAS (see above, paragraph 3). This analysis confirmed that, apart from bioavailable iron, there is also no significant difference in levels of elemental iron in tissues from BF and SF ticks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p> <italic>3) The Method/Results section relevant to the in vitro membrane feeding system is severely deficient in details that would permit other labs to reproduce the work. The authors should mention the differences (in any) in feeding time, engorgement rates, percentage of egg-laying females in comparing blood with serum feeding. This would suggest how serum feeding impacts tick engorgement, growth, and embryogenesis.</italic> </p><p>There were no obvious differences in the time-course of membrane feeding, feeding success, weights of engorged females and egg clutches sizes between BF and SF ticks. These experiments were repeated many times with reproducible results (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref> below).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.026</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Table 1: Overview of the feeding and egg laying parameters of membrane-fed <italic>I. ricinus</italic> females.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12318.026">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12318.026</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-12318-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p> <italic>4) The defect in larval hatching for serum-fed ticks is an interesting finding that also lack details and should be elaborated further. No evidence is provided other than an undefined image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom right panel) and a statement &quot;[…]whereas no larvae hatched out of SF ticks' eggs&quot;. If these represent immature eggs, at least a thorough histological analysis would be useful.</italic> </p><p>We agree that our previous statement that “no larvae hatched out of eggs laid by SF ticks” was insufficient as a proof of impaired tick reproduction. Therefore, we performed a light microscopic examination of developing embryos in eggs laid by BF- and SF- ticks, as well as in the rescue experiment with different amount of haemoglobin in the serum diet (S+Hb ticks). We noted that embryonic development was blocked only in eggs from SF ticks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>Major comments</italic> </p><p><italic>1) While the authors show that blood cells are required for larval viability, it is not conclusively shown that this is heme-dependent. Exogenous heme can easily be added back into serum to establish whether hatching of progeny can be rescued, showing this phenotype is specifically due to a lack of heme and not due to another components of the hematocrit. Additionally, the efficiency of ferrochelatase knockdown is not shown. Protoporphyrin IX and iron can be added back to the serum to analyze whether the ferrochelatase is truly functional and lysates can be directly analyzed for FECH activity.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the ideas of the reviewer how to proof the lack of haem biosynthesis in ticks. However, addition of just soluble haemin or haem precursor into the diet is a kind of oversimplification that does not take in account the complexity of tick digestive system. Haem is released from digested haemoglobin inside the digestive vesicles of the tick gut digest cells after its receptor-mediated endocytosis involving clathrin-coated pits. Therefore we used for the rescue experiment the pure commercial haemoglobin to demonstrate that haemoglobin alone (together with other serum components) and no other component of the red blood cells is required for successful tick reproduction. The consequence ‘no haemoglobin in the diet – no haem in eggs – no embryonic development’ is to our opinion a strong evidence that haem needed for tick reproduction originates exclusively from the host haemoglobin. Certainly, we cannot completely rule out that haem might be provided from other resources during the whole developmental cycle of the hard ticks, especially during the long inter-stage periods of starvation.</p><p>In the previous manuscript, the efficiency of ferrochelatase knockdown by RNAi was shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, panel D. The information that ferrochelatase RNAi had no obvious effect on tick fecundity was included among screening of other genes/proteins possibly playing a role in tick haem and iron metabolism and was recently submitted to another journal. As mentioned above, this part was completely removed from the current version of the manuscript and we only refer to this result in the Discussion to support the conclusion that the retained haem biosynthetic genes do not play a role in the synthesis of endogenous haem in adult ticks.</p><p><italic>2) Genomic analyses and measuring ferritin levels is not sufficient to say the tick has no mechanism for removing iron from heme. There are examples of non-canonical heme oxygenases, for example in bacteria. To more definitively show that heme can utilized as an iron source, iron and heme-free serum should be supplemented with iron, heme, or both and then measurements of non-heme vs heme iron be performed in various tissues. Since HPLC data are already shown for heme levels, a direct measurement of heme degradation products / biliverdin can be made by HPLC. Changes in Ferritin levels are not a great indicator of iron levels, as mammalian Ftns are also acute phase proteins. Is Fer1/2 regulated by stress as by heme starvation?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that determination of bio-available iron by monitoring levels of intracellular ferritin 1 is only indirect proof of the lack of haem catabolism in ticks. Therefore, we performed additional experiments based on determination of elemental iron in tick tissues by GF-AAS (see above the paragraph 3 and response to the Reviewer #1, Major concern 2). Obtained results confirmed that iron levels in tick tissues are independent on the haemoglobin presence in tick diet.</p><p>Additional HPLC analysis of tick gut extract (see the paragraph 4 above) confirmed the absence haem- derived biliverdin in line with our previous hypothesis that lack of haem oxygenase in ticks is associated with the need to obtain iron from serum components and not from haem.</p><p><italic>3) The functional relationship between the homologs CP3, Vg1 and Vg2 is unclear. It is postulated that CP3 is the main heme carrier protein in the hemolymph but the reduction in heme content in eggs is minimal when CP3 is knocked-down, and it is not shown whether viable larvae arise from these eggs. If developing embryos are completely reliant on maternally-derived heme, there must be another mechanism for maternal heme delivery to ovaries. Does the ricinus genome code for additional CPs like scapulus? Additionally, if Vg1 and Vg2 bind heme after heme deposition in the ovaries, why would knockdown result in reduced heme in this tissue? What happens to intestinal heme content when CP3, Vg1 and Vg2 are knocked down? One might expect heme accumulation in the intestine or hemolymph if a heme carrier is depleted, depending on which tissue the carrier protein acquires heme.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that the relation between the haem-binding lipoproteins might seem unclear. In order to distinguish these two groups of lipoproteins, the knowledge of their stage and tissue expression profiles is needed. RNAi-mediated silencing of IrCP3 led to about 80% reduction of IrCP3 in tick haemolymph and only to about 50% reduction of haem in laid eggs. This can be explained either by the incomplete depletion of IrCP3 from tick haemolymph in KD ticks or by contribution of other CPs homologues possibly present in <italic>I. ricinus</italic> haemolymph. Alternatively, the haem transporting role is taken over by vitellogenins which presence in ovaries coincides with appearance of haem. Since we are aware about the uncertainty behind the haem inter-tissue transport in ticks, we interpret our obtained results in a more careful way and leave the ultimate answers to our future research. Here, we present only the unambiguous results: IrCP3 is the main haem-binding protein in <italic>I. ricinus</italic> haemolymph while vitellins are the main haem-binding protein in the ovaries.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p> <italic>Although manipulative experiments are elaborate and describe the transport of heme to the eggs, evolutionary scenario suffers from incompleteness.</italic> </p><p> <italic>First, it is known that the genome of Ixoides scapularis is not completely finished and is not annotated at the level representing the standard in the field.listed genes were incompletely predicted and supported by few RNAseq (please compare T. urticae homologs) it cannot be excluded that the remaining 3 genes are present but in the portion of I. scapularis genome that has not been completed or not well annotated.</italic> </p><p> <italic>This should provide just a guidance and authors should confirm all these cases by proper alignment etc.</italic> </p><p><italic>[...] Thus, an additional analysis and re-interpretation of data is necessary to support major conclusions of this paper.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for his/her guide and advice regarding the mapping the haem biosynthetic pathway in <italic>I. scapularis</italic> using the orthologues from another mite, namely <italic>T. urticae</italic>. We agree that <italic>I. scapularis</italic> genome is still not perfectly annotated and contains a lot of gaps. In the previous manuscript, we only referred to the genes of haem biosynthetic pathway present in the KEGG database. Based on the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed a much more detailed data mining and BLAST analyses in available mite genomes as described in the paragraph 1 of this appendix.</p><p>Moreover, we confirmed transcripts of identified genes sequences by finding the corresponding orthologues in <italic>I. ricinus</italic> tissue transcriptomes. This led to additional identification of PPOX as a third gene of the tick haem biosynthetic pathway that was not revealed by KEGG. The reviewer found also other two genes related to <italic>T. urticae</italic> ALAS and UROD. Our phylogenetic analysis unambiguously revealed that these two genes are of bacterial origin.</p><p>A great hint from the reviewer #3 was the note about the lack of haem oxygenase (HO) in <italic>T. urticae</italic>. We further confirmed that absence of HO is a common feature among other Acari. This certainly makes indefensible our previous hypothesis that lack of HO presents another feature of tick adaptation to the haem-rich diet. In the light of a general absence of HO in Acari genomes, we may rather speculate that the inability to acquire iron from haem pushed the tick ancestor into haematophagy, and allowed the loss of haem synthesis as HO-mediated haem degradation is the major source of iron in most organisms studied up to now.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><p><italic>1) Data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> suggest critical involvement of hemoglobin in tick development. As the manuscript discuss heme auxotrophy, please clarify why reconstitution experiments involved supplementation of hemoglobin, rather than heme, to the SF media. Also clarify whether there is a correlation between numbers of live/hatched progeny with heme concentration. This is important because low heme may support hatching of larvae in the initial stages but may not be able to keep up as embryos utilize the limited supply of heme, as demonstrated by a previous article by Walter-Nuno et al., JBC 2013.</italic> </p><p>Supplementation of serum with haemin (soluble haem chloride) instead of haemoglobin (Hb) would be a more straightforward rescue experiment. However, addition of haemin into the diet is a non-physiological over-simplification that does not take into account the complexity of the tick digestive system. Unlike haematophagous insects, ticks digest blood meal intracellularly and haem is released from digested haemoglobin inside the digestive (lysosome-like) vesicles of the tick gut digest cells. This was the main reason why we performed the rescue experiment using pure commercial haemoglobin. Consequently, ‘no haemoglobin in the diet – no haem in the eggs – no embryonic development’ is, in our opinion, strong enough evidence that haem needed for tick reproduction originates exclusively from host haemoglobin and no other component of the host blood.</p><p>Irrespective of these considerations, we tried to verify what would happen if ticks were fed on serum supplemented with haemin, as suggested by the reviewer. Therefore, we performed the experiment as suggested by the reviewer. We prepared diets with 625µM (HH – high haemin) and 62.5µM (LH – low haemin) haemin in the serum, corresponding to a concentration of 1% and 0.1% w/v haemoglobin, respectively. Ticks were fed for the first five days on pure serum and from day 6, they received haemin-supplemented sera. Ticks were able to fully engorge and lay eggs under both conditions. Laid eggs were used for determination of haem concentrations by HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>). Interestingly, haem concentrations were about the same in eggs from HH- and LH-fed females. We have no clear interpretation of this result. We assume that haemin uptake might be facilitated through haem-binding serum proteins (e.g. albumin, haemopexin). Similar haem concentrations in egg clutches of HH and LH ticks may be attributed to limited haem-binding capacity of serum proteins.</p><p>A quantitative correlation between haemoglobin (haem) concentration in the diet and the number of hatched living larvae is quite difficult to determine. We routinely estimate the larval hatching rate by crosses +, ++, and +++ for low, medium, and high numbers, respectively. There is great variability in larval numbers, even for naturally fed ticks, and we further noted that there are also seasonal variations in clutch sizes and the time needed for larval hatching. Therefore, it is not feasible to reliably evaluate differences in hatching from in vitro fed females in relation to haemoglobin concentrations over a reasonable time frame.</p><p>In the case of the triatominae bug <italic>Rhodnius prolixus</italic> mentioned by the reviewer, RNAi-mediated silencing of haemolymphatic haem-binding protein (RHBP) resulted in the laying of viable red eggs and non-viable white eggs in earlier and later stages of oviposition, respectively (Walter-Nuno et al., 2013). In contrast, ticks fed on different haemoglobin/haemin concentrations laid fairly homogenously colored clutches of eggs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>). To this end, we did not observe any obvious difference in larval hatching from individual parts of any egg clutch.</p><p><italic>2) Perhaps the most interesting discovery here is that hemoglobin is required for embryo viability without serving as an iron or as an amino acid source. Then why is Hb required? Some additional experimentation could be conducted with their in vitro membrane feeding system, for example, adding other globular proteins or myoglobin to determine more specifically why Hb is required.</italic> </p><p>We believe that we have sufficiently demonstrated in our manuscript that haemoglobin is strictly required only as a source of haem needed as the prosthetic group for endogenous haemoproteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Nevertheless, we thank the reviewer for his/her proposal to perform an additional experiment to replace haemoglobin with myoglobin in the diet. Despite this non-physiological situation, it appears that ticks, indeed, are capable of acquiring haem from myoglobin and can transport it to the developing oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>). As in the case of haemin, it is not clear whether the uptake of myoglobin by tick digestive cells follows the proposed haemoglobin pathway via the putative specific receptor-mediated endocytosis or is absorbed non-specifically by fluid-phase pinocytosis proposed for serum proteins. Further studies are planned to answer this question.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.027</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental feeding in vitro of <italic>I.</italic> ricinus females on serum supplemented with myoglobin or haemin.</title><p>Ticks were membrane fed in vitro on bovine serum (S).

Under these conditions, it is possible that ticks may be able to degrade heme to acquire iron. This result will indicate that heme degradation is conditional and induced when iron is limiting and that a non-canonical enzyme might be performing this function (as is found in several bacteria). Please clarify and discuss these possibilities.</italic> </p><p>This is definitely a correct suggestion, but unfortunately unfeasible under the current state-of-the-art of tick artificial feeding. Our efforts to manipulate the serum diet usually resulted in a failure of tick feeding. For instance, ticks do not feed on serum that has been dialyzed (removal of low molecular weight components). On the other hand, ticks can be partially fed on a serum ultrafiltrate (&lt; 3 kDa), however they do not commence the rapid engorgement (‘big sip‘) phase in the absence of serum proteins. Hence, we have so far failed to establish conditions of limited iron supply in the tick diet. Currently, implementation of a defined artificial tick diet, similar to that found for <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic> (Talyuli et al., 2015), seems to be the only way to experimentally approach the question of the source of iron and other essential nutritional components.</p><p><italic>4) The AAS result does not distinguish whether the iron was derived from Hb or other serum components (such as Tf). The result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> is just suggestive, because SF conditions have the same iron and BF. Again, the only way to demonstrate this is to remove all sources of heme and inorganic iron followed by titrating heme and/or iron back.</italic> </p><p>We believe that this comment probably resulted from our unclear explanation of the experiment shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Exactly because AAS is not able to distinguish between haem and non-haem iron, we chose to measure total iron in peripheral tissues (ovaries and salivary glands) dissected from semi-engorged females where still no haem is transferred to ovaries. If iron transported to these peripheral tissues by secreted ferritin 2 (Hajdusek et al., 2009) originated from haem degradation in guts, one should expect that the amount of iron in tissues from BF ticks would be much higher than found in SF ticks. Our AAS analysis therefore, excluded this hypothesis, providing additional evidence that haem is not a source of bioavailable iron in ticks. We have modified the corresponding sentence in Results to better clarify the rationale of this experiment:</p><p>“As this method is not able to distinguish between iron of haem and non-haem origin, only salivary glands and ovaries dissected from partially engorged BF and SF ticks were used for the analysis to avoid distortions caused by the presence of haemoglobin in the samples”.</p><p><italic>5) Please clarify this statement &quot;an efficient inter-tissue heme distribution system&quot;, when only 100 nmol of heme is being utilized from a blood meal to be transported to the ovaries. What was the method used to measure this?</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the obvious contradiction in this sentence. We have re-phrased it accordingly:</p><p>“We estimate that out of approximately 10 µmol of total haem acquired from a tick blood meal, only about 100 nmol (~1%) needs to be transported to the ovaries within a period of several days[…]”</p><p>Our estimation of the quantity of total haem acquired from a blood meal (~10 µmol) was based on the following calculation: A fully engorged female imbibes approximately 1 ml of blood meal containing ~150 mg haemoglobin (2.32 µmol) and each haemoglobin molecule contains four haem rings (~10 µmol). The average haem content in eggs from ticks fed on whole blood was approximately 600 pmol/mg, which, when multiplied by the weight of a typical egg clutch (100–150 mg) yields 100 nmol of haem.</p><p><italic>6) The authors should discuss why the ticks have retained the last three enzymes in heme biosynthesis – could these enzymes serve another function? Could heme precursors from the host enter into this partial pathway? What is their expression over the course of tick feeding and development? Please refer to whether any of these genes (transcripts) were identified in published studies (especially recent RNA-Seq studies) involving Ixodes ticks.</italic> </p><p>We have examined the available RNA-Seq data from <italic>I. ricinus</italic> salivary glands and midgut transcriptomes (Kotsyfakis et al., 2015) and found that <italic>ir-cpox, ir-ppox</italic> and <italic>ir-fech</italic> are indeed expressed in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 3A</xref>).

They suggest other serum proteins such as transferrin. Could they test this by manipulating transferrin content in their in vitro assay?</italic> </p><p>As already mentioned in our response to point 2, we could not find any way to deplete transferrin from bovine serum without the manipulation leading to a failure of tick feeding. Instead, we increased the amount of transferrin in bovine serum by addition of 3 mg/ml of commercially available holo-transferrin. Addition of this iron-saturated transferrin to the serum diet led to a corresponding increase in intestinal ferritin 1 used for monitoring the levels of bioavailable iron, as described earlier (Hajdusek et al., 2009) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 4</xref>). This experiment indicates that ticks are indeed capable of acquiring iron from host transferrin. However, it is still not clear whether the host transferrin is the exclusive source of bioavailable iron for ticks. Answering this question on the source of iron for ticks lacking the haem oxygenase gene is a challenging task for our future research, possibly based on using defined artificial diets as discussed in our response to point 3.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12318.029</object-id><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Increased transferrin levels in serum led to higher levels of ferritin 1 in tick gut.</title><p>Ticks were fed on serum or on serum supplemented with 3 mg/ml of bovine holo-Transferrin (Sigma, T1283).

Also the haemoglobin receptor expected to be present on tick digest cells has not yet been identified. Due to the uncertainty in this matter, the corresponding part of the text was removed from the Discussion.</p><p><italic>9) Please clarify the statement &quot;These results collectively show that vitellins are the major haemoproteins&quot;. Does vitellin actually function with heme bound, or is it a storage molecule for heme?</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that vitellins are not haemoproteins in the strict sense as they apparently do not need haem as a prosthetic group for their function. The same is true for HeLp, the haemo-lipoprotein in tick hemolymph <italic>Ir</italic>CP3. Given their lipophilic character, these low-density lipoproteins function as haem scavengers, and most-likely as transporters and storage proteins for insoluble haem. Based on this, we replaced the term ‘haemoprotein’ by the term ‘haem-binding proteins’ where appropriate.</p><p><italic>10) The authors say &quot;these experiments revealed that haemoglobin was, surprisingly, not strictly required as a source of amino acids for vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).&quot; Please clarify why this is surprising.</italic> </p><p>Based on the fact that haemoglobin makes up about 70% of total blood proteins, it has long been assumed that haemoglobin was an indispensable source of amino acids for the production of yolk proteins. For this reason, our research over the past decade was focused mainly on haemoglobin digestion as a potential target for anti-tick intervention. However, the results presented in this work show that ticks can produce an equal amount of vitellogenins and eggs even in the absence of haemoglobin. In order to make this surprising result more obvious we changed the corresponding sentence in the following way (see lines 264‒266) ‘These experiments surprisingly revealed that haemoglobin, which makes up about 70% of total blood proteins, is not a necessary source of amino acids for vitellogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)”.</p><p><italic>Finally, the discussion needs to be more cohesive and better link various results on tick metabolism and development into one complete story.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for this helpful suggestion. We have removed some parts that were not tightly associated with our results and that possibly would be more appropriate to be discussed in a review article concerning other haem auxotrophic organisms. We believe that the discussion is now more focused on blood-feeding arthropods without losing general interest for other biologists.</p></body></sub-article></article>
