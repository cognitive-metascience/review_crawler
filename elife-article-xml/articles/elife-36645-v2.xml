contacts that contribute to metastasis. Solid tumors are characterized by an acidic extracellular medium. We intend to take advantage of this tumor feature to design new molecules that specifically target tumors. We created a novel pH-dependent transmembrane peptide, TYPE7, by altering the sequence of the transmembrane domain of EphA2. TYPE7 is highly soluble and interacts with the surface of lipid membranes at neutral pH, while acidity triggers transmembrane insertion. TYPE7 binds to endogenous EphA2 and reduces Akt phosphorylation and cell migration as effectively as ephrinA1. Interestingly, we found large differences in juxtamembrane tyrosine phosphorylation and the extent of EphA2 clustering when comparing TYPE7 with activation by ephrinA1. This work shows that it is possible to design new pH-triggered membrane peptides to activate RTK and gain insights on its activation mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>EphA2 activation</kwd><kwd>receptor tyrosine kinase</kwd><kwd>membrane active peptide</kwd><kwd>pH responsive</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM120642</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barrera</surname><given-names>Francisco N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS096956</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bing-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA155676</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Bing-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transmembrane domain of the EphA2 receptor has been transformed into a novel amphitropic peptide that binds to the EphA2 receptor and inhibits cell migration.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eph receptors are the largest sub-group of the transmembrane receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>) and are divided in two classes, EphA and EphB. Humans have nine different EphA and five EphB receptors that are activated, with some exceptions, by ephrinA and ephrinB ligands, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisabeth et al., 2013</xref>). In general, Eph receptors and ephrin ligands are found on opposing cells, where they establish cell-to-cell contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lisabeth et al., 2013</xref>). Full activation of Eph receptors is achieved upon clustering of receptors at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kullander and Klein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barquilla and Pasquale, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 1994</xref>). EphrinA molecules are anchored to the extracellular face of the plasma membrane by a glycosylphosphatidylinositol linkage. Binding of ephrinA ligands to EphA causes cell repulsion through activation of intracellular signaling pathways that control cytoskeletal dynamics. As a result, the EphA-ephrinA signaling axis controls contact-dependent cell communication that drives cell adhesion, migration, morphology, and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyd et al., 2014</xref>). These activities are important during development, particularly in nervous system formation and blood vessel remodeling, and in adult homeostasis of neural, bone and epithelial tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barquilla and Pasquale, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Not surprisingly, misregulation of EphA-ephrinA signaling can lead to pathological states. For example, it has been found that altered localization of EphA4 contributes to synaptic dysfunction in Alzheimerâs disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rosenberger et al., 2014</xref>), while a missense mutation in EphA2 can cause age-related cortical cataracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barquilla and Pasquale, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jun et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, Eph receptors can contribute to cancer malignancy. Indeed, Eph receptors were named after their discovery in an <underline>e</underline>rythropoietin-<underline>p</underline>roducing <underline>h</underline>epatoma cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirai et al., 1987</xref>). Relevant to cancer, the EphA2-ephrinA1 signaling axis regulates events crucial for cellular transformation and malignancy. Furthermore, EphA2 is overexpressed in multiple cancer types (breast, brain, ovary, bladder, prostate, pancreas, esophagus, lung, and stomach) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tandon et al., 2011</xref>). However, regulation of EphA2 is complex, and several factors, including ligand binding and downstream events, can cause EphA2 to act as a tumor suppressor or as an oncogenic protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi and Wang, 2018</xref>).</p><p>EphA2 contains a N-terminal extracellular domain (ECD) connected to the intracellular domain (ICD) by a single transmembrane (TM) helix. Information from ephrinA1 binding to the extracellular ligand-binding domain is transmitted across the membrane by the TM helix in the form of a conformational change in the ICD. As a result, the intracellular kinase domain is activated and auto-phosphorylates multiple tyrosine residues, which triggers a signaling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binns et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locard-Paulet et al., 2016</xref>). Full activation of EphA2 requires first dimerization, a process mediated by the TM domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bocharov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharonov et al., 2014</xref>), as well as soluble domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himanen et al., 2010</xref>), followed by assembly into clusters. However, EphA2 activation is poorly understood, especially at the level of the conformational interplay between the TM and soluble domains. New tools are needed to interrogate the conformational rearrangements that mediate EphA2 activation.</p><p>We have recently designed the ATRAM (<underline>a</underline>cidity-<underline>t</underline>riggered <underline>ra</underline>tional <underline>m</underline>embrane) peptide. ATRAM is a highly soluble synthetic peptide that is capable of pH-dependent interaction with lipid membranes: at neutral pH, ATRAM binds to the membrane surface, while a decrease in pH triggers insertion into the lipid bilayer as a TM helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>). The pH-dependent membrane insertion of ATRAM results from the protonation of glutamic acid residues, as this event switches the polarity of the peptide from moderately to highly hydrophobic. The pH-triggered membrane insertion of ATRAM and similar peptides can be used to target cell membranes in acidic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reshetnyak et al., 2007</xref>). Acidosis of the extracellular medium is a hallmark of aggressive tumors and results from altered cell metabolism and physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schornack and Gillies, 2003</xref>). Tumor acidosis favors aggressiveness, metastasis and invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martinez-Outschoorn et al., 2011</xref>). We reasoned that the strategy used to design ATRAM could be applied to conditionally solubilize the transmembrane domain of a receptor. Here, we have used this approach to transform the TM helix of the human EphA2 into an amphitropic peptide, called TYPE7 (<underline>t</underline>ransmembrane t<underline>y</underline>rosine kinase <underline>p</underline>eptide for <underline>E</underline>ph). TYPE7 is a highly soluble peptide in aqueous solution that inserts into cellular membranes in a pH-dependent fashion. The TM state of TYPE7 interacts with EphA2 to induce receptor oligomerization and phosphorylation, which causes inhibition of cell migration. The observed mechanistic differences between EphA2 activation by eprhinA1 and TYPE7 provide new insights into the activation mechanism of EphA2.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A pH decrease triggers the membrane insertion of TYPE7</title><p>TYPE7 is comprised of the sequence of the TM region of EphA2 and flanking residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We introduced five glutamic acid residues at the C-terminus and two in the TM region to enhance water solubility and confer pH-responsiveness. TYPE7 dissolved readily in buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy experiments showed that TYPE7 was unstructured in solution at neutral and slightly basic pH (as indicated by the single minimum atÂ ~200 nm, grey line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, in the presence of phosphatidylcholine (POPC) lipid vesicles, TYPE7 bound to lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>), without causing bilayer disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). We used a NBD dye as a reporter for lipid interaction, and observed that the TYPE7-NBD lipid affinity was pH-dependent. While the lipid partition coefficient (K<italic>p</italic>) at pH 8 was 0.8 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> (Â±0.4Ã10<sup>6</sup>), at pH 5 it increased to 2.9 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> (Â±0.4Ã10<sup>6</sup>) (meanÂ Â±S.E.M, <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 3). This result is in agreement with our expectation of TYPE7 being more hydrophobic at acidic pH, as a result of side chain protonation of glutamic acids. Next, we performed a complete pH titration in the presence of POPC vesicles, and observed that TYPE7-NBD fluorescence changed in a sigmoidal fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, red line), with a pH midpoint (pH<sub>50</sub>) of 6.18. We used CD to determine the conformation that TYPE7 adopts in the presence of lipids at neutral and acidic pH. At close to neutral pH TYPE7 was unfolded (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, dotted blue line), while at acidic pH the two characteristic Î±-helical minima were observed. This change indicates that the pH titration involves membrane helical formation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36645.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Membrane interaction of TYPE7.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)<italic>Â Top,</italic> partial amino acid sequence of the human EphA2 receptor showing the TM helix (underlined), preceded by a short extracellular segment, and followed by the start of the juxtamembrane segment.

We used OCD to determine the helical membrane orientation that TYPE7 adopts in POPC at pH 5. We observed that the OCD spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, dashed red line) was closer to the theoretical curve for a TM helix. However, the differences with the black line suggest that TYPE7 adopted a tilted TM helix orientation in POPC bilayers. Transmembrane peptides will typically tilt in the membrane to avoid hydrophobic mismatch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Killian and Nyholm, 2006</xref>). We reasoned that if TYPE7 formed a TM helix, its membrane tilt would decrease to adapt to a thicker lipid membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anbazhagan and Schneider, 2010</xref>). To test this idea, we repeated the OCD experiment in 22:1,22:1-PC, a lipid with longer acyl chains that forms bilayers 7.3 Ã thicker than POPC (16:0,18:1-PC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kucerka et al., 1808</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kucerka et al., 2009</xref>). In agreement with the expected behavior for a TM helix, the OCD spectrum in the thicker bilayer was closer to the theoretical TM curve with no tilt. Taken together, our data reveal that the sigmoidal pH titration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), associated with increased lipid affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), represents the transition from an unstructured state bound to the membrane surface to a transmembrane helix found at lower pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>TYPE7 shows no toxicity and binds to cells in a pH-dependent manner</title><p>We explored if TYPE7 was also able to bind to cellular membranes. To this end, we studied the cellular interaction of a fluorescently labeled version of TYPE7 at different pH values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A</xref>). We observed a robust interaction with cells at neutral pH, which increased with acidification. This indicates that the enhanced lipid affinity at acidic pH values is observed both in lipid vesicles and in cells. However, since satisfactory TYPE7 cell binding was achieved at neutral pH, we decided to employ physiological pH for the ensuing cellular experiments. Additionally, we performed cell viability experiments to study if TYPE7 was toxic to cells. The results of an MTS assay indicated that the peptide did not decrease cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TYPE7 interacts with EphA2</title><p>Next, we investigated if TYPE7 could interact with EphA2. The single TM helix of EphA2 forms a dimer that mediates receptor dimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bocharov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sharonov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). The TM region of TYPE7 contains glutamic acid residues designed to align into a single helical face. NMR studies indicated that this face is located away from the dimerization interface of EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bocharov et al., 2010</xref>). As a result, TYPE7 theoretically contains an intact dimerization interface to interact with the EphA2 TM helix. We hypothesized that this would allow binding of TYPE7 to the transmembrane domain of EphA2. To evaluate this hypothesis, we used a new peptide encompassing the TM domain of EphA2 and five residues at the N-terminus of the juxtamembrane segment (JMS), through residue K563 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We refer to this peptide as TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). We used the pH<sub>50</sub> assay to study the interaction between TYPE7 and TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2. We reasoned that transmembrane binding between TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 and TYPE7 would increase the pH<sub>50</sub>, as the TM state of TYPE7 would be stabilized over the surface-bound conformation, displacing the equilibrium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Indeed, the presence in the vesicles of TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 at a 4-fold molar excess, increased the pH<sub>50</sub> of TYPE7 from 6.18Â Â±Â 0.09 to 6.85Â Â±Â 0.16 (meanÂ Â±S.D., <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 7Â âÂ 9). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows that, in these conditions, a non-negligible fraction of TYPE7 is already in the TM state at pH 7. This suggests the intriguing possibility that TYPE7 could interact with EphA2 without requiring strong acidification. To study the specificity of this effect we performed a control experiment replacing TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 by GWALP23, an unrelated peptide that also forms a transmembrane helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ozdirekcan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rankenberg et al., 2012</xref>). The pH<sub>50</sub> of TYPE7 was similar in the absence or presence of GWALP23 (6.18Â Â±Â 0.09 and 6.17Â Â±Â 0.20, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting that TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 specifically interacts with TYPE7.</p><p>To explore the cellular relevance of the biophysical results, we examined the co-localization of TYPE7 with endogenous EphA2 in A375 cells at physiological pH. We evaluated the effect of EphA2 activation on the interaction between TYPE7 and EphA2 by treating the cells with ephrinA1-Fc (EA1). EA1 uses a Fc group (heavy chain of human IgG1) to crosslink ephrinA1. Incubation with EA1 recapitulates EphA2 trans-activation by membrane clusters of ephrinA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis et al., 1994</xref>). The resulting EphA2 clustering and phosphorylation leads to recycling into endosomes and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kania and Klein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikolov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boissier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sabet et al., 2015</xref>). We used confocal microscopy to study the cellular distribution of EphA2. As expected, we observed that EA1 promoted EphA2 clustering, resulting in accumulation of large puncta at the plasma membrane and cytosolic recycling (compare two insets in left column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We used TYPE7 fluorescently labelled with Alexa568 to assess co-localization with EphA2. We observed that the TYPE7 signal overlapped to a large degree with the EphA2 receptor in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, upper right panel). However, this could partially result from the membrane affinity of TYPE7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To test the specificity of the co-localization, we performed additional experiments in the presence of EA1, and evaluated if TYPE7 partitioned to the clusters. Interestingly, after EA1 activation we observed stronger TYPE7 co-localization with EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lower right panel). We quantified co-localization using the Pearson correlation coefficient (<italic>r</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Manders et al., 1992</xref>), which showed that the positive pixel correlation between EphA2 and TYPE7 (<italic>r</italic>Â =Â 0.26, <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 14) increased significantly upon receptor activation with EA1 (<italic>r</italic>Â =Â 0.38, <italic>n</italic>Â =Â 17) (<italic>t</italic>Â =Â â2.68, p&lt;0.05). Next, we performed a co-precipitation assay to confirm the interaction between TYPE7 and endogenous EphA2. To this end, we treated H358 cells with TYPE7 labelled with a near-IR fluorophore, DyLight 680 (TYPE7-DL). After EphA2 immuno-precipitation, SDS-PAGE gels showed a fluorescent band corresponding to the molecular weight of TYPE7-DL (5.2 KDa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, when EphA2 was activated with EA1, the amount of TYPE7 that precipitated with endogenous EphA2 increased fourfold. These data suggest that the peptide might be trapped in EphA2 clusters. Taken together, the co-localization and co-precipitation results indicate that TYPE7 interacts with EphA2 in cells, and binding is enhanced upon activation of EphA2.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36645.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TYPE7 interacts with endogenous EphA2 in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Confocal microscopy shows co-localization of TYPE7 and EphA2.

These clusters can contain hundreds of EphA2 molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Himanen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nikolov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janes et al., 2012</xref>) and appear as micron-sized puncta in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Salaita et al., 2010</xref>). We explored if TYPE7 activates EphA2 by promoting receptor clustering. First, we employed super-resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) to qualitatively investigate this possibility. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> shows that untreated cells have a relatively homogeneous EphA2 distribution at the plasma membrane. EA1 treatment caused EphA2 to concentrate in brighter foci on the membrane, indicating clusters of EphA2 (marked as white arrowheads). Strikingly, incubation with TYPE7 did not promote foci formation. Similar conclusions were drawn from confocal imaging (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This was surprising, since TYPE7 increased Y772 phosphorylation and reduced cell migration as effectively as EA1, but apparently, it did so without promoting formation of EphA2 foci. This suggests that TYPE7 and EA1 might achieve similar inhibition of cell migration despite inducing different levels of EphA2 self-assembly.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36645.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>TYPE7 induces formation of oligomers of EphA2.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>)Â Super-resolution SIM data.

FCS is more sensitive than SIM for detecting changes in oligomerization status, particularly for small oligomers. FCS records the time-resolved fluorescence fluctuations within a confocal detection volume caused by diffusion of EphA2. By performing correlation analysis on the recorded fluctuation signals, auto-correlation function (ACF) curves are obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1AâB</xref>). From the ACF curve, we determined the lateral mobility of EphA2, reported as an effective diffusion coefficient (D). We investigated changes in EphA2 oligomeric state monitoring lateral mobility after TYPE7 and EA1 treatment. Although it is difficult to use lateral mobility to calculate the absolute size of EphA2 oligomers, there is a direct correlation between lateral mobility and oligomer size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chung et al., 2010</xref>). Namely, for the same receptors in the same membrane environment, a decrease in the lateral mobility indicates growth in oligomer size. FCS measurements were recorded in live DU-145 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>) that stably express EphA2 labelled with enhanced GFP (EphA2FL-GFP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). While this experimental setting does not allow ruling out the presence of more than one diffusing component, a single relaxation term (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5">Eq. 5</xref>) fitted the data well. In untreated cells, the median D value for EphA2FL-GFP was 0.30 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, first column). When treated with EA1, the median D value decreased to 0.09 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, orange area). The decrease in D upon EA1 stimulation showed that, as expected, EphA2FL-GFP formed clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). However, upon treatment with TYPE7, D decreased to 0.20 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, second column). This indicates that EphA2FL-GFP oligomerizes upon TYPE7 treatment, but the intermediate D value indicates that EphA2 is detected in a lower-order oligomeric state than the cluster. The difference between diffusion coefficients obtained for EA1-activated EphA2FL-GFP, both with and without TYPE7, was not statistically significant. This suggests that regardless of the presence of TYPE7, EA1 caused EphA2FL-GFP to form clusters of similar size. This apparent saturation effect agrees with the cell migration and phosphorylation data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,D and E</xref>). Additionally, FCS data analysis allows us to quantify the plasma membrane levels of EphA2FL-GFP. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref> shows that incubation with TYPE7 did not alter the levels of EphA2 expression, in agreement with Western blot data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4DâE</xref>.</p><p>To demonstrate that TYPE7 is specifically targeting EphA2 without affecting other single-pass transmembrane receptors, we tested the effect of TYPE7 on Plexin A4. Plexin A4 is a cell surface protein that has a similar domain structure as EphA2: one transmembrane domain, a large ectodomain, and an enzymatic cytoplasmic domain. Previous work showed that Plexin A4 forms an inactive dimer prior to ligand stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marita et al., 2015</xref>). COS-7 cells were transiently transfected with Plexin A4 labelled with eGFP (Plexin A4-eGFP). FCS measurements were carried out on the peripheral membrane area of live cells expressing Plexin A4-eGFP to measure any change in their lateral mobility upon TYPE7 treatment. In untreated cells, the median diffusion coefficient (D) value for Plexin A4-eGFP was 0.28 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>), similar to the previously published value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marita et al., 2015</xref>). There was no significant difference when the cells were treated with TYPE7 (DÂ =Â 0.27 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s). This control experiment suggests that TYPE7 does not affect the diffusion of transmembrane proteins in a non-specific manner.</p><p>The results obtained in lipid vesicles containing TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 suggested that TYPE7 interacts with the membrane-proximal region of EphA2. However, TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 encompasses not only the TM helix of EphA2 but also the first five basic JMS residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to define the domains of EphA2 that interact with TYPE7, we performed additional FCS experiments with two deletion EphA2 constructs. We first used a truncation construct where the full ICD was deleted at the first JMS residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The resulting construct, EphA2ÎJ-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2017</xref>), was used to study the ability of TYPE7 to target the EphA2 TM helix. Using this construct, we observed that TYPE7 treatment decreased the mobility of EphA2ÎJ-GFP from 0.20 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s to 0.14 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s, suggesting that TYPE7 binding to the TM domain increased oligomerization. Interestingly, upon EA1 stimulation, D was 0.13 Î¼m<sup>2</sup>/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, orange area), similar to the value observed with TYPE7. This suggests that in the absence of the ICD, TYPE7 has a similar effect as EA1 on self-assembly, suggesting that the ICD domains might be responsible for the differences in clustering observed between EA1 and TYPE7.</p><p>Finally, we studied the oligomerization of the isolated EphA2 ICD. FCS was thus performed using Myr-EphA2 ICD-GFP transfected in COS-7 cells. In Myr-EphA2 ICD-GFP, the ICD of EphA2 is anchored to the membrane at the first JMS residue using a myristoyl group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). When we performed FCS experiments with this construct, we observed faster diffusion compared to the other two EphA2 construct in control conditions. Interestingly, treatment with TYPE7 also decreased D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), indicating that TYPE7 also promoted oligomerization of the ICD (cell images are shown at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We performed control experiments to evaluate if the oligomerization change that TYPE7 induces in Myr-EphA2 ICD-GFP might result from nonspecific interactions with the myristoyl moiety. To this end, we assayed the effect of TYPE7 on six Src family kinases, which are also linked to the membrane <italic>via</italic> myristoylation. Such experiments showed that TYPE7 did not alter the phosphorylation status of any of the myristoylated kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Additionally, we assayed the phosphorylation status of 37 other protein kinases and kinase substrates, with the exception of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). Importantly, we observed that TYPE7 did not induce phosphorylation changes in any of these proteins. These results additionally suggest that the effects of TYPE7 on cell migration results from changes in EphA2 activity, and not any of these other cellular targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Collectively, our data indicate that TYPE7 interacts with both the TM helix and the ICD of EphA2, to promote receptor oligomerization.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this work, we show how strategic addition of acidic residues can transform a transmembrane domain into a water-soluble species, which can be triggered to insert into membranes. This finding can have important implications for the design of new ligands that modulate protein-protein interactions in membrane proteins. A molecule capable of establishing protein-protein interactions efficiently in cellular membranes should have three fundamental properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stone and Deber, 2017</xref>): (1) be easily deliverable into the membrane, where it should reside stably; (2) adopt an appropriate conformation to bind to the target; and (3) do not cause membrane disruption. Our data indicate that TYPE7 satisfies all these criteria. TYPE7 displays affinity for lipid bilayers, while it is readily soluble in buffer, which allows for easy plasma membrane delivery in physiological conditions. We hypothesize membrane binding of TYPE7 is initially driven by its moderately hydrophobic nature, as in the ATRAM and pHLIP peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reshetnyak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hunt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Deacon et al., 2015</xref>). After localizing at the surface of lipid vesicles, TYPE7 adopts a TM configuration, triggered by a pH decrease.</p><p>Our studies in cells, including co-precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), indicated that TYPE7 interacts with endogenous EphA2. Additional experiments in a reconstituted vesicle system showed that the acidity required for TYPE7 insertion significantly diminished in the presence of the membrane region of EphA2. In fact, in the presence of TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2, the pH<sub>50</sub> of TYPE7 membrane insertion shifted to a less acidic value, and the transition started at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). No changes in pH<sub>50</sub> were observed using a control transmembrane domain of different sequence, indicating that the interaction is specific. We propose that binding to TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 shifts the membrane equilibrium of TYPE7 away from the membrane surface, and promotes glutamic acid protonation and formation of the transmembrane state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>The data obtained with TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 suggest an interaction between TYPE7 and the hydrophobic amino acids of the transmembrane helix of EphA2. However, the TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2 peptide contains at the C-terminus a basic stretch, <sup>559</sup>HRRRK<sup>563</sup>, corresponding to the start of the JMS. It has not escaped our notice that TYPE7 contains a potentially complementary acidic stretch at the C-terminus, with sequence EEEEE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), which might establish an attractive electrostatic interaction with the basic stretch of TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2. We performed additional experiments to determine if TYPE7 could interact with the JMS of EphA2 in cells. Indeed, we observed that TYPE7 promoted self-assembly of the full ICD, containing the JMS but not the TM domain, as determined by FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As expected, TYPE7 also promoted self-assembly of the EphA2 construct lacking the full JMS, but containing the TM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Taken together our data suggest that TYPE7 interacts with EphA2 both at the TM domain and the ICD, and we hypothesize the ICD interaction occurs at the JMS.</p><p>We studied the biological effect of the interaction of TYPE7 with EphA2 using a trans-well migration assay. Interestingly, we observed that TYPE7 inhibited EphA2-driven cell migration to a similar extent as the saturating EA1 concentrations employed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). It has been shown that phosphorylation of the activation loop residue Y772 of EphA2 is required for ligand-induced inhibition of cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locard-Paulet et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). To determine the molecular mechanism of the activation of EphA2 by TYPE7, we studied the phosphorylation at the JMS and kinase activation loop. We observed that EA1 and TYPE7 caused a similar increase in Y772 phosphorylation, indicating that this molecular event might explain the similar effect of both ligands on cell migration.</p><p>Surprisingly, clear differences existed in the phosphorylation of the JMS residues Y588 and Y594. While TYPE7 did not affect their state, EA1 strongly promoted phosphorylation of Y588 and Y594. JMS phosphorylation is required for EA1 activation of EphA2, since the JMS auto-inhibits the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lemmon and Schlessinger, 2010</xref>). This regulatory mechanism involves docking of the JMS to the kinase domain, which stabilizes the inactive kinase state. EphA2 activation by ephrin binding promotes phosphorylation of the JMS residues Y588 and Y594, which causes a conformational change in the JMS that leads to its release from the kinase domain, and ends auto-inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wybenga-Groot et al., 2001</xref>). As a result, Y772 in the kinase activation loop is phosphorylated and the kinase domain is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2008</xref>). Our results show that TYPE7 promotes full EphA2 Y772 phosphorylation and inhibition of cell migration without JMS phosphorylation. This suggests that phosphorylation of the JMS is not the only path to release juxtamembrane inhibition of EphA2. How can TYPE7 release the auto-inhibition without JMS phosphorylation? We hypothesize that the interaction between TYPE7 and the JMS of EphA2 might induce a conformational change that reorients the JMS without requiring phosphorylation, and as a result preclude autoinhibition by binding of this segment to the kinase domain. Interestingly, it has been recently reported that the regulation of the phosphorylation of Y772 and Y588 can be uncoupled by differential de-phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Locard-Paulet et al., 2016</xref>). Our data indicates that phosphorylation of Y772 can occur <italic>via</italic> a different mechanism that does not require JMS phosphorylation. Our results illustrate the flexibility of molecular events involved in the interplay between the JMS and kinase domain, and might suggest that additional modes of release of autoinhibition could regulate EphA2 phosphorylation.</p><p>Crosstalk between Akt and EphA2 has been documented in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shi and Wang, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Miao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). Akt is a key protein that controls cell migration and differentiation through the oncogenic Akt/mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altomare and Khaled, 2012</xref>). EphA2 activation by ephrinA1 downregulates this pathway through Akt de-phosphorylation mediated by a serine/threonine phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3FâH</xref> shows that TYPE7 decreased phosphorylation at the two main Akt kinase activation sites, T308 and S473, similarly to EA1. We propose that inhibition of Akt by TYPE7 can explain the strong inhibition of cell migration shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. Furthermore, this observation suggests that TYPE7 can be used to inhibit the oncogenic Akt/mTORC1 signaling pathway.</p><p>EphA2 ligand-dependent activation involves formation of large clusters. We compared the effect of EA1 and TYPE7 on clustering. The FCS and SIM data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> show that while EA1 promotes formation of large clusters of the full-length EphA2, TYPE7 does not induce clusters, but smaller oligomers. This indicates the possibility that the large EphA2 clusters that EA1 induces are not required for EphA2-mediated inhibition of cell migration. Based on this result, we suggest that a smaller oligomer might be the active signaling state of EphA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A similar scenario has been proposed for EphB2 using chemical dimerizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaupp et al., 2014</xref>). The larger EphA2 clusters might be needed instead for regulation or recycling, as a means to control the duration and intensity of EphA2 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boissier et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36645.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Cartoon depicting the different domains forming EphA2, which compares the activation mechanism of ephrinA1 (<italic>left</italic>) with the proposed TYPE7 mechanism (<italic>right</italic>), where the JMS is not phosphorylated and EphA2 assembles into smaller oligomers.</title><p>Figure is not to scale.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-36645-fig5-v2"/></fig><p>It has been previously shown that TM peptides can modulate other membrane receptors.

Furthermore, the pH-dependent membrane insertion could potentially confer a means for the targeted delivery of TYPE7 to cells in acidic environments, such as tumors.</p><p>EphA2 is a promising target for therapeutics of different cancer types. Overexpression of EphA2 in cancer can promote cancer progression and malignancy, and it is often associated with ephrin downregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macrae et al., 2005</xref>). Importantly, TYPE7 can activate EphA2 in the absence of ephrins. Furthermore, it has been proposed that EphA2 monomers are pro-tumorigenic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2015</xref>). As TYPE7 promotes oligomerization, we hypothesize it might have an anti-tumorigenic effect. Moreover, TYPE7 inhibits cell migration without showing toxicity, making this peptide an interesting lead compound to reduce migration of cancerous cells and metastasis. Importantly, the strategy we have developed to target EphA2 can be generalized to design peptide tools to study the activation mechanism of other single-span and multi-span membrane receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents and peptides</title><p>Peptides (TYPE7 and TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2) were synthesized by Thermo Fisher Scientific (Waltham, MA) atÂ â¥95% purity.

The same software package was used for to perform the Mann-Whitney U test to the co-precipitation data. Statistical significance was considered as p&lt;0.05. Where multiple comparisons were performed, significance was determined by <italic>t</italic>-tests followed by the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure using a false discovery rate of 0.05. Effect sizes in standard deviations were determined by Hedgeâs <italic>g</italic> values as calculated in Excel 2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIHÂ grants R01GM120642 (FNB) and R01NS096956 and R01CA155676Â (B-CW).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;A novel pH-dependent membrane peptide that binds to EphA2 and inhibits cell migration&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>This manuscript describes a thorough investigation of a novel peptide that inhibits migration of malignant cells by its binding to the transmembrane segment (TMS) of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2. Thorough biophysical studies of peptide structure, membrane integration and binding are juxtaposed with a comprehensive cell biological analysis of the effects the pH-dependent TYPE2 binding to EphA2. The discovery of a peptide that can be used to activate EphA2 through an unconventional mechanism is interesting for potential therapeutic applications.</p><p>The reviewers were positively impressed by the combination of a large body of biophysical, cell biological and modeling work that you have been able to build on a difficult system. They consider that your study will represent a significant advance to the field, but a significant number of additional evidences to support your conclusions and changes to consolidate the paper are nevertheless required.</p><p>These major points are summarized below:</p><p>1) To support their hypothesis, the authors must verify that TYPE7 does increase EphA2 kinase activity, for example, by monitoring phosphorylation of a substrate (Fang et al., 2008) and/or by using the phospho-kinase antibody array in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3, which contains a number of EphA2 downstream targets.</p><p>2) The authors should add more experimental evidence that TYPE7 interacts with an EphA2 TM interface but not with another interface.</p><p>3) They should show that TYPE7 does not affect the clustering of EphA2-deltaJ-GFP if the TM domain is replaced by an unrelated TM domain and that TYPE7 does not affect the clustering of Myr-EphA2-ICD-GFP if the positively charged amino acids are eliminated.</p><p>4) Some control experiments are missing: in order to conclude that TYPE7 increases pY772 and pHLIP does not, the effects of TYPE 7 and pHLIP should be compared in the same cells and preferably in the same experiment.</p><p>5) Reviewers have concerns with the mathematical model of the kinetics and wonder if the model should be kept in the manuscript. First, it is not clear whether the model is not simply custom-built to produce the observed results and has actually provided new insight. This point should be clarified. Moreover, some predictions of the model are not consistent with published data: for instance, literature does not support the presence of a substantial population of inactive EphA2 dimers in the absence of ephrin-As (see for example Singh et al., 2015 and Sabet et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018 Communications Biology 15; and, for EphB2, Ojosnegros et al., 2017 PNAS 114:13188). According to the proposed model, ephrinA1 stimulation disrupts the EphA2 inactive dimers and promotes formation of active dimers that use a different TM interface. What are the predictions of the model in regard to the behavior the two EphA2 mutants with a disrupted TM interface and are they consistent with the data in Sharonov et al., 2014, where mutation of each TM interface affects EphA2 activity in both unstimulated and ephrinA1-stimulated cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is an impressive and thorough study of an interesting engineered peptide that builds off of the pHLIP concept. The authors are to be commended for the breadth and scope of the study, which includes a wide-range of both biophysical and cellular experiments, complemented with mathematical modeling. Relevant controls are run, including WALP and pHLIP. The paper offers several suggestions as to the mechanism through which their peptide activates EphA2, although the actual mechanism is left unresolved. I will say that I was surprised that the peptide acts to activate, rather than inhibit, the receptor. If true, the finding is very exciting and opens the door to understanding a new mechanism of activation that couples conformational changes in the TM domain to activation through oligomerization. This is an exciting mechanism that deserves publication in a high impact journal.</p><p>I have two major comments, which if adequately addressed will convince me that the paper should be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) The authors state in reference to Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D-E that there is no significant increase in EphA2 levels upon treatment with TYPE7. However, the figure does appear to indicate that there is at least some increase in expression (approximately 30%). Since we don't know if there is a relationship between expression levels of EphA2 and activation, it would be necessary to rule out the possibility that the increased (albeit mild) expression induced by TYPE7 isn't causing activation. Overexpression of other membrane proteins, such as TNF receptors, can cause ligand-free clustering and activation in cell membranes. The authors should test the effect in their cell lines of overexpression at various levels of DNA transfection to reassure the reader that this isn't affecting their core findings.</p><p>2) The use of computational modeling is commendable, but it is not clear to me that the model has actually provided new insight. More specifically, I am not convinced that the model results aren't a trivial consequence of the assumptions used to build the model. The authors should do a better job of explaining the model and making transparent how the model results differ from those that are trivial consequences of the assumptions they have started with. I will do my best to explain, and if I'm simply confused please correct the text to clarify these points:</p><p>&quot;The model proposes that binding of saturating levels of EA1 causes a conformational switch that disfavors the inactive dimers, completely blocking the inactive interface.&quot; Then, not surprisingly, the results show an increase in the number of monomers upon ligand addition, and rapidly an increase in clusters from rapid formation of active dimers (Figure 5B). Then, adding Type 7 (Figure 5C) slows everything down. Is this not simply the consequence of the fact that, unlike the EA1 ligand, the TYPE7 effect is slowed by your choice to slow its reactivity by way of its diffusion? That is, given this difference between EA1 (instantaneous/saturating) and TYPE7 (Diffusion-slowed/concentration dependent), could you not have predicted a priori (i.e. without solving the equations) that the process would be slowed with TYPE7? I'm not saying that the mechanism for slowing isn't correct (ligand binding instantly activates pre-assembled dimers vs TYPE7 has to diffuse), I'm simply asking whether you needed a complex kinetic model to know that would be the case.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a novel peptide (TYPE7) that was designed based on the transmembrane segment of the EphA2 receptor tyrosine kinase. TYPE7 contains strategically located glutamic acid residues that make it soluble in aqueous solutions but able to insert into lipid membranes at acidic pH. Treatment of cells with TYPE7 increases phosphorylation of Y772 in the activation loop of the EphA2 kinase domain. This is attributed to the interaction of TYPE7 with the transmembrane (TM) helix and/or the juxtamembrane segment (JMS) of EphA2, which promotes EphA2 clustering and activation. The authors also developed a mathematical model of EphA2 activation based on results in the manuscript and information from the literature.</p><p>The discovery of a peptide that can be used to activate EphA2 through an unconventional mechanism is potentially interesting and could have therapeutic applications. However, additional experimental evidence is needed to support the conclusions presented and the mathematical model of EphA2 clustering.</p><p>The authors found that TYPE7 increases EphA2 phosphorylation on Y772 but not Y588 and Y594. They hypothesize that this is due to a new mechanism of EphA2 activation that does not involve Y588 and Y594 phosphorylation. To support this hypothesis, the authors should verify that TYPE7 does in fact increase EphA2 kinase activity (for example, by monitoring phosphorylation of a substrate (Fang et al., 2008) and/or by using the phospho-kinase antibody array in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3, which contains a number of EphA2 downstream targets). Of note, pY588 and pY594 are major EphA2 autophosphorylation sites, and thus they would be expected to be phosphorylated in the active receptor even if their phosphorylation does not play a role in receptor activation. It should also be noted that LocardâPaulet et al., 2016, implicated pY772 in cancer cell migration/invasiveness, but this effect may not be linked to EphA2 kinase activity.</p><p>Additional controls are needed to support the proposed mechanism of EphA2 activation by TYPE7. For example, additional controls for Figure 2A, B should include clustering of an unrelated transmembrane receptor, to show that TYPE7 specifically co-clusters with EphA2. Additional controls for Figure 3A and Figure 3âfigure supplement 3 should demonstrate no effects of TYPE7 on the migration of cells that do not express EphA2, to exclude non-specific effects of TYPE7 on cell migration. Furthermore, the experiments with the pHLIP peptide in Figure 3âfigure supplements 2 and 3 may not be sufficient as controls if they were performed at neutral pH, since under these conditions TYPE7 but not pHLIP would insert into the membrane of cells expressing EphA2.</p><p>The authors propose that TYPE7 interacts with an EphA2 TM interface observed by NMR (hypothesized to mediate dimerization of inactive EphA2 in cells) but not another interface (hypothesized to mediate dimerization of active EphA2 in cells). However, additional experimental evidence should be included to support this model. For example Sharonov et al., 2014, reports mutations that selectively destabilize each TM interface. If the mechanism presented by the authors is correct, TYPE7 should not associate with an EphA2 mutant where the interface hypothesized to mediate formation of inactive dimers and to interact with TYPE7 is mutated.</p><p>The authors propose that TYPE7 affects EphA2 clustering by interacting with both the TM domain and the positively charged portion at the N-terminus of the JMS segment. To support this idea, the authors should show that (i) TYPE7 does not affect the clustering of EphA2-deltaJ-GFP if the TM domain is replaced by an unrelated TM domain and (ii) TYPE7 does not affect the clustering of Myr-EphA2-ICD-GFP if the positively charged amino acids are eliminated. Could an alternative explanation of the effects observed in Figure 4 be that insertion of TYPE7 changes the properties of membranes, slowing down lateral diffusion of proteins?</p><p>Different types of experiments and their controls should be carried out in the same cell line, with possible verification of some results in other cell lines. For example, the controls in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2 with the pHLIP peptide should be performed in the same cell line used to examine the effects of TYPE7 (i.e. A375). There is also some concern about the use of H358 cells, in which EphA2 activation by ephrinA1 does not seem to have robust signaling effects (see Figures 3âfigure supplement 2 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 3).</p><p>The authors present a detailed mathematical model of EphA2 clustering. However, some of the predictions of the model do not seem to be consistent with published data. For example, evidence in the literature does not does not support the presence of a substantial population of inactive EphA2 dimers in the absence of ephrin-As (see for example Singh et al., 2015 and Sabet et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018, Communications Biology 15; and, for EphB2, Ojosnegros et al., 2017 PNAS 114:13188). According to the proposed model, ephrinA1 stimulation disrupts the EphA2 inactive dimers and promotes formation of active dimers that use a different TM interface. What are the predictions of the model in regard to the behavior the two EphA2 mutants with a disrupted TM interface? Are these predictions consistent with the previous data in Sharonov et al., 2014, where mutation of each TM interface affected EphA2 activity in both unstimulated and ephrinA1-stimulated cells?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Alves et al. describes a thorough investigation of a novel peptide that inhibits cell migration of malignant cells by its binding to the transmembrane segment (TMS) of the receptor tyrosine kinase EphA2. The peptide can be delivered in a soluble form, then integrates into the membrane upon lowering the pH, and eventually binds to EphA2 at its TMS and the adjacent juxtamembrane segment (JMS). The authors also show that one of three phosphorylation sites in the adjacent intracellular regulatory domain of EphA2 is phosphorylated upon binding of the designed peptide TYPE7, which induces dimerization of the receptor, but no further clustering that happens only upon Ephrin A1 ligand binding and phosphorylation of all three sites. Despite its stimulation of phosphorylation of only the Y772 single site, TYPE2 is as active as Ephrin A1 in inhibiting cell migration and therefore may have future therapeutic utility.</p><p>The study is overall very comprehensive and makes a convincing case for the proposed mechanism. Thorough biophysical studies of peptide structure, membrane integration and binding are juxtaposed with a comprehensive cell biological analysis of the effects the pH-dependent TYPE2 binding to EphA2.</p><p>The comments below are suggestions on how the authors could and should further improve an already very good and carefully written manuscript.</p><p>Figure 1: A) please align the sequences for easier comparison.

Reading the relevant Materials and methods section, it appears that peptide and lipids were first dried and then rehydrated to 96% relative humidity. The pH may actually be undefined in this situation and membranes at 96% RH are not the same as in bulk water or buffer and this may drive the peptide deeper into the membrane and thereby change its orientation relative to fully hydrated bilayers. This should be acknowledged.

In the first paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 interacts with EphA2â, JMS appears to be defined as the few residues adjacent to the TMS that directly abut the membrane surface, which is a common definition in many other single-span membrane proteins. However, in the second paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 inhibits cell migration by specific EphA2 phosphorylation at Y772â, the authors seem to include many more residues including all three phosphorylation sites that are as far as 30 residues away from the TMS in their definition of JMS. Please make definitions consistent.</p><p>Figure 4: A) Is too small to see clusters vs. no clusters that authors want to highlight. B) Does the blue FCS curve possibly represent more than one diffusing component? Its shape is clearly different from the other two. E) It is true that TYPE7 binding decreased diffusion of the myristylated receptor like it did with the native receptor (subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â, last paragraph), but all diffusion coefficients are much higher in the lipid-anchored compared to the protein-anchored cases. I.e. the scale is different in E vs. C and D. Nothing wrong with this, but it should be mentioned.</p><p>Mathematical model: Does a stochastic model, which this is, have a real time scale like the minutes shown in all modeling figures, or does it not have arbitrary time steps, and therefore, should the time scale in these figures not be better called arbitrary? Of course, this does not take away from the modeling, but it does not tie the figures directly to an actual experimental time scale that may be quite different.</p><p>The model as depicted in Supplementary Figure 11A also needs more explanation. There seem to be 3 different types of k(I),(on and off) and 2 different types k(A),(on and off) as shown in the different panels. Or are they all constrained to the same respective values in the model? So, how many free fit parameters are there in the model? Clarification of this point is important to better understand the main text. The Supplementary Figure 11A legend will also benefit from a more detailed panel-by-panel explanation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36645.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers were positively impressed by the combination of a large body of biophysical, cell biological and modeling work that you have been able to build on a difficult system. They consider that your study will represent a significant advance to the field, but a significant number of additional evidences to support your conclusions and changes to consolidate the paper are nevertheless required.</p><p>These major points are summarized below:</p><p>1) To support their hypothesis, the authors must verify that TYPE7 does increase EphA2 kinase activity, for example, by monitoring phosphorylation of a substrate (Fang et al., 2008) and/or by using the phospho-kinase antibody array in Figure 4âfigure supplement 3, which contains a number of EphA2 downstream targets.</p></disp-quote><p>To address the request of monitoring phosphorylation of an EphA2 substrate, we have studied the effect of TYPE7 on the phosphorylation of Akt. Akt is an important downstream target of EphA2, and Akt phosphorylation promotes cell migration. We provide new figure panels (Figure 3F-H) that show that TYPE7 causes an Akt de-phosphorylation that is comparable to the effect of ephrinA1-Fc (EA1), a ligand of EphA2. Akt de-phosphorylation is a well-stablished mechanism to reduce cell migration. Thus, this new finding adds on the TYPE7 mechanistic information we had already collected. We were prompted to study Akt after re-evaluating the kinase array, where we observed that TYPE7 promoted de-phosphorylation of Akt (included now as Figure 4âfigure supplement 12C), now mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â. To verify the results of the kinase array, we decided to perform Western blots for two activation sites of Akt (S473 and T308), confirming the effect of TYPE7 on this kinase crucial for cell migration. The identification of the effect of TYPE7 on a crucial EphA2 downstream target is a significant addition to the manuscript.</p><p>We originally proposed to study Rac1, a separate downstream target of EphA2. We performed those experiments, and we did not detect an effect of TYPE7 on Rac1 phosphorylation. This result is not surprising, since Rac1 activation occurs when EphA2 is phosphorylated at Y735, a residue which we have not evaluated in our manuscript for lack of commercially available phospho-specific antibody.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) They should show that TYPE7 does not affect the clustering of EphA2-deltaJ-GFP if the TM domain is replaced by an unrelated TM domain and that TYPE7 does not affect the clustering of Myr-EphA2-ICD-GFP if the positively charged amino acids are eliminated.</p></disp-quote><p>New FCS experiments have been performed in live cells, where the diffusion coefficient of Plexin A4 receptor has been determined in control conditions and in the presence of TYPE7. The new figure (Figure 4âfigure supplement 11) shows that TYPE7 does not affect the lateral diffusion of Plexin A4-GFP. A new paragraph discussing these results has been added (subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â, third paragraph). This result suggests that TYPE7 does not affect the membrane diffusion of single-pass membrane receptors in a non-specific manner, and that the effect of TYPE7 on EphA2 diffusion results from direct binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some control experiments are missing: in order to conclude that TYPE7 increases pY772 and pHLIP does not, the effects of TYPE 7 and pHLIP should be compared in the same cells and preferably in the same experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Tthe manuscript already contained on the original submission data performed with pHLIP and TYPE7, carried at the same time and with the same cell line, H358 (Figure 3âfigure supplement 6C). We have performed additional experiments where we study the effect on Y772 phosphorylation of TYPE7 and pHLIP. These experiments are again performed at the same time, but now in A375 cells. Additionally, experiments with pHLIP performed at acidic pH (pH 4.2), where pHLIP is expected to be fully in the transmembrane configuration, showed no effect (Figure 3âfigure supplement 6B). In the new data, TYPE7 also increases the phosphorylation of EphA2 at Y772, although to a lower extent than in H358 cells. We also include an additional figure (Figure 3âfigure supplement 5), where cell migration was studied in H358 cells (previous migration data, Figure 3A, was carried out in A375 cells). TYPE7 reduces cell migration in both cell lines. However, the effect seems even larger in H358 cells, which seems to agree with the larger increase in Y772 phosphorylation in this cell line compared to A375.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewers have concerns with the mathematical model of the kinetics and wonder if the model should be kept in the manuscript. First, it is not clear whether the model is not simply custom-built to produce the observed results and has actually provided new insight. This point should be clarified. Moreover, some predictions of the model are not consistent with published data: for instance, literature does not support the presence of a substantial population of inactive EphA2 dimers in the absence of ephrin-As (see for example Singh et al., 2015 and Sabet et al., 2015; Singh et al., 2018 Communications Biology 15; and, for EphB2, Ojosnegros et al., 2017 PNAS 114:13188).

What are the predictions of the model in regard to the behavior the two EphA2 mutants with a disrupted TM interface and are they consistent with the data in Sharonov et al., 2014, where mutation of each TM interface affects EphA2 activity in both unstimulated and ephrinA1-stimulated cells?</p></disp-quote><p>As a result of your suggestion, the latest version of the manuscript no longer contains the mathematical modeling sections. The concerns raised in this point, and also in the next one, are solely pertinent to the model. After removal of this non-central part of the manuscript, these concerns should have been addressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors should add more experimental evidence that TYPE7 interacts with an EphA2 TM interface but not with another interface.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to point 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[â¦] I have two major comments, which if adequately addressed will convince me that the paper should be published in eLife.</p><p>1) The authors state in reference to Figure 3âfigure supplement 4D-E that there is no significant increase in EphA2 levels upon treatment with TYPE7. However, the figure does appear to indicate that there is at least some increase in expression (approximately 30%). Since we don't know if there is a relationship between expression levels of EphA2 and activation, it would be necessary to rule out the possibility that the increased (albeit mild) expression induced by TYPE7 isn't causing activation. Overexpression of other membrane proteins, such as TNF receptors, can cause ligand-free clustering and activation in cell membranes. The authors should test the effect in their cell lines of overexpression at various levels of DNA transfection to reassure the reader that this isn't affecting their core findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included additional FCS data that confirms the previous Western blot EphA2 quantification. These results show that TYPE7 does not change the plasma membrane levels of EphA2FL-GFP or EphA2DJ-GFP (Figure 4âfigure supplement 10C). We now mention this finding in the second paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The use of computational modeling is commendable, but it is not clear to me that the model has actually provided new insight. More specifically, I am not convinced that the model results aren't a trivial consequence of the assumptions used to build the model. The authors should do a better job of explaining the model and making transparent how the model results differ from those that are trivial consequences of the assumptions they have started with. I will do my best to explain, and if I'm simply confused please correct the text to clarify these points:</p><p>&quot;The model proposes that binding of saturating levels of EA1 causes a conformational switch that disfavors the inactive dimers, completely blocking the inactive interface.&quot; Then, not surprisingly, the results show an increase in the number of monomers upon ligand addition, and rapidly an increase in clusters from rapid formation of active dimers (Figure 5B). Then, adding Type 7 (Figure 5C) slows everything down. Is this not simply the consequence of the fact that, unlike the EA1 ligand, the TYPE7 effect is slowed by your choice to slow its reactivity by way of its diffusion? That is, given this difference between EA1 (instantaneous/saturating) and TYPE7 (Diffusion-slowed/concentration dependent), could you not have predicted a priori (i.e. without solving the equations) that the process would be slowed with TYPE7? I'm not saying that the mechanism for slowing isn't correct (ligand binding instantly activates pre-assembled dimers vs TYPE7 has to diffuse), I'm simply asking whether you needed a complex kinetic model to know that would be the case.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, the mathematical model is no longer in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[â¦] The discovery of a peptide that can be used to activate EphA2 through an unconventional mechanism is potentially interesting and could have therapeutic applications.

We thank the reviewer for spotting this error. The text is fixed in the Figure 1 legend. We have updated the Materials and methods section to clarify the point of the 96% relative humidity (subsection âOriented circular dichroism (OCD)â). During the overnight incubation the dry sample on the slide was first fully hydrated with abundant acidic buffer. We expect that after overnight incubation the humidity of the lipid bilayers would be close to 100%. To avoid the previously added buffer to dry, a large amount of saturated salt was filling the camber where this step was carried out. That camber would have an atmosphere that was kept humid with the saturated salt (96% relative humidity). However, the sample would still be 100% hydrated. In this situation we expect the pH to be adequately controlled. We thank the reviewer for prompting us to clarify this important point. We are confident that the OCD protocol that we employ yields valid results. Specifically, we have carried out OCD experiments on three different peptides, and our results have yielded membrane orientations independently validated by other techniques using 100% hydration. Those are the GWALP23 peptide (Nguyen et al., 2018 Biophysical Journal), the pHLIP peptide (Scott et al., 2015 Biochemistry), and the ATRAM peptide (Nguyen et al., 2015).</p><p>Regarding the suggestion of carrying out OCD experiments at pH 7, we think this could not be a straightforward experiment. On the one hand, at this pH the peptide has little helical structure (Figure 1B), and a very small OCD signal is expected. Furthermore, performing this experiment has the additional complication that at neutral pH the membrane affinity of TYPE7 decreases (Figure 1C), resulting on a non-negligible amount of peptide not being bound to the membrane, but staying on solution. Any CD signal from this sample will not result from oriented peptide, but from TYPE7 on solution, causing an artifact. In the past this situation has make interpreting OCD data of pHLIP at neutral pH unreliable in our hands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âTYPE7 shows no toxicity and binds to cells in a pH-dependent mannerâ: define MTS.</p></disp-quote><p>The chemical name of the MTS compound has been added to the Materials and methods subsection âCell proliferation assay (MTS)â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection âTYPE7 interacts with EphA2â, first paragraph: What is the evidence in Figure 1D that a fraction of TYPE7 is already in the TM state at pH 7? It may also be helpful to state somewhere in this paragraph that TM-EphA2 was in 4-fold molar excess over TYPT7 in these experiments (according to the Materials and methods section).</p></disp-quote><p>The text saidâa fraction of TYPE7 is already in the TM state at neutral pHâ, which is based on Figure 1D in the presence of TM-EphA2 (orange symbols), showing that at pH 7 we are beyond the high pH plateau (peripheral state), and already within the sigmoidal transition where Î± helix is being formed. This has been discussed the first paragraph of the subsection âCell proliferation assay (MTS)â. To clarify that here we are referring to the presence of Î± helix, not that this is the dominant species, we have changed the text, replacing âa fractionâ with âa non-negligible fractionâ. Additionally, we have introduced in the main text the presence of a molar excess of TM-EphA2 (TMJM546-EphA2) over TYPE7, as the reviewer suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The sentence âIncubation with EA1 recapitulates EphA2 trans-activation by membrane clusters of ephrinA1â, needs a literature reference.</p></disp-quote><p>An appropriate reference has been added (subsection âCell proliferation assay (MTS)â, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There seems to be some confusion about the definition of the JMS and other parts (kinase domain) of the ICD. In the first paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 interacts with EphA2â, JMS appears to be defined as the few residues adjacent to the TMS that directly abut the membrane surface, which is a common definition in many other single-span membrane proteins. However, in the second paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 inhibits cell migration by specific EphA2 phosphorylation at Y772â, the authors seem to include many more residues including all three phosphorylation sites that are as far as 30 residues away from the TMS in their definition of JMS. Please make definitions consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified that TM-EphA2 contains a subset of the N-terminal region of the longer JMS (subsection âCell proliferation assay (MTS)â, first paragraph. In fact, to further clarify this point we have decided to rename TM-EphA2 to recognize it includes JM residues. The new name for TM-EphA2 is TMJM<sub>563</sub>-EphA2, indicating that includes the JM sequence until residue 563. The name has been updated in the whole manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4: A) Is too small to see clusters vs. no clusters that authors want to highlight. B) Does the blue FCS curve possibly represent more than one diffusing component? Its shape is clearly different from the other two. E) It is true that TYPE7 binding decreased diffusion of the myristylated receptor like it did with the native receptor (subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â, last paragraph), but all diffusion coefficients are much higher in the lipid-anchored compared to the protein-anchored cases. I.e. the scale is different in E vs. C and D. Nothing wrong with this, but it should be mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>A) New insets have been included highlighting the clusters (Figure 4A, Figure 4A legend).</p><p>B) The reviewer is right in pointing out that our FCS experiments do not allow ruling out the presence of more than one diffusing component. However, the data fitted well to a single relaxation term (Equation 5), suggesting that the approximation we use, which is to compare the average values for the single component fits, is reasonable. We have introduced this important qualification in the second paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â.</p><p>E) We now discuss the increased D value for the myristoylated construct in the last paragraph of the subsection âTYPE7 promotes limited self-assembly of EphA2â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Mathematical model: Does a stochastic model, which this is, have a real time scale like the minutes shown in all modeling figures, or does it not have arbitrary time steps, and therefore, should the time scale in these figures not be better called arbitrary? Of course, this does not take away from the modeling, but it does not tie the figures directly to an actual experimental time scale that may be quite different.</p><p>The model as depicted in Supplementary Figure 11A also needs more explanation. There seem to be 3 different types of k(I),(on and off) and 2 different types k(A),(on and off) as shown in the different panels. Or are they all constrained to the same respective values in the model? So, how many free fit parameters are there in the model? Clarification of this point is important to better understand the main text. The Supplementary Figure 11A legend will also benefit from a more detailed panel-by-panel explanation.</p></disp-quote><p>The comment should have been addressed after removal of the mathematical model from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
