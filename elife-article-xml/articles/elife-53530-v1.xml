Recent advances in single-particle cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) now allow structure determination without the need to grow high-quality crystals, one of the major bottlenecks for structure determination by X-ray crystallography. Detergents are the most commonly used way to stabilize membrane proteins in solution outside a lipid bilayer, but detergents are cause for concern. Because of their amphipathic nature, small size and dynamic micellar state, detergents not only cover the hydrophobic belt of a membrane protein, but may also destabilize their fold by disrupting hydrophobic interactions. This structural destabilization may only slightly affect the conformation of proteins, but it can also cause various degrees of denaturation, which over time will result in the aggregation and precipitation of the proteins. Substantial efforts have thus been devoted to finding alternative ways to stabilize membrane proteins in solution, especially for structural studies, which resulted in the introduction of several novel membrane mimetics, such as amphipols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Diab et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tribet et al., 1998</xref>), membrane-scaffold protein (MSP)-based lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Civjan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Denisov and Sligar, 2017</xref>), saposin A-based Salipro particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Frauenfeld et al., 2016</xref>), and styrene maleic acid co-polymer lipid particles (SMALPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bada Juarez et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Morrison et al., 2016</xref>), all reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Autzen et al. (2019)</xref>.</p><p>Recently, our laboratory introduced the peptidisc as a novel type of peptide scaffold designed to keep membrane proteins stable in solution without detergent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>). The peptidisc peptide is based on the original apolipoprotein A-I peptide initially reported by the Segrest group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 1985</xref>), but has the reversed amino-acid sequence. This peptide forms two amphipathic helical stretches that are separated by a proline residue. When the peptidisc peptide is mixed with detergent-solubilized membrane protein and the detergent is removed, multiple copies of the peptide associate with the transmembrane domain, embedding the protein in a peptidisc, which can also incorporate lipids that may be bound to the membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>). We have shown that the peptidisc peptide works equally well for the reconstitution of α-helical and β-barrel membrane proteins and that reconstitution is simple, efficient and requires little optimization. Because of the facile auto-assembly process, peptidisc formation is possible through rapid detergent removal in the presence of the peptidisc peptide using ‘on-column’ and ‘on-bead’ methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we present a new gentle method to reconstitute membrane proteins into peptidiscs, which we named ‘on-gradient’ reconstitution and we believe should be particularly useful for labile membrane-protein complexes. As model system, we used the reaction center (RC) of <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> that can be purified on its own, or surrounded by a light-harvesting complex 1 (LH1) ring, or as a large dimeric complex consisting of two RC–LH1 complexes linked together by PufX proteins (RC–LH1–PufX complex). All three RC complexes could be stabilized by peptidiscs, showing that peptidiscs can be used for membrane-protein complexes of diverse sizes. The RC–LH1–PufX complex is particularly demanding for the membrane mimetic because of its large, convoluted and bent transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Qian et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we show that peptidisc-stabilized membrane proteins (in this case reconstituted with the conventional ‘on-beads’ method) can be used for high-resolution structure determination by single-particle cryo-EM. Using <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MsbA, we show that peptidiscs stabilize this ABC transporter as effectively as MSP-based lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). In particular, the cryo-EM map at 4.2 Å resolution reveals that the peptidisc preserves the native conformation of MsbA as well as its interaction with its lipopolysaccharide (LPS) cargo. We also present a 3.3 Å resolution cryo-EM structure of the homo-heptameric mechanosensitive channel MscS from <italic>E. coli</italic>. Notably, the arrangements of the peptidisc peptides around MsbA and MscS are very different, revealing the structural basis for how the peptidisc scaffold can adapt to membrane proteins of different sizes, shapes and symmetries.</p><p>Together, our results demonstrate that peptidiscs can be used to stabilize membrane proteins and membrane-protein complexes with very different structures, that they preserve the native conformation of membrane proteins as well as their interaction with associated lipids, and that they allow for high-resolution structure determination by single-particle cryo-EM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>On-gradient reconstitution for the stabilization of membrane-protein complexes</title><p>We developed a new, gentler method to reconstitute membrane proteins into peptidiscs. In this approach, the detergent-solubilized membrane protein is mixed with an excess of peptidisc peptide, and the mixture is overlaid on a detergent-free linear sucrose gradient. As the gradient is centrifuged, proteins enter the detergent-free gradient and become reconstituted into peptidiscs, whereas excess peptide and detergent micelles remain in the overlaid solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In addition, since the sucrose gradient separates proteins according to their density, contaminants and aggregates will migrate to different positions in the gradient. To test whether this approach allows efficient reconstitution and effective separation, we used the <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> RC core complex by itself (99 kDa), the monomeric RC–LH1 complex (258 kDa), and the dimeric RC–LH1–PufX complex (521 kDa). In addition to their varied sizes, these complexes are colored due to their pigmented co-factors, making it easy to follow their migration into the sucrose gradient upon centrifugation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Reconstitution of <italic>Rhodobacter spheroides</italic> reaction center (RC) complexes into peptidiscs by using the ‘on-gradient’ method.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic drawing showing the principle of the on-gradient reconstitution method: detergent-solubilized membrane protein is mixed with an excess of peptidisc peptide and the mixture is overlaid onto a detergent-free linear sucrose gradient.

These bands were located in the same positions as the detergent-solubilized complexes run on detergent-containing sucrose gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), showing that the peptidisc does not affect the overall hydrodynamic properties of the complexes. Furthermore, when these complexes were recovered from the sucrose gradients, concentrated and analyzed by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), all samples produced a sharp, symmetric peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), indicating that the peptidisc-embedded complexes remain stable in solution. Peak fractions were then imaged by negative-stain EM, which in all three cases showed a homogeneous and monodispersed particle population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Class averages calculated from these samples show the structural features expected for the RC core complex, the monomeric RC–LH1 complex, and the dimeric RC–LH1–PufX complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposed tight fit of the peptidisc scaffold to the contour surface of the transmembrane domains of the stabilized proteins and complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Peptidiscs preserve MsbA in its native conformation</title><p>To explore whether peptidisc-stabilized membrane proteins are suitable for high-resolution structure determination by single-particle cryo-EM, we used the ABC transporter MsbA as test specimen, as its structure was recently determined in different conformations in the context of a nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We purified His-tagged MsbA by nickel-affinity purification and, because the protein is quite stable, we opted not to use the on-gradient reconstitution approach and instead reconstituted it into peptidiscs using the conventional on-beads method described before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>). The peak fractions from the nickel-affinity column were pooled and analyzed by SEC, which showed a sharp and symmetric peak for the peptidisc-embedded MsbA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and by negative-stain EM, which showed monodispersed particles that were homogeneous in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Analysis of the ATPase activity of MsbA purified in dodecyl maltoside (DDM) and reconstituted into peptidiscs established that the protein was about six times more active in peptidisc than in detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), similar to what has been observed for MsbA reconstituted into lipid-based nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). Consistently, class averages of negatively stained MsbA in peptidiscs showed that all transporters assumed similar conformations, also seen in nanodiscs, in which the nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) are in close proximity to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). None of the averages showed the detergent-induced conformation, seen in an X-ray crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ward et al., 2007</xref>) and negative-stain EM averages of detergent-solubilized MsbA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moeller et al., 2015</xref>), in which the NBDs are far apart. Even though double electron-electron resonance experiments have found that the NBDs of MsbA reconstituted into proteoliposomes can be distant from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zou et al., 2009</xref>), because we only see separated NBDs for detergent-solubilized MsbA, which has a lower ATPase activity, but not for MsbA reconstituted into peptidiscs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>) or nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>), we believe that NBD separation is an artifact introduced by the detergent.</p><p>The structure of MsbA reconstituted into a peptidisc was then analyzed by single-particle cryo-EM. Samples were vitrified, imaged with a K2 Summit direct detector on a Titan Krios electron microscope and processed with RELION-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Zivanov et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>). Image processing revealed subtle conformational variability in the distance between the two NBDs, as illustrated by the two final density maps at resolutions of 4.2 and 4.4 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6A</xref>). The slight mobility of the NBDs in the nucleotide-free state is the likely reason for the somewhat limited resolution of our maps as well as the previously published cryo-EM map of MsbA in nanodiscs (also 4.2 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). The final model was obtained by docking the cryo-EM structure of MsbA in nanodiscs into our 4.2 Å density map using Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>), followed by refinement in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Like in the nanodisc-stabilized MsbA, our map showed clear density for LPS trapped in the transporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), which was not visible in any of the X-ray crystal structures of detergent-solubilized MsbA . However, unlike the EM map of nanodisc-stabilized MsbA, in which the nanodisc is seen as a large amorphous density, the EM map of peptidisc-stabilized MsbA shows clear tubular densities surrounding the transmembrane domain of MsbA that represent the α-helical peptidisc peptides (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and below).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM maps for the <italic>E. coli</italic> lipid transporter MsbA and the <italic>E. coli</italic> mechanosensitive channel MscS reconstituted into peptidiscs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two density maps for MsbA in peptidiscs that differ slightly in the relative position of the two nucleotide-binding domains).

The resolution of our map is similar to that of the recently published single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction of MscS in DDM (3.4 Å) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>), but our map shows better defined density for the loop connecting transmembrane helices 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7A</xref>). As MscS in nanodiscs, our map of MscS in peptidiscs shows the channel in the closed conformation, with perfect seven-fold symmetry that could be docked into our map using Chimera, followed by refinement in PHENIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Our final structure of MscS in peptidiscs is very similar to the published one of MscS in nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s7">Figure 2—figure supplement 7B and C</xref>). However, unlike the map of MscS in nanodiscs that resolves bound lipids, our map of MscS in peptidiscs, like the X-ray crystallographic structure of detergent-solubilized MscS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bass et al., 2002</xref>), does not show any density representing lipids associated with MscS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The arrangement of the peptidisc peptides around MsbA and MscS is different</title><p>Cryo-EM maps of membrane proteins reconstituted into nanodiscs typically show the nanodisc as an amorphous band of density. This is due to the fact that the lipids encircled by the MSPs, other than ones that are tightly associated with the target protein, are mobile, and that the MSPs do not assume unique positions with respect to the incorporated protein. As a result, all structural detail of the nanodisc are being averaged out, which is also true for detergent micelles surrounding a membrane protein. In contrast, the recent cryo-EM map of a fungal mitochondrial calcium transporter stabilized with saposin A showed clear density for the individual saposin A molecules, revealing how they are arranged around the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore analyzed the non-protein density in our cryo-EM maps of peptidisc-stabilized MsbA and MscS to see whether it is possible to deduce the arrangement of the peptidisc peptides. To assess whether imposing symmetry during image processing introduced artificial features in the density representing the peptidisc peptides, we also processed the datasets without imposing symmetry. As expected, the resulting maps are noisier and have lower resolution, but the density representing the peptidisc peptides is very similar to that seen in the symmetrized maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 8</xref>).</p><p>In the case of MsbA, we identified a total of 15 and 21 helical segments in the maps of conformation 1 and 2, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The size of the identified segments is found to vary greatly in length. In both maps, only a single segment is seen with a length approaching the expected length if the entire peptidisc peptide adopts an α-helical conformation (~55 Å). Most other helical segments vary in length, ranging from 16 to 42 Å, and a few segments are very short (6.5 to 11 Å; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The differing number of segments identified in the two maps somewhat exaggerates the actual difference in the MsbA surface covered by peptides in the two maps, because longer segments in one map occasionally overlap with more than one shorter segment in the other map. For example, the longest helical segment in the map of conformation 1 overlaps with three shorter segments in the map of conformation 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Overall, most of the helical segments overlap completely or at least partially between the two maps, as can be seen on the front face of the MsbA dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left panel). However, the side face of the MsbA dimer reveals differences between the surface coverage of the transmembrane domain by the peptidisc peptides, with the map of conformation 2 showing two helical segments that are not seen in the map of conformation 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right panel; red arrows). In addition to the length, the tilt of the helical segments on the MsbA surface also varies. Most segments run almost parallel to the membrane plane, with tilt angles of less than ~15° for 8 and 14 segments for the maps of conformations 1 and 2, respectively. However, there are also four segments in both maps with higher tilt angles that range from ~40° to ~50°.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The peptidisc densities surrounding MsbA and MscS.</title><p>Different views of the density maps of (<bold>A</bold>) MsbA in conformation 1 (red ribbon representation), (<bold>B</bold>) MsbA in conformation 2 (green ribbon representation), and (<bold>C</bold>) MscS (blue ribbon representation).

Of the 16 identified helical segments, two are long (~36 Å), three are short (~6, 13 and 16 Å), and all others have a length ranging from 19 to 32 Å. Importantly, all helical segments run essentially parallel to the membrane plane and form a continuous band of helical segments, surrounding the transmembrane domain of MscS at a level corresponding to the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane. A second continuous band is also present at the level corresponding to the periplasmic leaflet of the membrane, but these helical segments appear shorter and less well defined in our map. Thus, unlike in the case of MsbA, the arrangement of the peptidisc peptides surrounding the MscS channel is reminiscent of the double-belt model proposed for how MSPs encircle the lipids in nanodisc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bibow et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Stabilizing membrane proteins in solution for structural and functional studies remains an important area of research, which has gained further importance with the recent advances in single-particle cryo-EM that resulted in a tremendous increase in the pace at which membrane protein structures can now be determined. Preparing well-behaved samples has thus become one of the time-limiting steps for structure determination of membrane proteins. Because peptidiscs, unlike detergents, do not affect the structure nor decrease the stability of membrane proteins and because reconstitution of membrane proteins into peptidiscs requires little optimization, peptidiscs have emerged as a promising new tool to stabilize membrane proteins in solution. Here, we present the on-gradient method that combines gentle reconstitution with a purification step and may be particularly well suited to reconstitute labile membrane-protein complexes into peptidiscs. In addition, our high-resolution cryo-EM structures of MsbA and MscS reveal very different arrangements of the peptidisc peptides, thus revealing the structural basis for why peptidiscs are an excellent and probably universal tool to stabilize membrane proteins outside of biological membranes.</p><p>In our original report, we showed that detergent-solubilized membrane proteins can be reconstituted into peptidiscs by the on-bead method, in which the protein is immobilized on beads and the detergent buffer is replaced with buffer containing the peptidisc peptide before the protein is eluted from the beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>), a method now named PeptiQuick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saville et al., 2019</xref>). The novel on-gradient method we present here combines membrane protein reconstitution into peptidiscs with a purification step, because the reconstituted target protein will form a defined band in the gradient, whereas other proteins will localize to different positions in the gradient. In particular, small degradation products, excess peptides and detergent micelles stay at the top of the gradient, whereas aggregates migrate further towards the bottom of the centrifuge tube. The location of the reconstituted target protein in the gradient can always be identified by gradient fractionation and analyzing the fractions by SDS-PAGE. However, as seen with the RC complexes, colored proteins are easily seen as discrete bands in the gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Therefore, target proteins could be expressed with a fluorescent tag, such as green fluorescent protein or mCherry, to simplify their harvest from the gradient. Alternatively, the peptidisc peptide could be labeled with a fluorophore and mixed in with unlabeled peptide used for reconstitution, which would be a universally applicable approach that does not require modification of the target protein. Although more work will be needed to fully establish this approach, initial attempts look very promising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We believe that the on-gradient method is a particularly gentle and simple way to reconstitute membrane proteins into peptidiscs, because it does not require immobilization and elution of the target protein from a resin, and because sugars, such as glycerol and sucrose, are known to have a stabilizing effect on proteins and macromolecular complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ruan et al., 2003</xref>). As a natural extension of the method, on-gradient peptidisc reconstitution could be combined with the GraFix approach, in which the sugar gradient also contains a gradient of glutaraldehyde to chemically fix fragile membrane-protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kastner et al., 2008</xref>). Considering that eight of the 37 residues of the peptidisc peptide are lysines, this extension should also introduce crosslinks between the individual peptides, which would rigidify the scaffold and further stabilize the target complex (which may form additional crosslinks with the scaffold). This approach would thus have the potential to stabilize even the most labile membrane-protein complexes.</p><p>The resolutions of the cryo-EM structures we obtained for peptidisc-stabilized MsbA and MscS are similar to those reported earlier for the same proteins embedded in nanodiscs. Thus, the ease that peptidiscs provide for reconstituting membrane proteins does not compromise the resolution that can be achieved. In addition, the structures of MsbA and MscS in peptidiscs are indistinguishable from those of the two proteins in nanodiscs, demonstrating that the peptidisc scaffold provides a similar stabilizing effect as the MSP-based, lipid-containing nanodiscs. In the case of MsbA, the protein in peptidiscs has a higher ATPase activity than in detergent, as was seen for the protein in nanodiscs, and it does not adopt the artifactual conformation with widely separated NBDs observed with detergent-solubilized protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Moeller et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ward et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, MscS in peptidiscs adopts the expected closed channel conformation, showing that the peptidisc environment does not exert major strain on this mechanosensitive channel. Interestingly, the peptidisc environment also preserves the LPS cargo bound to MsbA as was observed for this transporter reconstituted into nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). In the case of MscS, however, the map does not reveal density that could be assigned to bound lipids as seen in the structure of MscS reconstituted into nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rasmussen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Reddy et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggest that peptidiscs cannot preserve lipids that are only loosely associated with the protein or whose presence depends on the physicochemical properties of a true lipid bilayer, which is provided by MSP-based lipid nanodiscs. However, peptidiscs do preserve lipids that are tightly bound to membrane proteins, which are also the most likely ones to affect membrane protein function.</p><p>Analysis of the density representing the peptidisc in our cryo-EM maps provides the first glimpse of how the peptides cover the hydrophobic domain of membrane proteins. Their arrangement appears to be in between that of detergent micelles and nanodiscs on the one hand, and that of saposin A on the other. Instead of an amorphous density surrounding the target protein typically seen for detergent micelles and nanodiscs, our maps of peptidisc-embedded MsbA and MscS show well-defined densities consistent with α-helical peptides. However, these densities have different lengths and represent only parts of the entire peptidisc peptides, which is different from a cryo-EM map of a fungal mitochondrial calcium transporter obtained with saposin A. In the latter, six saposin A molecules surround the transporter, which could all be modeled almost completely as poly-alanine α-helices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>). However, to date this is the only structure of a membrane protein that has been determined at near-atomic resolution with this membrane mimetic. A potential reason may be that saposin A is only compatible with membrane proteins whose hydrophobic belt can accommodate a multiple of the helix-loop-helix structure of saposin A. In contrast, the peptidisc peptide consists of two short amphipathic helical segments separated by a proline residue. This shorter peptide design probably allows the scaffold to adapt to a variety of transmembrane domains, including those of β-barrel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saville et al., 2019</xref>). This notion is supported by saposin A being arranged in a well-organized tilted picket fence arrangement in the high-resolution structure of the mitochondrial calcium transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nguyen et al., 2018</xref>), whereas the organization of the peptidisc peptide surrounding MsbA and MscS varies greatly. In the case of MsbA, the helical peptide segments are tilted at different angles with respect to the membrane plane, whereas the peptides surrounding MscS run essentially parallel to the membrane. The variable way in which peptidisc peptides can adapt to the hydrophobic domain of membrane proteins is also reflected in the overall length of the densities representing the peptides, since most are shorter than the expected length of the peptide. Since single-particle cryo-EM maps result from the averaging of thousands of individual particle images, density for the peptidisc peptides only represents the most commonly assumed positions, and even these densities are weaker than those corresponding to the transmembrane helices of the incorporated target protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The weaker density and the many densities that are shorter than the peptidisc peptide thus suggest that the peptides can cover the hydrophobic belt of the target membrane protein in a variety of ways. This conclusion is supported by our earlier native mass spectrometry and peptide quantitation analysis, which suggested that proteins are not necessarily stabilized by a defined number of peptidisc peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 2018</xref>). We therefore conclude that the different ways in which the peptidisc peptide can assemble around transmembrane domains renders this membrane mimetic ideally suited to stabilize many if not all membrane proteins in the absence of a lipid bilayer.</p><p>The fact that at least some regions of the peptidisc peptides are well ordered provides an additional motivation for using peptidiscs as membrane mimetic. Detergent micelles and nanodiscs are structurally very heterogeneous. Therefore, even though they increase the size of the target membrane protein and thus make the particles easier to see and to pick, they also bury the transmembrane domain in an amorphous density, thus preventing it from contributing signal that could be exploited for alignment, 2D and 3D classification of the particles, especially at early stages of the processing when the resolution of the map is still low. In contrast, while peptidiscs also increase the size of the target membrane protein, the regions of the peptidisc peptides that assume defined positions on the protein also contribute signal that will help in the alignment, 2D and 3D classifications of the particles, similar, for example, to Fab fragments bound to target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). The signal of the ordered peptidisc peptide regions should thus aid in image processing and is therefore an additional advantage of using peptidiscs over detergents or nanodiscs.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Classes producing poor averages were discarded. The remaining 363,126 particle images were used at the original size for further classification and refinement in RELION-3. An initial 3D map, generated with eight classes showing different views of the protein, was C2-symmetrized and used as reference for 3D classification into six classes. Two classes showed the best structural detail but represented slightly different conformations, with the NBDs either close together (conformation 1) or slightly separated (conformation 2). Independent refinement and post-processing of these two classes yielded maps at resolutions of 5.5 Å and 5.8 Å, respectively. After CTF refinement and Bayesian polishing, the maps reached resolutions of 4.2 Å and 4.4 Å. All 3D classification and refinement steps were carried out with C2 symmetry imposed. To assess the effect of symmetrization on the density representing the peptidisc peptides, the 363,126 selected particle images were subjected to 3D classification into six classes without imposing symmetry, yielding two classes similar to those representing conformations 1 and 2 when C2 symmetry was imposed. These two classes, containing 124,691 and 84,079 particles, respectively, were independently refined without symmetry, resulting in maps at resolutions of 4.5 and 4.7 Å after post-processing.</p><p>For peptidisc-embedded MscS, first 218,672 particles were picked without templates from 1056 micrographs, extracted into 180 × 180 pixel images and subjected to 2D classification into 100 classes in RELION-3. Three averages showing the protein in different orientations were selected as templates to repick the images. The resulting 262,563 particles were extracted into 240 × 240 pixel images and subjected to another 2D classification into 100 classes. After discarding the classes that showed poor averages, the remaining 128,940 particles were used to generate an initial map imposing C7 symmetry, which was also imposed in all subsequent processing steps. A 3D classification into six classes produced four maps that showed more detailed structural features than the other two classes. The corresponding 99,883 particles were combined, refined and post-processed. After Bayesan polishing and additional refinement, the final map reached a resolution of 3.3 Å. In parallel, the 128,940 selected particles were also subjected to 3D classification into six classes without imposing symmetry.

The authors developed and describe a novel, gentle peptidisc reconstitution method using a sucrose gradient. Further, they solved two membrane protein structures reconstituted in peptidiscs (MsbA and MscS). Cryo-EM structures for both proteins were previously solved using nanodiscs. While the resolution could not be further improved by peptidiscs (they were similar to the resolution obtained in nanodiscs), the cryo-EM maps show density for the peptidiscs. Although the complete/unambiguous assignment of peptidisc helices into the respective densities appeared to be quite challenging, the main finding of the paper is the fact that there is density for the peptidiscs. Hence, peptidiscs differ clearly from nanodiscs and detergent in the sense that there is a (at least partially) ordered and structured interaction between peptide and transmembrane helices. An additional finding of interest is, that the peptidisc is organized in completely different ways for MsbA and MscS, showing the versatility and adaptability of the peptidisc peptides to keep membrane proteins with different sizes and shapes in solution.

This evidence is:</p><p>1) MsbA in peptidiscs has a higher ATPase activity than MsbA solubilized in the mild detergent dodecyl maltoside (DDM). The activity of MsbA in peptidiscs is indeed similar to the ATPase activity of MsbA in the lipid environment provided by nanodiscs (Mi et al., 2017). Since peptidisc-stabilized MsbA is more active than detergent-solubilized MsbA, our conclusion is that peptidiscs better preserve the native structure of MsbA.</p><p>2) All averages obtained with peptidisc-stabilized MsbA in negative stain show almost identical conformations, in which the two NBDs are in close proximity. The same conformation is seen for nanodisc-embedded MsbA in negative stain (Mi et al., 2017). In contrast, DDM-solubilized MsbA shows a continuum of conformations with the two NBDs being located at variable distances from each other. Since MsbA in detergent is less active, we believe that this structural heterogeneity represents a destabilization of the MsbA structure by the detergent and thus reflects an artifact. We now explicitly state this in the manuscript: “Even though double electron-electron resonance experiments have found that the NBDs of MsbA reconstituted into proteoliposomes can be distant from each other (Zou et al., 2009), because we only see separated NBDs for detergent-solubilized MsbA, which has a lower ATPase activity, but not for MsbA reconstituted into peptidiscs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C) or nanodiscs (Mi et al., 2017), we believe that NBD separation is an artifact introduced by the detergent.”</p><p>From a technical point of view, the continuous conformational heterogeneity of detergent-solubilized MsbA would make it very challenging to produce a high-resolution cryo-EM structure, and since the structural heterogeneity seems to be an artifact introduced by the detergent, the relevance of such a structure would be questionable.</p><p>MscS – Recently, a structure of DDM-solubilized MscS has been published (Reddy et al., 2019). We now show in panel A) of new Figure 2—figure supplement 7 local resolution maps for MscS in peptidiscs and for DDM-solubilized MscS. While the features and the local resolution of the two maps are very similar, the map of MscS in peptidiscs better resolves the connection between transmembrane helices 1 and 2, suggesting that this region is more stable in the context of peptidiscs. In the revised manuscript, we added the following statement: “The resolution of our map is similar to that of the recently published single-particle cryo-EM reconstruction of MscS in DDM (3.4 Å) (Reddy et al., 2019), but our map shows better defined density for the loop connecting transmembrane helices 1 and 2 (Figure 2—figure supplement 7A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Can the authors comment on possible differences of lateral pressure between the peptidisc and nanodisc approach?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not aware of a way to experimentally measure the lateral pressure created by peptidiscs or nanodiscs, so that we can only speculate on this point. We find that both membrane mimetics stabilize the same conformation of MsbA (which is not stabilized by detergent). This result could be interpreted as the two membrane mimetics exerting a similar degree of lateral pressure on the protein. However, the underlying reasons for protein stabilization by the two membrane mimetics could also be different. In a nanodisc, the membrane-scaffold proteins create a physical barrier that encircles the membrane patch, indeed providing a means to generate lateral pressure on the protein, the extent of which would depend on how many lipids are filling in the nanodisc. Peptidisc peptides, on the other hand, simply associate with the transmembrane domain and thus may not exert much lateral pressure on the protein, similar to detergent molecules forming a micelle around the transmembrane domain. However, unlike the flexible acyl chains of detergent molecules, the peptidisc peptides form more rigid amphipathic α-helices. Association of these amphipathic α-helices with the transmembrane domain likely reduces the mobility/flexibility of the transmembrane α-helices, which could be the reason why peptidiscs have a stabilizing effect on transmembrane domains. However, since we are not aware of any experimental approach we could use to test our ideas, we prefer not to include these speculations in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be interesting to see whether peptidiscs increase the stability of embedded membrane proteins. Can the authors show a CD melting curve with a melting temperature, and would the complexes refold after melting?</p></disp-quote><p>In our original publication that introduced peptidiscs as a novel membrane mimetic, we have already recorded melting curves for the reaction center (RC) of <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> (Carlson et al., 2018). Panel C) of Figure 10—figure supplement 1 demonstrates that RC in peptidiscs is indeed more stable than in detergent. Panels D) and E) show that the stabilizing effect of peptidiscs is similar to those of other membrane mimetics, such as SMA, nanodiscs, and proteoliposomes, which all result in a similarly increased melting temperature compared to that of RC in detergent.</p><p>The degree of stabilization will vary depending on the detergent as well as on the intrinsic properties and stability of the membrane protein itself. We agree with the reviewers that an in-depth analysis of the stability and refolding of membrane proteins in detergent <italic>versus</italic> different membrane mimetics (with and without lipids) would be interesting. However, such work should be carried out in a systematic manner on several membrane proteins (requiring a high-throughput format), which is beyond the scope of our current Research Advance manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Long NBD distances were detected by DEER using MsbA reconstituted in proteoliposomes (Zou et al., 2009). This should be taken into consideration during the discussion. Shorter NBD distances might be &quot;imposed&quot;/&quot;selected&quot; by the nanodiscs or peptidiscs.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above and now stated in the manuscript, the longer distances seen for MsbA in detergent correlate with a lower ATPase activity. Also, we cannot think of a reason for why shorter NBD distances would be imposed/selected by nanodiscs and peptidiscs, but would not be imposed/selected by proteoliposomes. Thus, while we cannot rationalize the published DEER results, we believe that the separation of the NBDs observed in detergent-solubilized MsbA is an artifact, since MsbA has a higher ATPase activity in nanodiscs and peptidiscs, in which case we never observe large distances between the two NBDs. To state this more explicitly, we have included the following statement in the revised manuscript: “Even though double electron-electron resonance experiments have found that the NBDs of MsbA reconstituted into proteoliposomes can be distant from each other (Zou et al., 2009), because we only see separated NBDs for detergent-solubilized MsbA, which has a lower ATPase activity, but not for MsbA reconstituted into peptidiscs (Figure 2—figure supplement 2C) or nanodiscs (Mi et al., 2017), we believe that NBD separation is an artifact introduced by the detergent.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors describe the density for the peptidisc helices.

Detergent micelles and nanodiscs are structurally very heterogeneous. Therefore, even though they increase the size of the target membrane protein and thus make the particles easier to see and to pick, they also bury the transmembrane domain in an amorphous density, thus preventing it from contributing signal that could be exploited for alignment, 2D and 3D classification of the particles, especially at early stages of the processing when the resolution of the map is still low. In contrast, while peptidiscs also increase the size of the target membrane protein, the regions of the peptidisc peptides that assume defined positions on the protein also contribute signal that will help in the alignment, 2D and 3D classifications of the particles, similar, for example, to Fab fragments bound to target proteins (Wu et al., 2012). The signal of the ordered peptidisc peptide regions should thus aid in image processing and is therefore an additional advantage of using peptidiscs over detergents or nanodiscs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The pattern of peptidisc-membrane protein interaction appears to be very complex.

We had therefore already processed both datasets without imposing 2-fold symmetry for MsbA and 7-fold symmetry for MscS. However, while at lower resolution, the density representing the peptidisc peptides looked very similar and we now show the unsymmetrized density maps in new Figure 2—figure supplement 8. Therefore, the density distribution does not appear to be greatly affected by the symmetrization and thus does represent differences in the arrangement of peptidisc peptides around MsbA and MscS. We added the following statement in the revised manuscript: “To assess whether imposing symmetry during image processing introduced artificial features in the density representing the peptidisc peptides, we also processed the datasets without imposing symmetry. As expected, the resulting maps are noisier and have lower resolution, but the density representing the peptidisc peptides is very similar to that seen in the symmetrized maps (Figure 2—figure supplement 8).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The method works well with the colored proteins used in this study.
