The 'conditional' nature implies that burst activity in dentate gyrus granule cells is required for detonation. Whether single unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) trigger spikes in CA3 neurons remains unknown. Mossy fiber synapses exhibit both pronounced short-term facilitation and uniquely large post-tetanic potentiation (PTP). We tested whether PTP could convert mossy fiber synapses from subdetonator into detonator mode, using a recently developed method to selectively and noninvasively stimulate individual presynaptic terminals in rat brain slices. Unitary EPSPs failed to initiate a spike in CA3 neurons under control conditions, but reliably discharged them after induction of presynaptic short-term plasticity. Remarkably, PTP switched mossy fiber synapses into full detonators for tens of seconds. Plasticity-dependent detonation may be critical for efficient coding, storage, and recall of information in the granule cell–CA3 cell network.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17977.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17977.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>post tetanic potentiation</kwd><kwd>detonator synapse</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>dentate gyrus</kwd><kwd>synaptic plasticity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32HL083808</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vyleta</surname><given-names>Nicholas P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>People Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>291734</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Borges-Merjane</surname><given-names>Carolina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>268548</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWF P 24909-B24</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>692692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jonas</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Activity-dependent enhancement of transmitter release makes the hippocampal mossy fiber synapse a full detonator in rats.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The strength of a synapse in relation to action potential threshold is a key factor that defines its role in neuronal information processing. In neocortical and hippocampal circuits, it is generally thought that individual synapses are weak, and that temporal or spatial summation of unitary excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) is required to reach the firing threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>). In contrast, in the peripheral nervous system and brainstem, ‘detonator’ synapses are abundant, which directly control the activity of postsynaptic targets in the absence of temporal and spatial summation. Well established examples of detonator synapses include the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Katz, 1969</xref>) and the calyx of Held in the auditory brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borst et al., 1995</xref>). Whether detonator synapses exist in higher brain regions is presently unclear. Resolving this question has important implications for understanding the nature of information encoding and the rules of synaptic computation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koch and Segev, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">London and Häusser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Silver, 2010</xref>). In a network with weak synapses below detonation, activity in an ensemble of multiple convergent presynaptic neurons is required to activate a postsynaptic cell. In contrast, in a network with strong synapses near detonation, activity of a single connected presynaptic neuron may be sufficient to drive a postsynaptic cell and to initiate a behaviorally relevant output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brecht et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The hippocampal mossy fiber synapse onto CA3 pyramidal neurons is a candidate for a detonator synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelkey and McBain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Urban et al., 2001</xref>). However, the efficacy of this key hippocampal synapse has not been quantified. Structural properties suggested that mossy fiber synapses are highly efficient, because of proximal dendritic location, multiple release sites, and large vesicular pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chicurel and Harris, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, functional analysis <italic>in vitro</italic> indicated that mossy fiber synapses have a low release probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawrence et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>) and that a single mossy fiber EPSP is insufficient to drive postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brown and Johnston, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jonas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mori et al., 2004</xref>). However, <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis also revealed that mossy fiber synapses show substantial facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Toth et al., 2000</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments demonstrated that high-frequency firing in granule cells and subsequent temporal summation initiates spikes in target pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henze et al., 2002</xref>). This has led to the hypothesis that the mossy fiber synapse operates as a 'conditional detonator' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelkey and McBain, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Urban et al., 2001</xref>). Alternatively, spatial summation of inputs from multiple mossy fiber synapses, or spatial summation of mossy fiber and non-mossy fiber inputs may be required for spike initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henze et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pelkey and McBain, 2005</xref>). Whether single unitary mossy fiber EPSPs trigger spikes in CA3 pyramidal neurons in the absence of summation is currently unknown.</p><p>Mossy fiber synapses not only exhibit facilitation, but uniquely large and prolonged post-tetanic potentiation (PTP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffith, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Langdon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zucker and Regehr, 2002</xref>). Here, we tested whether PTP could convert mossy fiber synapses from subdetonator into full detonator mode. The efficacy of mossy fiber synapses has been hard to tackle, because it is difficult to selectively stimulate mossy fibers, and, in particular, to selectively activate single presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nicoll and Schmitz, 2005</xref>). We address this question with a recently developed method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>) to selectively and minimally invasively stimulate an individual presynaptic terminal, while simultaneously recording from an adjacent postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To determine the efficacy of individual mossy fiber connections, we used our recently developed technique to selectively and noninvasively stimulate single mossy fiber presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). Single mossy fiber terminals were stimulated in the tight-seal, bouton-attached configuration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>), while postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons were simultaneously recorded in the whole-cell configuration at near-physiological temperature (31–34°C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischofberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perkins, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). Bouton-attached stimulation enabled precise control of electrical activity, as verified by the appearance of action currents in the presynaptic terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Recently, this method was also successfully used at the calyx of Held (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2015</xref>). Hippocampal granule cells <italic>in vivo</italic> fire both single action potentials and bursts of spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernía-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</xref>). We first examined the properties of synaptic transmission evoked by single presynaptic action potentials at mossy fiber–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Single unitary EPSPs had a mean latency of 1.06 ± 0.09 ms, a peak amplitude of 9.6 ± 2.4 mV, a 20–80% rise time of 3.6 ± 0.7 ms, and a decay time constant of 134 ± 10 ms (6–8 pairs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–I</xref>). Furthermore, single unitary EPSPs triggered action potentials with a mean probability of only 0.12 ± 0.08. Thus, single unitary mossy fiber EPSPs failed to reliably induce action potential initiation in postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neurons.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17977.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Properties of single unitary EPSPs at the hippocampal mossy fiber–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Infrared videomicrograph (<bold>A</bold>) and schematic illustration (<bold>B</bold>) showing a paired recording from a mossy fiber bouton (tight-seal, bouton-attached configuration) and a synaptically connected CA3 pyramidal neuron (whole-cell configuration).

Three brief stimuli were applied at a frequency of 50 Hz, resembling burst activity in hippocampal granule cells <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernía-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</xref>). Under these conditions, spike probability for the third EPSP increased to 0.82 ± 0.09 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). The increase in spike probability could be generated by either presynaptic facilitation or postsynaptic summation. To reveal the contribution of presynaptic facilitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Toth et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>), we analyzed the underlying postsynaptic conductance changes by measuring excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) in the same pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). For a 50-Hz train of stimuli, the ratio EPSC<sub>2</sub> / EPSC<sub>1</sub> was 2.57 ± 0.42, and the ratio EPSC<sub>3</sub> / EPSC<sub>1</sub> was 3.12 ± 0.62. To assess the contribution of postsynaptic temporal summation, we simulated the extent of superposition of three temporally shifted identical EPSPs. For an EPSP decay time constant of 134 ms, the ratio EPSP<sub>2</sub> / EPSP<sub>1</sub> was 1.86, and the ratio EPSP<sub>3</sub> / EPSP<sub>1</sub> was 2.60. Thus, the increase of EPSP amplitude during a train was primarily generated by presynaptic facilitation, and to a smaller extent by postsynaptic summation. These results support the idea that the mossy fiber–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapse operates as a 'conditional detonator' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henze et al., 2002</xref>), and further identify presynaptic facilitation as the major mechanism underlying conditional detonation.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17977.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Presynaptic facilitation contributes to 'conditional detonation' at the hippocampal mossy fiber–CA3 pyramidal neuron synapse.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pyramidal neuron EPSPs and action potentials evoked by a short train of stimuli delivered to the presynaptic bouton (top, three stimuli delivered at 50 Hz).

Can PTP convert mossy fiber synapses from a subdetonator into a detonator mode? To address this question, we measured the probability of postsynaptic action potential initiation before and after high-frequency stimulation (HFS, 100 stimuli delivered at 100 Hz), a paradigm that reliably induces PTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffith, 1990</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Intriguingly, HFS substantially increased the probability of spiking for the first stimulus, from 0.14 ± 0.09 under control conditions to 0.71 ± 0.18 at the peak and to 0.51 ± 0.16 in a 100 s time window following HFS (22 to 122 s; seven pairs; p=0.03; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>). Detonation was rapid – the latency from the stimulus to the maximum slope of the EPSP preceding action potential generation in the PTP phase was 1.5 ± 0.09 ms, and the latency from the stimulus to action potential onset in the PTP phase was only 3.1 ± 0.09 ms (seven pairs). Enhanced detonation decayed with a time constant of 67 s, indicating that the alteration was long lasting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). HFS also increased the probability of spiking for the second and the third stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In the same paired-recordings, the extent of PTP, quantified from the maximal slope of the rising phase of EPSP<sub>1</sub>, was 442% at the peak and 348% in the 100 s time interval following HFS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). PTP decayed with a time constant of 89 s, consistent with a prolonged enhancement of release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

The activity dependence of PTP at different synapses is not precisely known. The amount of PTP appears to depend on both the frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Griffith, 1990</xref>) and the number of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Habets and Borst, 2005</xref>), and may also be influenced by other forms of presynaptic plasticity (e.g. frequency facilitation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Salin et al., 1996</xref>). However, recent <italic>in vivo</italic> whole-cell patch-clamp recordings suggest that granule cells in awake rats and mice occasionally fire bursts of &gt;10 action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernía-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vyleta et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging experiments in awake mice with genetic Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators suggest that granule cells occasionally generate large spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients consistent with ~20 action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pilz et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, as granule cell activity seems to be spatially tuned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>), even more action potentials may be generated during a long-term stay of the animal in the center of the place field, or if it visits the same place field repeatedly during exploration of the spatial environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Danielson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Neunuebel and Knierim, 2012</xref>). Therefore, due to the bursting nature of granule cell firing <italic>in vivo</italic>, substantial PTP may be induced during specific behaviors.</p><p>The dentate gyrus is also capable of eliciting strong feedforward inhibition onto CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki, 1984</xref>), and GABAergic interneurons are a major target for mossy fiber boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>). Although disynaptic inhibition appears to be too slow to affect single action potential generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Torborg et al., 2010</xref>) or the rapid detonation that we record here during the PTP phase, inhibition likely prevents excessive depolarization and burst firing of CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Torborg et al., 2010</xref>). It should be noted that recruitment of inhibition by cell-attached stimulation of a mossy fiber bouton may be different from that with a physiological stimulus (synaptic activity in granule cell dendrites) for two reasons. First, orthodromic action potential propagation may recruit feedforward inhibition more rapidly and effectively than antidromic action potentials initiated at the mossy fiber terminal. Second, the mossy fiber axon may not be fully maintained in the slice preparation. However, it appears that due to the minimal delay of monosynaptic excitation, large EPSPs during synaptic enhancement are capable of driving pyramidal cell firing before the effects of disynaptic inhibition.</p><p>The results also have major implications for how synaptic computations are performed in the granule cell–CA3 network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lisman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Treves and Rolls, 1994</xref>). Current models of hippocampal function suggest that the dentate gyrus processes multimodal sensory inputs by pattern separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Leutgeb et al., 2007</xref>) and represents this information in a sparse coding scheme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernía-Andrade and Jonas, 2014</xref>). A single CA3 pyramidal cell receives convergent input from ~50 granule cells, and a single granule cell provides divergent output onto ~15 CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaral et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Patton and McNaughton, 1995</xref>). How sparse ‘engrams’ are relayed from the dentate gyrus to the CA3 region has been unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In the subdetonation mode, activation of several granule cells by multiple highly specific patterns would be necessary to activate a given CA3 pyramidal neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Given the sparse activity of granule cells, this is an unlikely scenario. In contrast, in the full detonation mode, activation of a single granule cell by a single pattern would be sufficient to trigger activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, left). Furthermore, in the full detonation mode, a single action potential in a granule cell should activate an ensemble of ~15 CA3 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, right) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Amaral et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, our results imply a new mechanism of neuronal ensemble formation in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fries, 2009</xref>): divergence combined with plasticity-dependent detonation.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17977.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Synaptic computations enabled by plasticity-dependent, full detonation in the hippocampal mossy fiber network.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Synaptic computations in the dentate gyrus–CA3 cell network in a subdetonation regime. Action potential initiation in CA3 pyramidal cells requires spatial summation (e.g. activation of multiple granule cells; left) or temporal summation (e.g. repetitive activation of a single granule cell, right). In the spatial summation scenario, mossy fiber transmission will implement a logic ‘and’ operation. Specific wiring rules in the network could be generated by structural plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Galimberti et al., 2006</xref>). Activation of multiple distal perforant path synapses may substitute for the activation of single proximal mossy fiber inputs. (<bold>B</bold>) Synaptic computations in the dentate gyrus–CA3 cell network in a full detonation regime (e.g. during PTP). Action potential initiation in CA3 pyramidal cells is possible after a single action potential in a single granule cell (left). Thus, plasticity-dependent detonation at mossy fiber synapses will enable a logic ‘or’ operation and allow a single highly specific cue to trigger the encoding, storage, or recall of complex information in CA3 pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Quiroga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>). Additionally, a single spike in a single granule cell may not only activate a single CA3 pyramidal cell, but rather an ensemble of ~15 CA3 cells. Thus, plasticity-dependent detonation at mossy fiber synapses will contribute to the generation of ensemble activity in the hippocampal network.

This age range was chosen because morphological properties of mossy fiber synapses were largely mature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral and Dent, 1981</xref>) and paired recording experiments became increasingly difficult at later stages. Rats were maintained under light (seven am–seven pm) and dark cycle (seven pm–seven am) conditions and were kept in a litter of eight animals together with the mother in a single cage. Animals were killed by rapid decapitation, in accordance with national, institutional, and European guidelines. Experimental procedures were approved by the Bundesministerium für Wissenschaft, Forschung und Wirtschaft (A. Haslinger, Vienna). Slices were cut from the left hemisphere in ice-cold, sucrose-containing extracellular solution using a vibratome (VT1200, Leica Microsystems), incubated in a maintenance chamber at ~34°C for 30–60 min, and subsequently stored at room temperature. Cutting and storage solution contained 87 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM glucose, 75 mM sucrose, 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 7 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, ~325 mOsm. Experiments were performed at near-physiological temperature (~32°C; range: 31–34°C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Bouton-attached stimulation and paired recording</title><p>Subcellular patch-clamp recordings from mossy fiber boutons and simultaneous recordings from pyramidal neurons in the CA3b,c region of the hippocampus were performed under visual control as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischofberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szabadics and Soltesz, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>).

Experiments were performed in the absence of blockers except in a subset of EPSC experiments, in which gabazine (10 µM) was added to block inhibitory postsynaptic currents. We found no statistically significant differences between recordings in gabazine and in the absence of blockers (4 and 9 pairs, respectively) for EPSC<sub>1</sub> rise times (20–80%; 0.65 ± 0.18 ms versus 0.67 ± 0.06 ms, p=0.26), EPSC<sub>1</sub> decay τ (5.4 ± 0.97 versus 6.5 ± 0.54 ms, p=0.30), and total charge during the 3 x 50-Hz stimulus train (25.1 ± 10.1 versus 39.4 ± 7.6 pC; 60 ms integration time; p=0.31). These results are consistent with the assumption that GABAergic currents do not significantly contribute to evoked synaptic potentials in our recordings.</p><p>Presynaptic recording pipettes were fabricated from 2.0 mm / 0.6 mm (OD/ID) borosilicate glass tubing and had open-tip resistances of 10–20 MΩ. For tight-seal, bouton-attached stimulation under voltage-clamp conditions, the presynaptic pipette contained a K<sup>+</sup>-based intracellular solution (140 mM KCl, 2 mM mgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 10 mM EGTA and 10 mM HEPES), allowing us to measure bouton properties in a subsequent whole-bouton configuration. The presynaptic holding potential was set at –70 or –80 mV to minimize the holding current (typically between 0 and –5 pA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alcami et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Perkins, 2006</xref>). Action potentials in mossy fiber boutons were evoked by brief voltage pulses (amplitude &lt;1 V, duration 0.05–0.1 ms). Action currents showed an all-or-none behavior, were reliably evoked by each short pulse above threshold, and followed the brief voltage stimuli after short time intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>); late or spontaneous action currents did not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, action currents were tightly correlated with the occurrence of EPSCs in the recorded postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, bouton-attached stimulation permitted the precise control of activity in a single presynaptic input. Boutons had diameters of ~3–5 µm, in close agreement with the previously reported range of diameters of mossy fiber boutons in light and electron microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acsády et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral and Dent, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bischofberger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chicurel and Harris, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rollenhagen et al., 2007</xref>). In the whole-bouton configuration, capacitive currents decayed biexponentially, with a fast component corresponding to C<sub>1</sub> = 1.17 ± 0.46 pF and a slow component corresponding to C<sub>2</sub> = 3.16 ± 0.82 pF (seven pairs), further suggesting recording from typically sized boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Amaral and Dent, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Geiger and Jonas, 2000</xref>). Stimuli (1 or three stimuli at 50 Hz) were delivered once every 20 or 40 s (0.05 and 0.025 Hz, respectively).</p><p>Postsynaptic recording pipettes were fabricated from 2.0 mm / 1.0 mm (OD/ID) borosilicate glass tubing with resistances of 1.5–3.5 MΩ and contained an internal solution with 130 mM K-gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 10 mM HEPES, and 10 mM EGTA (pH adjusted to 7.28 with KOH, 312–315 mOsm). This formulation provides low series resistance for improved resolution of the kinetics of synaptic events and action potentials, and high electrode stability for accurately setting the resting potential of the cell, but sets E<sub>Cl</sub> at ~–45 mV. Because GABAergic signaling is hyperpolarizing at CA3 pyramidal neurons after early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banke and McBain, 2006</xref>), inhibition was not preserved in our recording conditions. In a subset of EPSC experiments, 2 mM QX-314 was added to block action potential initiation in the postsynaptic neuron. Current-clamp and voltage-clamp recordings were performed at –70 mV, and only recordings with &lt;150 pA injection of hyperpolarizing current were included in analyses. Membrane potential was checked repeatedly throughout the experiment, and holding current was carefully readjusted if required. Postsynaptic series resistance ranged from 3.9–13.2 MΩ, median 5.9 MΩ. In current clamp mode, series resistance was fully compensated using the bridge balance circuit of the amplifier. In the voltage-clamp mode, series resistance was uncompensated, but carefully monitored with a test pulse following each data acquisition sweep. Only recordings with stable series resistance were included in analyses. Paired recordings with tight-seal, bouton-attached stimulation were stable for up to 30 min. EPSC data from four pairs had been included in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vyleta and Jonas, 2014</xref>). Gabazine and QX-314 were from Biotrend, other chemicals were from Sigma-Aldrich and Merck.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Data acquisition and analysis</title><p>Data were acquired with a Multiclamp 700A amplifier, low-pass filtered at 10 kHz, and digitized at 50 kHz using a CED 1401plus interface (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Pulse generation and data acquisition were performed using FPulse version 3.3.3 (U. Fröbe, Physiological Institute, University of Freiburg, Germany). Data were analyzed with Stimfit version 0.13.17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzman et al., 2014</xref>) and Igor Pro (Wavemetrics). In a subset of recordings, traces of unitary EPSPs were filtered (low-pass digital filter, cut-off frequency of 1 kHz) for robust analysis of maximal slope of the rising phase of individual EPSPs. Mean EPSP and EPSC parameters were measured from average waveforms of individual recordings and averaged across recordings. Latencies were measured from the beginning of the presynaptic stimulus (0.1 ms duration) to the onset of the synaptic event unless stated differently. EPSP or EPSC onset was defined as the intersection of a line in the rising phase through 20 and 80% of the peak amplitude and the preceding baseline. For EPSPs, EPSCs, and action potentials, the analysis time window was set between 0 and 10 ms after the stimulus. EPSP decay time course was fit with a monoexponential function including an offset. For calculating facilitation ratios, EPSC peak amplitudes were normalized to the value for the first EPSC of a train. To quantify synaptic efficacy in EPSP recordings with overlaying action potential initiation in a subset of traces, the maximal slope of the EPSP was used as a parameter. The maximal EPSP slope was calculated as the maximum of the first derivative of the rising phase of the EPSP. Time-derivatives were calculated using a 60-μs temporal window. PTP decay time course was fit with a monoexponential function including an offset. To assess the extent of temporal summation, we simulated the superposition of three EPSPs of identical peak amplitude, shifted in time by 20 ms. The EPSP decay time constant was assumed to be 134 ms, consistent with the experimentally measured value for single unitary mossy fiber EPSPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistics and conventions</title><p>Statistical significance was assessed using a two-sided t-test at the significance level (P) indicated.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Chris McBain (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study explores the nature of transmission at the mossy fiber synapse between granule cells of the dentate gyrus and CA3 pyramidal cells in rat hippocampal slices in vitro. Although much is known about transmission at these synapses, e.g., low initial release probability and marked short term potentiation, the current paper re-explores the properties of transmission with high resolution recording techniques, combining cell attached recordings from individual presynaptic boutons with whole cell recordings from postsynaptic CA3 pyramidal cells. The authors demonstrate that single synaptic connections can be transformed from &quot;conditional detonators&quot; where reliable action potentials are triggered only after summation of a few synaptic potentials in a train, to one where the action potential probability triggered by unitary events is increased following high frequency induced post-tetanic potentiation. This transition converts synapses into reliable detonators.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers were uniformly enthusiastic about the work. One reviewer wrote, &quot;This issue has major implications for how synaptic computations are performed in the granule cell-CA3 network and therefore is, in my opinion, of broad interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. Besides its significance, the data are of outstanding quality, which adds to the overall strength of the manuscript.&quot; Another referred to it as &quot;a rather beautiful study,&quot; and said, &quot;It is rare that I read a manuscript and have no comments on how it should be revised or improved. This is one of these manuscripts. I found the logic and flow of the experiments and data analysis clear and persuasive and have only one comment. The authors should be congratulated on providing such a lucid and straightforward dataset.&quot;</p><p>The main question had to do with the reversal potential for chloride used in the experiments and whether the extent to which it is expected to influence the results. The solutions as reported predict E<sub>Cl</sub> around -45 mV (assuming complete dissociation), which could make IPSPs depolarizing and possibly excitatory (depending on where threshold is). While it is clear that PTP converts the response, it would be helpful to clarify (at least by discussion) any role for inhibition. The methods indicate that some experiments were performed with gabazine but it is not immediately evident which experiments these were. Therefore, for the revision:</p><p>1) Please verify that the solutions are reported correctly and indicate whether this is indeed the reversal potential.</p><p>2) Please also discuss the extent to which the results might be affected by inhibition. The specific queries of the reviewers are indicated in Major Point 1.</p><p>Major point:</p><p>1) The authors appear to have recorded the postsynaptic cells using pipettes filled with an intracellular solution that would be expected to set E<sub>Cl</sub> at ~-45 mV, thus potentially turning feedforward GABAergic inhibition (triggered by the mossy fiber bouton stimulation) into excitation. Although this is not a problem for the single pulse experiment, as the authors show a very low probability of action potential generation in CA3 pyramidal cells, it does makes the interpretation of both the &quot;three pulse&quot; and &quot;plasticity&quot; experiments less unequivocal. In fact, one could think that repetitive activation of mossy fiber boutons might generate feedforward GABAergic excitatory responses, which would contribute to driving the pyramidal cell to action potential threshold. Also, previous work by the same lab has shown both PTP and LTP at the mossy fiber-dentate gyrus basket cells synapse. Therefore, it cannot be excluded that similar mechanisms might operate in the CA3 region and result in an enhanced excitatory feedforward GABAergic component (even to the first response) following the high frequency stimulation protocol.

This solution was used for historic reasons in the lab, providing reduced series resistance for better resolution of the kinetics of synaptic events and action potentials, and improved electrode stability for accurately setting the resting potential of the cell. However, we appreciate the potential limitation of this approach, as pointed out by the reviewer. In the revised version, we have carefully discussed the possible effects of inhibition both with regards to (1) conditional detonation in response to trains of presynaptic stimuli and (2) full detonation in response to single APs in the PTP phase.</p><p>1) For the “three pulse” conditional detonation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), we agree with the reviewer that inhibition could make a contribution. If disynaptic GABAergic conductances contributed significantly to depolarization of the pyramidal neuron during presynaptic stimulus trains, we would predict that blocking GABAA receptors with gabazine would significantly change the time course of postsynaptic currents and reduce the total charge during train stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We have tested this prediction in our experimental data. However, we found no statistically significant differences between recordings in gabazine (10 µM) and in the absence of blockers (n = 4 and 9, respectively) for EPSC<sub>1</sub> rise times (20-80%; 0.65 ± 0.18 ms versus 0.67 ± 0.06 ms, P = 0.26), EPSC<sub>1</sub> decay τ (5.4 ± 0.97 versus 6.5 ± 0.54 ms, P = 0.30), and total charge during the 3 x 50-Hz stimulus train (25.1 ± 10.1 versus 39.4 ± 7.6 pC; 60 ms integration time; P = 0.31). These results are consistent with the assumption that GABAergic currents do not significantly contribute to evoked synaptic potentials in our recordings. Importantly, the “conditional detonation” we observe in response to stimulus trains is very similar to that previously reported in in vivo experiments where inhibition is fully intact (Henze et al., 2002). We have added the corresponding quantitative data to the Methods section (subsection “Bouton-attached stimulation and paired recording”). We have also added a statement to the Methods section describing that inhibition was not preserved in our recording conditions, and have included a reference to Banke and McBain (2006), where GABAergic signaling was shown to be hyperpolarizing at CA3 pyramidal neurons after early development (subsection “Bouton-attached stimulation and paired recording”, last paragraph).</p><p>2) For the “tetanus” full detonation experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we think that a confounding effect of inhibition is highly unlikely, because the onset of feedforward inhibition is too slow (Torborg et al., 2010). In our experiments, the latency from the stimulus to the maximum slope of the EPSP preceding AP generation in the PTP phase was 1.5 ± 0.09 ms (n = 7). Torborg et al., (2010) determined that the latency between monosynaptic excitation and disynaptic inhibition in CA3 pyramidal neurons was, on average, 2.2 ms. Thus, feedforward inhibition would be predicted to occur ~3.7 ms after the stimulus. However, in our experiments the latency from the stimulus to action potential onset in the PTP phase was only 3.1 ± 0.09 ms (n = 7). Thus, disynaptic inhibition comes too late to affect the probability of action potential initiation. Consistent with this argument, Torborg et al., (2010) found no effect of blocking GABAA receptors on latency, jitter, and initiation probability of single action potentials evoked by mossy fiber stimulation, and concluded that “[…] mossy fiber-driven feedforward inhibition does not substantially influence the timing of single action potentials in CA3 pyramidal cells, but rather provides a potent mechanism to prevent excessive depolarization and burst firing of CA3 pyramidal cells.” Furthermore, the authors concluded that “[…] the temporal precision of action potentials is likely governed by the kinetics of the EPSP itself […] largely independent of inhibition” (Torborg et al., 2010). We have added a sentence to the Results section to describe the latency data (last paragraph). We have also added a paragraph to the Discussion to explain the role of inhibition, including a reference to the paper by Torborg et al., 2010 (third paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
