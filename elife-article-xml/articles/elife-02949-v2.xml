In mammals, the PrP protein can form a prion that causes the fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies. Prions have also been uncovered in fungi, where they act as heritable, protein-based genetic elements. We previously showed that the yeast prion protein Sup35 can access the prion conformation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. Here, we demonstrate that <italic>E. coli</italic> can propagate the Sup35 prion under conditions that do not permit its de novo formation. Furthermore, we show that propagation requires the disaggregase activity of the ClpB chaperone. Prion propagation in yeast requires Hsp104 (a ClpB ortholog), and prior studies have come to conflicting conclusions about ClpB's ability to participate in this process. Our demonstration of ClpB-dependent prion propagation in <italic>E. coli</italic> suggests that the cytoplasmic milieu in general and a molecular machine in particular are poised to support protein-based heredity in the bacterial domain of life.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02949.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02949.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02949.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Unlike most infectious agents—such as viruses or bacteria—that contain genetic material in the form of DNA or RNA, a prion is simply an aggregate of misfolded proteins. Although they are not living organisms, these prion aggregates can self-propagate; when they enter a healthy organism, they cause existing, correctly folded proteins to adopt the prion fold. Within the aggregate, the prion proteins have a corrugated structure that allows them to stack together tightly, which in turn makes the aggregates very stable. As more prions are formed, they then trigger other protein molecules to misfold and join the aggregates, and the aggregates continue to grow and spread within the infected organism causing tissue damage and cell death.</p><p>Prion diseases are well known in mammals, where the prion aggregates typically destroy tissue within the brain or nervous system. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy (also commonly known as BSE or ‘mad cow disease’) is an example of a prion disease that affects cattle and can be transmitted to humans by eating infected meat. Prions also form in yeast and other fungi. These prions, however, do not cause disease or cell death; instead, yeast prions act as protein-based elements that can be inherited over multiple generations and which provide the yeast with new traits or characteristics. Although prions can form spontaneously in yeast cells, their stable propagation depends on so-called chaperone proteins that help to remodel the prion aggregates. Previous work has shown that bacterial cells can also support the formation of prion-like aggregates. The bacteria were engineered to produce two yeast prion proteins—one of which spontaneously formed aggregates that were needed to trigger the conversion of the other to its prion form. However, it was not known if bacterial cells could support the stable propagation of prions if the initial trigger for prion conversion was removed.</p><p>Yuan et al. now reveal that the bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> can propagate a yeast prion for over a hundred generations, even when the cells can no longer make the protein that serves as the trigger for the initial conversion. This propagation depends on a bacterial chaperone protein called ClpB, which is related to another chaperone protein that is required for stable prion propagation in yeast. As such, the findings of Yuan et al. raise the possibility that, even though a prion specific to bacteria has yet to be identified, prions or prion-like proteins might also contribute to the diversity of traits found in bacteria. Furthermore, since both yeast and bacteria form and propagate prions in similar ways, such protein-based inheritance might have evolved in these organisms' common ancestor over two billion years ago.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02949.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02949.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>prion</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>Sup35</kwd><kwd>ClpB</kwd><kwd>protein-based heredity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pioneer award, OD003806</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hochschild</surname><given-names>Ann</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate research fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Andy H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The bacterium <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> possesses a permissive cytoplasmic environment and the requisite molecular machinery to support the propagation of prions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Prions are infectious, self-propagating protein aggregates first described in the context of scrapie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prusiner, 1982</xref>), an example of a class of devastating neurodegenerative diseases known as the transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs). Specifically, the prion form of a protein known as PrP is the causative agent of the TSEs, which afflicts humans and other mammals. Native PrP (PrP<sup>C</sup>) undergoes a dramatic change in conformation upon conversion to its prion form (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>), forming distinctive cross-β aggregates termed as amyloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diaz-Espinoza and Soto, 2012</xref>). Highly resistant to denaturation and proteolysis, PrP<sup>Sc</sup> is infectious and templates the conformational conversion of PrP<sup>C</sup> molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Caughey et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Prion-like phenomena have also been described in budding yeast and other fungi. Since Wickner first invoked prions to account for two examples of non-Mendelian genetic elements in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigle and Lacroute, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wickner, 1994</xref>), the study of fungal prion proteins has resulted in profound advances in the understanding of prion biology, including the first demonstration that purified prion protein aggregates are infectious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maddelein et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">King and Diaz-Avalos, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>). In general, such prion proteins exist in either a native, soluble form or a self-perpetuating, amyloid form with spontaneous conversion between forms representing a rare event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lancaster et al., 2010</xref>). However, unlike PrP<sup>Sc</sup>, yeast prions do not normally cause cell death. Instead, they can act as protein-based genetic elements that confer new phenotypes on those cells that harbor them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">True and Lindquist, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tuite and Serio, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Newby and Lindquist, 2013</xref>). Fungal prion proteins have been found to participate in diverse cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coustou et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">True et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holmes et al., 2013</xref>). The conversion of these proteins to their prion forms typically results in a dominant loss-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigle and Lacroute, 1975</xref>). A particularly well-characterized example involves the essential translation release factor Sup35, which confers on cells a heritable nonsense suppression phenotype upon conversion to the prion form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Patino et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paushkin et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>Like other yeast prion proteins, Sup35 has a modular structure with a distinct prion domain (PrD) that mediates conversion to the prion form, [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>]. In the case of Sup35, the essential prion determinants, which include a glutamine- and asparagine-rich segment and five complete copies of an imperfect oligopeptide repeat sequence, lie in the N-terminal domain (N), whereas translation release activity resides in the C-terminal domain (C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ter-Avanesyan et al., 1993</xref>). A highly charged middle region (M) increases the solubility of native Sup35 and enhances the mitotic stability of [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2002</xref>). Together, Sup35 N and M function as a transferable prion-forming module (NM) that maintains its prionogenic potential when fused to heterologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li and Lindquist, 2000</xref>). A distinctive property of the Sup35 conversion process in yeast is its dependence on the presence of a pre-existing prion, designated [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>] for [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] inducibility factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Derkatch et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, yeast strains containing Sup35 in the non-prion form, [<italic>psi</italic><sup>–</sup>], support the spontaneous conversion to [<italic>PSI</italic><sup>+</sup>] only if they contain [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>], typically the prion form of the Rnq1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Derkatch et al., 2000</xref>). However, several other yeast prion proteins, including the New1 protein, have the capacity to function as [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>] in their prion forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derkatch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osherovich and Weissman, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the stable propagation of yeast prions—and thus, the heritability of their associated phenotypes—depends on the function of chaperone proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chernoff et al., 1995</xref>). Specifically, the AAA+ disaggregase Hsp104 is strictly required for the propagation of virtually all yeast prions characterized thus far, and several other chaperone proteins have been implicated in this process as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Liebman and Chernoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Winkler et al., 2012</xref>). Various lines of evidence support the view that the essential role of Hsp104 with respect to prion propagation stems from its ability to fragment prion aggregates and thereby to generate smaller seed particles known as propagons that can be efficiently partitioned to daughter cells during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paushkin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ness et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cox et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kryndushkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Higurashi et al., 2008</xref>). Accordingly, depletion or inhibition of Hsp104 in a prion-containing cell leads to prion loss in progeny cells.</p><p>The molecular processes underlying prion biology constitute at least two distinct phases, namely, (i) the de novo conversion of a protein from its native to prion form, and (ii) the subsequent propagation of the self-perpetuating prion form over multiple generations. While studies have demonstrated that the bacterial cytoplasm can support the de novo formation of prion-like aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sabaté et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fernándes-Tresguerres et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrity et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Espargaró et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gasset-Rosa et al., 2014</xref>), evidence for prion propagation—and thus, protein conformation-dependent heredity—in bacteria has remained elusive. We previously demonstrated that conversion of Sup35 NM to its prion form in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, depends on [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>], which is formed by providing the bacterial cells with the yeast New1 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrity et al., 2010</xref>). This [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>] dependence provides an experimental framework for distinguishing between the initial conversion and subsequent propagation phases of the prion cycle. In particular, the formation of prion-like Sup35 NM aggregates can be induced in bacterial cells containing the New1 protein; subsequent depletion of the New1 protein from these cells reveals whether or not the bacterial cytoplasm can support the propagation of the Sup35 NM prion in the absence of [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>].</p><p>Here we show that bacteria can propagate the Sup35 prion in an infectious conformation over at least ∼100 generations under conditions that do not permit de novo prion formation. More specifically, we demonstrate maintenance of the Sup35 NM prion over multiple rounds of restreaking in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells no longer capable of synthesizing the New1 protein. Furthermore, we establish that propagation of the Sup35 NM prion in <italic>E. coli</italic> requires the disaggregase activity of ClpB, the bacterial ortholog of Hsp104. The striking parallel between the requirements for both prion formation and prion propagation in yeast and bacteria, which are thought to have diverged more than 2.2 billion years ago, suggests that the paradigm of protein-based heredity may be more ancient than previously inferred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeSantis et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>E. coli</italic> cells can propagate SDS-stable Sup35 NM aggregates</title><p>Having previously shown that Sup35 NM can adopt an infectious amyloid conformation in the <italic>E. coli</italic> cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrity et al., 2010</xref>), we wished to determine whether or not <italic>E. coli</italic> cells could stably propagate Sup35 NM in its prion form.

The two fusion proteins were produced from compatible plasmids under the control of IPTG-inducible promoters. The plasmid encoding New1-mGFP (pSC101<sup>TS</sup>-<italic>NEW1</italic>) bore a temperature-sensitive origin of replication, enabling us to cure cells of New1-encoding DNA and thereby deplete cells of the New1 fusion protein. As an initial test of our experimental system, we introduced the plasmid encoding Sup35 NM-mCherry-His<sub>6x</sub> (pBR322-<italic>SUP35 NM</italic>) together with either pSC101<sup>TS</sup>-<italic>NEW1</italic> or an empty vector control (pSC101<sup>TS</sup>) into <italic>E. coli</italic> cells and induced the synthesis of the fusion proteins at the permissive temperature. After overnight growth, we detected SDS-stable Sup35 NM aggregates (‘Materials and methods’) only in cells producing the New1 fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As New1 can independently adopt an amyloid conformation in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrity et al., 2010</xref>), we also detected SDS-stable New1 aggregates in cells containing both fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We also examined cells by fluorescence microscopy.

Our experimental protocol is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We first induced fusion protein synthesis in cells transformed with pBR322-<italic>SUP35 NM</italic> and either pSC101<sup>TS</sup>-<italic>NEW1</italic> (experimental sample) or pSC101<sup>TS</sup> (control sample). These ‘starter cultures’ were grown overnight to allow for the formation of SDS-stable Sup35 NM aggregates in the experimental sample.

More specifically, the [<italic>PIN</italic><sup>+</sup>]-dependent de novo conversion of Sup35 NM to its prion form in our <italic>E. coli</italic> system enabled us to distinguish experimentally between the initial formation phase and subsequent propagation phase of the prion cycle. Under our experimental conditions, two of four cell lineages (L1<sub>E</sub> and L3<sub>E</sub>) maintained the prion for the duration of the experiment (that is, ∼100 generations), one lineage (L4<sub>E</sub>) maintained the prion for ∼80 generations, and one lineage (L2<sub>E</sub>) maintained the prion for ∼60 generations. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that prion propagation in <italic>E. coli</italic> requires the disaggregase activity of ClpB, the bacterial ortholog of Hsp104. We conclude that bacteria can support a chaperone-dependent, protein-based mode of heredity and speculate that the emergence of prion-like phenomena may have predated the evolutionary split between eukaryotes and bacteria.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Stability of prion propagation in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>As only two of four lineages retained the prion for the full duration of our experiments, propagation of the Sup35 NM prion may be less stable in <italic>E. coli</italic> than in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DiSalvo et al., 2011</xref>). However, as noted above, loss of the prion in two lineages was coincident with a dramatic drop in Sup35 NM fusion protein levels. Furthermore, this drop was evidently reversible as Sup35 NM fusion protein levels were restored in R4 of L2<sub>E</sub> without reappearance of the prion. We do not understand the mechanism underlying this reversible change in protein levels; however, we suggest that stochastic fluctuations in plasmid copy number may set the stage for such an event. We note that our experiments were performed in <italic>recA</italic><sup>−</sup> cells, which should prevent plasmid rearrangements that might lead to a permanent loss of fusion protein coding capacity.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Bacterial machinery capable of remodeling Sup35 NM aggregates</title><p>The question of whether or not ClpB can substitute for Hsp104 in promoting Sup35 prion propagation has been addressed in a number of studies yielding conflicting indications. On one hand, several in vitro studies have provided evidence that Hsp104 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shorter and Lindquist, 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeSantis et al., 2012</xref>), but not ClpB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeSantis et al., 2012</xref>), can fragment amyloid aggregates in the absence of auxiliary factors. Furthermore, whereas the presence of various combinations of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hsp70- and Hsp40-family proteins was found to modulate Hsp104 activity on amyloid substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeSantis et al., 2012</xref>), ClpB appeared to remain inert even in the presence of bacterial Hsp70 (DnaK), Hsp40 (DnaJ), and nucleotide exchange factor GrpE despite exhibiting robust activity on various disordered protein aggregates in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DeSantis et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, the results of several in vivo studies suggest that ClpB, in the presence of appropriate co-chaperones, is competent to support Sup35 prion propagation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tipton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reidy et al., 2012</xref>). Based on an analysis of the in vivo activities of Hsp104/ClpB chimeras, Tipton et al. argue that prion replication in yeast requires that Hsp104 collaborate with its cognate Hsp70 chaperone system. A logical inference from their work is that the inability of ClpB to substitute for Hsp104 in supporting Sup35 prion propagation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is an indirect consequence of the inability of ClpB to cooperate with fungal co-chaperones. More recently, Reidy et al. provided direct support for this inference. In particular, Reidy et al. found that ClpB supported prion propagation in yeast provided that DnaK and GrpE were present. Interestingly, the activity of the bacterial disaggregase machinery in yeast was dependent on the fungal Hsp40-family Sis1 protein, consistent with prior work implicating Sis1 as a necessary component of the chaperone network required for prion propagation in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Higurashi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tipton et al., 2008</xref>). Our work demonstrates that no exogenous fungal accessory factors are required for prion propagation in bacteria. Taken together, these observations argue that the amyloid remodeling activity of Hsp104 is an evolutionarily conserved feature of the Hsp100-family chaperones, an inference that is strongly supported by our finding that propagation of the Sup35 NM prion in <italic>E. coli</italic> requires ClpB disaggregase activity.</p><p>Despite the apparent prevalence of prions in the fungal kingdom, to date, no bacterial prion has been identified. Notably, the absence of cytoplasmic mixing during conjugation would preclude the discovery of prion-like phenomena by classic genetic approaches, which facilitated the discovery of prions in yeast based on the non-Mendelian inheritance of their associated phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cox, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aigle and Lacroute, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wickner, 1994</xref>). Nevertheless, recent bioinformatic analyses of prokaryotic proteomes have revealed that bacterial and archaeal genomes encode many proteins containing glutamine- and asparagine-rich prion-like domains resembling those found in most confirmed and putative <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> prions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alberti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Espinosa Angarica et al., 2013</xref>; Yuan et al., unpublished data). Moreover, it is becoming increasingly clear that Q/N-richness at the level of primary amino acid sequence is neither a prerequisite for prion conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taneja et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Suzuki et al., 2012</xref>) nor protein amyloidogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goldschmidt et al., 2010</xref>).

Your full submission has been evaluated by K (Vijay) VijayRaghavan (Senior editor) and 3 peer reviewers, one of whom, Peter Greenberg, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers all thought this was an elegantly executed study but in the end that it did not constitute enough of an advance to merit publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The specific reviews are self-explanatory. We are sorry we do not have better news at this time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors build on a previous study they published in which they showed that the yeast prion domain (Sup35NM) can take up an infectious prion form in a bacterial (<italic>E. coli</italic>) cell. In this important new paper they now go on to show that this prion form can be propagated over a large number of cell divisions in <italic>E. coli</italic> and that this propagation requires the Hsp104 bacterial ortholog of Hsp104, i.e. ClpB, to do so. They provide a very detailed description of their experimental strategy and, although the ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> to propagate the prion form of Sup35NM is certainly less efficient than one sees in yeast, nevertheless their data are convincing that propagation does indeed require ClpB. What they do not formally demonstrate is that it is the chaperone activity of ClpB that is important and this could be easily addressed by repeating their experiments with an appropriate ClpB mutant.</p><p>The chaperone activity of ClpB depends on its oligomerisation and its ATPase activity and numerous chaperone-defective mutants have been described. Such an experiment should be straightforward and well within the grasps of the authors. Given the important implications of their findings, i.e. that <italic>E. coli</italic> has the chaperone machinery to propagate a (heterologous) prion; I think it necessary that they demonstrate that it is indeed the chaperone activity that is essential. Of course it remains to be established if <italic>E. coli</italic> (or any other bacterial spp) has endogenous prion-forming proteins but the findings reported here give one confidence that they are there, we just have to find a way of detecting them. By showing the dependency on ClpB, the authors open up one strategy to do so.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript submitted by Hochschild and colleagues addresses the ability of <italic>E. coli</italic> to support propagation of the [PSI+] prion of yeast through the self-assembly and inheritance of aggregates of the prion-determining domain (NM) of the Sup35 protein. The significance of this work to the field and its ability to advance the current state of knowledge are somewhat limited:</p><p>1) Previous work from Hochschild and colleagues (Garrity et al. PNAS 2010) demonstrated that NM can form SDS-resistant aggregates that, when introduced into yeast cytosol, induce the appearance of [PSI+]. In the current work, the authors reveal that this state is maintained in <italic>E. coli</italic> through multiple generations and that its propagation, unlike its initiation, is independent of another yeast prion protein New1. These principles have been previously established in yeast, and it’s unclear how their extension into <italic>E. coli</italic> advances our understanding of the process or its evolutionary conservation.</p><p>2) The authors demonstrate that ClpB, the bacterial homologue of Hsp104, is required for propagation of NM aggregates in <italic>E. coli</italic>. Previous work from the Masison lab has demonstrated that, when expressed in yeast, ClpB and its Hsp70 co-chaperone DnaK are sufficient to support [PSI+], so the fact that ClpB can do so within its native environment is not surprising. Moreover, this result simply reports a genetic interaction without mechanistic insight. Is ClpB performing the same function in <italic>E. coli</italic> as Hsp104 does in yeast?</p><p>Together, these studies only represent an incremental advance over previous work in the field.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Yuan et al present evidence for the establishment of yeast prion propagation in the prokaryote <italic>E. coli</italic>. This is dependent on the presence of both the yeast PIN factor New1 and the bacterial Hsp104 homologue ClpB. A PIN factor is required for conversion of Sup35 from psi- to PSI+ (the prion form) and Hsp104 has long been known to be required for the propagation of nearly all yeast prions known. Thus the key finding of this carefully done paper is that ClpB the E coli homologue of yeast Hsp104 is also analogous (having the same function). Since most homologues are analogues and many yeast proteins can function in <italic>E. coli</italic>, at one level this result is not too surprising. It does however suggest that fundamentally there are no huge differences between the cytosol of yeast and <italic>E. coli</italic> in regards to prion propagation apart from the presumable absence of PIN factors in <italic>E. coli</italic>. This work sets the stage for further genetic analysis of yeast prion propagation in <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>Since both of these systems are genetically well characterized some overall conclusions about the fundamentals of in vivo prion propagation may well be able to be reached in future work, though such work is prone to false negative results as there can be many trivial reasons for lack of functional complementation when working in such evolutionarily distant systems. The authors make a distinction between prion establishment and prion propagation, but these are really more tightly linked as one cannot establish a prion without propagating it. They do come out on the side of ClpB and New1 both being required for prion propagation but indeed since both were simultaneously depleted in the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, it seems more likely that they are both required for both the establishment and propagation phases. Even given the fuzziness of the distinction is not clear if ClpB is required for the propagation alone or if it is just required for prion establishment. Does expression of NM make <italic>E. coli</italic> sick? If it does then that raises the possibility that strains that propagate prions are able to sequester it as a less toxic form. This in combination with the observation that the vast majority of ClpB+ colonies fail to propagate NM raises the possibility that <italic>E. coli</italic> host mutations are also necessary for prion propagation and that <italic>E. coli</italic> is coming up with various other ways to get around this sickness. The various forms of aggregates observed raises the issue of which are prion-like and which are non-propagating. The real definition of prion I guess is ability to propagate, more than its SDS insolubility. This distinction should be made clearer throughout the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02949.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] They provide a very detailed description of their experimental strategy and, although the ability of E. coli to propagate the prion form of Sup35NM is certainly less efficient than one sees in yeast, nevertheless their data are convincing that propagation does indeed require ClpB.

The reviewer suggests that it would be relatively straightforward to address this point by using appropriate ClpB mutants. Indeed, we have already initiated such experiments and aim to test two well characterized ClpB mutants that are (i) specifically deficient in ATPase activity and (ii) specifically defective in substrate translocation through the ClpB pore. We hypothesize that neither of these mutants will support propagation of the Sup35-NM prion.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>The manuscript submitted by Hochschild and colleagues addresses the ability of E. coli to support propagation of the [PSI+] prion of yeast through the self-assembly and inheritance of aggregates of the prion-determining domain (NM) of the Sup35 protein. The significance of this work to the field and its ability to advance the current state of knowledge are somewhat limited. […] Together, these studies only represent an incremental advance over previous work in the field</italic>.</p><p>In response to reviewer #2, we wish to clarify why we believe our findings are broadly significant. Specifically, our findings establish that prion biology can operate in the bacterial domain of life and thus they provide the first demonstration of protein-based inheritance in a non-eukaryote. Additionally, as pointed out by reviewer #1, our study lays the foundation for a search for endogenous prion-like mechanisms in bacteria (reviewer #1 says, “the findings reported here give one confidence that they [endogenous bacterial prion proteins] are there, we just have to find a way of detecting them. By showing the dependency on ClpB, the authors open up one strategy to do so”). The second reviewer’s assessment that our study represents only “an incremental advance of previous work in the field” appears to be in reference to the field of fungal prion biology. We agree with the reviewer that our findings do not significantly deepen the mechanistic understanding of prion propagation in the endogenous fungal system. Rather we believe that the significance of our work is that we have uncovered a foundation for prion biology in another domain of life.</p><p>The reviewer also suggests that our findings with regard to ClpB are “not surprising”. However, given a prominently published study from the Shorter lab, which concludes, based on experiments performed <italic>in vitro</italic>, that ClpB is incapable of remodeling prion-like amyloid aggregates, we believe our findings will be surprising to at least some investigators in the field. (In demonstrating that ClpB is capable of remodeling prion-like aggregates, our findings complement those from the Masison lab, which we discuss; we note, however, that Masison and colleagues found that the ability of ClpB to support [PSI+] in yeast was dependent on the fungal Hsp40-family Sis1 protein, whereas our work shows that no fungal accessory factors are required in the endogenous bacterial setting.) Specifically, our results and those of the Masison lab challenge a prevalent view in the yeast prion field – namely that the ability to remodel prion-like aggregates is an Hsp104 innovation specific to fungal systems. Instead, our results raise the possibility that this ability predates the split between bacteria and yeast and has been conserved in their respective chaperone systems.</p><p>Finally, the reviewer asks if ClpB is performing the same function in <italic>E. coli</italic> as Hsp104 does in yeast. As discussed above (response to reviewer #1), we agree that this is an important question and are currently performing experiments to address this point.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>Yuan et al present evidence for the establishment of yeast prion propagation in the prokaryote E. coli. This is dependent on the presence of both the yeast PIN factor New1 and the bacterial Hsp104 homologue ClpB.

The real definition of prion I guess is ability to propagate, more than its SDS insolubility. This distinction should be made clearer throughout the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer suggests that the distinction between prion establishment and prion propagation is a fuzzy one. We suspect that we did not make the distinction clear enough in our manuscript. We believe (i) that there is a clear conceptual distinction between the <italic>de novo</italic> formation phase and the propagation phase and (ii) that our <italic>E. coli</italic>-based system provides us with a rigorous experimental strategy to distinguish between these two phases. Conceptually, the <italic>de novo</italic> formation of prion-like aggregates from soluble protein within a given cell (which can be facilitated by protein overproduction) represents “establishment”, whereas the maintenance of these aggregates in progeny cells under conditions that do not permit <italic>de novo</italic> formation represents “propagation”. Accordingly, the strict [PIN+] dependence of Sup35-NM aggregate formation in our bacterial system allows for a clean separation between a <italic>de novo</italic> formation phase (which occurs in our “starter” cultures) and a propagation phase (which occurs after plating). Specifically, the detection of prion-like aggregates in cells that have arisen multiple generations after the loss of the vector encoding New1 (the source of [PIN+] in our system) is evidence for propagation (i.e. protein-based inheritance).</p><p>Based on these considerations (which we believe we can articulate more clearly in a revised text), we disagree with the reviewer’s comment that it is “not clear if ClpB is required for propagation alone or if it is just required for prion establishment”. If ClpB were required just for prion establishment, then depleting the cells of ClpB <italic>after</italic> the establishment phase would not have resulted in Round-1 progeny clones that uniformly lack prion-like aggregates (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s last substantive point: “The real definition of prion I guess is ability to propagate, more than its SDS insolubility. This distinction should be made clearer throughout the manuscript”. We will carefully revise the text to avoid confusion on this critical point.</p></body></sub-article></article>
