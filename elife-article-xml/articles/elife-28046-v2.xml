Upon nutritional starvation, the master regulator of meiosis Mei2 inactivates Mmi1, thereby allowing expression of the meiotic program. Here, we show that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Not4/Mot2 of the evolutionarily conserved Ccr4-Not complex, which associates with Mmi1, promotes suppression of meiotic transcripts expression in mitotic cells. Our analyses suggest that Mot2 directs ubiquitination of Mei2 to preserve the activity of Mmi1 during vegetative growth. Importantly, Mot2 is not involved in the constitutive pathway of Mei2 turnover, but rather plays a regulatory role to limit its accumulation or inhibit its function. We propose that Mmi1 recruits the Ccr4-Not complex to counteract its own inhibitor Mei2, thereby locking the system in a stable state that ensures the repression of the meiotic program by Mmi1.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fission yeast sexual differentiation</kwd><kwd>RNA degradation</kwd><kwd>protein ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>YTH-family RNA-binding protein Mmi1</kwd><kwd>meiosis inducer Mei2</kwd><kwd>Ccr4-Not complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007492</institution-id><institution>Fondation Bettencourt Schueller</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>prix Coup d'Elan 2009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Libri</surname><given-names>Domenico</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004097</institution-id><institution>Fondation ARC pour la Recherche sur le Cancer</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Projet Fondation ARC 1782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rougemaille</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-2016-CE12-0031-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rougemaille</surname><given-names>Mathieu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The RNA-binding protein Mmi1 targets its own inhibitor Mei2 for ubiquitination by the E3 ubiquitin ligase Not4/Mot2 in order to preserve its role in meiotic mRNA decay during vegetative growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell cycle switch from mitosis to meiosis is associated with profound changes in gene expression. In yeast, initiation of meiosis occurs upon nutrient starvation and depends on well-characterized signalling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto, 2010</xref>). Several hundred genes are induced thanks to specific transcription factors, which define the key steps of the meiotic program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mata et al., 2007</xref>). Previous work in <italic>S. pombe</italic> has revealed the existence of an additional mechanism that controls the onset of meiosis. An RNA degradation system selectively eliminates meiosis-specific transcripts produced during the mitotic cell cycle, thereby inhibiting sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>). Essential to this regulatory process is Mmi1 (<underline>m</underline>eiotic <underline>m</underline>RNA <underline>i</underline>nterceptor <underline>1</underline>), a member of the conserved YTH family of RNA-binding proteins that localizes exclusively to the nucleus. Mmi1 recognizes a <italic>cis</italic>-acting region within targeted mRNAs, called DSR (Determinant of Selective Removal), which confers nuclear exosome-mediated degradation. DSR regions are enriched in repeats of the hexanucleotide motif UNAAAC to which Mmi1 binds to via its C-terminal YTH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamashita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chatterjee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Touat-Todeschini et al., 2017</xref>). Mmi1 also associates to several coding and non-coding RNAs with fewer UNAAAC motifs, indicating flexibility in target recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kilchert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Touat-Todeschini et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several factors identified both by genetic screens and biochemical analyses, cooperate with Mmi1 to promote meiotic mRNA suppression during vegetative growth. Previous studies demonstrated a role for components of the 3’-end processing machinery as well as the canonical poly(A) polymerase Pla1 and the poly(A) binding protein Pab2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">St-André et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yamanaka et al., 2010</xref>). Mechanistically, it was first proposed that Mmi1 promotes hyperadenylation of targeted transcripts and binding of Pab2 onto mRNAs poly(A) tails, which in turn recruits the nuclear exosome subunit Rrp6 for degradation. Mmi1 was next found to associate and cooperate with the multi-subunit MTREC complex to mediate meiotic mRNAs suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yamashita et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Egan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Core components of this complex include the zinc finger-containing protein Red1 and the Mtr4-like RNA helicase Mtl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Egan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). MTREC is crucial for meiotic mRNA degradation and has been proposed to physically bridge RNA-bound Mmi1 to the nuclear exosome. Recent studies also reported an interaction between Mmi1 and the Ccr4-Not complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cotobal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ukleja et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>), the major cytoplasmic mRNA deadenylation machinery conserved from yeast to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wahle and Winkler, 2013</xref>). However, although Mmi1 recruits Ccr4-Not to its RNA targets in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cotobal et al., 2015</xref>) and stimulates its deadenylation activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Stowell et al., 2016</xref>), this function of the complex is not required for the turnover and the translation of DSR-containing meiotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cotobal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A subset of Mmi1-regulated genes is covered by repressive chromatin marks (i.e. dimethylated histone H3 lysine 9 or H3K9me2) during vegetative growth, which disappear upon developmental or environmental cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shah et al., 2014</xref>). Mmi1 and the MTREC subunit Red1 recruit the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4 to mediate H3K9me2 deposition and direct components of the RNAi machinery to these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zofall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hiriart et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tashiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shah et al., 2014</xref>). The function of Mmi1, Clr4 and RNAi factors in suppressing the expression of meiotic mRNAs in vegetative cells also prevents the incidence of chromosome missegregation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Folco et al., 2017</xref>). However, the contribution of heterochromatin and RNAi machineries to the silencing of Mmi1 targets is moderate. Rather, the post-transcriptional degradation pathway mediated by Mmi1, MTREC and the exosome is predominant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ard et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Upon nutritional starvation, Mmi1 is sequestered in an RNP complex, which allows translation of meiotic mRNAs and progression of the cell through meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>).

Phosphorylated forms of Mei2 are inhibited by 14-3-3 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sato et al., 2002</xref>) and are targeted for degradation by the proteasome in an ubiquitination-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otsubo et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Despite recent progresses, a full understanding of how Mmi1 cooperates with its cofactors during vegetative growth to prevent initiation of the meiotic program is still elusive. Using affinity purification and co-immunoprecipitation assays, we show that Mmi1, but not MTREC, stably associates in vivo with the evolutionarily conserved Ccr4-Not complex. This interaction is functionally relevant because integrity of the Ccr4-Not complex is required for meiotic mRNA suppression during vegetative growth. Surprisingly, we show that the RNA deadenylases Ccr4 and Caf1/Pop2 are dispensable for controlling the levels of meiotic transcripts, while the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Not4/Mot2 is essential for this process. Importantly, biochemical and genetic analyses suggest that Mot2 ubiquitinates the Mmi1 inhibitor Mei2 to functionnally inactivate the latter or to limit its steady state levels. Our results reveal that Mot2 is not responsible for the constitutive pathway of Mei2 turnover, which depends on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, but negatively controls Mei2 to preserve the activity of Mmi1. We propose that Mmi1 recruits the Ccr4-Not complex to fine-tune the levels or the activity of its own inhibitor Mei2, thereby sustaining efficient meiotic mRNAs suppression. Our data unveil an important role for the conserved E3 ligase Not4/Mot2 in providing an additional level of control to the repression of the meiotic program in vegetative cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The RNA-binding protein Mmi1, but not MTREC, associates with the Ccr4-Not complex in vivo</title><p>To obtain a comprehensive view of Mmi1 protein partners during vegetative growth, we affinity-purified a C-terminally TAP-tagged version of the protein and analyzed interacting proteins by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Even upon a roughly 100-fold Mei2 overexpression, we observed a proportional increase in Ubi-Mei2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>). This indicates that ubiquitination is not limiting and that the decreased level of Ubi-Mei2 in <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells is not the mere consequence of an overproduction of Mei2.</p><p>Together, these results are consistent with the notion that Mot2 ubiquitinates Mei2, which likely promotes its degradation and/or inhibits its activity.</p><p>Previous work showed that mutation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1 also triggers accumulation of Mei2 in vegetative cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2001</xref>).

This was due to a major effect on the turnover rate of Mei2, as shown by cycloheximide chase experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Note that because of the low levels of Mei2 in wild type cells and the relatively modest impact of Mot2 on Mei2 stability, it is not possible to reliably evaluate the differences in turnover rate between the wild type and <italic>mot2∆</italic> strains (see discussion). Consistent with a predominant role for Ubr1, ubiquitination of Mei2 was strongly decreased in <italic>ubr1∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–C</xref>). Live-cell microscopy of GFP-tagged Mei2 further substantiated the major requirement for Ubr1 in the control of Mei2 abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D</xref>).

Here, we report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit Not4/Mot2 of the Ccr4-Not complex strengthens the control exerted by the YTH-family RNA-binding protein Mmi1 on the repression of the meiotic program during vegetative growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our results suggest that Mmi1 recruits Mot2 to ubiquitinate its own inhibitor Mei2, although we cannot formally exclude that the ubiquitination activity of Mot2 impacts the function or levels of Mei2 in an indirect manner. Importantly, Mot2 is not involved in the constitutive pathway of Mei2 turnover, which depend on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1, but rather targets a fraction of Mei2 to prevent inhibition of Mmi1. This ensures the maintenance of Mmi1 in a functional state and the persistent suppression of meiotic mRNAs. Thus, Mmi1 has a dual role: in nuclear RNA surveillance, by targeting meiotic transcripts for degradation by the exosome, and in the regulation of protein ubiquitination, by recruiting Mot2 to Mei2. These results also reveal a novel role for the E3 ubiquitin ligase Mot2 in the control of sexual differentiation in fission yeast.</p><p>The existence of a regulatory circuit whereby a protein controls the levels or the function of its own inhibitor might hamper alterations in the activity of the protein (Mmi1) due to fluctuations in the levels of the inhibitor (Mei2), which might occur under given growth conditions. This, in turn, is expected to prevent variations in the levels of meiotic RNAs and their translation products, which might affect, directly or indirectly, the robustness of vegetative growth.</p><p>The need for buffering increased Mei2 production is the likely reason why Mot2 only affects the levels of meiotic transcripts during growth in minimal medium. In yeast, meiosis occurs upon exposure to nutritional starvation, which activates signalling pathways that converge towards the induction of a complex transcriptional program finalized to sexual differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto, 2010</xref>). Growth in minimal medium, when nutrients are available but limiting, might induce a partially analogous response, possibly anticipating the need for entry into meiosis. Indeed, we observed increased levels of Mei2 protein upon vegetative growth in minimal versus rich medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which might in principle be due to increased transcription, translation and/or protein stabilization. The low levels of Mei2 in rich medium even upon deletion of <italic>mot2</italic>+ suggest that the expression of the <italic>mei2</italic>+ gene is limited by transcription in these growth conditions. Conversely, the requirement for Mot2 ubiquitination activity to restrict Mei2 levels or activity in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) might suggest that Mei2 is post-translationally controlled in this context. Thus, Mot2 has an important role in controlling the levels of Mei2 under conditions where entry into meiosis is to some extent transcriptionally prefigured, but for which a no-return commitment is premature.</p><p>Higher levels of Mei2 in <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells could be due to increased Mei2 production, consistent with a known role of the Ccr4-Not complex in translational repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Miller and Reese, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collart, 2016</xref>). However, our data argue against this possibility because (i) the fraction of <italic>mei2</italic>+ mRNAs associated with translating ribosomes does not increase in the absence of Mot2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), (ii) the regulation of Mei2 by Mot2 requires Mmi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>), which localizes to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shichino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2016</xref>) and does not bind to <italic>mei2</italic>+ mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), and (iii) the absence of Mot2 does not lead to further increased Mei2 levels upon proteasome inactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Our results also exclude significant effects of Mot2 on <italic>mei2</italic>+ transcription and mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–D</xref>). Together with the demonstration that Mot2 ubiquitination activity is required for controlling Mei2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), these results suggest that mutation of Mot2 affects the stability of Mei2.</p><p>The turnover of Mei2 mainly depends on the E3 ubiquitin ligase Ubr1. Considering the steady state levels of Mei2 in <italic>ubr1∆</italic> and <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells, the Mot2-dependent degradation rate is expected to be approximately six times less active than that dependent on Ubr1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). This implies that Mei2 half-life might differ only by roughly 15% between wild type (in which both ubiquitin ligases are active) and <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells (in which only Ubr1 is active), which amounts to less than 1.5 min. This small difference, together with the very low levels of Mei2 in wild type cells, is the main reason why we could not reliably measure the impact of Mot2 deletion on Mei2 degradation rate. Because of this limitation, we cannot formally exclude the possibility that indirect effects may account for the increased Mei2 steady state levels in the absence of Mot2. Yet, we showed that higher Mei2 levels in <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells did not result from increased transcription and translation, pointing to the most parsimonious explanation that Mot2 impacts directly Mei2 turnover.</p><p>It is however unclear whether maintaining the levels of Mei2 under a given threshold is the main physiological role of Mot2 for controlling its activity or whether ubiquitination by itself is the key regulatory event. In the latter scenario, ubiquitination would be the primary Mei2 inhibitory event and Mot2-dependent protein degradation would ensue as a secondary consequence.</p><p>In vegetative cells, Mmi1 localizes to scattered nuclear foci to mediate meiotic RNAs degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sugiyama and Sugioka-Sugiyama, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yamashita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shichino et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sugiyama et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that Mot2 ubiquinates Mei2 to prevent its entry and/or its persistence in nuclear dots, thereby preserving the function of Mmi1. Ubiquinated Mei2 might then be directed more efficiently to the turnover pathway, thus explaining the impact of Mot2 on Mei2 steady state levels.</p><p>The control exerted by Mot2 (and Ubr1) on Mei2 levels is only part of the mechanism that prevents meiosis onset in vegetative cells. Although Mei2 levels in <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells exceed those observed in the wild type strain in minimal medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), this is not sufficient to induce ectopic entry in meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This observation suggests that additional events are required to activate meiosis and/or that another control exists on Mei2 that backs up the roles of the E3 ligases. Consistent with this latter hypothesis, the Pat1 and Tor2 protein kinases phosphorylate Mei2 to inhibit its activity and promote its degradation, and mutation of these enzymes or expression of a non-phosphorylatable form of Mei2 trigger ectopic entry into meiosis, even in haploid cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yamamoto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kitamura et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez and Moreno, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Otsubo et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the increased pools of Mei2 in <italic>mot2∆</italic> and <italic>ubr1∆</italic> cells might be partially inactivated by Pat1 and/or Tor2, thereby preventing full activation of the meiotic program.</p><p>A strict control on the inhibition of Mmi1 appears to be essential given the important role of this factor in suppressing mRNAs encoding meiosis-specific transcription factors that, in turn, control the expression of other transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mata et al., 2007</xref>). On the other side, the onset of meiosis might require abrupt changes in physiology, which could benefit from a faster response associated to releasing the inhibition of factors already present in the cell as opposed to synthesizing these factors de novo. Whether this also requires regulation of expression or activity of Mot2 is an important question and matter for future studies.</p><p>The function of Ccr4-Not in sexual differentiation in fission yeast is analogous to the role played by the metazoan complex in controlling developmental decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rouget et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nousch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Solana et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamaji et al., 2017</xref>). However, in these examples, the mechanism of action of the complex essentially relies on its deadenylation and translational repression activities. The YTH proteins Pho92 and YTHDF2, the budding yeast and human homologues of Mmi1 respectively, also recruit Ccr4-Not to regulate mRNA deadenylation and turn over (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du et al., 2016</xref>). In light of these findings, the control of Mei2 abundance by Mmi1 and the conserved E3 ubiquitin ligase Not4/Mot2 might provide another layer of complexity to the regulatory potential of the Ccr4-Not complex. Our work paves the way for addressing the conservation of this type of regulation in other networks and species.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fission yeast strains and growth media</title><p>The <italic>S. pombe</italic> strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Following removal of supernatants, protein precipitates were air dried and stored at −80°C prior to MS/MS analysis.</p><p>Precipitated proteins were digested overnight at 37°C by sequencing grade trypsin (12.5 μg/ml; Promega Madison, Wi, USA) in 20 μl of NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub>25 mmol/L. Digests were analyzed by an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA) equipped with a Thermo Scientific EASY-Spray nanoelectrospray ion source and coupled to an Easy nano-LC Proxeon 1000 system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). Chromatographic separation of peptides was performed with the following parameters: pre-column Acclaim PepMap100 (2 cm, 75 μm i.d., 3 μm, 100 Å), column Pepmap-RSLC Proxeon C18 (50 cm, 75 μm i.d., 2 μm, 100 Å), 300 nl/min flow, gradient rising from 95% solvent A (water, 0.1% formic acid) to 35% B (100% acetonitrile, 0.1% formic acid) in 98 min. Peptides were analyzed in the orbitrap in full ion scan mode at a resolution of 60000 (at <italic>m/z</italic> 400) and with a mass range of <italic>m/z</italic> 350–1550. Fragments were obtained with a Higher-energy Collisional Dissociation (HCD) activation with a collisional energy of 30%, and a quadrupole isolation width of 1.6 Da. MS/MS data were acquired in the linear ion trap in top-speed mode, with a dynamic exclusion of 50 s and a repeat duration of 60 s. The maximum ion accumulation times were set to 250 ms for MS acquisition and 60 ms for MS/MS acquisition in parallelization mode. MS/MS data were processed with Proteome Discoverer 1.4 software (Thermo Fisher scientific, San Jose, CA) coupled to an in house Mascot search server (Matrix Science, Boston, MA; version 2.5.1). The mass tolerance was set to 7 ppm for precursor ions and 0.5 Dalton for fragments. The following modifications were used in variable modifications: oxidation (M), phosphorylations (STY), acetylations (K, N-term), deamidations (N, Q), methylations (K), ubiquitinylation (GG and LRGG motifs on K amino acids). The maximum number of missed cleavages by trypsin was limited to 2. MS/MS data were searched against SwissProt databases with the <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> taxonomy. False Discovery Rate (FDR) for peptides was calculated using the Percolator algorithm and peptides were considered identified under the 1% FDR threshold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Coimmunoprecipitation</title><p>CoIPs were performed essentially as described in the previous section with the following modifications: 50 ODs of cells were grown at 30°C in EMM 0.5X and harvested by centrifugation.

It was previously determined by other studies that Mmi1 associates with the Ccr4-Not complex. Mmi1 is an RNA binding protein that targets Ccr4-Not to meiotic transcripts for their repression. The authors confirm this interaction and set out to determine how Ccr4-Not regulates the repressed transcripts. Contrary to expectations, deleting the deadenylase subunits, Ccr4 and Caf1, does not affect significantly the levels of meiotic transcripts. The lone catalytic subunit of the complex that does is Mot2 (Not4). This leads the authors to explore a role of the reported ubiquitin ligase promoting activity of Mot2 in the regulation of Mei2, another RNA binding protein. They find that the amount of Mei2 protein is increased in a <italic>mot2</italic> mutant, which is dependent on the RING domain, suggesting its ability to recruit E2s is important.</p><p>The discovery that repression is not mediated by deadenylation and may require the ubiquitylation function is interesting. The experiments presented are mostly convincing and done well. A weakness is that it is questionable if Mot2 directly ubiquitylates Mei2. This is outlined below.</p><p>- No direct evidence that Mot2 affects the stability of the Mei2 protein, such as pulse chase, is provided. In fact, the attempt to measure half-life using CHX in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> suggests that the half-life is equivalent in the wild type and <italic>mot2</italic> mutant. There is also no direct evidence that Mot2 ubiquitylates Mei2. The in vivo genetic evidence contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> suggests the shifted band (presumably ubiquitylated Mei2) migrating between 130-250 is the same in both the WT and <italic>mot2</italic> mutant. The normalization to total protein is not convincing. Furthermore, the result that the overall levels of ubiquitylation detected by 6HIS pulldown in the figure is not surprising since Not4 has multiple substrates. Could the authors perform a reciprocal experiment of IP'ing Mei2 (in the presence of proteasome inhibitors) and measuring ubiquitylation levels of this protein?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Ubiquitination-dependent control of sexual differentiation in fission yeast&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have shown that the impact of Ubr1 on the levels of Mei2 is much higher than the impact of Mot2. Based on the steady state levels of Mei2 in <italic>ubr1∆</italic> and <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells, it can be estimated that the rate constant for degradation of Mei2 by Ubr1 is roughly six times higher than the rate constant for Mot2-dependent degradation. This translates to only a difference of roughly 15% when comparing the half-life of Mei2 in wild type and <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells (e.g. 1.5 minutes difference for 10 minutes t<sub>1/2</sub>). Reliably measuring such a small difference is very arduous (if at all possible) considering the low levels of Mei2 in wild type cells and the constraints imposed by experimental errors.</p><p>We have attempted to improve detection of Mei2 in the wild type strain by using <sup>35</sup>S-methionine for a chase experiment. However, and contrary to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we observed that <sup>35</sup>S-methionine uptake was extremely inefficient in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>), which ultimately prevented use of this technique for the pulse chase. We also considered the possible existence of a very fast phase of Mot2-dependent degradation and attempted chase experiments with short time points after cycloheximide addition, but the general results were similar.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Kinetics of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine uptake in budding and fission yeasts.</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (BY4742) and <italic>S.pombe</italic> wild type cells were grown to exponential phase (OD = 0.3 and 0.45) in YNB (Yeast Nitrogen Base, 2% glucose) and EMMO.5X media, respectively. 50 µCi <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (EasyTag L-[<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine, NEG709A005MC, PerkinElmer) were added to 5 mL cultures and cells were collected using 0.2 µm filters at the following time points: 30 sec, 10 min, 20 min, 40 min and 60 min. Filters and aliquots of media depleted for cells were counted using a liquid scintillation counter (WALLAC 1409 DSA, Perkin Elmer) to determine the % of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine uptake (filled lines) and the % of <sup>35</sup>S-methionine remaining in the culture media (dashed lines). Blue and red curves refer to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> respectively.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-28046-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>Because of these experimental limitations, we have provided evidence that all the other steps in Mei2 production are not affected upon deletion of <italic>mot2</italic>+, notably transcription of the <italic>mei2</italic>+ gene, mRNA stability or mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Since the production of Mei2 is not positively affected in the absence of Mot2, the higher steady state levels of the protein can only be due to its slower turnover. Further supporting this notion, we have also shown that Mot2 and the proteasome function in the same degradation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>In the revised version of the manuscript, we have stressed that degradation of Mei2 might not be the primary cause of its inactivation by Mot2. Indeed, it is possible that the primary effect of ubiquitination is to functionally inactivate Mei2 or to regulate its localization, and that degradation is a secondary consequence of Mot2-dependent ubiquitination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also no direct evidence that Mot2 ubiquitylates Mei2. The in vivo genetic evidence contained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> suggests the shifted band (presumably ubiquitylated Mei2) migrating between 130-250 is the same in both the WT and mot2 mutant. The normalization to total protein is not convincing.</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> indeed indicate that the amount of ubiquitinated Mei2 is similar in both wild type and <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells, but the total levels of Mei2 are significantly higher in the mutant. The only possibility to estimate the fraction of ubiquitinated Mei2 in each strain is to normalize to total Mei2 levels. This would not be correct if Mei2 were distributed in different pools, only some of which could be ubiquitinated, in which case normalization should be done relative to the fraction that can be ubiquitinated, but there is no evidence for this, neither in our experiments nor in the literature. For clarity, we now provide immunoblots showing the decrease of Ubi-Mei2 species in the absence of Mot2 when similar amounts of total Mei2 are probed from wild type and <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To substantiate our claim, we analyzed the signals of Ubi-Mei2 in strains carrying the <italic>mts2-1</italic> proteasome mutation alone or in combination with the deletion of <italic>mot2</italic>+, which accumulate identical levels of total Mei2. In this context, we reproducibly observed a 2-fold decrease in the fraction of Ubi-Mei2 species in <italic>mts2-1 mot2∆</italic> versus <italic>mts2-1</italic> cells at the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>), in agreement with a role for Mot2 in the ubiquitination of Mei2.</p><p>Another possibility is that the higher levels of Mei2 in <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells somehow saturate the ubiquitination pathway (e.g. Ubr1-dependent). To rule out this scenario, we compared the fraction of Ubi-Mei2 in cells expressing endogenous levels of the protein (e.g. Mei23xFLAG) or overexpressing it (e.g. P3nmt1-3xFLAG-Mei2). Even upon a roughly 100-fold Mei2 overexpression, we could observe a proportional increase in Ubi-Mei2 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). This implies that ubiquitination is not limiting and that the decreased levels of Ubi-Mei2 in <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells are not due to an overproduction of Mei2.</p><p>These results, which strengthen our original conclusions, have been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the result that the overall levels of ubiquitylation detected by 6HIS pulldown in the figure is not surprising since Not4 has multiple substrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not intend to claim that the overall levels of ubiquitination are decreased in the absence of Mot2. The lower signal of ubiquitin conjugates observed in the <italic>mot2∆</italic> mutant in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> was rather due to experimental variability. We now provide a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> in which the amount of these conjugates is similar between strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors perform a reciprocal experiment of IP'ing Mei2 (in the presence of proteasome inhibitors) and measuring ubiquitylation levels of this protein?</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted such an experiment, but we had to rely on the detection of species bearing endogenous ubiquitin. As suggested, we pulled down Mei2 from cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 but consistently failed to detect Ubi-Mei2 species from the wild type strain, most likely because the protein and/or endogenous ubiquitin are not sufficiently abundant, even in the presence of the proteasome inhibitor.</p><p>Overall, we have performed additional experiments and added new data to the manuscript, which largely support our model. Our results indicate that Mot2 ubiquitinates a low but substantial fraction of Mei2 to preserve the activity of Mmi1 in meiotic mRNA suppression. We would like to add that several lines of evidence further support a direct role for Mot2 in the control of Mei2 levels and/or function: i) Mmi1 physically brings Mot2 to Mei2, ii) Mei2 accumulates in mutants of Mmi1 that cannot associate with the Ccr4-Not complex, similar to <italic>mot2∆</italic> cells and, iii) the catalytic activity of Mot2 is required to limit the cellular amounts of Mei2. We hope that our experimental results will convince the referees and the editor that our model is correct.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there is one remaining issue that needs to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>'The genetics supporting Mot2's function in regulating Mmi1 is compelling.
