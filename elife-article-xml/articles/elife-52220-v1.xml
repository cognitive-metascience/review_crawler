within discrete microenvironments is fundamental to understanding biological processes. A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) restrict the range of action of protein kinases within intracellular compartments. We exploited the AKAP targeting concept to create genetically encoded platforms that restrain kinase inhibitor drugs at distinct subcellular locations. <bold><underline>Lo</underline></bold>cal <bold><underline>K</underline></bold>inase <bold><underline>I</underline></bold>nhibition (<bold>LoKI</bold>) allows us to ascribe organelle-specific functions to broad specificity kinases. Using chemical genetics, super resolution microscopy, and live-cell imaging we discover that centrosomal delivery of Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora A (AurA) inhibitors attenuates kinase activity, produces spindle defects, and prolongs mitosis. Targeted inhibition of Plk1 in zebrafish embryos illustrates how centrosomal Plk1 underlies mitotic spindle assembly. Inhibition of kinetochore-associated pools of AurA blocks phosphorylation of microtubule-kinetochore components. This versatile precision pharmacology tool enhances investigation of local kinase biology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>In order for an animal cell to divide it needs to duplicate its DNA and split this genetic material equally between its daughter cells. This process, also known as mitosis, requires a number of different proteins that work together to coordinate this vital aspect of the cell’s lifecycle. For example, two enzymes known as Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora A (AurA) accumulate at specialized structures within the cell called centrosomes, where they receive signals from other parts of the cell to promote this process. Plk1 and AurA also operate at other locations in the cell, but it remains unclear whether these proteins have different activities at each individual location.</p><p>Current methods for measuring protein activities use drugs or genetic approaches that switch off the target protein’s activities everywhere in the cell. Now, Bucko et al. have developed a new tool named LoKI that is able to direct drugs to specific locations in animal cells to switch off a target protein’s activity only at these sites. The experiments showed that inhibiting the activities of Plk1 and AurA at the centrosomes led to defects that prolonged mitosis.</p><p>The new tool developed by Bucko et al. provides a means to more precisely study local events that occur in healthy and diseased cells. This will help us to understand how cancer and other diseases develop and may ultimately lead to new treatments for human patients with these conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>kinases</kwd><kwd>local signaling</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01DK105542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01DK119192-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM127621</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hehnly</surname><given-names>Heidi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM086858</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maly</surname><given-names>Dustin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-1762114</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bucko</surname><given-names>Paula J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM008268</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lombard</surname><given-names>Chloe K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetically-encoded platforms direct kinase inhibitor drugs to organelles to reveal new dimensions of local kinase signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein kinase inhibitor drugs are an emerging class of therapeutics for a variety of clinical indications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ferguson and Gray, 2018</xref>). These small molecules are also powerful research tools that can be used to discover new aspects of kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caunt et al., 2015</xref>). While ‘<italic>drugging</italic>’ individual kinases can establish their role in cellular events, this global approach cannot discriminate where or when these signaling enzymes operate inside the cell. Thus, designing pharmacological strategies that influence the spatial and temporal action of kinases is at the frontier of precision medicine.</p><p>Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora A (AurA) are important regulators of cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Combes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lens et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, ATP-competitive drugs that block their activity, such as BI2536 and MLN8237, ascribe functions to these kinases and are promising anticancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Steegmaier et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lénárt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asteriti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Manfredi et al., 2011</xref>). However, elucidating the individual spatial and temporal actions of Plk1 and AurA remains challenging as these enzymes continually change their location and activity throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruinsma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Joukov and De Nicolo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lera et al., 2016</xref>). As a result, global drug delivery strategies mask the unique contributions of each kinase at distinct mitotic structures. Moreover, standard drug regimens that saturate dividing cells with these compounds may increase off-target effects and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klaeger et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Plk1 and AurA have been implicated in the control of mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Combes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lens et al., 2010</xref>). The anchoring protein Gravin/AKAP12 participates in this process by forming a macromolecular complex with these enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehnly et al., 2015</xref>). A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) are scaffolding proteins that limit the scope of cell signaling events at distinct cellular locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scott and Pawson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esseltine and Scott, 2013</xref>). For example, anchored protein kinase A action is constrained to within 200–400 angstroms of the AKAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). This has led to the formulation of a signaling island model where catalytic activity of anchored kinases is restricted to the immediate vicinity of select substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Scott and Pawson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Esseltine and Scott, 2013</xref>). Likewise, anchoring of Plk1 and AurA occurs on a phosphorylated species of Gravin at Threonine 766 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehnly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colicino et al., 2018</xref>). Consequently, loss or disruption of this scaffold abrogates Plk1 and AurA organization at centrosomes and promotes mitotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehnly et al., 2015</xref>). Yet, an outstanding question that remains is exactly how do centrosome-localized pools of Gravin-anchored Plk1 and AurA coordinate mitotic signaling events.</p><p>In the present study, we first establish that Gravin is required for localizing active pools of Plk1 and AurA at mitotic centrosomes. We then develop a novel chemical-biology tool, LoKI (<bold><underline>Lo</underline></bold>cal <bold><underline>K</underline></bold>inase <bold><underline>I</underline></bold>nhibition), to probe the actions of Plk1 and AurA at defined subcellular locations. Finally, we demonstrate that local inhibition of Plk1 and AurA kinases at centrosomes and kinetochores disrupts substrate phosphorylation, spindle organization, and mitotic duration. Together, these studies decipher how activities of individual kinases at precisely defined microenvironments contribute to the global signaling events that underlie mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Gravin loss perturbs duration of mitosis and accumulation of Plk1 and AurA at centrosomes</title><p>Gravin depletion via shRNA-mediated knockdown perturbs mitotic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehnly et al., 2015</xref>).

To test this, we explored whether activity of centrosome-localized Plk1 and AurA is perturbed in cells lacking Gravin. We examined pT210-Plk1 and pT288-AurA immunofluorescence (measures of Plk1 and AurA activity, respectively) in HEK293 cells stably expressing a control or Gravin shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).

Immunoblot detection of mCherry-SNAP-PACT persisted up to 4 hr upon removal of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). As anticipated, mCherry-SNAP-PACT associates with centrosomes during interphase and mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Super-resolution structured illumination (SIM) imaging revealed that the SNAP-PACT construct (magenta) was labeled by CLP-fluorescein (yellow) at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>).

In parallel, a LoKI-off vector containing an inactivating mutation (C144A) in SNAP-tag was constructed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>). LoKI-off is unable to incorporate CLP-conjugates and serves as the control platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>Pulse-chase experiments were used to determine how efficiently CLP-BI2536 labeled SNAP-PACT. U2OS cells were treated with CLP-BI2536 (over a range of concentrations) to block CLP-rhodamine conjugation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Incubation with 250 nM CLP-BI2536 for 4 hr at 37°C was defined as the optimal drug regimen (~50% labeling of SNAP-PACT; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Next, we measured the pT210-Plk1 immunofluorescence signal as an index of active kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Erikson, 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). In mitotic cells expressing LoKI-off, incubation with 250 nM CLP-BI2536 reduced pT210-Plk1 immunofluorescence to 58.1% of DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,I</xref>). Strikingly, the pT210-Plk1 signal was reduced to 21.4% in cells expressing LoKI-on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). This trend persisted with lower CLP-BI2536 concentrations and even after a 1 hr washout of drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,J</xref>). Further validation confirmed that the reduction of pT210-Plk1 does not result from a loss in total Plk1 protein at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Additional controls established that inducible expression of LoKI-on was necessary to attenuate the pT210-Plk1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Immunoblot analyses of nocodazole-synchronized cells collected via mitotic shake-off further support these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

However, recent reports have implicated AurA as a modulator of microtubule attachment to kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chmátal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). At this location AurA phosphorylates serine 69 in Hec1, a subunit of the NDC80 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLuca et al., 2018</xref>). This local phosphorylation stabilizes microtubule-kinetochore interaction to safeguard chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeLuca et al., 2018</xref>). However, the proximity of centrosomes to kinetochores in early mitosis has hampered attempts to resolve the contribution of discrete AurA pools. Therefore, immunofluorescent detection of pS69-Hec1 served as an index for local AurA kinase activity at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). As before, counterstaining for α-tubulin (green) and DNA (blue) revealed the mitotic spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). In cells expressing Mis12-LoKI-off, incubation with 100 nM CLP-MLN8237 caused a negligible decrease in pS69-Hec1 signal as compared to DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,I</xref>). Conversely, in Mis12-LoKI-on cells the pS69-Hec1 signal was reduced to 59.8% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H,I</xref>). Representative heat maps further illustrate this phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>). Importantly, the pS69-Hec1 signal at centrosomes was unaffected by drug treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Amalgamated data from three independent experiments reveal that this trend persisted even at higher concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Immunoblot analyses of nocodazole-synchronized cells collected via mitotic shake-off further support our findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, when SNAP-PACT LoKI-expressing cells were used to sequester CLP-MLN8237 at centrosomes, we no longer observed a reduction in pS69-Hec1 signal at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data further support a role for AurA at the kinetochore. Ultimately, our findings illustrate how LoKI platforms can be adapted to pharmacologically investigate kinase signaling at distinct subcellular locations within the mitotic cell.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Cells have evolved a highly organized architecture that is segregated into functionally distinct microenvironments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). However, traditional methods of drug delivery do not account for this exquisite degree of molecular organization. Conventional approaches flood cells with bioactive compounds, masking the unique contributions of individual kinases at distinct subcellular locations. Although it is well established that Plk1 and AurA coordinate various aspects of cell division, current drug-targeting strategies limit our ability to decode the spatiotemporal regulation of these events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barr et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Combes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lens et al., 2010</xref>). Studying molecular scaffolds that form complexes with these key mitotic enzymes provides important mechanistic insight into how these processes are coordinated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehnly et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, designing pharmacological tools that restrict the spatial and temporal action of kinase inhibitor drugs is paramount to deciphering local kinase action. In this study, we discovered that the anchoring protein Gravin is required for organizing active pools of Plk1 and AurA at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). These data support previous findings in which Gravin loss led to increased Plk1 mobility and aberrant CEP215 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hehnly et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colicino et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we suggest that Gravin constrains enzymes in a signaling island to provide spatiotemporal control of kinase activity. Conversely, depletion of this anchoring protein alters Gravin-Plk1 and Gravin-AurA protein-protein interactions which underlie healthy cellular function. This further emphasizes a need for designing strategies that inhibit kinase activity locally. For this reason, we developed a novel chemical-biology tool, LoKI, to more precisely probe the actions of Plk1 and AurA at centrosomes and kinetochores. Previous work from Gower and colleagues utilized antibody mimetics to target promiscuous inhibitor drugs to specific kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gower et al., 2016</xref>). Our strategy advances this technology by combining AKAP-targeting domains with SNAP-tagging technologies. Additionally, we direct selective ATP-competitive inhibitors to specific subcellular locations to achieve local kinase inhibition. By combining biochemical approaches, quantitative imaging, and live-cell microscopy we reveal that local targeting of Plk1 and AurA kinase inhibitor drugs disrupts substrate phosphorylation, spindle organization, and mitotic duration more profoundly than global drug distribution. Thus organellar targeting of drugs offers a new means to advance the investigation of broad-spectrum kinases at precise locations.</p><p>Previous studies suggest that Plk1 phosphorylates pericentriolar substrates that coordinate γ-tubulin accumulation at mitotic centrosomes to facilitate microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lane and Nigg, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xu and Dai, 2011</xref>). We advance this concept and extend these findings by demonstrating that centrosomal inhibition of Plk1 prevents accumulation of γ-tubulin and correct organization of bipolar mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, by using the LoKI system we are able to definitively establish that Plk1 activity at mitotic centrosomes is a driver in these processes. Furthermore, the utility of LoKI drug targeting was underscored by our in vivo studies using zebrafish embryos. We provide evidence that embryos treated with centrosome-targeted Plk1 inhibitors have more microtubule abnormalities than those treated with a non-localized inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). These data implicate centrosome-localized pools of Plk1 in coordinating mitotic events such as spindle organization and mitotic progression during early zebrafish development. In a broader context, we show that local targeting of Plk1 inhibitors in developing organisms offers an innovative precision technique to probe local drug action.</p><p>Another key advance in our studies came with the discovery that AurA-mediated Hec1 phosphorylation is a spatially-coordinated event that occurs at kinetochores. We provide quantitative imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>) and biochemical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>) data that implicates AurA activity at this mitotic substructure. Although this kinase was originally thought to reside exclusively at centrosomes and mitotic spindles, our findings extend recent evidence for the existence of an AurA pool at kinetochores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeLuca, 2017</xref>). We reveal that kinetochore-targeted MLN8237 reduces pS69-Hec1 signal more drastically than globally distributed drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H–I</xref>). Our data suggest that even during prometaphase, when kinetochores may encounter centrosome-associated AurA, this phosphorylation is solely a kinetochore-associated event. Furthermore, when we target the AurA inhibitor to centrosomes and measure pS69-Hec1 at kinetochores we no longer see a loss of pS69-Hec1 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, we show that centrosome-associated AurA is not likely responsible for this phosphorylation event as has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chmátal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ye et al., 2015</xref>). More importantly, these findings uncover that S69-Hec1 phosphorylation is a local event that depends on AurA activity at kinetochores. This allows us to postulate that isolated pockets of AurA may act independently and concurrently to orchestrate complex cellular events.</p><p>The versatility of this new chemical-biology platform is demonstrated in three ways. First, this approach works in a variety of cell types and microinjection of LoKI mRNA into live zebrafish embryos permits local drug targeting in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We foresee that LoKI platforms will be adapted to acutely probe local signaling in other genetically tractable organisms. Second, while derivatized Plk1 and AurA drugs delineate roles for each mitotic kinase, conjugation of chloropyrimidine (CLP) to other ATP analogs offers a general method to synthesize localizable inhibitors for additional members of the kinome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gower et al., 2016</xref>). However, it is worth noting that the reduced cell permeability of certain CLP-drug conjugates, including CLP-BI2536, may necessitate their use at approximately 10-fold higher concentrations than the unmodified drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, derivatization of certain inhibitors may sterically hinder their access to the ATP-binding pockets of some kinases or, as is the case of the PKA antagonist H89, the lack of a functional group prevents CLP derivatization. Third, plasma membrane and mitochondrial targeting domains from AKAP79 and dAKAP1 expand the repertoire of subcellular compartments reached by LoKI platforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p><p>Although our strategy uncovers local contributions of anchored kinase pools within the cell, certain limitations to our current approach exist. For example, we treat cells for 4 hr with CLP-conjugated drug adducts to achieve sufficient inhibitor targeting (~50% of drug binding sites occupied; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). This is a relatively long time period in the context of measuring cell-cycle events. Likewise, in cells we find that high concentrations of CLP-drug (100 nM) are required to produce equivalent effects as 10 nM of non-derivatized MLN8237 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We postulate that reduced cell permeability of certain CLP-drug conjugates may account for both of the aforementioned findings. As a result, this necessitates long incubation periods and application of higher concentrations of drug. Finally, it is possible that kinase inhibitor drugs directed to centrosomes have off-target effects at nearby structures such as spindle microtubules. We envision that future advancements of this platform would include photo-caged inhibitors that are inert until they are ready to be released at the site of desired inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ellis-Davies, 2007</xref>). Employing this strategy would more strictly define the range of inhibitor action, provide another level of control to the LoKI system, and allow us to better delineate the effects of global versus local inhibition.</p><p>One exciting feature of our LoKI platform is the ability to co-localize CLP-drug combinations via a dual SNAP conjugation moiety (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Although in our study this allowed combined inhibition of Plk1 and AurA at centrosomes, we hope that future work will advance on our strategy and provide a system that utilizes multiple self-labeling enzymes to deliver distinct inhibitors to the same location. Employing orthogonal tagging systems such as CLIP-tag or Halo-tag in tandem with SNAP-tag could eliminate the possibility that CLP-BI2536 and CLP-MLN8237 compete for conjugation to the same targeting moiety. Nonetheless, by exploiting our knowledge of how AKAPs compartmentalize signaling enzymes we have developed tools that define the local kinase terrain at the angstrom level. This will allow investigators to probe local signaling events at a level of precision that has not been possible before.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alpha-tubulin, clone DM1A</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">T9026 <break/>Mouse <break/>monoclonal <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_477593">AB_477593</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alpha-tubulin-FITC, clone DM1A</td><td valign="top">Sigma <break/>Aldrich</td><td valign="top">F2168 <break/>Mouse <break/>monoclonal <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_477593">AB_477593</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Amersham ECL Mouse IgG, <break/>HRP-linked F(ab')₂ <break/>fragment (from sheep)</td><td valign="top">GE Life <break/>Sciences</td><td valign="top">NA9310</td><td valign="top">WB (1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Amersham ECL Rabbit IgG, <break/>HRP-linked F(ab')₂ <break/>fragment (from donkey)</td><td valign="top">GE Life Sciences</td><td valign="top">NA9340</td><td valign="top">WB (1:10000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Aurora A</td><td valign="top">Sigma Aldrich</td><td valign="top">SAB2500135 <break/>Goat <break/>polyclonal</td><td valign="top">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Centromere (ACA)</td><td valign="top">Antibodies Inc.</td><td valign="top">15-234-0001 <break/>Human <break/>polyclonal</td><td valign="top">IF (1:200)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Phospho-Aurora A (T288), clone C39D8</td><td valign="top">Cell <break/>Signaling</td><td valign="top">3079 <break/>Rabbit polyclonal</td><td valign="top">IF (1:500);

All immunofluorescence signal measures were carried out using Fiji software. Sum slice 32-bit Tiff projections were generated from z-stack images for analysis of immunofluorescence at centrosomes. For kinetochore measurements the ImageJ ‘SubtractMeasuredBackground’ macro was first applied and sum slice 32-bit Tiff projections were generated. For centrosomes measurements, the oval selection tool in Fiji was used to draw a circle (ROI) around the centrosome in the 568 (SNAP-PACT) channel. The area of the circle remained consistent for all measurements and all replicates of an experiment. Measurements were taken in the 647 channel (which contained pT210-Plk1, Total Plk1, pT288-AurA, or γ-tubulin) using the predefined centrosome ROI. Using the measure function in Fiji, with ‘Area’ and ‘Raw Integrated Density’ predefined as measurements, values were determined for each centrosome and for an arbitrarily selected background region. The raw integrated density was recorded for each centrosome and the background. The average raw integrated density for the centrosomes was determined by adding together the raw integrated densities for each centrosome in a cell and dividing that value by 2. The integrated density for the background was subtracted from the average centrosome integrated density to yield a background-subtracted average integrated density signal for a centrosome. If the signal value was negative (signal at centrosome was lower than at background) the value was replaced with a 0. For kinetochore measurements, the selection tool in Fiji was used to draw an arbitrary region (ROI) around the kinetochore in the 405 (ACA, centromeric DNA) channel or in the 568 (SNAP-Mis12) channel. Measurements were taken in the 647 channel (which contained pS69-Hec1) using the predefined kinetochore ROI. Using the measure function in Fiji, with ‘Area’ and ‘Raw Integrated Density’ predefined as measurements, values were determined for each kinetochore. The raw integrated density was recorded for each kinetochore. For both centrosome and kinetochore experiments and average was calculated for each control and experimental condition. To do this the normalized average integrated densities were added together and divided by the total number of cells for that condition. This yielded a value that represents the background-normalized average integrated density at a centrosome or at the kinetochore for a particular condition. Values for drug-treated cells were then normalized to their respective DMSO-treated control. Integrated intensity surface plots were generated from sum-slice 32-bit Tiff projections of representative images using the 3D Surface Plot function in Fiji software. Maximum intensity heat maps were generated from maximum projection representative images using the 3D Surface Plot function with Fire LUT in Fiji software. <bold>Zebrafish three-dimensional renderings</bold>: Three-dimensional renderings were created using Imaris software (Bitplane). Individual mitotic cells were isolated and assigned a new color channel using the ‘Surfaces’ function to create a surface rendering. Surface renderings were created through the use of the Isoline function, where regions of individual mitotic cells were isolated based on intensity. Completed surface renderings were then merged and masked to create a channel that encompassed the mitotic cells of each embryo.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistics were performed using an unpaired two-tailed Student's t-test in GraphPad Prism software.

information</title><boxed-text><sec id="s9"><title>Clarification of terminology</title><p>In this paper, LoKI refers to the general method/tool that can be utilized for studying local kinase action. In addition, LoKI-on refers to the presence of a platform that enables local kinase inhibition while LoKI-off serves as a control. For simplicity, we refer to cells that localize CLP substrates at defined subcellular locations as LoKI-on and those that globally distribute these substrates throughout the cell as LoKI-off (reflecting ‘traditional’ drug treatment paradigms). The former is always accomplished by doxycycline-induced expression of catalytically active (wildtype) SNAP moieties that can covalently bind CLP-compounds. Conversely, we have two ways to accomplish LoKI-off. In some experiments LoKI-off refers to cells that express SNAP tags containing a single amino acid change (C144A) in SNAP. This mutation results in a catalytically-inactive enzyme that is incapable of binding CLP. LoKI-off can also refer to non-doxycycline-induced wildtype SNAP cells. These cells lack SNAP expression entirely and thus are likewise incapable of localizing CLP substrates. Both our doxycycline-induced mutant SNAP and non-induced wildtype SNAP cells serve to mimic traditional forms of drug delivery in which small-molecule inhibitors are free to diffuse globally throughout the cell.</p></sec><sec id="s10"><title>Components of LoKI platforms</title><p>All LoKI constructs used in this study contain a fluorescent reporter protein, two SNAP domains, and a subcellular localization sequence.

The authors demonstrate the feasibility of this platform by targeting AurA and Plk1 inhibitors to centromeres or kinetochores. This strategy provides evidence clarifying the actions of centrosome- or kinetochore-localized AurA and Plk1. Overall, this is an interesting chemical biology study addressing the issue of local inhibition of protein kinases. The authors have gone a long way to exemplify a solution in cells and a model organism. The strategy demonstrated in this paper is exciting and will be of broad interest to the kinase field. We recommend publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but have a couple of comments that the authors should consider when preparing a revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Combined AurA and Plk1 inhibitions were done using a dual SNAP conjugation moiety (Figure 4F). In theory, it is hard to ensure that both CLP-MLN8237 and CLP-BI2536 would be recruited by a dual SNAP moiety. If technically feasible, it would be good if the authors can use orthogonal tagging strategies in tandem, such as SNAP-tag plus CLIP-tag, to demonstrate this point. Also, the authors should show the effect of either single drug in Figure 4H, which should be included as additional controls.</p><p>2) The authors claim that the LoKI platform can achieve local kinase inhibition. While the authors do provide evidence that 1) pS69-Hec1 signal at centrosomes was not affected if CLP-MLN8237 was directed to kinetochores (Figure 6G, H; representative images shown but better quantified) and 2) pS69-Hec1 signal at kinetochores was not affected if CLP-MLN8237 was directed to centrosomes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E), it would be good if the authors can perform off-target assessment using TPX2 phosphorylation in the condition that CLP-MLN8237 is directed to centrosomes. TPX2 phosphorylation by AurA occurs at spindle microtubules in the neighbourhood of centrosomes, and thus TPX2 phosphorylation presumably would be a better index to tell how local/leaky the LoKI platform is. This is also related to the fact that in vitro kinase assays showed that CLP-inhibitor conjugates work to inhibit their cognate kinase at around 100nM, which is c. 10-fold worse than the unconjugated inhibitor. When raising the CLP-drug concentration then inhibition becomes independent of the SNAP targeting protein. The authors should discuss these points in the manuscript.</p><p>3) One general concern is that the limitations of the approach are not discussed, giving the sense of an ultimate solution which is not the case. It would have been instructive to have had discussion of the timing problem – 4h is a long period of drug exposure and somewhat undermines the need for acute local intervention, particularly in these cell cycle associated events. Additionally, it is evident that effects are observable in relatively narrow windows in order to distinguish between global inhibition and local inhibition. This does not undermine the study but appropriate discussion would give direction to those following on. It is recommended that the authors comment and discuss the advance in technology from the work by Gower et al., 2016. Some comment is needed to address that Gravin knockdown leads to increased Plk1 mobility and CEP215 phosphorylation (10.1091/mbc.E17-08-0524). This relates to the principle of insulation of signalling (i.e. by sequestration). This emphasizes the need to be able to inhibit locally rather than just remove/mutate the scaffold responsible.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52220.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Combined AurA and Plk1 inhibitions were done using a dual SNAP conjugation moiety (Figure 4F).

There are three parts to our response.</p><p>a) We determined that the concentration of inhibitor required to bind ~50% of the available SNAP-tags in a 4 hour incubation window as 250 nM for CLP-BI2536 and 100 nM for CLP-MLN8237 (Figure 2F and Figure 4C). We agree that having one CLP-linked inhibitor targeted to SNAP while the other inhibitor derivatized to interact with a different self-labeling enzyme would be a logical extension of our work. However, in addition to synthesizing the new drug (compatible for interaction with CLIP-tag) and generating new constructs, we would need to validate that the modified drug still inhibits its target, is cell permeable, and establish a concentration regime that provides localized inhibition. Thus, while developing orthogonally-tagged versions may be technically feasible, this venture would require many months of work. In addition, there is no guarantee that cystozine-benzyl-BI2536 or cystozine-benzyl-MLN8237 adducts would retain their efficacy.</p><p>b) In an effort to respond to the reviewers' suggestion we have carried out mitotic duration experiments that examine the effect of either drug alone. The inclusion of this data in a new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 3) demonstrates the effect of individual inhibitors on mitotic duration. This material is discussed in the subsection “Combined Plk1 and AurA suppression at centrosomes more profoundly delays mitosis than global kinase inhibition”. An important conclusion from these added studies is that targeting single inhibitors delays mitosis to a lesser extent than combination drug-targeting.</p><p>c) In accordance with point 3 (see below) we have expanded the Discussion noting that “we hope that future work will advance on our strategy and provide a system that utilizes multiple self-labeling enzymes to deliver distinct inhibitors to the same location”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors claim that the LoKI platform can achieve local kinase inhibition. While the authors do provide evidence that 1) pS69-Hec1 signal at centrosomes was not affected if CLP-MLN8237 was directed to kinetochores (Figure 6G, H; representative images shown but better quantified) and 2) pS69-Hec1 signal at kinetochores was not affected if CLP-MLN8237 was directed to centrosomes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1E), it would be good if the authors can perform off-target assessment using TPX2 phosphorylation in the condition that CLP-MLN8237 is directed to centrosomes.

When raising the CLP-drug concentration then inhibition becomes independent of the SNAP targeting protein. The authors should discuss these points in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide three responses to point 2.</p><p>a) As per the suggestion we now provide quantification in support of our statement in the manuscript. We demonstrate that pS69-Hec1 at centrosomes remains unaffected by CLP-MLN8237 treatment over a range of concentrations. We hope that this new data in Figure 6—figure supplement 2A will help support our original claim. These new results are introduced in the last paragraph of the subsection “Targeting CLP-MLN8237 to kinetochores reveals that AurA-mediated Hec1 phosphorylation is a local event”.</p><p>b)The reviewers recommended that we look at TPX2 phosphorylation as a measure of AurA activity at spindles to assess the leakiness of the LoKI platform. While this is a thoughtful suggestion, it is not technically possible to conduct these studies with existing reagents. Previous work from Fu et al., 2015 has demonstrated that TPX2 phosphorylation (as assessed by gel mobility shift) is reduced when mitotic cell lysates are treated with AurA inhibitors in vitro. Although phos-tag analyses is a means to indirectly evaluate phosphorylation status of TPX2, there are currently no reagents to selectively evaluate AurA-dependent phosphorylation of TPX2 inside cells. Moreover, since TPX2 is enriched at centrosomes during early mitosis (Eibes et al., 2018) it would be unclear whether loss of TPX2 phosphorylation (assessed by phos-tag) was due to inhibition of AurA at centrosomes, spindles, or both. In order to respond to the reviewers’ suggestions we have expanded on these points in the Discussion. In the modified manuscript we envision that future advancements of this platform would include photo-caged inhibitors that are inert until they are ready to be released after binding to SNAP at the site of desired inhibition. This would provide another level of control and more strictly define the range of inhibitor action. This statement is introduced in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><p>c)With all due respect, we wonder if the reviewers may have misinterpreted our in vitro kinase data. We observed an IC<sub>50</sub> of &lt;9.5 nM for CLP-MLN8237 and an IC<sub>50</sub> of &lt;11 nM when CLP-MLN8237 is bound to SNAP (Figure 4B, Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). In cells, we find that high concentrations of CLP-drug (100 nM) are required to produce equivalent effects as non-derivatized MLN8237 (10nM). For comparison please see Figure 4E versus Figure 4—figure supplement 2B. We postulate that this is an issue with reduced cell permeability of certain CLP-drug conjugates which necessitates their use at approximately 10-fold higher concentrations inside cells. These points have been more clearly articulated in the Discussion (fourth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One general concern is that the limitations of the approach are not discussed, giving the sense of an ultimate solution which is not the case.

This includes commentary on the timing and concentration required to achieve sufficient targeting of our inhibitors and the issue of altered cell-permeability with our drug adducts (Discussion, fourth paragraph). We discuss how generating photo-caged inhibitor drugs would provide an additional level of control and allow us to better decipher the effects of global versus local kinase inhibition (Discussion, fifth paragraph). Additionally, we incorporate discussion on the advancements of our technology in relation to work by Gower et al., 2016 (Discussion, first paragraph). Finally, we cite Colicino et al., 2018 and provide a commentary on the need to develop novel drug-targeting strategies to better probe the local roles of Gravin-anchored kinases (Discussion, first paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
