Thus, spatial and temporal control of gene activity required during this crucial period must be imposed post-transcriptionally. Due in part to its relatively late zygotic genome activation (ZGA) and consequent reliance on maternally synthesized transcripts, <italic>Drosophila</italic> has served as a valuable model for studying post-transcriptional gene regulation. Mechanisms including mRNA localization, translational control, and mRNA degradation are critical for establishing the body axes, for germline development, and for the elimination of maternal transcripts during the maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) when maternal products are replaced by zygotic gene products.</p><p>Post-transcriptional control can be coordinated through the partitioning of mRNAs into ribonucleoprotein (RNP) granules. These non-membrane bound bodies serve to compartmentalize regulatory events within the cytoplasm, such as sequestration of translationally repressed mRNAs in stress granules and P bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guzikowski et al., 2019</xref>). RNP granules can also promote colocalization and co-regulation of mRNAs that function in the same biological process and the segregation of different mRNAs with conflicting regulatory needs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buchan, 2014</xref>). Such roles in colocalization and segregation are exemplified by granules in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> germ plasm.</p><p>Hundreds of mRNAs are highly enriched in the germ plasm, a specialized cytoplasm that forms at the posterior of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte and persists in the early embryo, where it induces the formation of the germ cell progenitors, called pole cells, and specifies germline fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jambor et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lécuyer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mahowald, 2001</xref>). Many of these mRNAs are co-packaged in RNP assemblies called germ granules, which coordinate their segregation to the transcriptionally quiescent pole cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerit and Gavis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>). Among these are mRNAs like <italic>nanos</italic> that function in germline development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kobayashi et al., 1996</xref>). Not all germ plasm enriched mRNAs are partitioned into germ granules, however. One such transcript, <italic>oskar</italic>, encodes a core germ granule protein whose synthesis at the posterior of the oocyte initiates germ plasm assembly. Production of Oskar is targeted to the posterior of the oocyte by transport of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to the posterior, where its translation is activated. Oskar protein then nucleates formation of germ granules with the recruitment of additional core granule proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehmann, 2016</xref>). As oogenesis progresses, <italic>nanos</italic> and numerous other transcripts populate the germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forrest and Gavis, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2015</xref>). By contrast, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is not incorporated into germ granules but forms large RNP bodies, together with the double-stranded RNA-binding protein Staufen, that contain several to hundreds of <italic>oskar</italic> transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2015</xref>). Because germ plasm formation begins with <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lehmann, 2016</xref>), we refer to the <italic>oskar</italic>-containing RNPs in the germ plasm as founder granules. Notably, although both germ granule destined mRNAs and <italic>oskar</italic> are highly enriched in the germ plasm by virtue of their respective granule association, the localized transcripts represent only a small fraction of their total masses in the embryo (≤4% and 18%, respectively) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergsten and Gavis, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Trcek et al., 2015</xref>). The majority remain distributed throughout the cytoplasm, where they are silenced by additional layers of post-transcriptional regulation and ultimately degraded during the MZT.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo develops as a syncytium in which nuclei undergo 13 rounds of semi-synchronous divisions (nuclear cycles; nc) before the major wave of ZGA and cellularization occur. The pole cells form precociously, however, during nc10 when cell membrane buds enclose nuclei that have entered the germ plasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas both germ granules and founder granules persist in the germ plasm after fertilization, only the germ granules become enriched in the pole cells. This distinction is important, as targeting <italic>oskar</italic> to germ granules and consequent accumulation of <italic>oskar</italic> in pole cells impairs germline development, decreasing the number of pole cells formed and disrupting their migration to the gonad during gastrulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2015</xref>). We now report that <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA itself, and not its capacity to produce Oskar protein, is toxic to pole cells. Such deleterious effects caused by mis-incorporation of <italic>oskar</italic> in pole cells highlight the need to sequester <italic>oskar</italic> from germ granule mRNAs within the germ plasm and to prevent its entry into pole cells.</p><p>Here, we investigate how incorporation of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA into pole cells is minimized, and the role of founder granules in this process. We show that, in contrast to germ granule mRNAs, <italic>oskar</italic> is degraded in the germ plasm beginning in nc7. This selectivity occurs through the recruitment of mRNA decay factors specifically by founder granules. The subsequent degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> results in founder granule destabilization and ultimately limits uptake of <italic>oskar</italic> by pole cells. Founder granules impart another level of spatiotemporal control by promoting <italic>oskar</italic> degradation in the germ plasm well in advance of the degradation of unlocalized <italic>oskar</italic> during the MZT. Finally, we demonstrate that degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> in the germ plasm occurs by a process distinct from the degradation of unlocalized <italic>oskar</italic> during the MZT and requires the Piwi protein Aubergine. Together, these results show how the fates of different mRNAs with similar localizations can be controlled by their compartmentalization into distinctive RNPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Incorporation of untranslatable <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA into pole cells impairs germline development</title><p>The adverse effects on pole cell development caused by forcing <italic>oskar</italic> into germ granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little et al., 2015</xref>) could be due to <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA itself or to an excess of Oskar protein in the pole cells. To distinguish between these possibilities, we targeted an untranslatable <italic>oskar</italic> transcript to pole cells. <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is translated to produce two isoforms, Long Oskar and Short Oskar, using two alternative start codons.

Consequently, founder granules were detected among the germ granules clustered around nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,H</xref>) and near the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>), suggesting that they can be passively incorporated in pole cells. Moreover, since founder granules do not disperse from the vicinty of the forming pole cells, uptake of <italic>oskar</italic> by pole cells must be limited by another mechanism.</p><media id="video1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-49988-video1.mp4"><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Behavior of germ granules and founder granules prior to pole cell formation.</title><p>Time-lapse movie of germ granules labeled with Vasa-mCherry (green) and founder granules labeled with GFP-Staufen (red).

In contrast, other mRNAs that remain packaged in RNP granules, like those in germ granules, would remain protected from the degradation machinery in the germ plasm.

Germ granules contain mRNAs necessary for germline development and promote the inheritance of these mRNAs by pole cells. Founder granules contain <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA, whose translation at the posterior of the oocyte is crucial for germ plasm assembly and germ granule formation but whose accumulation in pole cells is detrimental to germline development. We show that <italic>oskar</italic> RNA itself is toxic to pole cells, necessitating an early-acting mechanism to deplete <italic>oskar</italic> from the germ plasm. Our results indicate that founder granules minimize inheritance of <italic>oskar</italic> by pole cells by recruiting factors for compartmentalized <italic>oskar</italic> degradation.</p><p>mRNA degradation is a key feature of early embryonic development, with the majority of the maternal transcriptome turned over and replaced by the zygotic transcriptome during the MZT. Founder granule-associated <italic>oskar</italic> degradation is distinct from degradation of unlocalized <italic>oskar</italic>, <italic>nanos</italic>, and other maternal transcripts during the MZT both temporally and mechanistically. Degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> in the germ plasm occurs well in advance of pole cell formation whereas the majority of MZT-related mRNA degradation occurs after pole cells have formed. Consistent with this timing, <italic>oskar</italic> degradation in the germ plasm is mediated solely by maternal factors whereas <italic>oskar</italic> degradation in the bulk cytoplasm relies on both maternal and zygotic machineries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomsen et al., 2010</xref>). Unlocalized <italic>oskar</italic> and <italic>nanos</italic> are degraded with the same kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thomsen et al., 2010</xref>) and degradation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Laver et al., 2015a</xref>) during the MZT. By contrast, only <italic>oskar</italic> is degraded in the germ plasm and this degradation does not require Brain tumor or Pumilio, but depends in part on Aubergine. Moreover, redirecting <italic>oskar</italic> to germ granules results in its stabilization, akin to <italic>nanos</italic> mRNA. These results, together with evidence that <italic>oskar</italic> degradation precedes founder granule disassembly, indicate that the differential suceptibility of <italic>oskar</italic> and germ granule mRNAs in the germ plasm is imparted by properties of the granules in which they reside.</p><p>The selective degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> among the hundreds of different mRNAs that share the germ plasm derives from the exclusive ability of founder granules to recruit decapping and degradation machinery. An outstanding question is what triggers the recruitment of DCP1 to founder granules around nuclear cycle 5. Such a timer could be provided by an as yet unidentified protein whose translation is activated at fertilization and reaches a critical threshold by nuclear cycle 5, similar to temporal control conferred by Smaug during the MZT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benoit et al., 2009</xref>). Although DCP1 recruitment requires Aubergine, Aubergine protein is maternally contributed suggesting that it is not the timer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kronja et al., 2014</xref>). The requirement for Aubergine in <italic>oskar</italic> degradation is itself surprising. First, Aubergine is a core germ granule protein and has been shown to stabilize germ granule mRNAs through an interaction with the poly(A) polymerase Wispy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dufourt et al., 2017</xref>). Second, Aubergine has been proposed to mediate degradation of mRNAs during the MZT by both piRNA-mediated cleavage and recruitment of the RNA-binding protein Smaug and the CCR4-NOT deadenylase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barckmann et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>oskar</italic> degradation is Smaug-independent, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tadros et al., 2007</xref>). Whether Aubergine might also direct piRNA-mediated degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> in founder granules remains a question for future study but its requirement for association of DCP1 with founder granules suggests that piRNA-mediated degradation may not be the primary mode. Moreover, we did not detect colocalization of <italic>Aubergine</italic> with founder granules suggesting that Aubergine acts indirectly, perhaps by sequestering stability factors. Alternatively, cytoplasmic Aubergine might associate with founder granules only transiently or in small quantities.</p><p>Compartmentalization of <italic>oskar</italic> degradation in founder granules may also serve to increase efficacy. The concentration of up to hundreds of <italic>oskar</italic> molecules in founder granules may enhance interaction of <italic>oskar</italic> with the decapping and degradation machinery, increasing reaction rates so that the germ plasm load of <italic>oskar</italic> is sufficiently reduced prior to pole cell formation. Moreover, as non-membrane bound organelles, founder granules would create a hub, bringing the various components of the decapping and degradation machinery into close proximity. Our finding that founder granules are stabilized when <italic>oskar</italic> is stabilized, as in <italic>aubergine</italic> mutants, suggests that <italic>oskar</italic> RNA might regulate the properties of these granules, similarly to the role of RNA in dictating the physical properties of liquid droplets in vitro and in <italic>Ashbya</italic> cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Co-packaging in RNPs can facilitate the coordinated regulation of cohorts of mRNAs. Germ granules serve such a role by coordinating the delivery of mRNAs to pole cells. Do founder granules contain mRNAs in addition to <italic>oskar</italic> that are toxic to pole cells? Interestingly, under certain conditions, retrotransposon mRNAs can mimic <italic>oskar</italic> and localize to the germ plasm using the same transport machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tiwari et al., 2017</xref>). Founder granules might also therefore sequester and destroy retrotransposon mRNAs in the germ plasm, preventing their reinsertion into the genome and thus maintaining genome integrity. We suggest that whereas germ granules provide the pole cells with a maternal endowment needed for germline development, founder granules serve an opposing function to protect the germline from inheriting deleterious transcripts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and genetics</title><p>The following <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> alleles and transgenes were used: <italic>y<sup>1</sup></italic>, <italic>w<sup>67c23</sup></italic> (Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center [BDSC] 6599) as the wild-type strain; <italic>osk<sup>54</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lehmann and Nüsslein-Volhard, 1991</xref>), <italic>osk<sup>A87</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vanzo and Ephrussi, 2002</xref>), <italic>FRT40 brat<sup>11</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Frank et al., 2002</xref>); <italic>mnk<sup>P6</sup>, aub<sup>HN</sup></italic> and <italic>mnk<sup>P6</sup>, aub<sup>QC</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klattenhoff et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>pum<sup>ET3</sup></italic> (also called <italic>pum<sup>3</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 1992</xref>); <italic>pum<sup>Msc</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 1992</xref>); <italic>mCherry-vas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lerit and Gavis, 2011</xref>); <italic>GFP-stau</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schuldt et al., 1998</xref>); <italic>Me31B-EGFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buszczak et al., 2007</xref>); <italic>UAS-gfp-aub</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Harris and Macdonald, 2001</xref>). <italic>brat<sup>11</sup></italic> germline clones were generated by the autosomal FLP-DFS method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou and Perrimon, 1996</xref>).

Secondary antibody amplification was performed with Vectastain reagent according to the manufacturer's instructions (Vectastain Elite PK6100 ABC kit; Vector Labs) and detected using peroxidase immunohistochemistry. Embryos were mounted in 80% glycerol and imaged using Nomarski optics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Ovaries were dissected from female fed with yeast paste for 2 days at 25°C, then frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Frozen ovaries were homogenized in boiling 2 × sample buffer (0.125 M Tris-HCl pH 6.8, 4% SDS, 20% glycerol, 5 M urea, 0.1 M DTT, 0.01% bromophenol blue) and boiled for 5 min. Samples were spun for 15 min at 4°C and the supernatant was run on a 10% SDS-PAGE gel. The membrane was blocked 3 × 10 min in Blotto (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20, 5% nonfat dry milk). The membrane was then cut just below the 100 kDa marker; the top portion was incubated at 4°C overnight in Blotto with 1:10,000 rabbit anti-Kinesin heavy chain (Cytoskeleton Inc) and the bottom portion was incubated similarly with 1:2000 rabbit anti-Oskar (gift of A. Ephrussi). After washing 3 × 15 min in Blotto at room temperature, the membranes were incubated in 1:2000 HRP donkey anti rabbit antibody for 1.5 hr at room temperature. The membrane was washed 3 × 15 min in TBST (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% Tween-20). Antibodies were detected using the Lumi-Light Plus Western Blotting Substrate (Roche) and the blot was imaged using an iBright FL1000 Imaging System (Invitrogen).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>RT-qPCR</title><p>RNA was extracted from dechorionated embryos using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). 1 µg total RNA was used to generate cDNA using the Quantitect RT kit (Qiagen). 2 µl cDNA was combined with 25 µl 2 × TaqMan Gene Expression Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific), 2.5 µl of 20 × TaqMan Gene Expression Assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific, <italic>oskar</italic> custom – Dm02134535, 4351372 or <italic>RpL7</italic> Dm01817653, 4351372), and 20.5 µl of nuclease free H<sub>2</sub>O. qPCR was performed on an Applied Biosystems 7900HT standard 96-well qPCR instrument. Three biological replicates were performed with three technical replicates each, all using a CT threshold of 0.6613619. Technical replicates were averaged and copy number determined using previously established standard curves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eagle et al., 2018</xref>). Copy number of the three biological replicates was normalized to the <italic>RpL7</italic> control and shown as mean ± s.d.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to P Lasko, S Newbury, H Siomi, and D St Johnston for antibodies, P Macdonald for plasmid DNA, and P Macdonald, W Theurkauf, and E Wieschaus for fly stocks.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Michael Buszczak as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Eisen as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Francisco Pelegri (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this paper, Ruesch and Gavis describe two types of granules that are vital for germ plasm formation and germ cell development: germ granules and founder granules. During oogenesis, the protein <italic>Oskar</italic> initiates the formation of germ granules through the recruitment of various other core components. As oogenesis proceeds, various mRNAs, including nanos, continued to be recruited to germ granules. By contrast, <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is not, and instead populates a distinct type of granule that the authors refer to as founder granules. Work presented here shows that the separation of various mRNAs into these two distinct granules is important for the proper establishment of germ plasm. Ectopic recruitment of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA to germ granules results in a decrease in the number of pole cells during embryogenesis. Further work shows that this likely depends on <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA and not on any ectopic <italic>Oskar</italic> protein. The founder granules exhibit limited mobility and do not disperse during pole cell formation. Germ plasm localized <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA is degraded during pole cell formation, and correlative data suggests these transcripts are degraded with founder granules. This degradation depends on decapping enzymes and appears distinct from the degradation machinery that functions during the MZT. Interestingly, founder cell degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA does not occur in <italic>aub</italic> mutants. Consistent with this observation, <italic>aub</italic> mutants fail to recruit Dcp1 to founder granules.</p><p>The concept that there are multiple types of granules undergoing different fates fits well with and contributes new facets to the growing understanding of fluid phase compartmentalization, and as such the studies presented constitute an important first example of such processes. The properties of osk RNA, essential to generate the germ plasm, appear to be detrimental at later stages, perhaps through interfering with another related biophysical pathway. Thus osk RNA needs to be removed in a timely manner. This work will be of broad interest to the field.</p><p>However, the manuscript has a number of issues that should be addressed before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further characterization of founder granules and <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization to these structures is warranted. Is recruitment of the degradation machinery osk-dependent? Does the oΔn mRNA localized to the germ granules lack localization with these factors? Are there specific elements within <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA that drive its temporally specific degradation or is recruitment to founder granules sufficient to cause other mRNAs to be degraded. Do the authors have insights into what regions of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA are necessary for its toxic effects? Osk transcript degradation in mutants or knockdowns of <italic>Dcp1, Me31B</italic> and <italic>pacman</italic> should also be analyzed, if possible.</p><p>2) The role of Aubergine (and potentially piRNAs) in the degradation of osk, presented in Figure 6 is interesting, but not convincing and also lacks experimental support. First, the work cited implicating AUB in the degradation of osk in the bulk cytoplasm is itself not entirely convincing [Barckmann et al., 2015]. Second, and more concerning, the observations mentioned in the Discussion section that AUB localizes to germ granules and not founder granules undermines the data presented in this manuscript that a) DCP1 (and later ME31B and PCM) colocalize to osk founder granules associated with osk degradation; and (b) oΔn mRNA localized to germ granules (which contain AUB) does not undergo degradation. Therefore, the conclusion that AUB is involved in regulating osk degradation is not concrete, and the authors cannot conclude that AUB plays a role in the recruitment of DCP1 to osk in founder granules based on the data presented here. The authors should experimentally address these concerns or consider deleting the Aub section altogether.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49988.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further characterization of founder granules and oskar mRNA localization to these structures is warranted.

However, we have now shown experimentally that <italic>oΔn</italic> RNA in germ granules does not colocalize with DCP1, indicating that <italic>oskar</italic> RNA per se is not sufficient to recruit degradation machinery. We have added these data (Figure 4H,I.)</p><p>b) Currently, <italic>oskar</italic> is the only known founder granule resident RNA. We previously performed FISH for numerous transcripts that are enriched in the germ plasm but thus far have not identified any other RNA localized to founder granules. <italic>oskar</italic> localization is unusual in requiring splicing of the first intron to create a stem-loop localization element that acts in an unknown manner with the exon junction complex that is deposited during this splicing event. This localization signal mediates transport of <italic>oskar</italic> to the posterior during stages 7-10 of oogenesis. A second wave of <italic>oskar</italic> localization occurs at during stages 11-13, and it is not known what sequences in <italic>oskar</italic> mediate this localization. The bottom line is that we do not know how to drive RNAs into founder granules so we are not able to test whether recruitment to founder granules is sufficient to cause other mRNAs to be degraded.</p><p>c) Related to the point above, <italic>oskar</italic> is a very complicated RNA, with numerous elements that regulate various aspects of its transport, anchoring, and translational regulation scattered throughout the transcript. Dissection of the regions that control the degradation would take several years of work and is complicated by the need to avoid compromising these other functions – it is thus beyond the scope of this paper.</p><p>d) We do not know what regions of <italic>oskar</italic> are necessary for the toxic effects. C.E.E. (first author)'s thesis committee discouraged her from pursuing this question because they felt that she was unlikely to learn anything relevant to &quot;normal&quot; <italic>oskar</italic> function or germ cell development. We agreed that it was better to stay focused on upstream events (e.g., regulation of <italic>oskar</italic>) given limits of time and resources.</p><p>e) Unfortunately, is not possible to analyze <italic>oskar</italic> degradation in <italic>Dcp1</italic>, <italic>Me31B</italic> and <italic>pacman</italic> mutants because oogenesis is arrested. <italic>Dcp1</italic> mutants arrest at stage 6, Me31B mutant egg chambers degenerate at or before stage 10, and pacman mutant egg chambers degenerate after stage 9. We tried a partial knockdown of <italic>pacman</italic> by RNAi and although we observed a small effect, the data were highly variable and not statistically significant (likely due to the partial nature of the knockdown).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The role of Aubergine (and potentially piRNAs) in the degradation of osk, presented in Figure 6 is interesting, but not convincing and also lacks experimental support.

We have now performed a rescue experiment by expressing a functional <italic>gfp-aub</italic> transgene in <italic>mnk<sup>–</sup> aub<sup>–</sup></italic>females. We show that degradation of <italic>oskar</italic> is indeed restored by expression of <italic>gfp-aub</italic>. Moreover, we show that DCP1 is recruited to <italic>oskar</italic> in these embryos. We have added a figure (Figure 8) with these new data.</p><p>I had hoped to be able to test whether the unlocalized population of Aubergine that is not in germ granules is the relevant source by expressing GFP-Aub mutants that either cannot be methylated or cannot bind piRNAs and consequently cannot associate with germ granules (obtained from the Aravin lab). Unfortunately, these proteins appear to be toxic and <italic>mnk<sup>–</sup> aub<sup>–</sup></italic>females expressing them produce few eggs, all of which disintegrate rapidly after laying.</p><p>We have also toned down our conclusions in the Discussion. In particular, we say no longer state that Aubergine recruits DCP1 to founder granules because it implies a direct role for Aubergine. Rather we have changed the wording to state that recruitment of DCP1 to founder granules requires Aubergine and that Aubergine is required for <italic>oskar</italic> degradation. We suggest that the cytoplasmic pool of Aubergine could be the source and/or that Aubergine may act indirectly. Finally, we revised our citation of the previous work to say &quot;Aubergine has been proposed to mediate degradation of mRNAs during the MZT….&quot; which we also hope addresses the reviewer's concerns.</p></body></sub-article></article>
