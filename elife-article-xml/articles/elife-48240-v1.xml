We show that most yeast cells arrest in G1 before death with low nuclear levels of Cln3, a key G1 cyclin extremely sensitive to chaperone status. Chaperone availability is seriously compromised in aged cells, and the G1 arrest coincides with massive aggregation of a metastable chaperone-activity reporter. Moreover, G1-cyclin overexpression increases lifespan in a chaperone-dependent manner. As a key prediction of a model integrating autocatalytic protein aggregation and a minimal Start network, enforced protein aggregation causes a severe reduction in lifespan, an effect that is greatly alleviated by increased expression of specific chaperones or cyclin Cln3. Overall, our data show that proteostasis breakdown, by compromising chaperone activity and G1-cyclin function, causes an irreversible arrest in G1, configuring a molecular pathway postulating proteostasis decay as a key contributing effector of cell senescence.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>proliferation</kwd><kwd>Start</kwd><kwd>chaperone</kwd><kwd>G1 cyclin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2016-80234-R</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aldea</surname><given-names>Martí</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cells accumulate damaged proteins during aging and, by compromising the function of chaperones in folding newly synthesized G1 cyclins, proteostasis breakdown inhibits cell-cycle entry and drives yeast cells into senescence.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Like most other cell types, individual yeast cells display a finite lifespan as they undergo subsequent replication cycles and, due to their relative simplicity, have become a very fruitful model to study the causal interactions among the different hallmarks of cell aging. Since yeast daughter cells are rejuvenated during most of the mother cell lifespan, it is generally accepted that aging is the result of asymmetric segregation of factors such as extrachromosomal rDNA circles (ERCs), dysfunctional mitochondrial and vacuolar compartments, or resilient protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denoth Lippuner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Janssens and Veenhoff, 2016</xref>). Proteostasis deterioration is a universal hallmark of cellular aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>), and yeast cells have been the paradigm to study the mechanisms of asymmetric segregation of protein aggregates or deposits and their relevance in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Molecular chaperones play key roles in proteostasis by folding nascent polypeptides, refolding misfolded proteins, and facilitating their degradation or accumulation in different types of aggregates and deposits if they cannot be properly recycled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>). Yeast cells display an age-dependent protein deposit, termed APOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saarikangas and Barral, 2016</xref>), that appears early in their replicative lifespan and is retained in the mother cell compartment in every division cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2017</xref>). Several chaperones including Hsp104, Ssa1 and Ydj1 co-localize with the APOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>), where they are thought to play a concerted role in disaggregation and recycling of deposited proteins. Regarding asymmetric segregation of protein aggregates during cell aging, farnesylated Ydj1 has been shown to be important for proper retention of the APOD at the ER in the mother cell compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>). The functional relevance of chaperones at the crossroads of protein aggregation and replicative aging is supported by the fact that Hsp104 and Ydj1 are required for a normal replicative lifespan and, when overexpressed, Hsp104 restores proteasome activity in aging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>) and suppresses lifespan defects of <italic>sir2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, by counteracting protein aggregation, overexpression of metacaspase Mca1 extends the lifespan of yeast mother cells in a Hsp104- and Ydj1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The interdivision time of yeast cells increases during the last cycles before death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>) and most aging cells accumulate in the unbudded period before death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaney et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McVey et al., 2001</xref>), suggesting that aging-related processes interfere with the mechanisms that trigger Start to drive cells into the cell cycle. The Cln3 cyclin is a rate-limiting activator of Start that is maintained at low but nearly constant levels during G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tyers et al., 1993</xref>). Nuclear accumulation of Cln3 is driven by a constitutive C-terminal nuclear-localization signal (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Edgington and Futcher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Miller and Cross, 2001</xref>), but involves the essential participation of Ssa1 (or paralog Ssa2) and Ydj1 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vergés et al., 2007</xref>) and the segregase activity of Cdc48 to release the G1 cyclin from the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parisi et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, Ssa1 and Ydj1 also affect Cln3 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Truman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Yaglom et al., 1996</xref>), and their availability modulates the execution of Start as a function of growth and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>). Here we study the effects of proteostasis decline during aging on the availability of Ssa1 and Ydj1 chaperones and, hence, on G1 cyclin function, aiming to uncover the processes that restrain proliferation in aged cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aging cells arrest mostly in G1 with low nuclear levels of cyclin Cln3 after the last budding event</title><p>To analyze cell-cycle entry kinetics in the last generations prior to death, we first examined wild-type cells expressing Whi5-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>) in a CLiC microfluidics device (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) that had been developed for high-throughput analysis of single mother cells during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Goulev et al., 2017</xref>). As previously observed, the average interdivision time was rather constant during aging until the senescence-entry point (SEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>), when it displayed an abrupt increase that was maintained for ca. 2–3 generations on average prior to cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The SEP concurred with an increase in the length of both unbudded (G1) and budded (S-G2-M) phases of the cycle. However, as assessed by the localization of Whi5 in the nucleus to inhibit the G1/S regulon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>), the G1 period prior to Start (T1) of the last three cycles before death displayed the largest relative increase compared to young mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Accordingly, while only about 15% of young mother cells are found in T1 in asynchronous cultures, the percentage of cells dying in this G1 subperiod increased up to ca. 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, old cells selected with the mother-enrichment program (MEP) displayed a larger fraction in G1 compared to young mother cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These data point to the notion that the deleterious effects of aging on cell cycle progression are particularly severe in G1 and prior to Start.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48240.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Yeast mother cells die mostly in G1 with low nuclear levels of cyclin Cln3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A yeast mother cell (arrow) expressing Whi5-GFP during aging at the G1 phase of indicated cycles before death.

Nonetheless, old cells grew in volume after the last budding event at same rate as in the previous cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and, as a result of progressive lengthening of G1, their size rapidly increased during the last cycles before death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Our results agree with recent precise measurements of cell volume in aging cells until death in a different microfluidics device (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sarnoski et al., 2018</xref>). Overall, these data would rule out possible indirect effects of growth impairment on cell cycle progression in aging cells. On the other hand, the coefficient of variation in volume at the last budding event was 41.2%, while young cells displayed a reduced 20.2%, suggesting that cell size control at Start becomes less efficient as cells age.</p><p>To further characterize the observed defects in G1 progression in old mother cells, we carefully quantified the levels and localization of Whi5-GFP during the last cycles before death. In agreement with previous analyses of aging cells at the mRNA level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yiu et al., 2008</xref>), the overall cellular concentration of Whi5 did not change much during the last cycles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio oscillated normally in the previous cycles to the last budding event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), being high in G1 and low in the budded phases of the cycle due to Cdk-dependent phosphorylation and nuclear export of Whi5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>). However, after the last budding event nuclear levels of Whi5-GFP remained low for about 200 min on average, and rose again to stay high in 76.8% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), indicating that most cells completed the last cell cycle and arrested in the next G1 prior to death. Although the differences were not as large as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>), Whi5 levels in the nucleus displayed a 3-fold increase during the last cycles and the final arrest in G1.</p><p>Cln3 is the most upstream G1 cyclin acting in the positive feedback loop that inactivates Whi5 and executes Start (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Skotheim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tyers et al., 1993</xref>). Since Cln3 is too short-lived to be detected as a fluorescent-protein fusion in single cells, we used a hyperstable and hypoactive Cln3<sup>11A</sup> protein fused to mCitrine (mCtr-Cln3<sup>11A</sup>) that can be detected by fluorescence microscopy with no gross effects on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). As expected from its essential role in the nucleus, mCtr-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> displayed a distinct nuclear signal during the last cycles before the final budding event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>); however, the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio decreased to very low levels afterwards and remained low until death. In agreement with the fact that <italic>CLN3</italic> mRNA levels do not show significant changes in aged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yiu et al., 2008</xref>), overall cellular levels of mCtr-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> remained rather constant and similar to young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), ruling out major effects due to transcriptional or translational regulation of Cln3. In summary, our data suggest that aging cells would undergo profound alterations in the mechanisms that drive nuclear accumulation of cyclin Cln3 and, hence, delay G1 progression as observed in the last cycles before cell death.</p><media id="video2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-48240-video2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48240.006</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>Movie of a representative mCitrine-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> (yellow) cell in the CLiC microfluidic chamber.</title><p>Images were taken every 10 min.

Ssa1 and Ydj1, with the participation of Cdc48, are important for releasing the G1 Cdk-cyclin complex from the ER and promoting its nuclear accumulation to trigger Start. On the other hand, it is generally assumed that aged cells display severe defects in protein homeostasis, thereby leading to the accumulation of misfolded-protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kaushik and Cuervo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Labbadia and Morimoto, 2015</xref>). Thus, we decided to analyze the levels of Ssa1, Ydj1 and Hsp104 fused to fluorescent proteins during aging in the CLiC microfluidics chamber. Levels of Ssa1 and Ydj1 chaperones were only slightly reduced during the last cycles before death when compared to young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). By contrast, Hsp104 concentration rose steadily during aging until the last budding event (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>), when it reached a two-fold increase compared to young cells, and continued to increase afterwards during the posterior G1 arrest at an even higher average rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To confirm this result with a different experimental approach we used the mother enrichment program (MEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>) to select cells aged for ca. 20 generations and also observed an increase in Hsp104 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Observed changes in chaperone concentrations agree with previous analysis at the mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yiu et al., 2008</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>) levels, and suggest that cells sense proteostasis defects and, regarding to Hsp104, react during aging similarly to other stress instances in which chaperone availability is assumed to be temporarily compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>). As their engagement in protein interactions must cause a decrease in the diffusion coefficient of chaperones, their mobility has been used as a proxy of availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lajoie et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we used MEP-aged cells to analyze the mobility dynamics of Ssa1 and Ydj1 chaperones as GFP fusions by fluorescence-loss in photobleaching (FLIP). Notably, we detected a dramatic drop in mobility of both Ssa1 and Ydj1 when we compared aged cells with their young counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). This decrease was similar to that caused in young cells by L-azetidine-2-carboxylic acid (AZC), which induces the accumulation of misfolded proteins with chaperones into disperse cellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Escusa-Toret et al., 2013</xref>), thus compromising chaperone availability. By contrast, free GFP did not display significant changes in its mobility in aged or AZC-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since AZC treatment rapidly hindered nuclear localization of mCtr-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), these data point to the notion that aged cells would be impaired in their ability to accumulate Cln3 in the nucleus due to severe limitations in chaperone availability.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48240.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mobility and spatio-temporal coincidence of Ssa1 and Ydj1 are reduced in aging cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Levels of Ssa1-mCh, Ydj1-GFP and Hsp104-mCh (mean ±CL, n = 50) in aging cells aligned at the last budding event.

Briefly, RICS provides information on moving molecules from raster-scan confocal images by obtaining an autocorrelation function (ACF) from small arrays of pixels within the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). After fitting a free-diffusion model to the autocorrelation functions of Ssa1-GFP from young and aged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), a significant drop in the coefficient of diffusion (D) of Ssa1-GFP was detected in aged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), which was again similar to that observed in AZC-treated young cells. Moreover, a similar behavior was observed for Ydj1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>The intersection value of autocorrelation functions obtained by RICS depends on a second parameter related to the number of fluorescent molecules in the moving particles, termed brightness (B). Interestingly, aged cells displayed lower B values for both Ssa1-GFP and Ydj1-GFP compared to young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which would reinforce the notion that the behavior of these two chaperones is altered in aged cells, perhaps as a result of different transient interaction dynamics. Contrary to the diffusion coefficient, which can only be robustly estimated after pooling data from many cells and images per cell, particle brightness can be determined rather consistently at a single-pixel resolution in every image to generate B maps. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, Ssa1-GFP produced rather uneven B maps in young cells, displaying moving particles with more Ssa1-GFP molecules in compartments of the cell that did not particularly match the nucleus or the ER as assessed with an Ole1-mCh fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We have recently described a procedure, called coincidence analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno and Aldea, 2019</xref>), that uses B maps to study the spatio-temporal colocalization of molecular pairs undergoing transient interactions when performing their function, such as Ssa1 and Ydj1. As previously observed, Ssa1-mCh and Ydj1-GFP displayed a much higher coincidence coefficient compared to free GFP and mCherry and, giving support to its application as a functional indicator of these two chaperones, their coincidence coefficient strongly decreased in the presence of AZC. Notably, B maps of Ssa1-mCh and Ydj1-GFP were more dissimilar in aged cells, and displayed a much lower coincidence coefficient compared to young cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>), suggesting that these two chaperones form less dynamic complexes in aged cells. All in all, these data point to the existence of important defects in the availability and concerted activity of Ssa1 and Ydj1, two key chaperones in the mechanisms that maintain protein homeostasis, in aged cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Firefly luciferase aggregation takes place during the G1 arrest preceding cell death</title><p>Firefly luciferase (FFL) refolding and enzymatic activity recovery has been widely used to assay chaperone activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schumacher et al., 1996</xref>) and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nollen et al., 1999</xref>), and an FFL-GFP fusion has been used as a single-cell reporter of chaperone activity after protein denaturation by heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams and Morano, 2013</xref>).

Thus, we established a stochastic model based on the asymmetric distribution of protein aggregates that appear stochastically during consecutive cycles of division, taking into account that chaperones are key factors in two mechanistic modules: (1) counteracting protein aggregation reactions and (2) facilitating nuclear accumulation of cyclin Cln3 to phosphorylate Whi5 and trigger Start (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Since Cln2 interacts with Ssa1,2 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2009</xref>) and likely requires chaperoning activities similar to Cln3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>), the model used a simplified version of Start without the positive feedback loop, and made Start strictly dependent on Cln3.

First, we ran the model to simulate independent single cells, and stored all variables during consecutive cycles until a permanent G1 arrest was achieved, or up to a maximum time equivalent to 75 generations in wild-type cells under regular growth conditions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, simulated protein aggregates increased around the last budding event, causing a sharp decrease in available chaperones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and free nuclear Cln3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Notably, all these simulated variables displayed kinetics qualitatively similar to the experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref> <italic>insets</italic>).

Albeit surprisingly, our model predicted that chaperone overexpression would have a very limited effect on lifespan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> inset). By analyzing in detail the kinetics of Ydj1 levels and the appearance of protein aggregates in stochastic simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) we observed that, due the positive feedback loop inherent to autocatalytic aggregation, once the first protein aggregates appear they rapidly overcome Ydj1 levels by several orders of magnitude, thus making ineffective the relatively small (ca. 50%) increase in Ydj1 levels attained by GAL1p-driven overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yahya et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we analyzed the interdependencies of Cln3 and Ydj1 in lifespan determination.

Hsp104, Ssa1 and Ydj1 chaperones regulate endogenous prion formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shorter and Lindquist, 2008</xref>). Thus, we fused a synthetic prion-forming domain (PFD) to GFP under the control of a regulatable promoter, and used a non-prion peptide derived from PFD with the same length and amino-acid composition but altered sequence as a control domain (CD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Toombs et al., 2012</xref>). While these two peptides displayed similar disorder propensity, they exhibited very distinct prion-like properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). PFD, but not CD, produced SDS-resistant high-molecular-weight aggregates as assessed by agarose-gel electrophoresis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Moreover, when expressed in young cells, only PFD-mCh formed foci where Ssa1-GFP, and to a much lesser extent Ydj1-GFP, also accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We then analyzed the effects of these synthetic peptides on chaperone mobility by FLIP as above, and found that only PFD expression caused a clear reduction in the mobility of both Ssa1-GFP and Ydj1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), which decreased even further for Ssa1-GFP in cells displaying PFD aggregates (PFD*). These data suggest that PFD expression was able to compromise chaperone availability by sequestering Ssa1 in aggregates with low exchange rates. Next we analyzed the effects of heterologous protein aggregation on the nuclear localization of Cln3, and found that PFD overexpression was sufficient to decrease the nuclear levels of mCtr-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). Consistent with these results, PFD overexpression increased the average budding size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Sup35 is an endogenous yeast prion that accumulates in the APOD in aging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>). Thus, we overexpressed the yeast prion Sup35N domain and observed an increase in the budding volume of cells that showed Sup35N aggregates similar to those with PFD aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In marked contrast, a Sup35N<sup>m3</sup> mutant that does not form aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) did not affect budding volume. More important, overexpression of Cln3 suppressed the increase in budding volume caused by PFD aggregation with no effects on aggregate frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Finally, since chaperones play important roles in proper coordination of budding size with growth rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>), we analyzed the possible effects of the accidental presence of PFD aggregates in daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

These results give additional support to the notion that protein aggregation in young cells leads to a premature G1 arrest by specifically inhibiting chaperone- and G1 cyclin-dependent execution of Start.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>It is generally accepted that aging cells undergo many different deleterious processes that somehow restrain proliferation and ultimately lead to cell death. However, their specific relevance and cause-effect relationships are just starting to emerge. Here we show that most yeast cells arrest in G1 before death and display low nuclear levels of cyclin Cln3, a key activator of Start that is particularly sensitive to chaperone status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Parisi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vergés et al., 2007</xref>). By using several independent approaches, we show that chaperone availability is seriously compromised in aged cells, and we find that blockade of cell-cycle entry finely correlates with the appearance of visible aggregates of a chaperone client reporter. A mathematical model integrating the role of chaperones in proteostasis and cyclin Cln3 activation is able to recapitulate our observations in aging cells. Notably, overexpression of Cln3 increases lifespan in a chaperone-dependent manner. As also predicted by the model, overexpression of aggregation-prone proteins in young cells decreases chaperone availability and restrains nuclear accumulation of Cln3 and, hence, cell-cycle entry. Finally, lifespan shortening by enforced protein aggregation can be suppressed by increased expression of specific chaperones or cyclin Cln3. Overall, these data establish a molecular mechanism linking loss of protein homeostasis to proliferation arrest in aged yeast cells.</p><p>Our data agree with the recent observation that expression of G1/S genes is greatly compromised in aged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>), concurrently with an increase in the nuclear levels of Whi5. Since Whi5 is phosphorylated and exported to the cytoplasm by G1 Cdk-cyclin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">de Bruin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Costanzo et al., 2004</xref>), our observation that nuclear accumulation of mCtr-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> is hindered in aging cells would explain, at least in part, the increase in nuclear Whi5 and the deficiencies in the activation of the G1/S regulon. Cells lacking Cln3 display a dramatic delay in G1, but do not arrest at Start unless <italic>CLN1</italic> and <italic>CLN2</italic> are disrupted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Richardson et al., 1989</xref>). Thus, the observed final G1 arrest should also involve other mechanisms restraining Cln1/2 levels or activity. It has been recently proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>) that the accumulation of ERCs in aged cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shcheprova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sinclair and Guarente, 1997</xref>) could have a direct inhibitory role on the <italic>CLN2</italic> promoter at the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, ERCs increase their levels around the time when G1 progression displays a clear delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morlot et al., 2019</xref>). As an alternative view, since Cln2 interacts with Ssa1,2 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gong et al., 2009</xref>) and likely requires chaperoning activities similar to Cln3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>), our observations on Cln3 could also apply to basal levels of Cln1 and Cln2 and, hence, contribute to explaining the final G1 arrest.</p><p>Mitochondrial membrane potential has been shown to play a key role in dissolution of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2014</xref>) and loss of membrane potential correlates with the SEP in a fraction of aging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, vacuolar acidity declines early during aging, and conditions that prevent this decline ameliorate mitochondrial function and extend lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hughes and Gottschling, 2012</xref>). Related to this, the vacuolar protein Vac17 has been shown to be involved in asymmetric segregation of protein aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hill et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, we have observed that enforced protein aggregation in young cells increased vacuolar pH (our unpublished observations). These findings support the notion that mitochondrial defects, vacuolar dysfunction and accumulation of protein aggregates during aging would exhibit multiple functional interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hill et al., 2017</xref>), cell death being the result of many intertwined defects in key cellular processes. In addition, cells that keep growing while cell-cycle arrested undergo cytoplasmic dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Neurohr et al., 2019</xref>), eventually contributing to a general breakdown of cellular homeostasis.</p><p>In our experiments with the CLiC microfluidics chamber, a fraction of cells (ca. 30%) were not arrested in G1 at death and showed a slightly shorter lifespan, which agrees with published findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Delaney et al., 2013</xref>). PFD-overexpressing cells also displayed a similar percentage of death outside G1. Interestingly, enforced aggregation of the Rnq1 yeast prion causes a G2/M arrest with monopolar spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Treusch and Lindquist, 2012</xref>). In all, these observations suggest that proteostasis defects would also hinder cell-cycle progression and limit replicative lifespan after bud emergence.</p><p>Ydj1 cooperates with Hsp104 and Hsp70 chaperones to recycle misfolded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Glover and Lindquist, 1998</xref>), and improper recruitment of chaperones to misfolded proteins has very negative effects in lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanzén et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Ydj1 associates with the APOD playing a key role in its asymmetric segregation to the mother compartment during cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Saarikangas and Barral, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>). Ydj1-deficient cells are particularly short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hill et al., 2014</xref>), supporting the relevance of proteostasis mechanisms in lifespan determination. In agreement with this notion, overexpression of Hsp104 restores proteasome activity in aging cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>) and suppresses lifespan defects of <italic>sir2</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erjavec et al., 2007</xref>). However, enforced expression of Hsp104 did not increase lifespan significantly in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>). We obtained similar results by concurrent overexpression of Ssa1 and Ydj1. Albeit surprisingly, our model predicted that chaperone overexpression would have a very limited effect on lifespan. This output of the model would be explained by (1) the positive feedback loop whereby proteostasis decline is accelerated by the autocatalytic accumulation of aggregated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2013</xref>), and (2) the fact that client/chaperone ratios in molecule numbers per cell are intrinsically overwhelming. Nonetheless, the inability of chaperone overexpression to extend lifespan would also underscore the existence of chaperone-independent mechanisms affecting execution of Start in aged cells as above mentioned, such as ERC-mediated downregulation of G1/S genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression suppresses the G1 progression delay of Ydj1-deficient cells with no effects on the expression of related chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vergés et al., 2007</xref>), and we show here that high levels of Cln3 rescue the short lifespan of Ydj1-deficient cells. These data give support to the downstream role of Cln3 with respect to chaperones in the proteotoxic aggregation pathway. This interplay between Cln3 and protein aggregates through chaperone availability is simulated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>, where free Cln3 levels decay in aged cells as protein aggregates increase in an autocatalytic loop.</p><p>Aged cells display increased levels of expression of many genes of the environmental stress response (ESR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Janssens et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yiu et al., 2008</xref>), which suggests that cells would sense proteostasis defects during aging similarly to other stress instances in which chaperone availability is assumed to be temporarily compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Nadal et al., 2011</xref>). Since many ESR genes are also upregulated in G0 cells obtained by nutrient starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>), expression similarities between G0 and aged cells would be due to the ESR signature. However, <italic>RIM15</italic>, which is strongly upregulated by nutrient starvation but not by heat stress, is also upregulated in aged cells, indicating that G0 and aged cells might activate common transcriptional programs other than the ESR.</p><p>Proteostasis defects have been associated with cell aging in many different model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Klaips et al., 2018</xref>), and the key factors that maintain the proteome in a conformationally-active state are exquisitely conserved. On the other hand, as in yeast, human G1 Cdk-cyclin complexes require the participation of chaperones also involved in general proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diehl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hallett et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, we foresee that mechanisms similar to those shown here for yeast cells could also play a prominent role in restraining proliferation in aging human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

growth conditions</title><p>Parental strains and methods used for chromosomal gene transplacement and PCR-based directed mutagenesis have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>). Unless stated otherwise, all gene fusions in this study were expressed at endogenous levels at their respective loci. As C-terminal fusion of GFP or other tags has strong deleterious effects on Ydj1 function, we inserted GFP at amino acid 387, between the dimerization domain and the C-terminal farnesylation sequence of Ydj1. This construct had no detectable effects on growth rate or cell volume when expressed at endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Saarikangas et al., 2017</xref>). The mCitrine-Cln3<sup>11A</sup> fusion protein contains a hypoactive and hyperstable cyclin with 11 amino acid substitutions (R108A, T420A, S449A, T455A, S462A, S464A, S468A, T478A, S514A, T517A, T520A) that allows its detection by fluorescence microscopy with no gross effects on cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>). Centromeric plasmids and yeast artificial chromosomes containing chaperone genes were obtained by multiple-fragment recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>). Cells were grown for 7–8 generations in SC medium with 2% glucose at 30°C unless stated otherwise. GAL1p-driven gene expression was induced by addition of 2% galactose to cultures grown in 2% raffinose at OD600 = 0.5. 1 µM β-estradiol was used to activate the Mother Enrichment Program (MEP) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>). Azetidine 2-carboxylic acid (AZC) was used at 10 mM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Time-lapse microscopy</title><p>Cells were analyzed by time-lapse microscopy within the CLiC microfluidic device as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>) in SC-based media at 30°C essentially as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>) using a fully-motorized Leica AF7000 microscope with a 63X/1.3NA oil-immersion objective. The media was pumped into the microfluidic device at a rate of 20 μL/min. Time-lapse images were taken every 10 min. Time-lapse images were analyzed with the aid of BudJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>), an ImageJ (Wayne Rasband, NIH) plugin that can be obtained from ibmb.csic.es/groups/spatial-control-of-cell-cycle-entry to obtain cell dimensions and fluorescence data as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>); budding events were identified visually. Wide-field microscopy is able to collect the total fluorescence emitted by yeast cells and, consequently, cellular concentration of fluorescent fusion proteins was obtained by dividing the integrated fluorescence signal within the projected area of the cell by its volume. The nuclear compartment was delimited as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, the gravity center from brightest pixels in the cell was used as center of a projected circle with area equal to that expected for the nucleus (17% of the cell projected area). Since the signal in the nuclear projected area is influenced by both nuclear and cytoplasmic fluorescence, determination of the nuclear concentration required specific calculations as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>). Intracellular foci were detected with BudJ as pixels with a fluorescence value above a certain threshold relative to the median cell fluorescence that produced a contiguous area with a minimum size (both set by the user). In a typical set up, pixels were selected if at least 30% brighter than the cell median, with a minimal size of 0.4 μm. Photobleaching during acquisition was negligible (less than 0.1% per time point) and autofluorescence was always subtracted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Biotin labeling of the cell wall for aged cells detection</title><p>MEP-derived cells were labeled with Sulfa-NHS-LC-Biotin (Pierce) as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lindstrom and Gottschling, 2009</xref>), and seeded in SC medium with 1 µM β-estradiol. After ageing for 1 or 2 days, cells were collected using a 0.2 μm pore centrifuge filter and a soft spin. Cells were washed twice with PBS in the column and stained with a Streptavidin-APC conjugate solution (2 μg/ml in PBS) for 30 min at 4°; simultaneously, bud scars were labeled with a compatible WGA-conjugated fluorochrome at 20 μg/ml. Afterwards cells were washed twice with media and transferred to 35 mm glass-bottom culture dishes (GWST-3522, WillCo) before microscopy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Chaperone mobility analysis by FLIP and RICS</title><p>We used fluorescence loss in photobleaching (FLIP) to analyze chaperone mobility in a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope with a 40X/1.2NA water-immersion objective at room temperature. FLIP was used as a qualitative assay to determine Ssa1-GFP and Ydj1-GFP mobility in the whole cell. A small circular region of the cytoplasm (3.6 µm<sup>2</sup>) was repetitively photobleached at full laser power while the cell was imaged at low intensity every 0.5 s to record fluorescence loss. After background subtraction, fluorescence data from an unbleached cell region were made relative to the initial time point, and a mobility index was calculated as the inverse of the fluorescence half-life obtained by fitting an exponential function. We noticed a clear dependency of this mobility index on cell size. Using a dataset of cells with very wide size range and expressing free GFP, we obtained an expression to correct the mobility index for cell size with <italic>MI<sub>c</sub> = MI .r<sup>1.49</sup></italic> where <italic>MI</italic> is the raw mobility index, <italic>r</italic> is the cell radius and <italic>MI<sub>c</sub></italic> is the corrected mobility index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Raster Image Correlation Spectroscopy (RICS) analysis was performed in a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope with a 63X/1.3NA water-immersion objective; specifically, we used a 35 nm pixel size and 12.6μs dwell time, tacking a stack of 100 frames (2 s/frame) in photon-counting detection mode, at room temperature. To obtain the coefficient of diffusion, 64 × 64 pixel stacks were used to remove the immobile fraction with a five frame moving average and analyzed using a set of plugins written by Jay Unruh (Stowers Institute) for ImageJ. The resulting autocorrelation function (ACF) in the scanning direction, that is G<sub>RICS</sub>(ξ,0), for each cell was obtained and averaged for each group of cells to determine the diffusion coefficient (D) and the number of molecules in the focus (N) by fitting the data to a simple diffusion model. In order to assess the uncertainty of the predicted D values from pooled RICS data by non-linear regression methods we used a Monte Carlo approximation.</p><p>Coincidence analysis with RICS data was carried out with CoinRICSJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno and Aldea, 2019</xref>). Briefly, after removal of the immobile fraction as described above, the ACF of each pixel was obtained using a 16 pixel range only in the raster direction. The intercept obtained by linear regression of the ACF (no specific model of diffusion assumed) was used as an approximation of the inverse of the number of moving particles (N). Then, the fluorescence intensity (I) at each pixel was used calculate the brightness (B) parameter as B = I/N, which were assembled into B maps covering the whole image being analyzed. Finally, correlation between Bmaps was analyzed using the Pearson’s correlation coefficient, setting the threshold as the mean value in the B map. These correlation coefficients assess the degree of spatiotemporal coincidence of moving particles of the two proteins analyzed as a function of the number of fluorescent molecules per particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno and Aldea, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Lifespan analysis by MEP-induced microcolony size</title><p>MEP strains were grown as above, diluted to OD600 = 0.01, and plated in 500 μL at ~3·10<sup>4</sup> cfu/cm<sup>2</sup> onto 35 mm 2% agar plates containing SC medium with 2% glucose or 2% galactose and 1 µM β-estradiol. Once the plates were dry, they were incubated at 30°C for 4 days. Finally, the microcolonies were imaged using a Leica AF7000 microscope with a 20X/0.5NA dry objective. As a proof of concept for the method, we measured the microcolony size produced by cells pre-aged in liquid media with 1 µM β-estradiol for increasing amounts of time, and we observed a progressive decrease in microcolony size as a function of pre-aging time in liquid media before plating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The microcolony area was determined semiautomatically using an ImageJ macro (microcolony_size.ijm). Briefly, after thresholding and binarization, segmentation of adjacent microcolonies with the watershed function, and exclusion of the objects at the edge of the image, the area of particles (holes included) was measured. Microcolonies that were too small (with less than 4–5 cell bodies) or too big (microcolonies where cells had likely escaped from the MEP) were filtered out.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Integrative mathematical model</title><p>The wiring diagram used to describe the interaction between Start and the protein folding/aggregation pathway is described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>. We chose to focus only upon execution of Start because experimentally we found that over 75% of aging cells arrest in G1 before death. To simulate the rest of the cell cycle we run a fixed timer. The Start network was also simplified to a constantly diluting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>) Whi5 molecule that is phosphorylated and inactivated by fluctuating Cln3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2015</xref>), which requires the concerted action of Ssa1 and Ydj1 chaperones for full activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vergés et al., 2007</xref>). Thus, execution of Start was modeled to take place when a minimal Whi5 threshold was reached. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> also details the wiring diagram used to describe the protein aggregation pathway. This again is a simplified approximation and includes dimers (which are assumed to represent a pool of all non-nucleated oligomers) and hexamers (which are assumed to represent a pool of all nucleated oligomers). This drastically decreases the number of species in the model and the complexity of the system, and we specifically chose hexamers to represent the nucleated form as they appear to have a critical size for stabilization of the oligomer in aggregating proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breydo and Uversky, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xue et al., 2008</xref>). The Hsp104 disaggregase is required for disassembling large aggregates and works in conjunction with Ssa1 and Ydj1 chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Okuda et al., 2015</xref>). It is therefore included in the dissociation of nucleated aggregates (hexamers), but not in monomer or dimer refolding. Ssa1 and Ydj1 are also able to suppress aggregation, presumably by refolding monomers and other small oligomers that are not nucleated, so we allow the Ssa1/Ydj1 chaperones to bind and refold these states. It is assumed that refolding always adds to the folded protein pool and that chaperones are not released until the misfolded proteins are either degraded or obtain their correct conformation.</p><p>The wiring diagram was converted into a model using COPASI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoops et al., 2006</xref>) with chemical reactions shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. All chemical reactions are assumed to follow mass-action kinetics and, hence, every catalyst is placed on both sides of the chemical equation. However, we explicitly create states where the Ssa1/Ydj1 chaperones are bound to the protein, as opposed to acting as a catalyst, as this allows us to follow the pool of chaperones bound to protein aggregates. Regarding the chemical equations involving the chaperone, we take into account that larger aggregates bind more chaperones and assume a 1:1 chaperone to protein ratio. Following experimental observations, Hsp104 disaggregase is given a background concentration that increases upon accumulation of chaperone-hexamer complexes. We choose to model Hsp104 as a catalyst that does not have multiple bound and unbound states for simplicity.</p><p>In order to create full cell cycles, events were included to simulate Start and cell division when specific conditions are met. Inactivation of the Whi5 inhibitor by Cln3 is what triggers Start in the model. We assume that Whi5 has a decaying concentration during G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schmoller et al., 2015</xref>) and, arbitrarily, Start is executed when 75% of Whi5 molecules are inactivated. The remainder of the cell cycle is assumed to take a constant time for simplicity. At division nuclear Cln3 is set to zero and Whi5 to the same initial Whi5 concentration in the previous generation, thus replicating the result that as cells age, the number of Whi5 molecules observed at the beginning of G1 increases with the increase in cell size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Neurohr et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Parameter selection was completed by scanning the parameter space using deterministic simulations in COPASI so that the average replicative lifespan matched the average value observed in experiments with wild-type cells. We then perturbed the model parameters by 1, 10% and 25% to obtain various cell cycle mutants, as described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. The most biologically accurate perturbation for each mutant in deterministic simulations was used for all subsequent simulations in stochastic mode. We also ensured that the parameters produced biologically accurate values for Ssa1/Ydj1, Wh5 and Cln3 (10000, 1000, and 100 molecules per cell, respectively). In order to speed up simulations, overall folded protein was limited to 10<sup>5</sup> molecules per cell by increasing degradation of the folded protein pool, which is the final product of the process and does not affect the results of the model. Once the most biologically accurate parameter set was selected, time course simulations were run using a direct stochastic method that implemented the Gillespie algorithm to simulate aggregation as a stochastic process. The stochastic time-course simulations were run 75 times for each condition, in order to obtain the distribution and average of replicative lifespans. The final parameter set is listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. Due to the existence of backup mechanisms for <italic>CLN3</italic> (basal expression of <italic>CLN1,2</italic>) or <italic>YDJ1</italic> (<italic>SIS1</italic>), genetic ablation of these genes was simulated by applying different degrees of reduction in the concentrations of the respective proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Increases and decreases in parameters were selected by conducting parameter sensitivity analysis in deterministic mode at 1, 10, 25% intervals after which the most biologically accurate perturbation was selected for stochastic simulations in each scenario. Initial sizes of mutants are based upon experimental data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferrezuelo et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Miscellaneous</title><p>DNA-content distributions were obtained by Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gallego et al., 1997</xref>), with slight modifications to identify aged mother cells with labeled cell wall (see above) in a Gallios Flow Cytometer.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yves Barral as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by David Ron as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Nyström (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>In this study, Moreno et al. establish that old yeast mother cells show a strong increase in proteostasis defects in their last divisions, as measured by chaperone mobility, levels and localisation. In parallel, these cells fail to properly fold the G1 cyclin Cln3, as reported by its failure to enter the nucleus, and the majority of the cells arrest their last cell cycle in the G1 phase of the cell cycle before dying. Cells induced to accumulate an aggregating protein show a similar increase in proteostasis defects, defect in Cln3 localisation to the nucleus and cell cycle arrest in G1. Based on a quantitative in silico model of this process, model that is is largely corroborated by the data, the authors propose that the collapse of proteostasis titrates the chaperones that normally ensure the proper activity and localisation of Cln3 and thereby lead to cell cycle arrest. Supporting this model, CLN3 over-expression extends the life-span of these cells. All three reviewers found that this manuscript is very well written, the experimental design is generally appropriate for testing the authors' hypotheses, and the experiments are well executed and convincing.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>The fact that CLN3 over-expression extends the longevity of the cells whereas overexpression of the chaperones does not is actually confusing. This seems at odds with the statement that chaperones are the limiting factor – does overproduction of Cln3 bypass the need for chaperones or what is going on? Does CLN3 over-expression promote expression of chaperones? If this is not the case, then the model needs to be amended at this time as it might not be as straightforward, and linear, a relationship as the authors suggest. Indeed, this observation could support two independent conclusions: Either proteostasis defects are accumulating more rapidly than any chaperone increase could control (and then it would be interesting to understand why), or one or several other processes limit the lifespan of the cell together with proteostasis and are not mitigated by chaperone over-expression.</p><p>Depending on the results of the additional experiments requested, the title of the paper might need to be amended.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Proteostasis collapse halts G1 progression and delimits replicative lifespan&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

We have modified the text (subsection “Cln3 overexpression increases replicative lifespan in a chaperone-dependent manner” and Discussion paragraph five) to describe these data as follows: While Ydj1-deficient cells displayed a reduced lifespan as previously observed (Hill et al., 2014), concurrent overexpression of Ssa1 and Ydj1 did not increase lifespan significantly (Figure 5D). Albeit surprisingly, our model predicted that chaperone overexpression would have a very limited effect on lifespan (Figure 5D inset). By analyzing in detail the kinetics of Ydj1 levels and the appearance of protein aggregates in stochastic simulations (Figure 5E) we observed that, due the positive feedback loop inherent to autocatalytic aggregation, once the first protein aggregates appear they rapidly overcome Ydj1 levels by several orders of magnitude, thus making ineffective the relatively small (ca. 50%) increase in Ydj1 levels attained by GAL1p-driven overexpression (Yahya et al., 2014).</p><p>In addition, in the Discussion section (paragraph five) we mention that, similarly to our results with Hsp70/40, overexpression of Hsp104 restores proteasome activity in aging cells (Andersson et al., 2013) and suppresses lifespan defects of sir2 mutants (Erjavec et al., 2007), but does not increase lifespan significantly in wild-type cells (Andersson et al., 2013).</p><p>Finally, as we discuss in Discussion paragraph two, the accumulation of ERCs in aged cells (Shcheprova et al., 2008; Sinclair and Guarente, 1997) may play a more direct role repressing CLN1,2 expression (Neurohr et al., 2018). This would explain why, regarding lifespan extension, CLN3 overexpression is much more efficient than increasing chaperone expression levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Depending on the results of the additional experiments requested, the title of the paper might need to be amended.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that, considering also our data above, the title reflects the main findings of our work, particularly in view of the important effects caused by precocious PD-protein aggregation in lifespan, and their suppression by either G1-cyclin or chaperone overexpression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While there is clear enthusiasm about your study and its findings, the reviewers were still unanimously concerned about whether the overall conclusion, as claimed in the title is truly supported by the data.

We also accept that the initially proposed title was a bit ambiguous in this respect and we propose a new title as follows: “Proteostasis collapse, a hallmark of aging, hinders the chaperone-Start network and arrests cells in G1”. In line with this, the end of the Abstract has been modified to clarify the idea of a “molecular pathway postulating proteostasis decay as a key contributing effector of cell senescence.” In addition, although we had already addressed this point in our paper, the Discussion section has also been modified to emphasize the existence of other mechanisms as follows: “[…], the inability of chaperone overexpression to extend lifespan would also underscore the existence of chaperone-independent mechanisms affecting execution of Start in aged cells as above mentioned, such as ERC-mediated downregulation of G1/S genes (Neurohr et al., 2018).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It raises issues about the interpretation of how Cln3 over-expression promotes longevity.

If this were not to be the case, the reviewers would find it more appropriate to discuss the issue more thoroughly and tone down the main conclusion of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding your second point, we would like to point out that <italic>CLN3</italic> overexpression fully suppresses the requirement of the Ydj1 chaperone for cell cycle entry in young cells, with no effects on the expression of related chaperones (Vergés et al., 2007). We had interpreted this result as if retention of Cln3 at the ER was not a very efficient mechanism and could not cope with very high levels of translated Cln3. In any event, the above suppression would explain why, even if proteostasis is seriously affecting chaperone availability in very old cells, high levels of Cln3 would suffice to prolong replicative lifespan. We have added this comment to the Discussion section (paragraph five).</p></body></sub-article></article>
