for osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs; however, its regulation and molecular function during this process is not fully understood. Here, we revealed that the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus encoding PLZF, is repressed by Polycomb (PcG) and H3K27me3 in naive hMSCs. At the pre-osteoblast stage of differentiation, the locus lost PcG binding and H3K27me3, gained JMJD3 recruitment, and H3K27ac resulting in high expression of PLZF. Subsequently, PLZF was recruited to osteogenic enhancers, influencing H3K27 acetylation and expression of nearby genes important for osteogenic function. Furthermore, we identified a latent enhancer within the <italic>ZBTB16/PLZF</italic> locus itself that became active, gained PLZF, p300 and Mediator binding and looped to the promoter of the nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (<italic>NNMT</italic>) gene. The increased expression of NNMT correlated with a decline in SAM levels, which is dependent on PLZF and is required for osteogenic differentiation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>human mesenchymal stem cells</kwd><kwd>histone H3 lysine 27 tri-methylation</kwd><kwd>osteogenesis</kwd><kwd>developmental enhancer</kwd><kwd>Polycomb proteins</kwd><kwd>PLZF</kwd><kwd>ZBTB16</kwd><kwd>polycomb proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008390</institution-id><institution>Forskerakademiet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>09-073526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Agrawal Singh</surname><given-names>Shuchi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004191</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF17CC0027852</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helin</surname><given-names>Kristian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001732</institution-id><institution>Danish National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DNRF 82</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helin</surname><given-names>Kristian</given-names></name><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Klaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007052</institution-id><institution>Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Support Grant NIH P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Helin</surname><given-names>Kristian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R34-A3479</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hansen</surname><given-names>Klaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A key transcription-factor for osteogenic differentiation, PLZF, acts as a transcriptional activator by binding to active developmental enhancers and facilitates mediator recruitment, but is not involved in enhancer looping.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) possess self-renewal and multi-lineage differentiation potential toward osteogenic, chondrogenic and adipogenic specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pittenger et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Prockop, 1997</xref>). Therefore, hMSCs represent a promising resource for regenerative medicine. However, for treatment efficiency and safety, it is instrumental to obtain a thorough understanding of basic molecular mechanisms that control the orchestrated activation of lineage-specific genes, determining cell fate of hMSCs and factors that ensure maintenance of the terminal differentiated state(s). The adipogenic differentiation of MSCs have been extensively studied and have revealed that it consists of a cascade of transcriptional events that are driven by a series of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rosen and Spiegelman, 2014</xref>). However, the knowledge regarding osteogenic differentiation of MSCs is mainly limited to the activity of the key transcription factors RUNX2 and SP7 (osterix), and markers representing the different stages of differentiation such as proteins involved in matrix formation and mineralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karsenty and Wagner, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neve et al., 2011</xref>). Although it is well established that Polycomb (PcG)- and Trithorax (Trx)-group protein complexes are intimately linked to cell specification through gene repression and activation, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piunti and Shilatifard, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>), very limited information regarding these complexes are available in naive hMSCs and cells undergoing osteogenic lineage specification. Moreover, there is a considerable lack in understanding of the chromatin changes associated with enhancer activation that leads to lineage-specific gene transcription during differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells.</p><p>Enhancers are cis-acting DNA regulatory elements that function as transcription factor (TF) binding platforms, increasing the transcriptional output of target genes through chromatin topological changes involving enhancer-promoter looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Plank and Dean, 2014</xref>). Binding of lineage-specific TFs to enhancers is key to cell specification during stem cell differentiation and organism development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). However, the enhancer landscape that becomes active and regulates lineage-specific gene expression during osteogenic commitment has not been fully explored.</p><p>The <italic>ZBTB16</italic> gene locus encodes a BTB/POZ domain and zinc finger containing TF known as PLZF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 1997</xref>). Targeted deletion of <italic>Zbtb16</italic> in mice disrupts limb and axial skeleton patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barna et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2008</xref>), and although PLZF has been shown to be involved in osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djouad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ikeda et al., 2005</xref>), the underlying mechanisms of its function is only partly understood. PLZF has been described to have a dual function in transcription 1) as a gene repressor through interaction with HDAC1, mSin3a, SMRT and NCOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">David et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hong et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Melnick et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wong and Privalsky, 1998</xref>), and PcG proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barna et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boukarabila et al., 2009</xref>), 2) as a gene activator due to its positive impact on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doulatov et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hobbs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Labbaye et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu et al., 2009</xref>). These studies have been performed in other tissues and cell types than MSCs, such as hematopoietic and germline cells. In these cell types, PLZF is already expressed at the stem cells stage and found to be required for the maintenance of the stem cell pool. However, in MSCs, PLZF is expressed only in differentiating MSCs and not in naive cellsÂ (stemÂ cells), and its molecular function is so far unknown in these cells.</p><p>Through the use of genome-wide ChIP-sequencing and expression analysis, we now present evidence for a novel function of PLZF at developmental enhancers directing osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Interestingly, we find that the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> (PLZF) locus is bound and repressed by PcG proteins and extensively H3K27 tri-methylated (H3K27me3) in naive hMSCs. Upon osteoblast commitment of progenitor cells (pre-osteoblast stage), H3K27me3 demethylation takes place through JMJD3 (also known as KDM6B) recruitment to the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus, followed by extensive H3K27 acetylation and PLZF expression. Interestingly, upon expression, PLZF binds to a subset of enhancers, which gain H3K27 acetylation and correlates with induced expression of nearby genes important for osteogenic differentiation and function. Intriguingly, an initially PcG-repressed enhancer within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus becomes active in pre-osteoblasts, gaining PLZF, p300 and Mediator binding. By use of Chromosome Conformation Capture combined with high-throughput sequencing (4C-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">van de Werken et al., 2012b</xref>), we show that this <italic>ZBTB16</italic> intragenic enhancer âEnPâ physically contacts the promoter of the nicotinamide n-methyltransferase gene (<italic>NNMT</italic>) and regulate its expression during osteogenic differentiation.</p><p>Taken together, our data reveal that the activation of the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> (PLZF) gene locus is an important event during osteogenic differentiation. PLZF regulates osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs through binding at gene enhancers and thereby it positively affects transcription of lineage-specific genes. The enhancer, EnP, localized within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus is an example of a latent developmental enhancer that becomes active upon differentiation and regulates <italic>NNMT</italic> expression in a PLZF-dependent manner through Mediator and RNA-PolII recruitment and enhancer-promoter looping.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus is activated during early osteogenic differentiation</title><p>To understand the transcriptional events that control the osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, we performed RNA-seq analysis for global expression levels and ChIP-seq analysis for histone marks known to be associated with transcriptionally repressed (H3K27me3) and active (H3K4me3, H3K27ac) gene loci. We looked for the changes taking place at an early time point of differentiation (10 days) as compared to naive hMSCs (day 0). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> shows the timeline of osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kulterer et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Neve et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Qi et al., 2003</xref>). The time point chosen for our analyses was based on prior microarray analyses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>), and an inÂ situ calcium staining assay and western blots, which revealed day 10 as a timepoint where progenitor cells have committed to the osteoblast lineage, but cells are still far from the mineralization stage that takes place between day 15 and day 21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). We will refer to the cells at this stage as immature osteoblasts (day 10) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two days after adding the osteogenic differentiation medium, the hMSCs are still proliferating (data not shown), which is supported by the expression of cyclin E and the presence of hyperphosphorylated pRB2 (p130) as revealed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>).

We identified 2,282 PLZF peaks that were observed only in immature osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). The analysis revealed that the majority of PLZF-binding sites localized at intergenic (45.5%) and intronic regions (34.7%) combined representing 1,830 out of 2,282 PLZF-binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

Discriminative <italic>de novo</italic> motif analysis of the DNA sequences within the PLZF peaks, compared to sequences from negative control regions, revealed a significant occurrence of a TACAGC motif (EÂ =Â 1.1Â ÃÂ 10<sup>â81</sup>), which is highly similar to the TAC(T/A)GTA PLZF motif identified by Ivins et al.

It has previously been suggested that PLZF functions as a repressor of gene transcription and has a link to PcG recruitment. Therefore, we were surprised to observe a very limited co-occurrence of PLZF with PRC1 (RNF2) and PRC2 (SUZ12) as well as the H3K27me3 repressive mark catalyzed by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). In contrast, there was a clear co-occurrence of PLZF binding, with H3K27ac and H3K4me1, histone marks characterizing active gene enhancers (H3K27ac, H3K4me1)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>) and promoters (H3K27ac). However, the number of gene promoters bound by PLZF was very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), indicating that the majority of PLZF-bound regions represent active gene enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>PLZF is recruited to gene enhancers in immature osteoblasts</title><p>Activating transcription factors often recruit histone acetyl transferases (HATs) leading to H3K27 acetylation as part of the gene activation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>). To investigate if PLZF during osteogenic differentiation would lead to increased H3K27ac at its binding sites, we next analyzed the levels of H3K27ac before and after PLZF recruitment genome wide. As evident in the ratio-metric heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), approximately 18% of the 2,282 genomic sites binding PLZF, gained H3K27ac (â¥Â 2 fold, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) upon osteogenic differentiation (red-colored population), whereas 81% of PLZF-bound regions retained their H3K27ac pattern (green-colored population). A small subset of PLZF-bound regions (approximately 1%) showed reduction in H3K27ac ((â¥Â 2 fold, blue-colored population). In contrast, the H3K4me1 mark was relatively constant at the PLZF-bound regions for the majority of sites (nÂ =Â 2,123; 93%) when comparing immature osteoblasts to naÃ¯ve hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, when comparing the PLZF bound enhancers that gained H3K27ac to those that retained H3K27ac levels and related it to the expression of nearest transcript, we observed a strong correlation between gain of H3K27ac and increased expression of proximal genes. Gene Ontology analyses revealed that many of these genes were related to âbone developmentâ, âosteoclast differentiationâ (rightmost panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and examples of ChIP-seq tracks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). This suggested that a subset of PLZF-bound enhancers become active for the regulation of nearest gene that relates to an increase in H3K27ac. Furthermore, some of the PLZF-binding sites with unchanged levels of H3K27ac, showed increased expression of nearest gene upon induction of osteogenic differentiation. This might be related to other chromatin features, forÂ example, other histone modifications and/or cooperative TF-binding effects at individual enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Spitz and Furlong, 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PLZF localizes to eRNA expressing active enhancers</title><p>Active enhancers produce so-called enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), which can be detected by global 5â end RNA sequencing (CAGE).

Interestingly, PLZF-bound enhancers in our hMSCs ChIP-seq data were highly enriched for enhancers that were significantly expressed in FANTOM CAGE libraries, of naive hMSCs (pÂ &lt;Â 5*10<sup>â8</sup>, Fisherâs exact test) and osteoblasts (pÂ &lt;Â 4*10<sup>â39</sup>, Fisherâs exact test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>) (it should be noted that the time point 10 days of osteogenic differentiation, immature osteoblasts, does not exist in the FANTOM5 data). Interestingly, almost equal numbers of PLZF-bound enhancers identified in our ChIP-seq analysis in immature osteoblasts were CAGE positive (FANTOM5 data) in naive hMSCs or in osteoblasts (13.2%: 98 out of 740% and 13.6%: 101 out of 740, respectively) and approximately 42% (42 out of 98 or 101) of these enhancers are in common between naive hMSCs and osteoblasts. This suggests that 1) in naive hMSCs, where PLZF is absent, other TFs define a subpopulation of active enhancers that later on during osteogenic differentiation is bound by PLZF and 2) that PLZF likely continues to be bound to a significant number of such enhancers in terminal differentiated osteoblasts.

Since it is not possible to maintain a stable knockdown of PLZF for 10 days of differentiation using siRNA, we analyzed the changes in H3K27ac at day 2 of differentiation (pre-osteoblasts), where PLZF knockdown was still pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Clustering of the data revealed a highly reproducible increase in H3K27ac in pre-osteoblasts, which was reduced when PLZF expression was down-regulated by siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PLZF-dependent H3K27 acetylation and osteogenic-specific gene expression.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Time course of PLZF expression before and after siRNA mediated knockdown in naÃ¯ve and osteogenic-induced hMSCs by western blot.Â GAPDH was used as loading control.

There were 1,897 genes differentially regulated upon osteogenic induction in control siRNA-transfected hMSCs compared to 1,184 genes differentially regulated in PLZF knockdown cells. Only 44% (950/1,897) of these genes overlapped between control siRNA and PLZF knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). As shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, the PLZF knockdown significantly reduced the expression of genes that were normally induced in osteoblast committed progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">Supplementary file 8</xref>).

The vertical order of genes is similar to the clustered heatmap shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">FigureÂ 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, (differentially regulated genes from microarray analyses). The RNA-seq data clearly indicate; i) a high degree of reproducibility in biological replicates, ii) pronounced impact of PLZF knockdown on gene regulation at early stage (2 days) of osteogenic differentiation. The expression of upregulated genes is mainly affected by the PLZF knockdown. Furthermore, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, the plot shows that PLZF knockdown significantly affected the osteogenic transcriptional program (pÂ &lt;Â 0.0001) when comparing the log2 fold differences between PLZF knockdown or negative control siRNA in hMSCs, harvested at day 0 and day 2. The Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of differentially regulated genes in control siRNA transfected cells enriched the terms such as âextracellular matrix organization, regulation of cell differentiation and ossificationâ. Whereas genes regulated in PLZF knockdown hMSCs, enriched terms including âInterferon signaling and chondrocyte differentiationâ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Moreover, we looked for the influence of PLZF knockdown on expression of genes proximal to the PLZF-bound enhancers that gain H3K27ac. Interestingly, we observed that lack of PLZF in many cases correlated with the reduced expression of nearby genes to the regions that gain H3K27ac in PLZF-dependent manner (examples are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>The PLZF-bound developmental enhancer EnP becomes active upon osteogenic differentiation of hMSC</title><p>Interestingly, among the PLZF-bound genomic regions, we identified the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Multiple PLZF peaks appeared across the intronic region covering around 50 kb, and flanking exons 3 and 4. We also observed a remarkable gain of H3K27ac at these regions overlapping with PLZF peaks in immature osteoblasts. In contrast, H3K27ac was absent in naive hMSCs and the region was heavily marked by H3K27me3. Intriguingly, two out of three observed peaks overlapped with CAGE defined enhancers. We refer to the enhancer with the most significant PLZF peak as âEnPâ (<underline>En</underline>hancer within <underline>P</underline>LZF locus bound by PLZF) and decided to further characterize it as an example of a PLZF-bound osteogenic enhancer. To validate, that the PLZF-bound intragenic EnP element correspond to a functional enhancer, we examined the presence of histone marks and gene regulatory factors known to bind enhancers by ChIP QPCR. First, we analyzed a number of relevant histone modifications and confirmed that the EnP element gained H3K4me1 and H3K27ac in pre-osteoblasts as compared to naive hMSCs, but contained low levels of H3K4me3 and H3K36me3 compared to other regions within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The gain in H3K4me3 and H3K27ac was observed at the TSS, and H3K36me3 was more enriched at exon two within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus in pre-osteoblasts correlating with transcription of the gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We obtained similar results when investigating another PLZF peak within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). It is well established that binding of the CBP/p300 histone acetyl transferases (HATs) marks enhancers and catalyzes H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Visel et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the binding of lineage-specific TFs together with the Mediator co-activator complex at enhancers facilitates RNA polymerase II (RNA PolII) recruitment to the promoter of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carlsten et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore, performed ChIP for p300 and the Mediator co-activator complex (MED1, MED12) in naive hMSCs and in pre-osteoblasts. The data revealed enrichment of all three factors at EnP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Taken together, our data strongly suggest that the EnP element that lies within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus represents a latent (no H3K4me1 and no H327ac) PcG repressed enhancer in naive hMSCs which gains the characteristics of an active enhancer in pre-osteoblasts.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Characterization of a PLZF-bound, <italic>ZBTB16</italic> intragenic enhancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser tracks representing the genomic region within the <italic>ZBTB16 locus that gain H3K4me1, H3K27ac and PLZF binding in immature osteoblasts (highlighted in grey box).

As a control element of similar size, we cloned another upstream distal region from the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus (CtE) that did not show PLZF binding. There was a complete absence of GFP fluorescence in hMSCs infected with the CtE-GFP element or empty vector control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Interestingly, EnP showed activity in a differentiation-specific manner, being completely inactive in naive hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). These results demonstrated that the EnP element likely represents a latent repressed enhancer in naive hMSCs, which upon induction of osteogenic differentiation acquires the properties of an active enhancer and can drive the expression of a nearby gene. To ensure that the integration of the lentiviral reporter constructs was comparable for EnP-GFP and CtE-GFP, we performed a QPCR for the GFP coding part on genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated from transduced cells. The data confirmed that the integration efficiency of the two reporter constructs were highly comparable and therefore the increase in GFP fluorescence in the EnP-GFP infected hMSCs was due to the functional activity of the EnP enhancer in response to induction of osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>The PLZF-bound intragenic enhancer (EnP) loops to the promoter of the neighboring nicotinamide N-methyl transferase gene (<italic>NNMT</italic>) gene</title><p>It is widely accepted that enhancers interact with gene promoters through chromatin looping and thereby regulate the transcriptional activity of associated genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Laat and Duboule, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Levine et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we decided to use 4C-seq in order to obtain an unbiased genome-wide screen for DNA contacts made by the EnP element upon induction of osteogenic differentiation. The experiment was performed using naÃ¯ve and pre-osteoblasts in biological replicates. Interestingly, the 4C-seq data revealed several contacts between the EnP element and other genomic sites observed within a 1 Mb window. We found that the EnP element looped to the promoter of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene, which is locatedÂ ~100 kb downstream of the EnP element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, this contact was specific for pre-osteoblasts, since no looping was detected in naÃ¯ve hMSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This is inÂ agreement with the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus being repressed by PcG and H3K27me3 in naive hMSCs and the inaccessibility of the EnP enhancer. To test the reliability of our 4C-seq data, we repeated the experiment under similar conditions, but using the <italic>NNMT</italic> promoter as viewpoint for the analysis. The results confirmed the contact of the <italic>NNMT</italic> promoter with the EnP element within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus and that it was specific for hMSCs undergoing osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Interestingly, a rather extended contact area around EnP (&gt;Â 10 kb) was observed when the <italic>NNMT</italic> promoter was used as viewpoint. Additionally, a <italic>NNMT</italic> upstream region and the promoter of <italic>ZBTB16</italic> were used as a negative 4C-seq controls. The <italic>NNMT</italic> upstream region showed limited, but much less than <italic>NNMT</italic>-promoter enriched contact frequencies with the EnP element, whereas the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> promoter showed no enrichment of contact frequencies interaction with EnP. Thus this may represent a Polycomb repressed compacted region, since the whole locus was covered by H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). In conclusion, these data support the existence of what we believe could be a cluster of enhancers localized within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> gene locus, where we observed a strong and broad H3K27ac enrichment in ChIP-seq and multiple PLZF peaks (intron 2â4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

NNMT functions in a biochemical reaction where it transfers the methyl group from SAM to nicotinamide and converts SAM to SAH (S-adenosyl-homocysteine) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aksoy et al., 1995</xref>). To investigate whether the increase in <italic>NNMT</italic> expression upon osteogenic differentiation affected the overall SAM levels in the cells, we measured SAM using a fluorescence-based assay. Interestingly, we observed a decrease in SAM levels upon differentiation, suggesting a correlation between increase in <italic>NNMT</italic> expression and a decrease in SAM levels (t test, pÂ =Â 0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, the drop in SAM levels was only minor, although significant (pÂ =Â 0.01 by t-test), suggesting a delicate balance on SAM homeostasis during osteogenic differentiation. SAM being a critical co-factor for methylation of DNA through the action of DNA methyl transferases (DNMTs) and histones through the activity of histone methyl transferases (HMTs) obviously needs to be tightly regulated. However, our data suggest that fine-tuning of global methylation during osteogenic differentiation could partly result from small changes in SAM levels via <italic>NNMT</italic> expression regulated through PLZF and the intragenic enhancer EnP.</p><p>Overall, these results provide evidence for a dynamic activation and function of a lineage specific developmental enhancer EnP present within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus, which regulates the expression of <italic>NNMT</italic> and thereby SAM homeostasis upon osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs.</p><p>To further characterize the effect of NNMT on osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs, we used siRNA to knock-down <italic>NNMT</italic> expression.

To address this question, we next performed ChIP for MED12 and RNAPolII in the presence or absence of PLZF and induction of osteogenic differentiation. Interestingly, the recruitment of MED12 and RNAPolII at the EnP enhancer was dependent on PLZF expression upon induction of osteogenic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that PLZF influences the expression of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene via recruitment of Mediator and RNAPolII at the EnP enhancer, without regulating enhancer-promoter looping per se.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have shown that the induction of the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> gene locus encoding the transcription factor PLZF is an important event during osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. This is in agreement with the genetic knockout of the <italic>Zbtb16</italic> in mice, showing severe defects in limb and axial skeleton patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barna et al., 2000</xref>). Unexpectedly, however, we found that PLZF, rather than functioning as a gene repressor by binding at promoters as described in other cellular models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), mainly localized to gene enhancers in immature osteoblasts. Increased H3K27ac at PLZF-binding sites often correlated with higher expression of nearby transcripts in a PLZF-dependent manner, many of which represent protein encoding genes known to be important in osteogenic differentiation, and thereby supporting a more general role of PLZF at osteogenic lineage-specific enhancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>).</p><p>We also revealed the presence of an intragenic enhancer (EnP) within this locus that is repressed by PcG and H3K27me3 in naive hMSCs but becomes highly active at an early stage of osteogenic differentiation of hMSCs. Our data also demonstrate the differentiation-specific looping of EnP to its target promoter of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene. This is now one of the few known examples where dynamics of enhancer promoter interaction has been described during mesenchymal stem cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dixon et al., 2015</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PLZF marks the differentiation onset of naive hMSCs</title><p>In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Djouad et al., 2014</xref>), we observed that PLZF expression was not specific for the osteogenic lineage since induction of chondrogenic- and adipogenic differentiation of hMSCs also led to induction of <italic>ZBTB16</italic> expression (data not shown). These observations suggest that PLZF functions at an early state of hMSCs differentiation and promotes the transition from the naive stem cell stage to a more committed state for all three lineages. Therefore, to obtain specific gene expression patterns that characterize the three different lineages and their functions, other cell-type-specific TFs must operate together with PLZF at enhancers in a context dependent manner. Recently, the genome-wide binding profile for Runx2 was characterized in mouse pre-osteoblastic cell lines and suggested a possible link of this TF to enhancer function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2014</xref>). Future studies using human MSCs should be designed to reveal if RUNX2 and FOXO1 bind enhancers and cooperate with PLZF or work independently in gene regulation during osteogenic commitment. In our de novo motif analyses of PLZF-binding sites, we identified the TACAGT motif, that is identical to previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ivins et al., 2003</xref>). The motif is, furthermore, a recognition site for the transcription factor OSR2, implicated in proliferation of osteoblasts and in osteogenic differentiation of dental follicle cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kawai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Park et al., 2015</xref>). Whether OSR2 and PLZF compete or cooperate for binding to enhancers and if OSR2 functions together with PLZF to regulate osteogenic gene expression is not known and would require further studies. We observed that MED12 binding at the osteogenic enhancer EnP was dependent on PLZF, although no direct interaction has been observed between PLZF and MED12 (data not shown), suggesting involvement of other cofactor(s). It should be considered that, the influence of PLZF on H3K27ac at distal regulatory elements might facilitate MED12 binding at these regions which is reverted in the absence of PLZF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>A latent developmental enhancer EnP within the <italic>ZBTB16/PLZF</italic> locus</title><p>EnP that lies within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus represents a latent PcG-repressed developmental enhancer in naive hMSCs. Upon induction of osteogenic differentiation, H3K27me3 was removed from EnP possibly through JMJD3 recruitment and there was a subsequent gain of chromatin marks characterizing active enhancers (H3K4me1 and H3K27ac) and gene regulatory factors such as Mediator, p300 and PLZF. Intriguingly, a reporter assay in which EnP was integrated in the genome of hMSCs cells showed that EnP functions only upon induction of differentiation. This suggests that the EnP enhancer element in the context of a GFP reporter also require lineage-specific factor(s) such as PLZF for its activity.</p><p>The region of the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus that we found to be in contact with the promoter of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene covered an area around 50 kb and included introns 3â5 which showed a strong enrichment for H3K27ac and H3K4me1 upon osteogenic differentiation and gained PLZF binding at several positions. These characteristics suggest that this <italic>ZBTB16</italic> intragenic region could represent a cluster of several active enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>) that likely binds other TFs besides PLZF. Since increased expression of PLZF was also observed during induction of chondrogenic and adipogenic differentiation (data not shown), we assume that EnP might be functional in these lineages as well. However, whether all potential intragenic enhancers in the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus would be regulated similarly between the three different cell lineages and contact similar or different target promoters would need further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Regulation of SAM levels through <italic>NNMT</italic> expression and activity</title><p>We found that EnP loops to the <italic>NNMT</italic> promoter and correlated with induced expression of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene during osteogenic differentiation, and that NNMT expression is required for the differentiation of hMSCs. The enzyme NNMT regulates nicotinamide (vitamin B3) levels through methylation, using SAM as a methyl donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). NNMT is overexpressed in many cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sartini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ulanovskaya et al., 2013</xref>) and can result in an altered epigenetic state. This has been proposed to happen due to draining of methyl groups from the methionine cycle leaving very stable 1MNA and SAH byproducts, thereby changing the methylome of cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shlomi and Rabinowitz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ulanovskaya et al., 2013</xref>). Based on our data, it is tempting to speculate that the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> intragenic enhancer EnP and PLZF, helps to fine tune global methylation patterns through transcriptional regulation of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene during osteogenic commitment of progenitor cells. These important aspects require further detailed investigations.</p><p>In conclusion, our results identify the transcription factor PLZF as a novel component that marks the enhancer landscape in hMSCs during osteogenic differentiation, acting as a positive regulator of enhancer function.

The reads were extended to a DNA fragment size of 300 bp. Genes subject to differential H3K27me3 levels were identified as follows: Read counts from two biological H3K27me3 ChIP-seq replicates from day 0 (naÃ¯ve hMSCs) and day 10 (immature osteoblast) samples were quantified within 5five kbp windows surrounding 30,716 non-redundant TSS in Refseq Hg19 gene annotation data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">O'Leary et al., 2016</xref>), which were downloaded from the refflat table at UCSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kent et al., 2002</xref>).

Regions with gain or loss in each histone mark were calculated by selecting the population with twofold change or higher in either direction.

The procedure resembles that of MACS with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Each dataset was divided into 100 bp windows, and the reads within each window scanned genome-wide. A normalization coefficient (NCIS) serving to normalize the background levels of the two datasets was analyzed in accordance with Liang and Keles, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang and KeleÅ, 2012</xref>). Window size was manually set to 100 bp. Global thresholds were calculated based on a Poisson Distribution using the genome-wide average number of reads in the windows and a p-value of 1E-05. Adaptive thresholds were modeled the following way: The average number of negative control reads in areas corresponding to 10x, 50x and 250x window size (100 bp) was calculated for each position. This number was used as lambdas for Poisson distributions and thresholds that matched a p-value of 1E-05 were calculated. The most conservative threshold was chosen from the three local thresholds of the control and the global threshold of the sample. Thresholds from the negative control were scaled according with the NCIS normalization factor. The position and statistics of windows passing the most conservative threshold, and having a NCIS-normalized log2-fold Sample/Control-ratio above 2, as well as less than a 3:1 difference between the signal on the plus and minus strands were extracted into a separate list, and the entire procedure was done four times where the windows were shifted 25 bp each time. Windows within 100 bp of each other and overlapping windows were merged. For each region in the resulting the borders were refined by sliding a window of 100 bp from one window-size upstream to downstream of the temporary border. The exact position where the number of samples reads within the window fell below the threshold was defined as the new border of that region. Shoulders were excluded at values below ÂµÂ +2 SD. After border refinement and peak-merging, peaks were positively selected for an FDR value of 1E-05 Benjamini or better and minimum a NCIS normalized log2 fold difference of 2.

What follows is the editorsâ letter requesting such plan.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;PLZF targets developmental enhancers for activation during osteogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells&quot; for consideration by eLife. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jessica Tyler as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted these remarks to emphasize the work that we feel must be completed for this manuscript to be considered for publication. Given the substantial additional work the reviewers feel is essential, we ask that you respond with a detailed plan of the experimental work you would be prepared to undertake and an estimate of the time it would take to complete these tasks. The Editor and reviewers will consider your response and issue a binding recommendation. Of course, if you are unable to complete these tasks in a reasonable time, we would understand if you choose to withdraw this manuscript from further consideration at this time.</p><p>The manuscript from Singh et al. reports on genomic roles of PLZF during lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells and evidence for a latent enhancer within the <italic>ZBTB16/PLZF</italic> locus that is developmentally induced and regulates expression of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene to influence cellular levels of SAM. The studies are of general interest with respect to understanding mechanisms of osteogenic differentiation. The authors demonstrate that PLZF is strongly induced at an early time point during osteogenic differentiation, coinciding with loss of the repressive H3K27me3 mark and gain of H3K27ac. ChIP-seq studies indicate that PLZF primarily binds to intra- and intergenic regions with features of enhancers, many of which exhibit increases in H3K27ac during differentiation and are near genes that are enriched for relevant functional annotations. Chromatin conformation capture (4C) experiments are performed indicating an interaction of the latent enhancer within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus and the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene, which is not dependent on PLZF induction. Induction of the expression of <italic>NNMT</italic>, which catalyzes the conversion of nicotinomide to N1-methyl nicotinomide in a SAM-dependent manner, results in a modest but significant reduction of SAM levels. Knockdown of the <italic>NNMT</italic> using an siRNA results in a striking block of induction of <italic>ZBTB16</italic> and ALPL mRNA during osteogenesis. The authors conclude that PLZF functions in enhancer activation and that the latent enhancer within its locus regulates the expression of <italic>NNMT</italic> during osteogenic differentiation. The findings are of interest, but there are several concerns with respect to the strength of some of the main conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The general pattern of PLZF binding is probably sound based on the absence of peaks in PLZF knockdown cells but the ChIP-seq experiments do not meet current standards for reproducibility. ChIPs from three independent experiments were pooled for sequencing. It is not possible from this experimental design to establish biological reproducibility of the peaks. This requires independent sequencing of ChIP products and application of statistical methods such as IDR. In addition, a table of general metrics for sequencing should be provided to help with data interpretation, including number of uniquely mapped reads, ChIP efficiency (fraction of reads in peaks) etc.</p><p>2) Specificity of siRNA knockdown. Although the methods section indicates that three different siRNAs were tested for PLZF, it is not evident that the three siRNAs generated the same result for PLZF or <italic>NNMT</italic>. This is important because of the potential for significant off-target effects of siRNAs. The striking effect of the <italic>NNMT</italic> siRNA on <italic>PLZF</italic> and <italic>ALPL</italic> expression during osteogenic differentiation should be clearly established by more than one siRNA.</p><p>3) Role of PLZF in enhancer activation. The ChIP-seq data indicates that PLZF primarily binds to a pre-existing enhancer landscape, with a significant faction of these regions showing an increase in H3K27ac. However, the cause-effect relationship between PLZF binding and gain in H3K27ac is not established. Many other factors are induced during osteogenic differentiation and could be the primary drivers of this change. A cause-effect relationship requires performing ChIP-seq for H3K27ac during osteogenic differentiation in cells in which PLZF has been knocked down.</p><p>4) Most importantly, there are no transcriptomic studies of the consequences of PLZF loss of function. Although it was shown that <italic>Zbtb16</italic> knockout leads to a skeletal defect (Barna et al., 2000), it is not necessarily an osteogenic defect. The only experiment evaluating effects of PLZF knockdown on gene expression is the Western blot for <italic>NNMT</italic> in Figure 6A, which does appear to show a difference at days 2 and 5 (but not day 10). However, there is no quantitative or statistical analysis of this finding and effects on mRNA levels are not provided. At this stage, there is no convincing evidence that PLZF plays an important role in regulating an osteogenic program of gene expression in this model system. This would require transcriptomic profiling in the PLZF knockdown cells.</p><p>5) The role of the enhancer EnP is not sufficiently dissected. While its activation is well supported by chromatin changes and by a retroviral enhancer assay, deletion of this enhancer should be performed, for example by CRISPR/Cas, to establish its physiological relevance. The 4C data in Figure 4 look rather unconvincing and are not statistically analyzed, and the impact of PLZF on <italic>NNMT</italic> seems weak.</p><p>6) There are many instances of figure panels lacking measures of statistical significance between experimental groups e.g., all of Figures 3, 5A, E, F, G, 6C, D, E, F.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: the revision plan was rejected after consideration by the editors and reviewers, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The decision letter issued after receiving the revision plan is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;PLZF targets developmental enhancers for activation during osteogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>We have considered the response you provided with regard to your plan for a revision and we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. One of the key conclusions from the Abstract of your manuscript was, 'Together, we show, PLZF functions in enhancer activationâ¦' This conclusion was based on an association of PLZF binding with genomic regions that gain histone acetylation during the differentiation process. An essential revision was to perform ChIP-seq experiments in cells lacking PLZF to establish that H3K27ac was PLZF-dependent. The data provided in Figure 3 of the plan for revision indicates no change in the gain of H3K27ac at the enhancer EnP in the PLZF knockdown cells. This experiment argues against the main conclusion that PLZF targets developmental enhancers for activation during osteogenic lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells, as stated in the title. Therefore, while you can address many of the other points raised as essential revisions, the central underlying mechanisms for how PLZF would alter programs of osteogenic differentiation are not established. Unfortunately, we think that the manuscript is no longer an appropriate candidate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>In this article, the authors made a strong case that PLZF, encoded by <italic>Zbtb16</italic>, is involved in the osteogenic-differentiation of hMSC. PLZF binds to osteogenic enhancers. Furthermore, the upregulation of <italic>Zbtb16</italic> correlates with gain in H3K27 acetylation of osteogenic enhancers. Among these enhancers the authors demonstrated that an EnP enhancer occupied by PLZF within the PLZF locus loop to the neighboring gene <italic>NNMT</italic> and correlate with gain of <italic>NNMT</italic> expression during lineage commitment. Overall, the analysis of extensive genomic data is carefully done. However, there are several points need to be addressed to consolidate the conclusion that <italic>Zbtb16</italic> is a key osteogenic factor in MSC differentiation model.</p><p>1) Would knockout of <italic>Zbtb16</italic> by itself block osteogenic differentiation (instead of just correlate with osteogenic differentiation)? Although it was shown that <italic>Zbtb16</italic> knockout leads to skeletal defect (Barna et al., 2000), it is not necessarily an osteogenic defect (such as it could be chondrogenic defect).</p><p>2) Similarly, although the evidence that PLZF binds to active enhancers are strong, the evidence that the occupancy of PLZF leads to the active enhancer status is lacking. Would knockout/knockdown of <italic>Zbtb16</italic> obliterate H3K27ac binding signal in the PLZF bound enhancers? Or alternatively, would <italic>Zbtb16</italic> gain of function increase the H3K27ac signal across PLZF bound enhancers? What are the changes in transcriptome with PLZF loss/gain of function? What other factors bind to the same sets of enhancers PLZF bind in osteogenesis related context? (This can be done by leveraging published ChIP-seq data in the context of osteogenesis.)</p><p>3) The EnP enhancer is very interesting, could the author demonstrate that the EnP-GFP+ cells are in a more primed/committed state than GFP- cells? This can be done by FACS-GFP and RNA-seq. Given that the entire <italic>PLZF-NNMT</italic> locus is likely co-regulated by a cluster of enhancers (as can be inferred by H3K27ac signals across the regions), is there any functional data to show the importance of EnP enhancer in this context?</p><p>4) In the title it states that PLZF targets developmental enhancers. Is there any direct evidence to suggest that these enhancers are 'developmentally' involved? Such as cross reference with vista enhancer browser enhancers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Singh et al. report that PLZF encoded by <italic>Zbtb16</italic> is induced during differentiation of hMSCs into osteoblasts in vitro. In addition, they focus on an enhancer called EnP within the <italic>Zbtb16</italic> locus that is bound by the PLZF protein and loops to the promoter of the neighboring <italic>NNMT</italic> gene to regulate its expression. There are major gaps in this scenario.</p><p>The function of PLZF in human MSC is not established since the authors do not present loss or gain of function studies, only a ChIP-seq analysis that shows binding to some osteoblastic genes among thousands of genes. In addition, they mention that PLZF is similarly induced during adipocyte and chondrocyte differentiation, which casts doubt on its specificity for osteoblasts. In fact, there are no in vivo data or reference to support the contention that PLZF regulates osteoblastic differentiation in human. The mouse literature indicates a role of PLZF in skeletal patterning through regulation of HOX genes, not osteoblastic regulation. Finally, the PLZF ChIP-seq analysis is incomplete: the authors do not assess the presence of a DNA binding motif for PLZF, or compare their data with previous reports in human cells or in mouse NKT cells.</p><p>The role of the enhancer EnP is not sufficiently dissected. While its activation is well supported by chromatin changes and by a retroviral enhancer assay, deletion of this enhancer should be performed, for example by CRISPR/Cas, to establish its physiological relevance. The 4C data in Figure 4 look rather unconvincing and are not statistically analyzed, and the impact of PLZF on <italic>NNMT</italic> seems weak. Therefore, the author's scenario describing a looping of this enhancer to the neighboring NNMT gene promoter and the suggestion that this may regulate global functions of methylation that impact osteoblastic differentiation remain vague and hypothetical.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript from Singh et al. reports on genomic roles of PLZF during lineage commitment of human mesenchymal stem cells and evidence for a latent enhancer within the <italic>ZBTB16/PLZF</italic> locus that is developmentally induced and regulates expression of the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene to influence cellular levels of SAM. The studies are of general interest with respect to understanding mechanisms of osteogenic differentiation. The authors demonstrate that PLZF is strongly induced at an early time point during osteogenic differentiation, coinciding with loss of the repressive H3K27me3 mark and gain of H3K27ac. ChIP-seq studies indicate that PLZF primarily binds to intra- and intergenic regions with features of enhancers, many of which exhibit increases in H3K267ac during differentiation and are near genes that are enriched for relevant functional annotations. Chromatin conformation capture (4C) experiments are performed indicating an interaction of the latent enhancer within the <italic>ZBTB16</italic> locus and the <italic>NNMT</italic> gene, which is not dependent on PLZF induction. Induction of the expression of <italic>NNMT</italic>, which catalyzes the conversion of nicotinomide to N1-methyl nicotinomide in a SAM-dependent manner, results in a modest but significant reduction of SAM levels. Knockdown of the <italic>NNMT</italic> using an siRNA results in a striking block of induction of <italic>ZBTB16</italic> and <italic>ALPL</italic> mRNA during osteogenesis. The authors conclude that PLZF functions in enhancer activation and that the latent enhancer within its locus regulates the expression of NNMT during osteogenic differentiation. The findings are of interest, but there are several concerns with respect to the strength of some of the main conclusions.</p><p>1) The general pattern of PLZF binding is probably sound based on the absence of peaks in PLZF knockdown cells but the ChIP-seq experiments do not meet current standards for reproducibility. ChIPs from three independent experiments were pooled for sequencing. It is not possible from this experimental design to establish biological reproducibility of the peaks. This requires independent sequencing of ChIP products and application of statistical methods such as IDR. In addition, a table of general metrics for sequencing should be provided to help with data interpretation, including number of uniquely mapped reads, ChIP efficiency (fraction of reads in peaks) etc.</p><p>2) Specificity of siRNA knockdown. Although the Materials and methods section indicates that three different siRNAs were tested for PLZF, it is not evident that the three siRNAs generated the same result for PLZF or NNMT. This is important because of the potential for significant off-target effects of siRNAs. The striking effect of the NNMT siRNA on PLZF and ALPL expression during osteogenic differentiation should be clearly established by more than one siRNA.</p><p>3) Role of PLZF in enhancer activation. The ChIP-seq data indicates that PLZF primarily binds to a pre-existing enhancer landscape, with a significant faction of these regions showing an increase in H3K27ac. However, the cause-effect relationship between PLZF binding and gain in H3K27ac is not established. Many other factors are induced during osteogenic differentiation and could be the primary drivers of this change. A cause-effect relationship requires performing ChIP-seq for H3K27ac during osteogenic differentiation in cells in which PLZF has been knocked down.</p><p>4) The studies provide limited evidence for a role of PLZF in osteogenic differentiation. Most importantly, there are no transcriptomic studies of the consequences of PLZF loss of function. The only experiment evaluating effects of PLZF knockdown on gene expression is the Western blot for NNMT in Figure 6A, which does appear to show a difference at days 2 and 5 (but not day 10). However, there is no quantitative or statistical analysis of this finding and effects on mRNA levels are not provided. At this stage, there is no convincing evidence that PLZF plays an important role in regulating an osteogenic program of gene expression in this model system. This would require transcriptomic profiling in the PLZF knockdown cells.</p><p>5) There are many instances of figure panels lacking measures of statistical significance between experimental groups i.e., all of Figure 3, 5A, E, F, G, 6C, D, E, F.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;PLZF targets developmental enhancers for activation during osteogenic differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

However, it is not clear whether the additional antibodies tested included an antibody recently demonstrated to work for PLZF ChIP-seq in human cells.

Therefore, we are very pleased to conclude, that this antibody can be considered as a replacement for the Santa Cruz PLZF antibody (sc-22839), which very unfortunately was discontinued by the company. This definitely will be helpful to reproduce and even extend our work in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis of the RNA-seq data shown in Figure 3 is superficial and does clearly link loss of function of PLZF to the overall gene expression program illustrated in Figure 1. The analysis of this data set should be performed along the lines of that shown in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1 in order to allow a clearer interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>As per reviewerâs suggestion, we have re-analyzed the RNA-seq data from the PLZF knockdown experiment and is now presenting it in a more comprehensive way in revised Figure 3D and E, and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and C. The heatmaps in Figure 3D, represents the RPKM-values of differentially regulated genes from RNA-seq of PLZF knockdown or control siRNA (in biological triplicates) in hMSCs. The vertical order of genes is similar to the clustered heatmap in Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B. The RNA-seq data clearly indicate: i) a high degree of reproducibility in biological replicates, ii) pronounced impact of PLZF knockdown on gene regulation at an early stage (2 days) of osteogenic differentiation. Furthermore, in Figure 3E, we present the Beeswarm plots comparing the log2 fold differences between PLZF knockdown or negative control siRNA in hMSCs, harvested at day 0 and day 2 of osteogenic differentiation. The plot shows that PLZF knockdown significantly affected the osteogenic transcriptional program (p&lt;0.0001). We also present the overlap by Venn diagram between differentially regulated genes in the absence or presence of PLZF during osteogenic induction and performed the Gene Ontology (GO) analyses of differentially regulated genes from each group (control siRNA or PLZF knockdown). All new analyses are now included in the main Figure 3 (revised) and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1 (revised) and described in the main text, figure legends and Materials and methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
