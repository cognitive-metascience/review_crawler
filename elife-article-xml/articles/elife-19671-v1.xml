resistance. Current strategies to circumvent resistance target the same or parallel pathways. We report here that targeting a completely different process, autophagy, can overcome multiple BRAF inhibitor resistance mechanisms in brain tumors. <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic>mutations occur in many pediatric brain tumors. We previously reported that these tumors are autophagy-dependent and a patient was successfully treated with the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine after failure of the BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitor vemurafenib, suggesting autophagy inhibition overcame the kinase inhibitor resistance. We tested this hypothesis in vemurafenib-resistant brain tumors. Genetic and pharmacological autophagy inhibition overcame molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms, inhibited tumor cell growth, and increased cell death. Patients with resistance had favorable clinical responses when chloroquine was added to vemurafenib. This provides a fundamentally different strategy to circumvent multiple mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance that could be rapidly tested in clinical trials in patients with <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> brain tumors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19671.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19671.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19671.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancers of the brain and spine are the second most common kind of tumor in children, after cancers of the blood and bone marrow. Yet brain and spine tumors kill more children than any other cancer, in part because many become resistant to treatment.</p><p>Like in other cancers, cells in brain and spine tumors often use a process called autophagy to survive the treatments that are used to try and kill them. This process allows cells to recycle proteins and other things inside the cell and use them for energy when the cell is under stress. In 2014, researchers reported that brain tumors carrying a mutation called <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> rely on autophagy to survive treatment with medications that target this mutation. These findings suggested that blocking autophagy might make the medications more effective against <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic>mutant tumors and overcome the resistance.</p><p>Now, Mulcahy Levy et al. â who include most of the researchers involved in the 2014 study â report that blocking autophagy does indeed overcome this kind of resistance in multiple types of tumor. The experiments made use of human brain tumor cells that can be grown in the laboratory and have been widely studied, as well as samples collected from patients.</p><p>Mulcahy Levy et al. were able to block autophagy in the tumor cells by using genetic methods and, importantly, by using an approved and inexpensive drug that could be rapidly translated into clinical trials. Together these findings suggest that blocking autophagy in patients might be a safe and effective strategy to improve their response to existing therapies that target the <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutation. Future clinical trials are now needed to test more patients and verify if this treatment plan can be broadly effective in patients with these types of brain cancers.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19671.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19671.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>BRAF V600E</kwd><kwd>brain tumor</kwd><kwd>chloroquine</kwd><kwd>pediatric</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08CA193982</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulcahy Levy</surname><given-names>Jean M</given-names> </name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-14-0414</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mulcahy Levy</surname><given-names>Jean M</given-names> </name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006058</institution-id><institution>St. Baldrick's Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>elope, Inc.

The RAF/MEK/ERK pathway is important in central nervous system tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gierke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mistry et al., 2015</xref>), and with <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> mutations in more than 50% of select tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Penman et al., 2015</xref>) there is great potential for the use of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> inhibitors. Indeed, the first pediatric patient successfully treated with vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rush et al., 2013</xref>) was followed by similar case reports in brain tumor patients of all ages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bautista et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Skrypek et al., 2014</xref>), and clinical trials in children and adolescents are ongoing using both vemurafenib (NCT01748149) and dabrafenib (NCT01677741). TheÂ initial excitement for BRAF inhibitors (BRAFi) in other tumors was tempered because the majority of patients who initially respond to RAF inhibition quickly develop resistance to therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartsough et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). This is a significant issue in brain tumors as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yao et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>There are multiple routes of acquired resistance to RAF inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Rizos et al., 2014</xref>) and circumventing these mechanisms usually involves either targeting the same pathway a different way or targeting a similar parallel pathway. A recent study of BRAFi resistance in colorectal cancer highlighted difficulties with this approach with a single tumor often harboring more than one mechanism of resistance. More importantly, when tumors became resistant to one combination of drugs, such as BRAF/MEK inhibition, there was cross-resistance to others such as BRAF/EGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahronian et al., 2015</xref>). This concept is playing out in clinical trials as well. BRAF and MEK inhibition in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> melanoma patients found a small increase in median progression free survival but failed after a short time. Further evidence found that patients who were treated with MEKi after they had developed BRAFi resistance had no objective clinical responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). EGFR is another potential secondary target in melanoma, brain, and colorectal cancer. Although encouraging preclinical results have been obtained in these tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corcoran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Girotti et al., 2013</xref>), combined BRAF/EGFR inhibition similarly leads to incomplete and short-term responses in people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahronian et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pietrantonio et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy inhibition is a potential method to reverse BRAFi resistance. Previous studies of kinase inhibitor resistance in adult BRAF<sup>WT</sup> gliomas with PTEN mutations resistant to phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase to AKT to mammalian target of rapamycin (PI3K-AKT-mTOR) pathway inhibitors found that autophagy inhibition improved response to dual PI3K-mTOR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fan et al., 2010</xref>). Up-regulation of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress-induced autophagy after treatment with BRAFi has been shown in melanoma tumor biopsies and associated with theÂ development of resistance to vemurafenib. Autophagy inhibition overcame the resistance through this mechanism in melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2014</xref>). Previously, we reversed clinical and radiographic disease progression with the addition of the autophagy inhibitor chloroquine (CQ) in a patient with a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> brainstem ganglioglioma who progressed while on vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2014</xref>). This patient continued to experience disease regression on the combination of CQ plus vemurafenib for more than two and a half years, contrasting dramatically with her original response to vemurafenib that failed at 11 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2014</xref>). These findings led us to hypothesize that autophagy inhibition provides a different way to circumvent BRAF inhibitor resistance in CNS tumors that avoids targeting the same or similar kinase pathways and might apply to multiple different mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy overcomes BRAFi resistance in vitro</title><p>Isogenic BRAFi resistant brain tumor cell lines (794R and AM38R) were developed through chronic exposure to vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and quantification <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Parental cells (794 and AM38) demonstrated a stable reduction the in ratio of pERK to ERK when treated with vemurafenib. In contrast, resistant cells recovered pERK:ERK ratios to almost baseline levels by 24 hr of drug exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and quantification of pERK:ERK ratios <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Unlike reports in vemurafenib-resistant melanoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma et al., 2014</xref>), neither basal nor drug-induced autophagy was increased in resistant cells (794R, AM38R, B76) compared to parental/sensitiveÂ cells (794, AM38, BT40) as determined by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>) or by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Quantification of autophagic flux measured by Western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) demonstrated that 794 and 794R cells have a similar flux at all timepoints, while AM38R had a smaller accumulation of LC3II over six hours compared to AM38 parental cells. This may be in part to the AM38 parental cells that demonstrated a lower level of LC3II at baseline compared to AM38R cells. As flux is measured by comparison of all time-points to the time 0 baseline, the higher level of LC3II in AM38R cells at time 0 would reduce the final flux measurement at six hours. Taken together, these data demonstrated that development of resistance to BRAFi did not increase levels of autophagy in these cells. Additionally, autophagic flux was successfully blocked in both parental and resistant cells using 5 Î¼M CQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), a dose that can be achieved clinically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Augustijns et al., 1992</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19671.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Brain tumor cell lines develop resistance to pharmacologic inhibition of BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of parental (<bold>P</bold>) and isogenic resistant (<bold>R</bold>) cell line response long-term growth following BRAFi for 72 hr.

Therefore, genetic inhibition of autophagy was also performed to test if the responses seen were related to inhibition of the autophagic pathway or were due to another effect of CQ. Knockdowns of either ATG5 or ATG7 (two essential regulators of canonical autophagy) had a profound effect on the growth of both parental and resistant cell lines with a dramatic decrease in growth velocity. However, under conditions where there was measureable growth in the presence of RNAi, the addition of vemurafenib to resistant cells along with ATG5 or ATG7 knockdown resulted in a further decrease in growth rate, under conditions where there was measurable growth in the presence of RNAi. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5AâB</xref>).

This strategy allows monitoring of treatment effects in tumor cells with a supporting microenvironment ex vivo. Patient #1 was diagnosed with epithelioid glioblastoma and had rapid recurrence following standard therapy including temazolamide and radiation. At relapse, a BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> mutation was identified, and there was a successful tumor control on vemurafenib for approximately 2 years. While on vemurafenib, a rapidly growing metastatic second recurrence developed. Following confirmation that the recurrent disease continued to harbor BRAF<sup>V600E</sup>, the largest lesions were treated with focal radiation while the metastatic disease required a chemotherapeutic approach. Tissue slices were collected at aÂ biopsy of recurrence and evaluated for protein level changes, LDH release, and EdU incorporation following BRAFi with vemurafenib and autophagy inhibition with CQ.

Moreover, combination therapy demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) that was associated with an increase in caspase 3/7 activity in the combination treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In a long-term growth assay, combination therapy also resulted in a reduction of cell growth compared to single drug treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Further pathway analysis of Patient #1 treated slice cultures was performed to evaluate the association between autophagy inhibition and the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway. Treatment with vemurafenib resulted in small decrease in pAKT and pS6 with an associated small increase in LC3II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and G</xref>) but no significant increase of autophagic flux in cells treated with vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

As has also been previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Spears et al., 2016</xref>), treatment with CQ resulted in increase phosphorylation of AKT. Combination therapy resulted in pAKT levels similar to DMSO control. Phospho MEK expression was also increased in all samples treated with vemurafenib, although the pMEK:MEK ratio was lower in samples treated in combination with CQ, primarily due to an increase in total MEK in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G and I</xref>). Importantly, in all treatments with vemurafenib, regardless of the presence of CQ, pERK was upregulated compared to DMSO control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,G and I</xref>). Together, these data suggest that patient #1âs tumor acquired resistance to vemurafenib through a mechanism leading to âparadoxicalâ RAF pathway activation by the drug, but that subsequent combination treatment with autophagy inhibition and vemurafenib could overcome this resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Autophagy inhibition enhances BRAFi response in multiple brain tumor types</title><p>An evaluation of additional patient samples with verified BRAF mutations allowed assessment of the effectiveness of this approach in other brain tumor types.

In contrast, two patients (Patients #3 and #4) with WT BRAF exhibited no increase in LDH release in any of the treatment conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) showing that as with our previous studies in cell lines, primary tumor samples with WT BRAF display no significant sensitivity to autophagy inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Levy and Thorburn, 2012</xref>).

An additional primary culture from Patient #5, an adult with a <italic>BRAF<sup>V600E</sup></italic> positive glioblastoma who had not received vemurafenib therapy, demonstrated inherent BRAFi resistance. However, as with Patients #1 and #2, sensitivity to pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Moreover, combination therapy with both vermurafenib and CQ again demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity compared to single drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), and was associated with an increase in caspase 3/7 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Both short and long term growth assays demonstrated decreased cell growth when autophagy was inhibited with or without vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>). Increased tumor growth was not seen in Patient #5 vemurafenib treated cells. The increase in Edu incorporation seen in Patient #2 was not related to paradoxical RAF pathway activation, as was seen in Patient #1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), although there was also not a substantial reduction in pERK overall. In contrast, Patient #5â tumor cells did demonstrate a reduction in pERK signaling with exposure to vemurafenib (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7HâI</xref>). Of note across all these patients, pERK status did not correlate with resistance to vemurafenib. Rather, inhibition of autophagy resulted in re-sensitization in all three primary patient samples.

When growth of EGFRoe cells was assessed for response to single drug and combination therapy, combination therapy resulted in a significantly slower growth velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Representative end-point images demonstrate the reduced number of cells seen with combination therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Analysis of the percent of viable cells also demonstrated a significant decrease in combination therapy compared to pharmacologic BRAF or autophagy inhibition alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Western blotting analysis verified the increased pEGFR expression in EGFRoe cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). It is noted that EGFR was not significantly overexpressed in our drug induced polyclonal 794R or AM38R cells.

Patient #6 completed one year of therapy with improvement of the brainstem lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). It is important to note that evidence of shunt failure was present on this response scan with fourth ventricle enlargement. Due to the continued presence of tumor mass, she was maintained on vemurafenib single drug therapy for an additional six months when she presented with a worsening left facial (CN VII) palsy, increased difficulty swallowing, and balance deterioration. Associated with these worsening clinical symptoms on vemurafenib alone, progressive tumor growth was demonstrated on MRI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>).</p><p>CQ (500 mg daily) was added as a second agent and she continued on vemurafenib. In contrast with her response to vemurafenib alone, and consistent with the other patients where combined therapy overcame acquired resistance to vemurafenib, within four weeks of the addition of CQ Patient #6 showed clinical improvement with improved swallowing and CN VII nerve palsy. This is a similar response to our previous brainstem BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> ganglioglioma patient who also showed a rapid clinical improvement with the addition of CQ therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2014</xref>). This clinical improvement was maintained for two and a half months when, unfortunately, the patient developed further ventriculoperitoneal shunt failure requiring surgical intervention and her medications were discontinued to allow complete surgical healing. Within three weeks of stopping therapy, her swallowing difficulties recurred. An attempt was made to restart her medications, but complications from her swallowing difficulties resulted in an acute medical decline requiring intubation, and subsequently, she was unable to continue swallowing medications. An MRI at this time demonstrated an unchanged size of the brainstem mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). Given the patientâs inability to continue oral vemurafenib therapy and her multiple medical complications, the family elected to pursue palliative therapy only.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Rechallenge with combination BRAF and autophagy inhibition effective in a patient with persistent BRAFi resistance</title><p>Both Patient #1 and Patient #6 required a treatment interruption to allow for healing from unrelated medical issues.

Once she had resolution of her additional medical issues, she requested to restart tumor directed therapy. Resistance to BRAF inhibition has been reported to be reversible following a period of treatment interruption in melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Seghers et al., 2012</xref>) therefore Patient #1 was restarted on single agent vemurafenib.

It has also been reported that combination BRAF inhibition and MEK inhibition prevents MAPK pathway reactivation and an improved reduction in pERK in glioma models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Grossauer et al., 2016</xref>). A trial of combination vemurafenib plus trametinib was therefore initiated based on these data, but this combination was not well tolerated in this patient. Instead she was continued on single agent trametinib. After an initial stabilization lasting four weeks, Patient #1 had further clinical decline with an evolving left hemiparesis and the development of focal seizures. Imaging repeated two months after the addition of MEK inhibition demonstrated significant tumor growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>).</p><p>In a final attempt to control tumor growth, Patient #1 was restarted on combination vemurafenib and CQ. At an evaluation four weeks after re-initiation of the combination with autophagy inhibition therapy, Patient #1 reported an overall improvement. She had regained partial use of her left side including the ability to open/close her left hand and move her left arm at the elbow. She had also regained the ability to walk unassisted for short distances where she had become wheelchair bound. An MRI at this time demonstrated a measurable reduction in her main solid tumor mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). This patient therefore demonstrates the potential risks of cross-resistance and resistance to combination therapies targeting the same pathway. But also showed that despite a clearly highly resistant tumor, the addition of autophagy inhibition continued to have a clinical benefit.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Targeted therapies such as kinase inhibitors that inhibit tumor-driving mutations are expanding in importance in cancer therapy with the continued identification of mutations across tumor types and the development of many selective inhibitors of these mutant enzymes. But with this potential comes difficulties in identifying which patients to treat and how to predict and counteract theÂ development of resistance. A recent study by Ahronian et al. evaluated resistance in colorectal cancer and highlighted many of the difficulties in combatting resistance to BRAFi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahronian et al., 2015</xref>). They found multiple resistance mechanisms across tumors and often more than one resistance mechanism in a particular patient. More importantly, they found that when cells became resistant to one combination of drugs, there was often cross-resistance to other potential combination therapies. This emphasizes the difficulty of targeting individual resistance mechanisms e.g. by adding an inhibitor of a downstream kinase such as MEK to circumvent resistance to BRAF inhibition. Tumor heterogeneity is also a significant concern with studies showing branched evolution in mutations and resistance mechanisms that can contribute to acquired resistance. Such heterogeneity can occur both temporally as well as geographically within the same patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The development of a therapeutic strategy that circumvents different molecularly distinct resistance mechanisms could potentially address these issues. Here we present evidence from cell lines with both experimentally acquired and different molecularly defined resistance mechanisms and from tumor samples from patients with clinically acquired and intrinsic BRAFi resistance, that pharmacological inhibition of autophagy with CQ can achieve this goal. In the cell lines where it was experimentally feasible, we could also demonstrate a similar effect with genetic inhibition of autophagy. Broad applicability is suggested because the various resistance mechanisms that could be overcome included examples that did and did not involve cross-resistance to MEK inhibition, mutational activation of both KRAS and NRAS, EGFR overexpression, paradoxical activation of the ERK pathway by vemurafenib, and a PTEN mutation. Taken together, our data suggest that regardless of the resistance mechanism to the BRAF inhibitor, autophagy inhibition was able to improve the response to BRAFi.</p><p>We have seen rapid clinical responses (in as little as six weeks) in patients with both high and low-grade tumors with acquired BRAFi resistance. These first clinical responses have also been sustained. Patient #1 demonstrated control and reduction of her metastatic tumors for greater than seven months, whereas she had previously shown MRI-measurable tumor growth in as little as two weeks. Moreover, patient #1 has experienced clinical benefit when the autophagy inhibitor was added to vemurafenib despite having demonstrated subsequent acquisition of clinical resistance to MEK inhibition after the acquisition of BRAF resistance. Also, the first patient we reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Levy et al., 2014</xref>) maintained sustained tumor regression on the combination of vemurafenib and CQ for more than 2 Â½ years without significant clinical complications. Although these early clinical results are encouraging, our findings are in a limited number of patients and further clinical investigation is required to verify if this strategy of combining autophagy inhibition with BRAF inhibition provides a durable and widely applicable response in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> tumors.</p><p>In summary, pre-clinical and clinical experience invariably shows that tumor cells rapidly evolve ways around inhibition of mutated kinase pathways like the RAF pathway targeted here. However, based on our results, we hypothesize that by targeting an entirely different cellular process, i.e. autophagy, upon which these same tumor cells rely, it may be feasible to overcome such resistance and thus re-establish effective tumor control. Importantly, our data suggest that this strategy can work even when different resistance mechanisms apply. This can be done using CQ, which is an approved, safe, and inexpensive drug and, perhaps, other more potent autophagy inhibitors that are under development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Egan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Goodall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ronan et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, in the context of BRAF mutant pediatric brain cancers where BRAF inhibition is already being tested, it should be feasible to quickly test this hypothesis in clinical trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>Experiments were designed to evaluate the hypothesis that autophagy inhibition provides a different way to circumvent BRAF inhibitor resistance in CNS tumors and might apply to multiple different mechanisms of kinase inhibitor resistance. The effect of autophagy inhibition to overcome resistance was initially evaluated in vitro in cell lines and then extended to include ex vivo studies of primary tumor samples. To ensure a complete evaluation of the effects on cell growth and death, both long and short-term growth assays were utilized as well as evaluation of LDH release and EdU incorporation as appropriate. Specificity to the autophagy pathway was evaluated with genetic inhibition studies. Final endpoints were defined prior to the start of each experiment. All in vitro experiments were completed with a minimum of three biologic replicates and where possible with triplicate technical replicates.

New data incorporates additional hairpins against ATG5 and ATG7. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) now includes IncuCyte growth monitoring experiments in 794R and AM38R cells with two hairpins each for ATG5 and ATG7 and is discussed in the subsection âGenetic inhibition of autophagy overcomes BRAFi resistance in vitroâ. Importantly, similar results were obtained with the additional hairpins including a significant decrease in growth in 794R and AM38R cells and, in conditions where there was still some measurable growth in the presence of RNAi, the addition of vemurafenib further decreased cell growth. An evaluation of viable cells at the end of these growth experiments was also determined for each hairpin and is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and also discussed in the aforementioned subsection. Western blotting demonstrates the effectiveness of these hairpins and is included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CâD</xref>. These data are consistent with our previous study in parental 794 and AM38 cells that also demonstrated the effectiveness of genetic inhibition of autophagy in BRAF<sup>V600E</sup> brain tumor cells.<sup>1</sup></p><p>Additional studies have been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). All BRAF mutant cell lines investigated to date have had a consistent response to CQ (pharmacologic inhibition of autophagy) with all showing a significant improvement in response to BRAFi when treated with combination therapy. We have also demonstrated in both parental<sup>1</sup> and polyclonal resistant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) that genetic autophagy inhibition is effective in reducing tumor cell growth alone and when combined with BRAFi. To test the effects of genetic inhibition of autophagy in a molecularly defined mechanism of resistance, we evaluated NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> resistant cells as these cells demonstrated significant resistance to single agent vemurafenib therapy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AâD</xref>). In the revised manuscript, we expanded the analysis to include two hairpins each for ATG and ATG7 in AM38 parental, AM38R polyclonal, and AM38 NRAS<sup>Q61K</sup> cells. Results were consistent across the three cell lines as well as across all of the hairpins. An additional <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref> has also been included to better evaluate the effectiveness of the addition of vemurafenib to the genetically inhibited cells. This was important as often the RNAi resulted in no growth of the cells and the combination effect upon addition of vemurafenib was therefore difficult to detect. An endpoint evaluation highlights the differences between the treatment groups that are difficult to see on the growth curves. This was particularly notable in cells with shATG7 #2, which had a very efficient knockdown and loss of protein. Western blotting analysis has been added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref> to show efficiency of RNAi knockdown.</p><p><italic>The reviewers also noted errors in assembly of the manuscript (figures discussed out of order, legends missing or incorrect, incompletely labeled figures) that should be corrected in the revised manuscript.</italic> </p><p>All errors in assembly of the manuscript have been corrected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> has been split into two figures (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) to allow the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> to be discussed in proper order.
