working memory. The neural dynamics in the striatum have been described in tasks with short delay periods (1–4 s), but remain largely uncharacterized for tasks with longer delay periods. We collected and analyzed single unit recordings from the dorsomedial striatum of rats performing a spatial working memory task with delays up to 10 s. We found that neurons were activated sequentially, with the sequences spanning the entire delay period. Surprisingly, this sequential activity was dissociated from stimulus encoding activity, which was present in the same neurons, but preferentially appeared towards the onset of the delay period. These observations contrast with descriptions of sequential dynamics during similar tasks in other brains areas, and clarify the contribution of the striatum to spatial working memory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19507.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19507.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>striatum</kwd><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Akhlaghpour</surname><given-names>Hessameddin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01MH106689-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witten</surname><given-names>Ilana B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witten</surname><given-names>Ilana B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witten</surname><given-names>Ilana B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 DP2 DA035149-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witten</surname><given-names>Ilana B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009670</institution-id><institution>National Alliance for Research on Schizophrenia and Depression</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Witten</surname><given-names>Ilana B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

Given the fundamental nature of working memory, much effort has been invested in studying its underlying neural mechanisms, and several cortical regions have emerged as important contributors. For example, neural activity in prefrontal and parietal cortex encodes stimuli during the delay period of working memory tasks, suggesting these areas contribute to maintaining the memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnsten, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Erlich et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Funahashi et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Guo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Horst and Laubach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Powell and Redish, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Romo et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shadlen and Newsome, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wang et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>However, working memory is not implemented merely in cortex, but instead emerges from the interaction between cortical and subcortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Floresco et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kopec et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Parnaudeau et al., 2013</xref>), with the striatum as a key subcortical region. For example, human imaging studies have noted increased activation of the striatum during working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lewis et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Olesen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Postle and D’Esposito, 1999</xref>). In addition, in the primate caudate, metabolic activity and single cell recordings point to elevated activity during spatial working memory (i.e. tasks that involve a memory for location) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kermadi and Joseph, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Levy et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, electric stimulation or lesions of the primate caudate, as well as pharmacological silencing of the analogous region in rats, the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), leads to disruptions of spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Balleine and O’Doherty, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cohen, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mordvinov, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Rosvold and Delgado, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Spencer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Stamm, 1969</xref>).</p><p>Neural correlates of working memory in the striatum have been characterized in the case of relatively short delay period (1–4 s), but less is known about striatal dynamics in the case of longer delay periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antzoulatos and Miller, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chiba et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hikosaka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Histed et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kermadi and Joseph, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pasupathy and Miller, 2005</xref>). This is a significant knowledge gap, given that animals (and humans) can remember stimuli over many seconds in real world situations.</p><p>We sought to answer several questions in this study. First, is sustained delay-period activity a feature of striatal activity in the case of long delay periods (&gt;4 s), as has been observed in primates for short delay periods (1–4 s)? (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hikosaka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schultz and Romo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schultz et al., 1994</xref>) If so, does that activity encode the memory of the stimulus throughout the delay period?</p><p>Another possibility is that there is sequential transient activation of neurons in the striatum during the delay period. This is a reasonable hypothesis, given that (1) memory-encoding sequences have been observed in cortical and hippocampal areas in working memory tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Horst and Laubach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">MacDonald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>), and (2) the striatum is known to exhibit sequential activity in tasks that do not directly involve working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lustig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matell and Meck, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mello et al., 2015</xref>). If we do observe sequences during a working memory task, do those sequences encode the memory of the stimulus throughout the delay period, as has been observed in other brain regions?</p><p>To address these questions and characterize striatal dynamics during working memory, we trained rats to perform a spatial working memory task that involved long delay periods (up to 10 s). We recorded single unit activity during this task from the DMS, a region involved in spatial working memory and other related aspects of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Corbit and Janak, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kimchi and Laubach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Ragozzino et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stalnaker et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yin et al., 2005</xref>).

At the beginning of each trial, a sample lever would appear in one of two possible locations on the front wall of the chamber. The rat was required to press the sample lever, at which point the lever would retract into the wall and the delay period began. The end of the delay period was signaled by the illumination of the nose port on the back wall of the chamber (delay period duration of 1 s, 5 s, or 10 s, determined randomly). During the delay period, the nose port remained inactive (i.e. the light in the nose port remained off and nose-poking has no effect), and the rats spent the majority of their time at the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, bottom-center panel; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), waiting for the variable length delay period to terminate. After the illumination of the nose port, the rat was then required to place its nose into the illuminated port in order for both levers to appear in the front wall of the chamber. If the rat subsequently pressed the choice lever that did not match the initial sample lever ('non-match'), it would receive a liquid reward in a central receptacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19507.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Delayed non-match to position (DNMP) task.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the task structure.

The shifted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) differed substantially from the non-shifted data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), confirming that the activity sequences that we observed were not an artifact of ordering the activity based on the peak response. In the shifted data, sequences were non-existent in the 5 s and 1 s duration trials and there was no correlation between the order of the peak firing rate for the 10 s delay-duration trials and for the 5 s delay-duration trials (p=0.29, Spearman correlation test). As another method to quantify the presence of sequential firing rate activity, we calculated the ridge-to-background ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; see Materials and methods). Ridge to-background ratios were significantly greater than chance level for all delay period lengths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, p&lt;0.001; one tailed test using the ratios from the randomly shifted data as the null distribution).</p><p>In comparison to the shifted data, the distribution of peak firing rate times in the real data revealed a bias towards the onset of the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In other words, although the sequences spanned the delay period, there were more peaks towards the beginning of the delay period relative to what would be expected by chance (p&lt;0.01, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p><p>Because the rats were not stationary during the entirety of the delay period, the possibility arises that the sequences were in fact a byproduct of neural selectivity for position or movement. To control for this possibility, we re-calculated the sequences while using only the subset of time during which the rats were positioned in front of the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). We found that even when controlling for the rats’ position by excluding times that they were not at the nose port, sequences were evident that closely matched the sequences based on the full dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Ridge-to-background analysis confirmed that the presence of firing rate sequences was statistically significant, even when using only data from times when the rat was at the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We therefore conclude that sequential activations of DMS neurons are not a by-product of responses to movement or position.</p><p>As an additional approach to control for the possibility that sequential firing activity might be due to position and locomotion selectivity, we found that time in the delay period is a significant predictor of neural activity, even when taking into account position/locomotion variables as alternative predictors. More specifically, we modeled each neuron’s spiking activity using two generalized linear models (GLMs), one with position related predictors only (i.e. head position, head direction, and velocity – all calculated using head tracking) and the other with both the position-related predictors as well as time from the delay period onset as a predictor (see Materials and methods for details). Time from delay onset significantly improves the model in 80% of the neurons (84/105) in comparison to a model with only the position/locomotor variables (p&lt;10<sup>–4</sup>, likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without time from delay period as predictor). This demonstrates that the time-dependent changes in firing rates during the delay period cannot be accounted for by position or the other variables we tested. Note that sequences were not specific to the delay period, as we observed similar sequential activation of neurons when time-locking to other task events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Transient encoding of the sample stimulus</title><p>To determine how firing rate sequences during the delay period relates to the sample lever selectivity of the neurons, we compared neural activity for trials when the sample lever was in the right versus the left location, excluding error trials and omission trial.

We calculated the time-varying mutual information between the sample stimulus and the spike trains of individual neurons (within a 0.5 s sliding window), by assuming that spiking of each neuron is a Poisson point process with a time varying rate determined by the sample stimulus and time from the delay onset (see Materials and methods for details). We found many neurons showed transient information peaks (e.g. example neurons 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To determine if these peaks were statistically significant, we calculated the distribution of the maximum information across the entire delay period that would be expected by chance for each neuron by repeatedly shuffling the labels specifying whether a trial had a left or a right sample and recalculating the mutual information. A neuron was considered to significantly encode the sample stimulus during the delay period if its peak sample information was larger than the 99th percentile of that distribution (green shaded area in the bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). By this criteria, 53 of the 105 neurons showed significant encoding of the sample stimulus at some point during the delay period (p&lt;0.01) with peak information values ranging between 0.07 to 0.69 bits (average peak information was 0.34 bits).</p><p>To compare firing rate sequences to stimulus encoding across the recorded population, we compared the time-varying firing rate alongside the sample information for the subset of neurons that encoded the stimulus significantly at some point in the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Surprisingly, the sample information peaks did not display a sequential organization to match the peak firing rate sequence. In fact, the time of the peak sample information did not correlate significantly with the peak firing rate time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, Pearson correlation test; r=0.06, p=0.69). In fact, sample information most often peaked towards the onset of the delay period, with more than 80% of the stimulus encoding neurons (45/53) displaying peak information within the first 2 s of the delay period. On average, peak sample information was significantly earlier than peak activity (p&lt;0.001; Wilcoxon signed rank test. Only neurons with significant information peaks were considered for this analysis).</p><p>We found that individual neurons encode the sample stimulus at specific times in the delay period, and that for many neurons sample encoding was strongest towards the beginning of the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). To quantify how sample encoding in the DMS changes throughout the course of the trial we constructed a population decoder that takes spiking activity of all the recorded neurons within a 500 ms sliding window and evaluated its performance using leave-one-out cross validation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerwinn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pouget et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Quian Quiroga and Panzeri, 2009</xref>). (In order to combine neurons across rats, we create pseudo-trials; see Materials and methods). This provided us with a time varying sample decoding accuracy representing how well DMS neurons encode the sample stimulus at different parts of the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In agreement with our findings from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, sample decoding was highest at the onset of the delay period (at the time of sample lever press) and declined over the course of the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>In order to compare the neural code in DMS for correct and error trials, we calculated the output of the decoder on error trials (after the decoder was trained on correct trials). This allowed us to determine when in the trial neural activity encoded the identity of the sample versus the identity of the choice. This distinction is difficult to make without analysis of error trials, because in correct trials the sample and choice levers perfectly predict one another. Given that the decoder for error trials is trained on correct trials only, a significantly lower than chance level decoding accuracy for error trials means higher than chance level encoding of the choice lever. The accuracy of decoding error trials was high towards the beginning of the delay period, quickly dropped and stayed at chance level throughout most of the delay period, and fell below chance near the choice lever press time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This means that neural activity around the time of the sample lever press encodes the sample lever identity, as opposed to the rat’s future choice. In contrast, at the time of the choice lever press, neural activity encoded the identity of the choice lever, as opposed to the sample identity.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19507.011</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Performance of population decoder for sample lever identity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Accuracy of decoding sample lever from population spiking data within a 0.5 s-wide sliding window in 10 s-delay correct trials.

To address this, we examined a time point during the delay period during which the movement trajectories converge for left and right sample trials. Following the sample press, rats typically move to the opposite wall and wait in front of the nose port for the delay period to end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Instead of aligning trials to the beginning of the delay period (i.e. the sample lever press), we aligned trials to the moment the rats first arrived at the nose port, and excluded the small subset of trials in which they left the nose port within 1.5 s of the nose port arrival. We show that head position is very similar across left and right sample trials following nose port arrival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>), yet our population decoder was able to decode the sample stimulus with high accuracy, even during the first 1.5 s when the rat strictly maintains its head position in front of the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is important as it provides evidence of memory encoding within striatal neurons during the delay period while controlling for the rats’ position on left versus right sample trials.</p><p>In an alternative approach to determine if the sample memory is present in DMS activity in a form beyond encoding of position/locomotion, we sought to test how well the sample stimulus can improve predictions of firing patterns when including other variables as predictors. Towards this end, we modeled each neuron's spiking activity using two generalized linear models (GLMs), one with position/locomotion related predictors only and the other with both task-related and position/locomotion related predictors. The position/locomotion predictors we used were head position, head direction, and head velocity and the task-related variables were time from delay period onset, sample stimulus of current trial, and the interaction between time and sample stimulus. We performed a nested model likelihood ratio test for each neuron to compare the two models, to determine if the addition of the sample memory related variables improved the model (see Materials and methods for details). For more than 90% of neurons (95/105), the model significantly improved when including the sample memory related variables (p&lt;0.0001; Pearson’s chi-squared test). These neurons included 51 of the 53 sample encoding neurons identified through the mutual information analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>).</p><p>As a final approach to address position differences between left and right sample trials, we considered the possibility that differences between the left-sample and right-sample spiking patterns may be due to the fact that the rat is simply in different locations or performing different actions in the two conditions. In order to determine if neurons are encoding the identity of the sample lever rather than motor actions or location in the chamber, we took advantage of the task design in that the rats performed the same lever pressing action at the same location but in different contexts of the task, i.e. either in the sample phase or the choice phase. More specifically, if striatal neurons only encode the action or the location, we would not to expect to see differences in the neural coding for sample lever presses and choice lever presses. Note that the rats’ head position is very similar at the time of sample and choice lever presses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19507.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Context-dependent neural encoding of the lever press.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left plots show similarity of head position during left lever press for sample lever press (top) and choice lever press (bottom).

For instance, the example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> responds to right sample presses but not right choice presses. Such a dramatic difference cannot be explained merely as a result of encoding of motor actions, location, or body position since the rat performs the same action at a similar location but we observe very different neural responses. Much like the example neuron in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, across the population of recorded neurons, some neurons preferentially encoded lever identity during the sample press while others encoded the lever identity during the choice press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

The sequential activity was dissociated from memory-encoding activity, which was present in the same neurons, but tended to occur earlier in the delay period. In other words, the time that a neuron most strongly encoded the sample stimulus during the delay period was not predictive of the time that it was most active.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Insights into the striatal dynamics underlying working memory</title><p>We employed two different methods to quantify the encoding of the sample stimulus during the delay period. The first method was to quantify the mutual information between the sample stimulus and the firing patterns for each individual neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which revealed strong sample stimulus encoding at the onset of the delay period and less encoding during the delay period. The second method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) was to measure our ability to decode the sample stimulus from the entire neural population as a function of time during the delay period. The second method revealed perfect decoding accuracy at the onset of the delay period and greater than chance level accuracy during most of the delay period. Both approaches demonstrated that the sample stimulus is encoded strongly at the onset of the delay period and that stimulus encoding declines noticeably with either measure by 2 s into the delay period. Stronger stimulus encoding toward the onset of the delay period has been reported in studies of primate cortical regions, although those studies did not compare sample stimulus encoding to sequential firing activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brody et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bruce et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Colby et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Gregoriou et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Romo et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments differed from most previous work in that we employed relatively long delay periods (up to 10 s). Considering that sample information in the DMS decreased substantially within several seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), the transient nature of stimulus encoding would have been less obvious if our task had only employed substantially shorter delay periods. Instead, the activity would have been better described as sustained memory-encoding activity. Indeed, previous recordings in primates have reported sustained delay period activity that encodes short-term memory in a subset of caudate neurons with delay periods of 2–4 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hikosaka et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kawagoe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schultz and Romo, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schultz et al., 1994</xref>). In our study, we observed some neurons with stimulus encoding during the delay period that persisted for several seconds, in agreement with prior work. However, no single neuron was found to encode the sample stimulus for the entire duration of the delay period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>A strength of our task design is that it allowed us to compare the same motor action (i.e. lever pressing) in different contexts within the trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This revealed that striatal neurons differentially encode the sample press and the choice press, and that encoding of the same action is dependent on the context of the action within the task. This supports the idea that the striatum is involved in encoding memories of task-related variables, and not merely encoding the rats’ position or movement during the task.</p><p>Unlike most prior work performed in head-fixed primates, our rats were freely moving. Thus, we performed several analyses to control for the possibility that our conclusions of sequential firing rate activity or transient stimulus encoding was a result of motor or position confounds. This included analyzing data from times that the rat was in the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), as well as showing that task-relevant variables remained a significant predictor of neural activity in the vast majority of neurons, even when accounting for movement or position with a generalized linear model (GLM). However, motor and position confounds may have been even more strongly excluded had we instead used a task design that restricts movement of the rat during the delay period. Additionally, in our task design the correct choice of a trial can be determined from the onset of the delay period, making it difficult to distinguish encoding of the memory of the sample stimulus from encoding of future motor actions ('retrospective' versus 'prospective' memory). A more sophisticated task design that enabled dissociation of stimulus encoding and pre-motor activity could have allowed us to make even stronger conclusions about memory encoding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Relevance to theoretical models of the striatal contribution to working memory</title><p>Different theories have been proposed to explain how the striatum contributes to working memory. For example, it has been suggested that the striatum may be involved in initiating the storage of new memories in cortical networks, an idea often referred to as 'gating' (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Reilly and Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Braver and Cohen 2000</xref>). According to this idea, the striatum plays a role in selecting cortical memory buffers that are to be updated and determines the time memory updating occurs, similar to the role the striatum is thought to play in initiating and selecting motor actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bailey and Mair, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bhutani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Grillner et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kropotov and Etlinger, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mink, 1996</xref>). The gating model ascribes a crucial role to the striatum at the onset of the delay period, when new information must be stored in short-term memory buffers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Frank et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gruber et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">O’Reilly and Frank, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Braver and Cohen 2000</xref>). Interestingly, our data emphasizes the importance of the striatum at the beginning of the delay period, as the stimulus is most strongly encoded during that period.</p><p>However, another possibility is that DMS is contributing to maintaining the short-term memory. Although the accuracy of our population decoder decreases substantially during the course of the delay period, the decoding accuracy near the end of the delay period is roughly comparable to behavioral performance even at the 10 s delays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that activity in the DMS might be sufficient to support the animal’s behavior. As another possibility, the DMS could assist cortical areas in maintaining the memory throughout the delay period, irrespective of holding the content of the memory. Memory encoding activity in cortex often appears as persistent elevated activity or sequential activations of neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baeg et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Cromer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Fuster and Alexander, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanks et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Harvey et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Horst and Laubach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kojima and Goldman-Rakic, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">MacDonald et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Pastalkova et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Powell and Redish, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schoenbaum and Eichenbaum, 1995</xref>), which may be implemented using positive feedback through distributed cortico-striato-thalamic loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Houk and Wise, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Middleton and Strick, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang, 2001</xref>). In this view, the sequential activity that spans the delay period in DMS could play a role in exciting cortical memory buffers and enabling memory encoding activity there. As yet another possibility, the stimulus memory may be stored in the striatum in a form that would not be fully detectable in the spiking activity, perhaps in short-term synaptic plasticity, as suggested by recent theoretical models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lundqvist et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mongillo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stokes, 2015</xref>). Future experiments employing transient perturbations of the striatum at sub-trial temporal precision will help address the question of whether the DMS is more important for initiating versus maintaining memories.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Relationship to neural dynamics reported in other tasks</title><p>Sequential neural activity dynamics have been reported in the striatum in tasks that do not involve spatial working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lustig et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Matell and Meck, 2000</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mello et al., 2015</xref>). These studies, taken together with our finding that firing rate sequences we observed here were dissociated from stimulus encoding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>), suggests that the delay-period spanning sequences in DMS support a general role for the striatum in time keeping, rather than a specific role in working memory.</p><p>On a related note, the neural dynamics we observed in the DMS underlying spatial working memory provide an interesting contrast with previous observations of sequential activity dynamics in other regions during spatial working memory.

This suggests a different role for the striatum in working memory relative to these other regions.

There were two retractable levers on the operant chamber front wall (right side of schematic and heat-maps, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). At the beginning of each trial, a sample lever extends out of the wall, (either on the left or the right side – randomly interleaved). The rat is then required to press that lever, after which the lever retracts back into the wall. The rat has to remember the sample lever side for the duration of the delay period (1 s, 5 s, or 10 s – randomly interleaved). The end of the delay period is signaled by the illumination of the nose port on the back wall of the chamber (left side of schematic and heat-maps, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The rat must then poke his nose into the illuminated nose port for both levers to extend from the front wall of the chamber, and then choose one of the two levers. Following a correct lever press, i.e. a choice lever press that does not match the initial sample lever, the rat is rewarded with 40 μl of milk in the reward receptacle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). The rats were given 30 s to respond to the sample lever, 5 s to respond to the activated at the end of the delay period, and 5 s to respond to the choice lever. An incorrect lever press or a failure to respond within the time limit, resulted in a 5 s time-out penalty, during which the house-light is turned off. Trials were followed by 10 s long inter-trial interval (ITI). The task was designed to encourage the rats to spend the delay period at the nose port. Tracking of head-position confirmed that rats spent the majority of the delay period in the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> center panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Before each testing session, rats were anesthetized in an induction chamber and were then moved to a nose cone to maintain anesthesia (with 2% isoflurane) for a total duration of 20–25 min. During this period the cap and dummy cannulae were removed and internal cannulae with appropriate projection length were inserted into the guide cannula. 600 nl of saline or muscimol solution was infused at a rate of 200 nl/min. The internal cannula was removed and dummy cannulae were inserted 4 min after each infusion, to allow the solution to diffuse. Rats were given 20–25 min of recovery time after the infusion and anesthesia, before being placed in the operant chamber to begin behavioral testing. To identify the muscimol concentration that was used for testing each rat, a range of muscimol infusion concentrations (37.5–75 ng) was tested on different days, and the largest concentration for which each rat performed a sufficient number of trials during a session was identified (at least 50 trials per session). Once the concentration was identified, the rats underwent two days of additional infusion sessions.

the term on the right can be calculated from the estimated firing rates in the case &lt;sample&gt; = x.</p><p>To determine if mutual information peaks are statistically significant, we compared mutual information peaks from the data to that obtained with shuffled data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Panzeri et al., 2007</xref>). Towards this end, we randomly shuffled the left sample and right sample trials and recalculated time-varying sample information using the approach explained above. For each neuron, this process was repeated 200 times and the maximum value of sample information within the delay period was taken each time, to obtain a distribution of the sample information peak value expected by chance. The peak information of the non-shuffled data was compared to that distribution to test for significance (p&lt;0.01, one-tailed test). All neurons with peaks larger than the 99th percentile of the shuffled distribution were considered to be significantly encoding the sample stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The green shadings on the bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> are the thresholds for significance of the peak value across the entire delay period interval, obtained by taking the 99th percentile of distribution for sample information peak expected by chance. Information about lever identity for choice and sample presses was calculated in a similar fashion, with the modification that we did not use a sliding window, but rather calculated for the entire 500 ms window centered at a lever press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Population decoder</title><p>We used a maximum likelihood estimator to decode the sample stimulus from population data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Brown et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gerwinn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pouget et al., 2003</xref>). Our decoder was constructed based on the assumption that spiking of each neuron is a Poisson process with a time-varying spike rate function. To obtain a time-dependent evaluation of the decoder, we use a 500 ms wide sliding window. For each neuron the desired 500 ms segment of the spike train is binned into 50 ms bins. The decoder is given an N×k matrix S, where S<sub>i,j</sub> is the spike count of neuron i for bin j of that segment (N denotes the number of neurons, and k is the number of bins).

The error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> are the SEM determined by the number of pseudo-trials if trials were drawn without replacement (i.e. the minimum number of trials for a specific condition across neurons), which is an upperbound on the SEM.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Generalized linear models of spiking activity</title><p>Generalized linear models (GLMs) were constructed to predict the number of spikes of each neuron in each 10 ms time bin using various predictors related to the task and the animal’s behavior. The GLMs modeled number of spikes with a Poisson distribution and a log link function). Positional predictors included: 9 binary predictors for head position, 8 binary predictors for head direction, and 3 numerical predictors for velocity (x component, y component, and magnitude of velocity vector). For the head position predictors, the chamber was divided into nine tiles (3 equal segments along each axis) and each binary predictor represented whether the head position was located in the corresponding tile. For the head direction predictors, the range of possible head directions (0–360 degrees) was divided into 8 equal segments and binary predictors for head direction represented which segment the head direction was in. For the task related predictors, the 10 binary predictors denoted time within the delay period and one binary predictor denoted the identity of the sample stimulus. For the time related predictors, time from delay onset was divided into 1 s long time bins and each of the 10 binary predictors signified whether the current time was in the corresponding 1 s time bin. Nested Model Comparison of GLMs were performed by first fitting the GLM to the data using R function glm() and then performing a likelihood ratio test using the R function anova (model1, model2, test = 'Chisq').</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank J Pillow for helpful suggestions with the data analysis; C Brody and M Murthy for comments on this manuscript; and the rest of the Witten lab for feedback and help with this work.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Earl Miller (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agreed that the authors have been very responsive to the reviewers' previous comments. In particular, the new inactivation experiment is important, and the authors added useful analyses to address the previous concerns. While the manuscript has improved significantly, the reviewers still raised some issues that need to be addressed before publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential points:</p><p>1) The decoding analysis shows that the neuronal activity contains sample information later in the delay (10 sec). Although the decoder performance is lower than that at the onset of delay period, the decoder performance is comparable to the behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This would mean that the striatal activity at the end of delay period can provide sufficient information to support the animals' behavioral performance. This contradicts the authors' claims. We would like to see more robust discussions on this limitation in the conclusion in Discussion.</p><p>2) The authors discuss sequential activity throughout the manuscript but in some places, the existence of sequential activity is not very obvious (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The correlation analysis that the authors performed might be problematic if correlations were drawn by a few outlier points. It would be helpful if the authors come up with a statistical way to quantify 'sequenceness' more directly. For instance, this may be achieved by looking at the rank in time of neurons recorded simultaneously across single trials.</p><p>3) In the inactivation experiment, it is important to report other behavioral measures to know whether DMS inactivation had other effects. Please report whether the range of doses used in the current experiment affected trials performed, time between trials, and other measures that can extracted.</p><p>4) The current task design may not be ideal for examining sample stimulus encoding during delay period. The authors have done a nice job of analyzing the data given what was done but some of the motor/place confounds can be more clearly excluded by the use of a more controlled task design. The authors now discuss their task design as having various advantages in Discussion but it would be useful to also point out disadvantages compared to other working memory paradigms commonly used in non-human primates and some rodent studies (e.g. block or randomly interleaved designs to dissociate sample stimulus from motor/place parameters). Please add some discussions on the limitation of the current task design with respect to strongly drawing conclusions on sample stimulus encoding.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Dissociated sequential activity and stimulus encoding in the dorsomedial striatum during spatial working memory&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Naoshige Uchida as the Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Previous studies have suggested that the striatum, in particular the dorsomedial striatum (DMS), may play a role in working memory. However, the mechanism by which the DMS is involved in working memory is not understood. The authors characterized firing patterns of DMS neurons in rats performing a delayed non-match to position (DNMP) task. The authors observed transient activation of neurons when the rats initiated a delay period by a nose poke. The authors also show that neurons were activated sequentially throughout the delay period. The main conclusion is that the activity at the onset of the delay period conveyed information about sample lever presses, the content of working memory, whereas the sequential activity did not. The authors suggest a possibility that the DMS is involved in working memory by gating information only at the early phase of working memory.</p><p>The reviewers find the main finding very interesting. However, during discussions as well as in the review comments, their enthusiasm differed significantly. Two reviewers were concerned about the possibility that the sequential activity as well as the transient activity at the beginning of the delay period are related to the movement or position of the animal and not directly related to working memory itself. The reviewers understood that the authors are not claiming that the sequential activation conveys information about working memory contents, but pointed out two problems. First, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that the information about sample lever presses are present throughout the delay period, so this contradicts with the analysis using mutual information. Second, what is causing the sequential activity remains unclear (i.e. is it really related to working memory, or other motor or place parameters?). The reviewers thought that the sequential activity is very interesting regardless of what it relates to. However, they thought that, to address these issues, more thorough analysis on behavior during the performance of the task is necessary although the task design appears to make it difficult to dissociate confounding factors completely. Another important issue is that it remains to be established whether the firing difference at the onset of the delay period is due to the content of working memory. The reviewers thought that showing that more information is available in neural activity when type of lever press (sample versus choice lever press) is specified is not sufficient to demonstrate this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The study by Akhlaghpour and colleagues reports interesting data on ensemble activity in the striatum during a delayed non-matching to position task. The methods for data acquisition and analysis are more than adequate to address the target issues of the manuscript. However, several issues in the behavioral design reduced my enthusiasm for the paper, and really should be addressed before it is considered for publication.</p><p>First, can the authors show that perturbing sequential activity in the striatum alters the animals’ performance of the task in a way that is predicted by the striatum participating in working memory? You may not have data (yet) on this, but it would make the paper much stronger.</p><p>Second, the task that was used is somewhat limited in being able to find evidence for working memory given that only two options are presented to the animals. Despite this limitation, the study is still interesting and could provide novel insights into striatal function if two major issues are addressed. Major challenges for this research are (1) to dissociate the sequential activations that are reported from positional and locomotor behaviors that could be the true generators of the sequential activations and (2) to demonstrate that the sequential activations do not occur in a sensory-guided version of the task (for example, using visual cues). Resolving these issues are most important for establishing the validity of the authors' interpretations.</p><p>Also, how do the sequential activations relate to the persistent activity reported by Schultz and colleagues in early primate recordings in the striatum. They never referred to those activity patterns as working memory, but did claim to find such activations to be quite common within the striatum. Why do you think that you did not find such activities in your study? (I think that it is because your rats were freely moving and there were many behaviors that could influence the striatal neurons during the delays between responses.) I think that you should comment on this issue in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript studies the relationship between sequential activity in the striatum and the code for spatial working memory using a DNMP task and electrical recordings. The paper is clearly written and clearly presented. The topic investigated is an interesting one. The analyses for the most part appear carefully performed and well done. I have one major concern relating to how well the authors can relate the activity they observed to working memory rather than other task variables, such as motor actions. This concern made it difficult for me to be convinced that the dissociation the authors propose, between sequential activity and working memory, is strongly supported. Without improvement in this area, I think the main conclusions cannot be stated with high confidence.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>1) I am not convinced the authors have clearly shown that working memory activity is encoded in the population of striatal neurons recorded. The evidence for working memory activity is that there is mutual (MI) between the sample lever identity and firing rates during the delay period and that the decoder can read-out above chance levels the identity of the sample lever during the delay. However, it seems that another possibility is that the rat performs different actions following a left and right sample lever press and that the activity is related mostly to different motor actions on different trial types, rather than working memory. The encoding of motor actions might be reasonable for explaining why the MI is the highest at the start of the delay because the rat likely moves very differently away from the right and left levers. In addition, the decoder performance for sample lever identity is highest at the times during which the motor actions for the different sample lever trial types is most distinct, namely right after the sample lever press and during the response lever press (which involves different levers on correct trials for different samples). This point is consistent with the decoding of sample lever identity on error trials based on training the decoder on correct trials: the decoder performance is near perfect at the sample lever press and near zero at the response lever press. The one argument against this hypothesis is that presses of the same lever have different neural activity during sample and response periods. However, there are likely many different motor actions occurring in these cases, such as anticipatory licking during the response but not sample period or different body actions and orientations based on entrance into the port. Given the striatum's known role in driving motor actions, it seems that a perfectly valid interpretation of the data could be that the striatal firing is related to motor actions and is not related to working memory at all. With the current presentation of the behavioral data, it is impossible to understand if this alternative hypothesis can be excluded.</p><p>Therefore, I think more needs to be done to rule out the possibility that what the authors consider to be working memory signals are simply reflections of motor action differences of the rat on right and left sample lever trials. I acknowledge that this is a potentially never-ending source of additional analyses and measurements if all possible motor actions are considered. However, it seems like more could be done with the current data. Some straightforward plots and analyses could go a long way in helping the reader on this topic.</p><p>Do the rats have different movement patterns following right and left sample lever presses? The authors could plot movement trajectories at various time intervals after left and right sample lever presses and also at various time intervals preceding left and right response lever presses. These trajectories could be supported and summarized using heat maps for occupancy during left and right sample trials at various time points, as used currently in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In these analyses, a marking of time and trajectories is critical, which is currently absent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> heat maps.</p><p>In addition, the authors could use classifiers or decoding methods to determine if they can predict whether the sample lever pressed was left or right based on the rat's position, heading direction, movement speed, and all other behavioral parameters they have measured. This classification analysis could be performed as a function of time from sample lever press.</p><p>Can the authors decode movement-related signals from the striatal firing, such as current movement speed or upcoming actions (changes in heading direction)? If these signals exist, then it is possible that these signals are the dominant factors during the delay period. If the authors can decode things like current or upcoming movements from striatal firing, then they can ask if the types of decoded movements differ on left and right sample lever press trials.</p><p>These points are essential to the paper because if the authors want to say that working memory information is encoded and separable from the sequential activity, then it is critical to be very confident that the working memory signal is actually present in a form beyond motor actions.</p><p>2) The authors include only a subset of neurons for the analysis of MI in comparison to firing rate peaks. The inclusion criterion is whether at any point the MI goes above 99% of the shuffled MI values (p value of 0.01). I think the authors are doing many comparisons (many timepoints) per neuron for this MI significance test; however, they have not done a multiple comparisons correction. If the authors perform many comparisons in each neuron, then a multiple comparisons correction is needed, such as a Bonferroni correction. Without such a correction, a significant false positive rate, well above 1%, is expected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a straightforward and well-written manuscript describing neural dynamics in the striatum or rats performing a spatial working memory task. The task is a classic and the analyses and results convincing. The intriguing aspect of the results is that striatal neurons fire and different points in the delay such that peaks in spiking are spread throughout the memory delay. There is an interesting dissociation, however, peaks in information about the remembered sample occur at the beginning and end of the delay and thus does not line up with the peaks in firing.</p><p>I don't really have any major concerns. Just suggestions for improvement.</p><p>The authors rightly (as far as I know) point out that these results are unique in the rodent literature and likely made possible by the use of a 10 sec delay. However, there have been similar results reported in the primate cortex. For example, the peak of information at the beginning and end of the delay is seen quite commonly in the primate prefrontal and parietal cortex. I encourage the authors to look at this literature and cite some relevant studies.</p><p>Likewise, the sequential nature of activation in the delay has also been reported in primate prefrontal cortex, albeit for information. For example, check out <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Cromer et al. 2011, J. Cog. Neuro. I think the authors should acknowledge and discuss this. And also, they need to be a little more cautious in their conclusion that the 10 sec delay was necessary. It may be in rodents, but not primates. It is interesting that primate cortex shows sequential information whereas rodent striatum less so. And interesting means worth mentioning.</p><p>Finally, there is an emerging class of working memory models that suggest that working memories are not encoded by sustained activity but instead by transient changes in synaptic weights induced by spiking activity. For example, consider Lunqvist et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) and the &quot;activity-silent&quot; models of Stokes. The result here seems to support this class of models seeing that activity isn't sustained across the delay. I think at this point should be raised.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19507.016</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic> </p><p><italic>The reviewers agreed that the authors have been very responsive to the reviewers' previous comments. In particular, the new inactivation experiment is important, and the authors added useful analyses to address the previous concerns. While the manuscript has improved significantly, the reviewers still raised some issues that need to be addressed before publication in eLife.</italic> </p><p><italic>Essential points:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The decoding analysis shows that the neuronal activity contains sample information later in the delay (10 sec). Although the decoder performance is lower than that at the onset of delay period, the decoder performance is comparable to the behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This would mean that the striatal activity at the end of delay period can provide sufficient information to support the animals' behavioral performance. This contradicts the authors' claims. We would like to see more robust discussions on this limitation in the conclusion in Discussion.</italic> </p><p>Thanks for the clarification. We now point out in the Discussion that although much higher levels of information and decoding accuracy are available in DMS neural activity towards the onset of the delay period, the decoding accuracy remains above chance for much of the delay period, at a level that is roughly comparable to the behavioral performance. This means it is possible that information within DMS is used for maintaining the shortterm memory. The only way to definitively address the question of whether DMS is more important for updating versus maintaining the memory is through future experiments involving fast timescale, subtrial manipulations, which could potentially distinguish on a causal level between these two possibilities (see subsection “Relevance to theoretical models of the striatal contribution to working memory” last paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) The authors discuss sequential activity throughout the manuscript but in some places, the existence of sequential activity is not very obvious (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The correlation analysis that the authors performed might be problematic if correlations were drawn by a few outlier points. It would be helpful if the authors come up with a statistical way to quantify 'sequenceness' more directly. For instance, this may be achieved by looking at the rank in time of neurons recorded simultaneously across single trials.</italic> </p><p>As an additional measure to quantify the presence of sequences in the firing rates, we now include the ridgetobackground analysis, an approach previously established for this specific purpose by Harvey et al., 2012. The ridgetobackground analysis takes ridge activity (defined as average activity in a fixed time window around the peak firing rate time) divided by background activity for each neuron, and statistically compares this ratio in the real data to a null distribution which is obtained by repeatedly shifting spike times in the behavioral session. As expected, we found that the ridgetobackground ratio was significantly above chance levels across all conditions presented in the paper (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In the inactivation experiment, it is important to report other behavioral measures to know whether DMS inactivation had other effects. Please report whether the range of doses used in the current experiment affected trials performed, time between trials, and other measures that can extracted.</italic> </p><p>To supplement the accuracy and latency measures reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, we now report the effect of muscimol on the number of trials performed, sample omission rates, trials abort rates, sample bias, and choice bias (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Unlike accuracy, none of these other measures were significantly affected by muscimol across the population of rats (n=7). However, a few of the rats did seem to perform fewer trials with DMS inactivation (with more sample omissions and more trial aborts), which is consistent with DMS being implicated in motivation or response vigor (Wang et al. 2013). Even if this effect were to become statistically significant across a larger population of rats, our conclusion stands that silencing of DMS activity impairs accuracy in the delayed nonmatch to sample task for trials that are completed.</p><p><italic>4) The current task design may not be ideal for examining sample stimulus encoding during delay period. The authors have done a nice job of analyzing the data given what was done but some of the motor/place confounds can be more clearly excluded by the use of a more controlled task design. The authors now discuss their task design as having various advantages in Discussion but it would be useful to also point out disadvantages compared to other working memory paradigms commonly used in non-human primates and some rodent studies (e.g. block or randomly interleaved designs to dissociate sample stimulus from motor/place parameters). Please add some discussions on the limitation of the current task design with respect to strongly drawing conclusions on sample stimulus encoding.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for noting this. We have added a paragraph to the Discussion on the limitations of our task design. Motor confounds may have been more strongly excluded had we used a task design that restricts the movement of the rat during the delay period. Additionally, our task makes it difficult to distinguish between motor planning and sample stimulus memory because the correct choice lever can be determined from the beginning of the delay period (see subsection “Insights into the striatal dynamics underlying working memory” third paragraph).</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>[…] The reviewers find the main finding very interesting. However, during discussions as well as in the review comments, their enthusiasm differed significantly. Two reviewers were concerned about the possibility that the sequential activity as well as the transient activity at the beginning of the delay period are related to the movement or position of the animal and not directly related to working memory itself. The reviewers understood that the authors are not claiming that the sequential activation conveys information about working memory contents, but pointed out two problems. First, the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows that the information about sample lever presses are present throughout the delay period, so this contradicts with the analysis using mutual information.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the thorough attention to the details of our results. Regarding the potential discrepancy between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref> (previously 4B and 6A), the two panels were generated using two different methods to quantify the encoding of the sample stimulus during the delay period. Our first method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) was to quantify the mutual information between the sample stimulus and the firing patterns for each individual neuron, only including the units with significant sample information peaks. That method revealed strong encoding at the onset of the delay period and very little encoding during the delay period (only a few neurons appear to encode the memory of the sample stimulus above 0.2 bits later in the delay period). Our second method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) was to measure our ability to decode the sample stimulus from the entire neural population as a function of time during the delay period. The second method revealed perfect decoding accuracy at the onset of the delay period and greater than chance level accuracy during most of the delay period. Based on the Reviewer comment, we now appreciate that these two results may at first appear to contradict each other, since a small amount of sample information in a few neurons contributes to an abovechance level of sample decoding accuracy when using the population data. However, the takehome message from the two plots is the same: the sample stimulus is encoded strongly at the onset of the delay period and that sample encoding declines noticeably with either measure by 23s into the delay period. We briefly clarify this in the Discussion of the revised manuscript (subsection “Insights into the striatal dynamics underlying working memory”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Second, what is causing the sequential activity remains unclear (i.e. is it really related to working memory, or other motor or place parameters?). The reviewers thought that the sequential activity is very interesting regardless of what it relates to. However, they thought that, to address these issues, more thorough analysis on behavior during the performance of the task is necessary although the task design appears to make it difficult to dissociate confounding factors completely.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for commenting that the sequential activity is very interesting, and for raising an important issue that needs to be addressed. To demonstrate that the sequences are not a byproduct of movement or position, we use the head tracking data and show that even when the rat’s head is in the nose port and therefore position is controlled for, the sequences are still present. This analysis is described in detail in our pointbypoint responses to Reviewer #1 below.</p><p><italic>Another important issue is that it remains to be established whether the firing difference at the onset of the delay period is due to the content of working memory. The reviewers thought that showing that more information is available in neural activity when type of lever press (sample versus choice lever press) is specified is not sufficient to demonstrate this point.</italic> </p><p>We believe you have raised an important question regarding whether the sample encoding we observe at the onset of the delay period is in fact simply encoding of position or motor actions. To support our claim that the firing rate differences observed between left and right sample presses cannot be accounted for merely by position, motion, or motor actions, we compare neural correlates of the sample press with neural correlates of the choice press (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In our revised submission, we do so by examining a much shorter time window around the time of the lever press (only ± 0.25s rather than ± 1s as in our original submission). This narrow time window was chosen based on examination of the head tracking data to minimize movement towards and away from the lever. Our analysis reveals that DMS neurons encode choice presses and sample presses differently. We provide details regarding this analysis in our responses to Reviewer #2 below.</p><p>In addition, we now provide new analysis of sample encoding when the rats first arrived at the nose port, shortly after pressing the sample lever. In this case, we show that head position is maintained at a similar location for left and right sample trials. Yet we observe significant sample encoding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). This further supports our claim that sample encoding during the delay period cannot be explained by the rats’ position and motion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The study by Akhlaghpour and colleagues reports interesting data on ensemble activity in the striatum during a delayed non-matching to position task. The methods for data acquisition and analysis are more than adequate to address the target issues of the manuscript. However, several issues in the behavioral design reduced my enthusiasm for the paper, and really should be addressed before it is considered for publication.</italic> </p><p>Thank you very much for describing our data as interesting and for mentioning that the data acquisition and analysis are more than adequate. As you will see below, we have worked to address your concern about the influence of the subject’s movement and position on our conclusions through additional analyses and experiments.</p><p><italic>First, can the authors show that perturbing sequential activity in the striatum alters the animals’ performance of the task in a way that is predicted by the striatum participating in working memory? You may not have data (yet) on this, but it would make the paper much stronger.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We agree that this is a good experiment which would make the paper much stronger. To this end, we trained a new cohort of rats on the delayed nonmatch to position task and inactivated the DMS with bilateral infusion of muscimol. Infusion of muscimol in the DMS led to much lower accuracy when compared to infusion of saline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, p &lt; 1e6 repeated measures ANOVA, n=7 rats). The fact that rats press the incorrect choice lever more frequently when the DMS is inactivated suggests that the DMS activity contributes to spatial working memory in this task.</p><p><italic>Second, the task that was used is somewhat limited in being able to find evidence for working memory given that only two options are presented to the animals. Despite this limitation, the study is still interesting and could provide novel insights into striatal function if two major issues are addressed. Major challenges for this research are (1) to dissociate the sequential activations that are reported from positional and locomotor behaviors that could be the true generators of the sequential activations and (2) to demonstrate that the sequential activations do not occur in a sensory-guided version of the task (for example, using visual cues). Resolving these issues are most important for establishing the validity of the authors' interpretations.</italic> </p><p>We very much appreciate the suggestion to better account for positional variables in our analyses. We are confident that our paper is much stronger as a result of the analytical approaches that we describe below.</p><p>To demonstrate that sequential activations cannot be explained by positional or locomotor behavior, we took two distinct and complementary approaches.</p><p>In our first approach, we plotted the activity of DMS neurons only for the subset of time that the rat was at the nose port, effectively controlling for body position and locomotion. The rats spend the majority of the delay period positioned at the nose port, waiting for the end of the delay period (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>We recalculated the firing rate sequences using only the subset of time during which the rats were positioned at the nose port, thereby controlling for position (Figure —figure supplement 1AD). The firing rates were calculating by aligning spiking activity to delay period onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, leftmost panel) or to time of arrival at the nose port (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>, leftmost panel). Time bins in which the rat was not at the nose port for a sufficient amount of time to calculate firing rates were excluded (masked in white in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>; see Methods). As you can see below, there is a high degree of correlation in the time of peak firing calculated by only using data from when the animal was at the nose port versus using the entire dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref> for alignment to noseport arrival, r = 0.72, p &lt; 106 Pearson correlation test; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref> for alignment to delay period onset, r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.05 Pearson correlation test). This demonstrates that sequences were not simply neural correlates of position or locomotion, and occurred even when the rats remained at the nose port.</p><p>In our second approach to demonstrate that sequential firing activity cannot be explained by position and locomotion, we used a statistical model to show that time in the delay period is a significant predictor of neural activity, even when taking into account the rats’ position/locomotor variables. What this means is that temporal fluctuations in firing rate that occurs during the delay period are not merely a byproduct of position/locomotion variables. More specifically, we modeled each neuron’s spiking activity using two generalized linear models (GLMs), one with position related predictors only (i.e. head position, head direction, and velocity – all calculated using head tracking) and the other with positionrelated predictors in conjunction with time from the delay period onset as a predictor. We demonstrate that time from delay onset significantly improves the model in 80% of the neurons (84/105) in comparison to a model with only the position/locomotor variables (p &lt; 0.0001, likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without time from delay period as predictor). This demonstrates that the timedependent changes in firing rates during the delay period cannot be accounted for by position or the other variables we tested. (see Methods for more details on the model).</p><p>Thank you for mentioning that it would be interesting to know if the sequences would occur in a sensory version of the task. Although we do not have this data, we do want to point out that our conclusions do not rest on the assumption that sequential activity would not appear in a sensory guided version of the task. In fact, we think it is likely that we would indeed observe sequential activity in a guided version of the task, given that we see sequential activation of neurons even outside the delay period (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>). Furthermore, the presence of sequences in a sensory guided version of the task will not necessarily be informative as to whether these sequences are related to working memory. It could be that sequential activation enables working memory, but is nevertheless present in tasks that are not related to working memory.</p><p><italic>Also, how do the sequential activations relate to the persistent activity reported by Schultz and colleagues in early primate recordings in the striatum. They never referred to those activity patterns as working memory, but did claim to find such activations to be quite common within the striatum. Why do you think that you did not find such activities in your study? (I think that it is because your rats were freely moving and there were many behaviors that could influence the striatal neurons during the delays between responses.) I think that you should comment on this issue in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for raising this question. In the Discussion section of our new submission (subsection “Insights into the striatal dynamics underlying working memory”, second paragraph) we now elaborate on how our study relates to previous studies in primates. Previous recordings in primates show sustained delay period activity that encodes future choice in a substantial fraction of caudate neurons (Schultz et al. 1994, Hikosaka et al. 1989, Schultz &amp; Romo 1988; Kawagoe et al., 1998). However the delay periods in these studies were typically 24s, which is much shorter than the 10s delays used in our task, and there was a low proportion of neurons that showed sustained activity over that delay period (less than 10% of task modulated caudate neurons had sustained activity in one study that quantified this with delay periods up to 4s, i.e. Hikosaka et a. 1989, and less than a third of recorded neurons were found to have sustained memory related activity in another study that used delay periods 11.5s long, i.e. Kawagoe et al. 1988). In our study we do observe some neurons with sample encoding during the delay period that persisted for 24s (such as the one illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>), in agreement with prior work. Given that the prior studies did not employ longer delay periods, we do not think our new data contradicts the prior studies.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19507.014</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19507.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19507.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-19507-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p><italic>This manuscript studies the relationship between sequential activity in the striatum and the code for spatial working memory using a DNMP task and electrical recordings.

The evidence for working memory activity is that there is mutual (MI) between the sample lever identity and firing rates during the delay period and that the decoder can read-out above chance levels the identity of the sample lever during the delay. However, it seems that another possibility is that the rat performs different actions following a left and right sample lever press and that the activity is related mostly to different motor actions on different trial types, rather than working memory. The encoding of motor actions might be reasonable for explaining why the MI is the highest at the start of the delay because the rat likely moves very differently away from the right and left levers.

The one argument against this hypothesis is that presses of the same lever have different neural activity during sample and response periods. However, there are likely many different motor actions occurring in these cases, such as anticipatory licking during the response but not sample period or different body actions and orientations based on entrance into the port.

The authors could plot movement trajectories at various time intervals after left and right sample lever presses and also at various time intervals preceding left and right response lever presses. These trajectories could be supported and summarized using heat maps for occupancy during left and right sample trials at various time points, as used currently in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In these analyses, a marking of time and trajectories is critical, which is currently absent in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> heat maps.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for these helpful comments and suggestions. As you mention, our claim is that we see encoding of the sample stimulus towards the onset of the delay period and that this sample encoding is not simply a byproduct of encoding of body position, location, or motor actions. We support this claim by the following approaches: first by more carefully examining the onset of the delay period when the rat presses the sample lever, and second by examining the time during the delay period during which the rats’ position for the right and left sample trials converge.</p><p>Before describing the details of these analyses, we want to point out that although we are controlling for the rats’ head position and action in both of these analyses, we recognize that what we refer to as sample encoding may in fact be encoding of an action intended to be executed in the future, sometimes referred to as premotor activity or prospective memory. In fact, given that there is a one-to-one mapping between the identity of the sample lever and the correct choice lever to be pressed at the offset of the delay period, our task design does not allow us to easily distinguish between retrospective and prospective memory (i.e. sample encoding versus premotor activity). We now bring up this important caveat up in the Discussion-  thank you for bringing it up. It is worth noting that in the second analysis described below for which we examine the time during the delay period during which the head position trajectories converge, the head position is similar for left and right trials for several seconds following the time window being analyzed, as will be evident in the occupancy maps.</p><p>In the first analysis, we show that the firing patterns at the onset of the delay period cannot be fully accounted for by position or action, by showing dramatic differences in encoding of lever identity for sample presses versus choice presses. This is a meaningful comparison because the rats are doing similar actions (i.e. pressing the left or right lever), but in a different context within the trial (i.e. sample vs choice press). We have now replotted the sample versus choice analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (previously <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) using a shorter time window (only ± 0.25s around the lever press, rather than ± 1s as before). The new time window was chosen to minimize movement before and after the lever press (see similarity in head position for sample and choice lever presses during this time window in 7A). This ensures that we do not include any additional motor actions such as anticipatory licking at the reward port, or movement towards or away from the lever for this analysis. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, we report the similarity in head position of the choice lever presses and sample lever presses. Next, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, we show an example neuron that responds to right sample presses but not to right choice presses. This observation cannot be explained merely as a result of encoding of motor actions, location, or body position since the rat performs the same action at a similar location but we observed very different neural responses. Much like the example neuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), across the population of recorded neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), some neurons preferentially encoded lever identity during the sample press, while others during the choice press. In fact, there was significantly more dispersion in the difference between sample and choice information than expected by chance (inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C, p</xref> &lt; 105; two sample Ftest for equality of variance for (sample information  choice information) in real vs. shuffled data). This analysis supports the conclusion that DMS firing patterns are not merely reflecting position or motor actions.</p><p>In our second analysis, we instead examine a time point during the delay period during which the movement trajectories converge for left and right sample trials. Following the sample press, rats move to the opposite wall and wait in front of the nose port for the delay period to end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). For this analysis, instead of aligning trials to the beginning of the delay period (i.e. the sample lever press, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), we align trials to the moment the rats first arrive at the nose port, excluding the small subset of trials in which they left the nose port within 1.5 seconds of the nose port arrival. Note that the head position is very similar for left and right sample trials at the nose port arrival time and in the following seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We then assess the ability of our population decoder to decode the sample stimulus from the neural data using leaveoneout cross validation with a 0.5s wide sliding window (same approach used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We noted high decoding accuracy, even during the first 1.5s during which the rat always maintains its head position in front of the nose port (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is important as it provides evidence of memory encoding within striatal neurons during the delay period while carefully controlling for the rats’ position on left vs right sample trials. Note that the decoding accuracy is highest preceding the nosepoke arrival, which is consistent with our conclusion that sample encoding is highest at the onset of the delay period.</p><p><italic>In addition, the authors could use classifiers or decoding methods to determine if they can predict whether the sample lever pressed was left or right based on the rat's position, heading direction, movement speed, and all other behavioral parameters they have measured. This classification analysis could be performed as a function of time from sample lever press.</italic> </p><p><italic>Can the authors decode movement-related signals from the striatal firing, such as current movement speed or upcoming actions (changes in heading direction)? If these signals exist, then it is possible that these signals are the dominant factors during the delay period. If the authors can decode things like current or upcoming movements from striatal firing, then they can ask if the types of decoded movements differ on left and right sample lever press trials.</italic> </p><p><italic>These points are essential to the paper because if the authors want to say that working memory information is encoded and separable from the sequential activity, then it is critical to be very confident that the working memory signal is actually present in a form beyond motor actions.</italic> </p><p>These are helpful suggestions to address the possibility of sample selectivity and sequential activity being a byproduct of position/motor variables such as head position, head direction, and velocity. In fact, we feel it is reasonable to expect neurons to display a mixture of selectivity for position/motor variables and for memories of taskrelated variables. However, one of our conclusions is that neural activity cannot be fully explained without taskrelated variables, such as the memory of sample stimulus or time from delay onset. To determine if this conclusion is justified, we sought to determine quantitatively if taskrelated variables had predictive power, even when accounting for motor variables. Towards this end, we modeled neural activity based on both task related variables and motor related variables. More specifically, we modeled each neuron's spiking activity using two generalized linear models (GLMs): one with only position related predictors and the other with both taskrelated and positionrelated predictors. The position/motion predictors we used were head position, head direction, and head velocity and the taskrelated variables were time from delay period onset, sample stimulus of current trial, and the interaction between time and sample stimulus. We performed a nested model likelihood ratio test for each neuron to compare the two models, to determine if the addition of the taskrelated variables improved the model (note that a likelihood ratio test controls appropriately for the difference in number of parameters between the models and that these models were based on delayperiod data only). For more than 90% of neurons, the model significantly improved when including the taskrelated variables (p &lt; 0.0001, likelihood ratio test comparing models with and without task related variables as predictor). This provides quantitative evidence that there is significant taskrelated encoding in these neurons, even when quantitatively accounting for the motor variables.</p><p>Again, thank you for the suggestions to better account for head position and movements in our analyses – we are confident that our paper is much stronger as a result.</p><p><italic>2) The authors include only a subset of neurons for the analysis of MI in comparison to firing rate peaks. The inclusion criterion is whether at any point the MI goes above 99% of the shuffled MI values (p value of 0.01). I think the authors are doing many comparisons (many timepoints) per neuron for this MI significance test; however, they have not done a multiple comparisons correction. If the authors perform many comparisons in each neuron, then a multiple comparisons correction is needed, such as a Bonferroni correction. Without such a correction, a significant false positive rate, well above 1%, is expected.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for this comment. In fact, we do one comparison for each neuron – not one comparison for each timepoint. The threshold is defined as the expected peak value across the entire time period, regardless of when the peak information occurs. With the current method, we expect the number of false positive neurons to be 1%. We appreciate that you pointed this out as a potential source of ambiguity and so we now provide a clearer explanation in the Methods.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>This is a straightforward and well-written manuscript describing neural dynamics in the striatum or rats performing a spatial working memory task. The task is a classic and the analyses and results convincing. The intriguing aspect of the results is that striatal neurons fire and different points in the delay such that peaks in spiking are spread throughout the memory delay. There is an interesting dissociation, however, peaks in information about the remembered sample occur at the beginning and end of the delay and thus does not line up with the peaks in firing.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for your positive comments. We are delighted that you found our study intriguing and that you share our enthusiasm about these findings.</p><p><italic>I don't really have any major concerns. Just suggestions for improvement.</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors rightly (as far as I know) point out that these results are unique in the rodent literature and likely made possible by the use of a 10 sec delay. However, there have been similar results reported in the primate cortex. For example, the peak of information at the beginning and end of the delay is seen quite commonly in the primate prefrontal and parietal cortex. I encourage the authors to look at this literature and cite some relevant studies.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for these points. We now cite some classic papers and also some more recent studies that report stronger activity and more information at the onset of the delay period in LIP and FEF (Clark, Noudoost, and Moore 2012; Bruce et al. 1985; Colby, Duhamel, and Goldberg 1996; Gregoriou, Gotts, and Desimone 2012).</p><p><italic>Likewise, the sequential nature of activation in the delay has also been reported in primate prefrontal cortex, albeit for information. For example, check out <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> of Cromer et al. 2011, J. Cog. Neuro. I think the authors should acknowledge and discuss this. And also, they need to be a little more cautious in their conclusion that the 10 sec delay was necessary. It may be in rodents, but not primates. It is interesting that primate cortex shows sequential information whereas rodent striatum less so. And interesting means worth mentioning.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for the additional reference we now cite (Cromer et al. 2011). In addition, we agree that is a good point that there may be important species differences in neural correlates of working memory between rodents and primates. We now mention this in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Finally, there is an emerging class of working memory models that suggest that working memories are not encoded by sustained activity but instead by transient changes in synaptic weights induced by spiking activity. For example, consider Lunqvist et al. (2010, 2011, 2012) and the &quot;activity-silent&quot; models of Stokes. The result here seems to support this class of models seeing that activity isn't sustained across the delay. I think at this point should be raised.</italic> </p><p>This is a very good point  thank you for bringing this up. We now reference the models of (Mongillo, Barak, and Tsodyks 2008; Stokes 2015; Lundqvist et al. 2010) in our Discussion as a possible interpretation of our results.</p></body></sub-article></article>
