information instructs adult tissue maintenance is poorly understood. Planarians undergo whole-body regeneration and tissue turnover, providing a model for adult positional information studies. Genes encoding secreted and transmembrane components of multiple developmental pathways are predominantly expressed in planarian muscle cells. Several of these genes regulate regional identity, consistent with muscle harboring positional information. Here, single-cell RNA-sequencing of 115 muscle cells from distinct anterior-posterior regions identified 44 regionally expressed genes, including multiple <italic>Wnt</italic> and <italic>ndk/FGF receptor-like (ndl/FGFRL</italic>) genes. Two distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits, involving juxtaposed anterior <italic>FGFRL</italic> and posterior <italic>Wnt</italic> expression domains, controlled planarian head and trunk patterning. <italic>ndl-3</italic> and <italic>wntP-2</italic> inhibition expanded the trunk, forming ectopic mouths and secondary pharynges, which independently extended and ingested food. <italic>fz5/8-4</italic> inhibition, like that of <italic>ndk</italic> and <italic>wntA</italic>, caused posterior brain expansion and ectopic eye formation. Our results suggest that FGFRL-Wnt circuits operate within a body-wide coordinate system to control adult axial positioning.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12845.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12845.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12845.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Some animals can regrow tissues that have been amputated. A group of flatworms called planarians are often used as a model to study the regeneration process because they are able to restore any lost tissue or even an entire animal from tiny pieces of the body. For regeneration to be successful, it is important to ensure that the new tissues form in the correct locations in the body.</p><p>The planarian body is divided into three main parts: head, trunk and tail. Several gene products involved in specifying what tissues regenerate are made by muscle cells along the planarian body. Some of the genes are involved in mechanisms that allow cells to communicate with each other, such as the Wnt signaling pathway. These genes could form a coordinated system to control regeneration, but their precise roles remain poorly understood.</p><p>Two groups of researchers have now independently identified genes that provide cells with information about their location in the flatworm body. Scimone, Cote et al. used a technique called RNA sequencing in individual muscle cells to identify 44 genes that have different levels of expression across the head, trunk and tail regions. These genes included multiple components of the Wnt signaling pathway and others that encode members of the FGFRL family of signaling proteins.</p><p>Further experiments revealed two distinct sets of genes, or “gene circuits”, that provide information to correctly position tissues in the head and trunk regions of the worm. For example, inhibiting the activity of the <italic>wntP-2</italic> or <italic>ndl-3</italic> genes increased the size of the trunk of the worms and caused extra mouths and pharynges (muscular organ used for eating) to form. On the other hand, blocking the activity of genes in the other gene circuit caused the brain to expand and extra eyes to form.</p><p>Another study by Lander and Petersen found that <italic>wntP-2 and ndl-3</italic> act with another gene called <italic>ptk7</italic>, which encodes another component of the Wnt signaling pathway. Together these findings suggest that the Wnt-FGFRL circuits act in a body-wide system that co-ordinates where and which new tissues form during regeneration. A future challenge is to find out how the genes identified in these studies interact and how the cells of the animal interpret this information to properly regenerate missing tissues.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12845.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12845.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>planarians</kwd><kwd>patterning</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd><kwd>FGFRL</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>muscle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddien</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reddien</surname><given-names>Peter W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA sequencing identifies an adult regional gene expression map in planarian muscle that includes two FGFRL-Wnt circuits controlling head and trunk tissue pattern.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adult animals replace cells during tissue turnover and, in many cases, regeneration. How animals specify and maintain regional tissue identity during these processes is poorly understood. Planarians can regenerate any missing body part and replace aged tissues during homeostasis, presenting a powerful system for identifying adult positional information mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reddien and Sánchez Alvarado, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reddien, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Planarian regeneration requires an abundant population of dividing cells called neoblasts that includes pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rink, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reddien, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, many genes required for regeneration are required for neoblast biology. However, some phenotypes associated with gene inhibition do not impact the capacity of animals to regenerate, but instead affect the outcome of regeneration, suggestive of a role for such genes in providing positional information. For example, inhibition of components of the Wnt signaling pathway causes regeneration of heads in place of tails, generating two-headed animals with heads facing opposing directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>). Neoblasts are also constantly utilized for the replacement of differentiated cells during natural tissue turnover. Several striking planarian phenotypes associated with altered regional tissue identity during tissue turnover have also been identified, including hypercephalized (Wnt-signaling inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gurley et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iglesias et al., 2008</xref>) and ventralized (BMP-signaling inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reddien et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Molina et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Orii and Watanabe, 2007</xref>) planarians. Reminiscent of the roles of Wnt and Bmp in planarian regeneration and tissue turnover, Wnt regulates anterior-posterior (AP) axis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petersen and Reddien, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Niehrs, 2010</xref>) and Bmp regulates dorsal-ventral (DV) axis development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Robertis and Sasai, 1996</xref>) in many animal phyla.</p><p>Many receptors, ligands, and secreted inhibitors belonging to key pathways that regulate development in many organisms, such as BMP and Wnt pathways are constitutively expressed in a regionalized manner across adult planarian body axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Reddien, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, these genes are predominantly expressed together in the same planarian tissue, the body-wall muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). Expression patterns of these genes can change dynamically following injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Petersen and Reddien, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petersen and Reddien, 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gurley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>), and some of these changes can occur in existing muscle cells in the absence of neoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). Body-wall muscle is distributed peripherally around the entire planarian body, and the known expression domains of candidate patterning molecules in muscle broadly span the AP, DV, and medial-lateral (ML) body axes, raising the possibility that muscle provides a body-wide coordinate system of positional information that controls regional tissue identity in tissue turnover and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). However, the roles for many of these genes with regionally restricted expression in muscle are poorly understood, and it is likely that many genes with regionally restricted expression in muscle and roles in positional information await identification.</p><p>Identification of muscle as a major site of expression of genes controlling regeneration and tissue turnover in adult planarians presented the opportunity for systematic characterization of positional information in an adult metazoan. To this end, we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on muscle cells isolated from 10 discrete regions along the planarian AP axis and found 44 genes for which expression within planarian muscle was restricted to specific AP domains. An RNA interference (RNAi) screen of many of these genes revealed two similar circuits each containing FGFRL and Wnt components that are required for the normal patterning of two distinct regions of the planarian body: the head and the trunk.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single muscle cell sequencing reveals 44 genes expressed in restricted domains along the AP axis</title><p>The prior identification of a single, body-wide cell type (body-wall muscle) expressing genes implicated in patterning in restricted domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>) raised the possibility that RNA sequencing of muscle cells could systematically identify components of this candidate adult positional information system. We sought such genes with regional expression in muscle utilizing single-cell RNA sequencing of muscle cells isolated from different regions along the AP axis. Non-dividing single cells from 10 consecutive regions along the AP axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) were isolated by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS), and the resulting single-cell cDNA libraries were screened by qRT-PCR for expression of planarian muscle markers before sequencing (Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Cells expressed an average of 3,253 transcripts, within the range reported for planarian single-cell libraries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wurtzel et al., 2015</xref>). Principal component analysis (PCA) on the 177 single cells sequenced was performed using highly variable transcripts. Two significant principal components that separated cells by expression of muscle markers (PC1&lt;0) and expression of neoblast markers (PC2&lt;0) were identified (details in Methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).

SCDE analyses of three different anterior-versus-posterior region comparisons (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C–E</xref>) identified transcripts of 99 genes as differentially expressed at p&lt;0.005. To further validate the regional expression of these candidate genes, RNA probes were generated for all statistically significant transcripts (88/99 successfully amplified) and whole-mount in situ hybridization (ISH) was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). 18 genes with regional expression in muscle have been previously identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">[Witchley et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Vogg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Reuter et al., 2015</xref>]). Although these three SCDE analyses correctly identified 13 of these 18 genes, those expressed in rare muscle cells (<italic>wnt1, foxD, zic-1</italic>), in shallow gradients (<italic>sFRP-2</italic>), or broadly (<italic>wntA),</italic> were below statistical significance (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, Figure 1—figure supplement 2B). Therefore, an additional 168 genes, for which transcripts showed non-significant differential expression in the SCDE analysis, were tested by ISH. ISH reveals expression in all tissue types, which might obscure detection of regional expression within muscle cells for some genes by this method. Nonetheless, ISH analysis verified 44 of these genes as regionally expressed (35/44 with p&lt;0.005 in any of anterior-versus-posterior SCDE analyses) from the total 256 genes tested, including 26 previously not reported to be regionally expressed in muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1F</xref>). All newly identified regionally expressed genes tested were expressed at least in part in cells expressing the planarian muscle marker <italic>collagen</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>The term position control gene (PCG) has been used for genes with both regional adult expression, and patterning abnormal RNAi phenotypes or prediction by sequence to be in a pathway regulating planarian patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). The function for many such PCGs awaits elucidation.

We utilized single-cell sequencing to map axial gene expression within the planarian muscle. Planarian muscle was previously found to express several genes with known roles in adult tissue patterning in planarians, raising the possibility that muscle functions to produce a body-wide coordinate system of positional information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witchley et al., 2013</xref>). Traditional RNA sequencing approaches to identifying candidate adult positional information in planarians is limited by the diversity of gene expression in heterogeneous tissue. The identification of a particular cell type expressing genes associated with regional tissue identity allowed application of regional single-cell sequencing to surmount this challenge. We applied this approach to the AP axis, and identified mRGs that constitute an expression map of muscle cells of the planarian primary axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Coordinate systems of positional information, such as those proposed to control embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Robertis et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petersen and Reddien, 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Niehrs, 2010</xref>), might exist within adult tissues of many animals, including humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rinn et al., 2006</xref>), however there is little functional data regarding positional information and maintenance of the adult body plan.

Here we show that both the planarian head and trunk require an FGFRL-Wnt circuit to maintain adult regional tissue identity. Different <italic>FGFRL</italic> and <italic>Wnt</italic> genes are used in the two body locations; however, in both cases, an <italic>FGFRL</italic> expression domain is juxtaposed by a posterior <italic>Wnt</italic> expression domain. Strikingly, inhibition of either gene (<italic>FGFRL</italic> or <italic>Wnt</italic>) caused posterior expansion and sequential duplications of structures normally found within the head and trunk regions, resulting in expanded brain and ectopic eyes in one case, and ectopic pharynges and mouths in the other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>Following inhibition of any of the components of these FGFRL-Wnt circuits, the axial expression map shows local shifts in expression domains coincident with the expansion of specific regionally restricted tissues such as brain and pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results suggest that muscle, a tissue found uniformly throughout the animal, marks different AP regions through combinatorial expression of mRGs. This implies that communication exists between muscle cells and the underlying region-specific tissues. Understanding the coordination between muscle cells and tissues within AP regions is necessary for determining how planarians are able to robustly maintain and regenerate their entire body plan. Positional information must be integrated into the decision to generate and pattern new tissue during planarian growth and regeneration. mRGs might therefore influence the regional behavior of neoblasts and/or their division progeny.</p><p>The two FGFRL-Wnt circuits described in this work are striking examples of body plan plasticity during homeostatic tissue turnover. In both cases, inhibition by RNAi of <italic>FGFRL</italic> genes (i.e., reduction or absence of the <italic>FGFRL</italic> expression domain) and inhibition of <italic>Wnt</italic> pathway components (i.e., expansion of the <italic>FGFRL</italic> expression domain) are coincident with the same phenotype of expanded regional identity. Future characterization of the biochemical properties of FGFRLs and elucidation of the mechanisms of interaction between Wnt/Fz pathways and FGFRLs might help in understanding this property. We propose that FGFRL proteins confine the regions where specific tissues in both the head and trunk can normally form and that the <italic>Wnt</italic> gene of each circuit acts by restricting tissues at the anterior end of its expression domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>). Given the similarities of the distinct FGFRL-Wnt circuits for patterning two different body regions, FGFRL-Wnt circuits might be broadly utilized, but presently underappreciated, patterning modules of animal body plans.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>Asexual <italic>Schmidtea mediterranea</italic> strain (CIW4) animals starved 7–14 days prior experiments were used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Muscle single cell isolation and library construction</title><p>Animals were dissected into 10 adjacent regions along the AP axis, and only the midline region (i.e., in between the ventral nerve cords) of each segment was utilized, to minimize heterogeneity caused by gradients expressed along the medio-lateral axes. 10 regions were chosen to balance consistency of amputation and AP resolution.

Two clear populations were separated by PC analysis, one of which included 115 cells that expressed <italic>troponin</italic> (&gt;4 cpm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D,F</xref>). These 115 muscle cells were used for all subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). Average expression per region (Seurat) for each transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) or expression per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) was centered and scaled to generate expression z-scores used for heatmap visualization. Dendrograms show complete hierarchical clustering using Euclidean distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Single cell differential analysis</title><p>Rv3.2.2 was used for all subsequent data analysis and visualization, relying on the following packages: Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Satija et al., 2015</xref>), SCDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>), matrixStats, ROCR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sing et al., 2005</xref>), ggplot2, RColorBrewer (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://colorbrewer2.org">http://colorbrewer2.org</ext-link>). To determine the best differential expression analysis method to identify putative mRGs, we tested three statistical methods: SCDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>), bimod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McDavid et al., 2013</xref>), and t-test (Student's t-test) for their ability to identify known mRGs. For each of the statistical tests, we compared cells from the head tip (region 1) versus those from the tail tip (region 10) and determined the rank and statistical significance of 10 canonical mRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Based on its ability to identify mRGs present only in a subset of cells within a region (e.g., <italic>wnt11-1, sFRP-1, notum</italic>), we chose SCDE for all further differential expression analysis. Note that SCDE explicitly accounts for drop-out rates due to single-cell sequencing by calculating a probability distribution for each transcript in each cell before calculating differential expression between groups. To identify putative mRGs, we performed three differential expression analyses: anterior (regions 1, 2, 3; n=23 cells) versus posterior (regions 8, 9, 10; n=38 cells); head (region 1; 11 cells) versus post-pharyngeal (regions 7, 8, 9; n=35 cells); pre-pharyngeal (regions 2, 3, 4; n=22 cells) versus tail (region 10; n=12 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All transcripts with a |Z| score greater than 2.58 (p&lt;0.005) in any of the SCDE analyses were screened by ISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C–E</xref>). Z-scores corrected for multiple hypothesis testing are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C–E</xref>, however we used uncorrected Z-scores due to their ability to rank many more transcripts. In addition, 168 genes below our statistical cutoff were successfully amplified from cDNA and screened by ISH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C–E</xref>).</p><p>To determine if our method correctly classified transcripts as mRGs, we used a combined score from all three SCDE analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wan and Sun, 2012</xref>]). If there is no differential expression of a gene along the AP axis, then the minimum p-value from any of the analyses, p<sub>[1]</sub> = min(p<sub>1,</sub> …, p<sub>k</sub>) where p<sub>i</sub> is the p-value from i<sup>th</sup> analysis, is expected to follow a beta distribution with parameters 1 and k (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tippett, 1931</xref>). A differential expression score was calculated based on beta distribution, S<sub>min</sub>= -log(P(beta(1,k) <underline>&lt;</underline> p<sub>[1]</sub>)), and used to rank all transcripts. Note that this scoring system only ranks transcripts, and that statistical significance of differential expression is only interpretable within the analysis performed. We then quantified how well our analyses, as scored by S<sub>min</sub>, classified transcripts as mRGs, as determined by ISH validation. The receiver-operator curve plots the false positive rate versus the true positive rate for each value of S<sub>min</sub> based on ISH validation. The area under the curve (0.88, perfect classification = 1, random classification = 0.5) indicates that S<sub>min</sub> and therefore our SCDE analyses are able to correctly classify transcripts as mRGs visible by ISH.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Gene cloning and whole-mount in situ hybridizations</title><p>Primers used to PCR amplify all planarian transcripts are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1C–E</xref>. 44 mRGs were cloned from cDNA into the pGEM vector (Promega, Madison, WI). RNA probes were synthesized and nitroblue tetrazolium/5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (NBT/BCIP) colorimetric whole-mount in situ hybridizations (ISH) were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pearson et al., 2009</xref>). Fluorescence in situ hybridizations (FISH) were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">King and Newmark, 2013</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, animals were killed in 5% NAC before fixation in 4% formaldehyde. Following treatment with proteinase K (2 μg/ml) and overnight hybridizations, samples were washed twice in pre-hyb buffer, 1:1 pre-hyb:2X SSC, 2X SSC, 0.2X SSC, PBST. Subsequently, blocking was performed in 5% casein (10X solution, Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and 5% inactivated horse serum PBST solution when anti-DIG or anti-DNP antibodies were used, and in 10% casein PBST solution when an anti-FITC antibody was used. Post-antibody binding washes and tyramide development were performed as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">King and Newmark, 2013</xref>). Peroxidase inactivation with 1% sodium azide was done for 90 min at RT. Live animal images were taken with a Zeiss Discovery Microscope. Fluorescent images were taken with a Zeiss LSM700 Confocal Microscope. Co-localization analysis of FISH signals was performed using Fiji/ImageJ. For each channel, histograms of fluorescence intensity were used to determine the cut-off between signal and background. All FISH images shown are maximal intensity projections. A median filter was applied using the ImageJ Despeckle function. Images are representative of results seen in &gt;5 animals per panel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNAi</title><p>dsRNA was prepared from in vitro transcription reactions (Promega) using PCR-generated templates with flanking T7 promoters, followed by ethanol precipitation, and annealed after resuspension in water. dsRNA was then mixed with planarian food (liver) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rouhana et al., 2013</xref>) and 2 ul per animal of the liver containing dsRNA was used in feedings. For the RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>), the following feeding protocol was used: animals were fed six times in three weeks, cut in four pieces (head, pre-pharyngeal, trunk and tail pieces), allowed to regenerate for 10 days, fed all together six times in another three weeks, and cut again into the four pieces described above. Seven days following amputation (7 dpa), trunk pieces were scored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> right panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and fixed at day 20 following amputation for further analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Five to 10 trunk pieces were kept after the first regeneration cycle, and were fed once a week for another 12 weeks and were scored after that period (homeostasis, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1G</xref>). Animals for homeostasis RNAi experiments for trunk patterning studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) were fed eight times in four weeks and scored a week after the last feeding. In RNAi experiments for head patterning analysis, animals were fed eight times in four weeks, scored after the first six feedings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>), and fixed seven days after the last feeding (without amputation). For longer time point experiments, animals were fed twelve times in six weeks and fixed seven days after the last feeding. For all RNAi conditions tested, the total amount of dsRNA per feeding per animal was kept constant. Therefore, for example, when RNAi of two or more genes was performed, dsRNA for each gene was diluted in half. For combinations of dsRNAs, synergistic effects of double RNAi were calculated using Fisher’s exact test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Minimum sample sizes were estimated using difference of proportion power calculation with h=0.4 (ectopic mouths) or h=0.8 (ectopic eyes), sig.level=0.05, and power=0.8 (n=98.1 or n=24.5). RNAi animals with ectopic pharynges/mouths were treated with 0.2% chlorotone, which results in muscle relaxation and pharynx protrusion through the mouth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panels). For RNAi enhancement experiments of <italic>ndl-3; wntP-2</italic> RNAi with β<italic>-catenin-1</italic>, animals were fed five times with a combination of <italic>ndl-3</italic> and <italic>wntP-2</italic>, and starting in the sixth feeding, β<italic>-catenin-1</italic> or control dsRNA was added to the mix of <italic>ndl-3</italic> and <italic>wntP-2</italic> for another three, four, or five feedings (being a total of eight, nine or 10 feedings, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Briefly, total RNA was isolated from fragments from individual intact worms or from individual regenerated fragments, as indicated by cartoons in figures, in 0.75mL Trizol (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) following manufacturer's instructions. Samples were homogenized for 30s using TissueLyser II (Qiagen). Following RNA purification and resuspension in dH20, concentrations for each sample were measured by Qubit using RNA HS Assay Kit (Life Technologies). 5 ng of RNA were treated with 1U amplification-grade DNAse I (Life Technologies) for 15 min at room temperature before DNAse heat-inactivation for 10 min at 65°C in the presence of 2.5 mM EDTA.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Alejandro Sánchez Alvarado as Reviewing Editor and Fiona Watt as the Senior Editor. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal her identity: Yukiko Yamashita.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the manuscript by Scimone, et al., the authors build upon their previous study of spatial signaling pathways being transcribed by muscle nuclei: Witchley et al., 2013. In order to describe the heterogeneity of signals transcribed by muscles, and how those signals may change along the axis of the worm, the authors use single cell RNA deep sequencing of 115 muscle cells isolated from different axial levels. This manuscript identifies genes that are expressed regionally along the anterior/posterior axis in planarian body wall muscle, which are thought to provide a coordinate system for axial information. Trying several analysis methods, the authors settle on one and then perform an in situ hybridization screen of 252 transcripts to look for regionally restricted transcripts. The RNA sequencing of single muscle cells identified 44 new regionally-expressed genes, many of which are members of the Wnt, FGFRL, and Hox gene families. Knockdown of these genes resulted in two overall classes of phenotypes: those that affect trunk identity, with formation of ectopic mouths, and those that affect anterior identity, with formation of ectopic photoreceptors. In both cases, the genes required for head or trunk identity consist of one Wnt and one FGFRL, suggesting that these proteins may form a regulatory circuit conveying regional axial information to underlying tissues in the animal.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The use of single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify transcripts expressed in particular cell types is a novel, powerful technique in planarians. The finding that signaling pathways such as Wnt and FGFRL cooperate to establish axial patterning is not altogether surprising, but understanding how this coordinate system functions is valuable. However, before publication some changes need to be made to improve the clarity of the story.</p><p>1) This manuscript should be expanded into a full article due to the vast amounts of data currently buried in supplemental (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 for example). Additionally, a very detailed protocol and sequence analysis accompanying this article would be helpful. Currently, sequencing depth or testing of sensitivity by mRNA spike-ins is not discussed or performed, and should be strongly considered to expand upon.</p><p>2) The selection criteria for these 44 new regionally-expressed genes is not clear from the text. Additionally, in screening 252 genes by in situ hybridization, why were 166 non-statistically-significant genes in this analysis? Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, why are only 38 in situs instead of 44? Stating the reasons for these inclusions and omissions will improve the clarity of the manuscript.</p><p>3) The claim that <italic>WntP-2</italic> and <italic>ndl-3</italic> only affect trunk identity and not head identity is poorly supported by the data as shown. The SFRP-1 expression patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-F</xref> seem to be moderately expanded, and it is difficult to tell how the authors determine the boundaries of these domains. Can they be quantified to show reproducibility across a population instead of in a single image? Similarly, the expression pattern boundaries shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> are difficult to see, and quantification would help.</p><p>4) The authors suggest in the conclusion that the Wnt signals form the posterior boundary for the FGFRLs. To prove that this system functions this way, does knockdown of multiple Wnts alter the FGFRL distribution? Does overall perturbation of global Wnt signaling (by knockdown of β-catenin or APC) alter patterning of these genes?</p><p>5) Levels of <italic>WNTP-2, ndl-3, fz5/8-4, ndk</italic> RNAi efficacy should be quantified by qRTPCR or RNAseq, as is standard in the planarian field.</p><p>6) Because the phenotype of <italic>wntA, <underline>ndk</underline></italic>, and <italic>fz5/8-4</italic> are all in a similar direction (head expansion), there cannot be a negative arrow from <italic>wntA</italic> to <italic>ndk</italic> in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Please modify accordingly if you propose this is a genetic arrow, or increase resolution if you propose this is a small-scale boundary restriction.</p><p>7) The authors did not put the ndl's in the context of regional head/tail repression by βcat/APC. In the case of the trunk domain expanding posterior, can this be suppressed by βcat RNAi's anteriorizing effects?</p><p>8) In the end, this is largely an ndl story as well as trying to get a handle on what the muscle cells are capable of in terms of signaling complexity. The authors state that 4/5 ndl's were differentially detected in muscle cells, yet it is hard to get a feeling for how they are regionally restricted, how they overlap with each other, and what how each of their phenotypes affect patterning as a whole. The authors should show the RNAi phenotypes for each of the ndl's and show the effects on the patterning of the others as well as the WNT's used in this manuscript. Secondly, they should quantify the overlap in each of the genes and support this by co-detection in single muscle cells using the data already in hand. The authors missed an opportunity here to perform some analyses on what mRGs were detected in single muscle cells – they should perform such an analysis (instead of the average expression for a region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, do all ndk-expressing muscles also express <italic>wntA</italic> and/or <italic>fz5/8-4</italic>? Are there transcription factor differences that can explain the expression profile of a given muscle? This would be very informative.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12845.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions: The use of single-cell RNA-sequencing to identify transcripts expressed in particular cell types is a novel, powerful technique in planarians.

However, before publication some changes need to be made to improve the clarity of the story. 1) This manuscript should be expanded into a full article due to the vast amounts of data currently buried in supplemental (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 for example). Additionally, a very detailed protocol and sequence analysis accompanying this article would be helpful. Currently, sequencing depth or testing of sensitivity by mRNA spike-ins is not discussed or performed, and should be strongly considered to expand upon.</italic></p><p>We agreed with the reviewers and have expanded this manuscript into a full article. We also agree with the reviewers that more detail for the single-cell sequencing could enhance the paper. Therefore we have added details of the sequencing analysis to the Results, including average number of transcripts detected per cell and to the Materials and methods, including average number of reads per cell, with additional references to <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> where the values for the individual cells are listed. Of note, a recent manuscript from our lab describes the single cell sequencing protocol used here in detail as well, and we also have added reference to this published detailed protocol to the paper (Wurtzel et al., 2015). We have included that the genes defining the final muscle cells used for the differential expression analysis were within the muscle-enriched set found by Wurtzel et al., 2015. The Smart-seq2 library preparation protocol (Picelli et al., Nature Methods, 2013), which we used for this work, does not use EERC spike-ins for normalization. Single-cell sequencing does suffer from drop-out rates, which is accounted for by the statistical modeling present in SCDE (Kharchenko et al., 2014), and this is noted in the Materials and methods.</p><p> <italic>2) The selection criteria for these 44 new regionally-expressed genes is not clear from the text. Additionally, in screening 252 genes by in situ hybridization, why were 166 non-statistically-significant genes in this analysis? Also, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, why are only 38 in situs instead of 44? Stating the reasons for these inclusions and omissions will improve the clarity of the manuscript.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this area of confusion. 35 of the 44 mRGs described were within the 99 genes that had statistically significant p-values from the SCDE analyses performed and that also showed regional expression by in situ hybridization. The additional 9 mRGs verified by in situ hybridization came from 168 genes below the significant p-value in the SCDE analyses. The reason for including these 168 non-significant genes was because of the absence of a few previously known mRGs within the 99 (p-value&lt;0.005) group. mRGs that were expressed in shallow gradients (e.g., <italic>sFRP-2</italic>) or in very few cells (<italic>wnt1, foxD, zic-1</italic>) were not present within the 99 significant genes. We therefore sought to examine the possibility that the threshold of p-value&lt;0.005 was too stringent to capture all mRGs in the data. On the other hand, lowering the threshold would increase the false positive rate. We therefore tested additional genes with different significance values to seek additional mRGs. Because only 4 more mRGs (plus 5 previously known mRGs) were found with this approach, we concluded we were near saturation of the data. i.e., further sampling below the significance level threshold set would reveal mainly false positives not validated by ISH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>, Methods subsection “Single cell differential analysis”). We re-wrote this section in the Results (subsection “Single muscle cell sequencing reveals 44 genes expressed in restricted domains along the AP axis”) to make this approach clearer.</p><p>Previously, we did not include all 44 genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>—figure-supplement 2 because some of those genes were already shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Now, for clarity purposes, we include all 44 genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p> <italic>3) The claim that WntP-2 and ndl-3 only affect trunk identity and not head identity is poorly supported by the data as shown. The SFRP-1 expression patterns in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E-F</xref> seem to be moderately expanded, and it is difficult to tell how the authors determine the boundaries of these domains. Can they be quantified to show reproducibility across a population instead of in a single image? Similarly, the expression pattern boundaries shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> are difficult to see, and quantification would help.</italic></p><p>We agreed with the reviewers about the challenge in visualizing shifts in individual images of expression domains from a figure. Therefore, we now added quantifications of all the expression domains that we thought might be shifting between the different RNAi conditions. We now demonstrate statistical significant shifts for the expression domains of the trunk mRGs <italic>ndl-3, wntP-2</italic>, and <italic>sFRP-2</italic> in <italic>wntP-2 / ndl-3</italic> RNAi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). ndl-2, showed subtle-to-no changes in its expression domain between conditions, and we describe it accordingly. The particular case of <italic>sFRP-1</italic> asked for showed no significant changes in its expression domain between the control and the RNAi groups. We also similarly quantified anterior expression domains, now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>.</p><p> <italic>4) The authors suggest in the conclusion that the Wnt signals form the posterior boundary for the FGFRLs. To prove that this system functions this way, does knockdown of multiple Wnts alter the FGFRL distribution? Does overall perturbation of global Wnt signaling (by knockdown of β-catenin or APC) alter patterning of these genes?</italic></p><p>We re-wrote those conclusions to be more specific about the role of Wnt signaling setting in the FGFRL expression domain. Specifically, we know state: &quot;Following inhibition of any of the components of these FGFRL-Wnt circuits, the axial expression map shows local shifts in expression domains coincident with the expansion of specific regionally restricted tissues such as brain and pharynx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).&quot; The <italic>ndl-3</italic> expression domain shifted in <italic>wntP-2</italic> RNAi animals that had extra pharynges/mouths, which we now clarify in the main text and in figure legends. We do not want to conclude at this point that <italic>wntP-2</italic> directly regulates the <italic>ndl-3</italic> domain, but that the <italic>wntP-2</italic> phenotype involves <italic>ndl-3</italic> expansion. We also performed a new experiment to examine the role of global canonical Wnt signaling (by β-catenin-1 RNAi) in FGFRL expression domains distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). In the progression of the β-catenin-1 RNAi phenotype, we found mild changes in distributions of FGFRL expression domains followed by large-scale re-patterning of the body (ectopic head formation) with associated large-scale FGFRL domain changes. Because of the transformation of the body plan (ectopic heads), it is difficult to make strong conclusions about the latter changes. Overall, we seek to avoid strong conclusions about direct regulation of ndl domains by Wnts, but state that some ndl expression domains change robustly when body plans change following Wnt perturbation.</p><p> <italic>5) Levels of WNTP-2, ndl-3, fz5/8-4, ndk RNAi efficacy should be quantified by qRTPCR or RNAseq, as is standard in the planarian field.</italic></p><p>We now included quantification by qRT-PCR as well as FISH experiments to show the efficacy of all the RNAi conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p> <italic>6) Because the phenotype of wntA, ndk, and fz5/8-4 are all in a similar direction (head expansion), there cannot be a negative arrow from wntA to ndk in the model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Please modify accordingly if you propose this is a genetic arrow, or increase resolution if you propose this is a small-scale boundary restriction.</italic></p><p>The arrow in the previous version between the wnts and <italic>ndk</italic> was not meant to be a genetic arrow, but rather meant to reflect the expansion of the expression domains of the FGFRLs in Wnt RNAi animals with phenotypes. We modified the presentation of the model such that arrows are not shown anymore; we now simply depict changes in expression domains in 7B and describe them in the legend.</p><p> <italic>7) The authors did not put the ndl's in the context of regional head/tail repression by βcat/APC. In the case of the trunk domain expanding posterior, can this be suppressed by βcat RNAi's anteriorizing effects?</italic></p><p>We have now performed this suggested experiment. We inhibited β-catenin-1 with RNAi in animals previously treated with <italic>ndl-3</italic> and <italic>wntP-2</italic> dsRNA. We observed that if anything, β-catenin-1 RNAi further enhances the phenotype observed in the double <italic>ndl-3; wntP-2</italic> RNAi animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p> <italic>8) In the end, this is largely an ndl story as well as trying to get a handle on what the muscle cells are capable of in terms of signaling complexity. The authors state that 4/5 ndl's were differentially detected in muscle cells, yet it is hard to get a feeling for how they are regionally restricted, how they overlap with each other, and what how each of their phenotypes affect patterning as a whole. The authors should show the RNAi phenotypes for each of the ndl's and show the effects on the patterning of the others as well as the WNT's used in this manuscript. Secondly, they should quantify the overlap in each of the genes and support this by co-detection in single muscle cells using the data already in hand. The authors missed an opportunity here to perform some analyses on what mRGs were detected in single muscle cells – they should perform such an analysis (instead of the average expression for a region shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). For example, do all ndk-expressing muscles also express wntA and/or fz5/8-4? Are there transcription factor differences that can explain the expression profile of a given muscle? This would be very informative.</italic></p><p>We show the average expression per region and whole-mount in-situ hybridization pattern for all ndls in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> and clarify that all six ndls were differentially expressed in the SCDE analyses (subsection “Regionally expressed genes in muscle, including FGFRL and Wnt-pathway genes, constitute an axial expression map in adult muscle”). All ndls that worked well by FISH (all except ndl-1) were pair-wise tested for spatial overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We now analyzed triple FISH for overlap of ndls within individual cells where their spatial domains overlapped, and show this data in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>. We also now present heatmaps in the main figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) from single cell sequencing, where individual cell data is shown, allowing visualization of overlap between all ndls in single cells from the anterior regions. We also have commented in the text on the degree of overlap in the single-cell sequencing data (same section). Finally, we show the single-cell sequencing data for all of the muscle cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>, which shows overlap between mRGs in all single muscle cells spanning the AP axis. In addition, we now analyzed by FISH and quantified by qRT-PCR the expression of each ndl family member when one or more of the ndl genes was inhibited by RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We found that single ndl RNAi (and even combination ndl RNAi) only significantly affected the expression of that ndl and not the others in this experiment. We have not identified transcription factor differences that would explain the expression profiles of a given muscle cell, but there are several transcription factors that are mRGs (<italic>zic-1, zic-2, foxD</italic>, prep, sp5, and the Hox genes) most of which have been functionally investigated in other papers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
