aspects of incoming stimuli. In the insect olfactory system, second order projection neurons target both the mushroom body, required for learning, and the lateral horn (LH), proposed to mediate innate olfactory behavior. Mushroom body neurons form a sparse olfactory population code, which is not stereotyped across animals. In contrast, odor coding in the LH remains poorly understood. We combine genetic driver lines, anatomical and functional criteria to show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LH has ~1400 neurons and &gt;165 cell types. Genetically labeled LHNs have stereotyped odor responses across animals and on average respond to three times more odors than single projection neurons. LHNs are better odor categorizers than projection neurons, likely due to stereotyped pooling of related inputs.

However, there are many shared organizational features with other sensory systems : for example, integration of information originating from distinct sensory receptors, and multiple levels of parallel and hierarchical processing. It is therefore possible that detailed studies of chemosensory systems may reveal general principles relevant to neurons that are considerably deeper in other sensory modalities. This study uses single cell neuroanatomy and genetically targeted <italic>in vivo</italic> electrophysiology to addresses two principal questions in the context of the <italic>DrosophilaÂ melanogaster</italic> olfactory system. First, can a higher olfactory center encode odors in a stereotyped way? More specifically, are there distinct cell types with reproducible odor responses across animals? Second, what is the nature of the population code in a higher olfactory area linked to innate behavior? How might the code relate to the behavioral requirements of the animal and how does it differ from neurons underlying learned responses?</p><p>The olfactory systems of mammals and insects have many similarities, including the presence of glomerular units in the first olfactory processing center. Second order neurons then make divergent projections onto multiple higher olfactory centers. For example in both flies and mice there are separate projections to areas proposed to be specialized for memory formation (mushroom body and piriform cortex, respectively) and unlearned olfactory behaviors (lateral horn and e.g. cortical amygdala) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heimbeck et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Root et al., 2014</xref>). In insects in general and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> in particular, the anatomical and functional logic of odor coding in the mushroom body (MB) and its relationship to olfactory learning has been intensively studied. About 150 projection neurons (PNs) relay information to the input zone of the MB, the calyx, where they form synapses with the dendrites ofÂ ~2000 Kenyon cells, the intrinsic neurons of the MB (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Masse et al., 2009</xref>). There is limited spatial stereotypy in these projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jefferis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lin et al., 2007</xref>) and each KC receives input from an apparently random sample ofÂ ~6 PNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). KC axons form a parallel fibre system intersected by the dendrites of 35 MB output neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>); it is proposed that memories are stored by synaptic depression at these synapses. KC odor responses are very sparse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Perez-Orive et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turner et al., 2008</xref>), which is proposed to minimize interference between different memories, but do not appear stereotyped across animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Random PN-KC connectivity is consistent with the idea that KC responses acquire meaning through associative learning rather than having any intrinsic valence. In mice, pyramidal cells of the piriform cortex also integrate coincident inputs from different glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Miyamichi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Davison and Ehlers, 2011</xref>), but as in the MB the available evidence suggests that this integration is not stereotyped from animal to animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Stettler and Axel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Choi et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to extensive studies of the MB, there is much more limited information concerning anatomy and function of the lateral horn (LH); this is also true for higher olfactory centers of the mammalian brain that have been hypothesized to serve a similar functional role such as the cortical amygdala. Studies examining the axonal arbors of PNs showed that these have more stereotyped projections in the LH than in the MB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>). Since at least three classes of LH neurons (LHNs) appeared to have dendrites in stereotyped locations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>), it was hypothesized that these neurons have stereotyped odor responses that are conserved from animal to animal. The first studies of odor responses of LHNs focussed on pheromone responses of neurons suspected to be sexually dimorphic in number or anatomy owing to their expression of the <italic>fruitless</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kohl et al. (2013)</xref> characterized three neuronal clusters showing that they responded in a sex- and class-specific manner and ranged from narrowly tuned pheromone-specialists to more broadly responsive neurons.</p><p>Pheromone responsive second order neurons project axons to a specialized subregion of the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Seki et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>) and the extent to which pheromone responsive LHNs are typical of the whole LH has been questioned by other studies. In particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta and Stopfer, 2012</xref>) recorded from a random sample of neurons in the locust LH, reporting that all LHNs were extremely broadly tuned and without finding evidence of neurons with repeated odor profiles; they eventually concluded that generalist LHNs are unlikely to be stereotyped encoders of innate behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FiÅek and Wilson (2014)</xref> carried out the first electrophysiological recordings of non-pheromone LH neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. They recorded from two genetically identified cell types with reproducible response patterns: one LHN class responded to 1 out of 8 tested odorants, the other responded to all odorants. Although these results suggested that generalist LHNs can also have stereotyped odor responses, the limited number of neurons investigated precluded general conclusions about LH odor coding. Studies of analogous regions in the mammalian brain are even more challenging, but recent recordings by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lurilli and Datta (2017)</xref> from the cortical amygdala found no evidence for response stereotypy or encoding of the behavioral valence or chemical category of odors.</p><p>We have taken a stepwise approach to understanding the organizational and functional logic of the LH. We first reasoned that it was essential to characterize its cellular composition and to develop approaches for reproducible access to different cell populations. We achieved this by screening and annotating genetic driver lines, hierarchically classifying single cell morphologies, and using whole brain electron microscopy (EM) data to place rigorous bounds on total cell numbers, which turn out to be much greater than anticipated.</p><p>We then used genetically targeted single cell electrophysiology and anatomy to reveal principles of odor coding in genetically defined cell populations, finding that LHNs typically respond to more odors but with fewer spikes than their PN input. Since we found that LHNs show stereotyped odor responses across animals, we carried out a detailed analysis of neuronal cell types. We show that functional and morphological criteria can both be used to define cell type and that they are highly consistent. We then show that LHNs are better odor categorizers than their PN inputs, providing one justification for their distinct coding properties. Finally we use EM data to measure direct convergence of different olfactory channels onto both local and output neurons of the LH, providing an anatomical substrate for the response broadening. Taken together these results reveal some of the logic by which the nervous system can map sensory responses onto behaviorally relevant categories encoded in a population of stereotyped cell types in a higher brain area.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Key anatomical features of the lateral horn</title><p>Our key goal in this study was to understand the coding principles of third order neurons underlying innate olfactory behaviors. Nevertheless it is hard to understand the functional properties of a brain area without a basic understanding of the number and variety of constituents neurons. We used a wide variety of experimental/analytic approaches to obtain a comprehensive overview of the functional anatomy of the LH. We now present the observations most relevant to odor coding, organized hierarchically. We present further details in Materials and methods and online supplements including accompanying 3D data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flyemdev.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk:8080/LHlibrary/">jefferislab.org/si/lhlibrary</ext-link>).</p><p>Neuropil volume is indicative of the energetic investment in particular sensory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Sterling and Laughlin, 2015</xref>), and strongly correlated with length of neuronal cable and synapse numbers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schlegel et al., 2017</xref>). We find that the volume of the LH is 70% of the volume of the whole MB. However many LHNs extend axons beyond the LH; we estimate that the total volume of LHN arbors is therefore actually (40%) greater than the MB. This large investment in neuropil volume argues for the significance of the LH in sensory processing, whereas the literature currently contains 13 fold more studies of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MB than LH (Materials and methods section Neuropil Volumes).</p><p>The number of neurons in a brain area is a key determinant of neuronal coding. A classic EM study cutting the MBâs parallel axon tract counted 2200 Kenyon cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Technau and Heisenberg, 1982</xref>), while comprehensive genetic driver lines contain up to 2000 KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aso et al., 2009</xref>). However the number of LHNs has remained undefined, since there is no single tract to cross-section, nor any driver line labelling all LHNs. In the locust, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gupta and Stopfer, 2012</xref>) estimated that there are fewer LHNs than PNs. We combined light level image data with whole brain electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) to address this question. Our anatomical screen (see below) identified 31 primary neurite tracts entering the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>); a random EM tracing procedure targeting 17 of the largest tracts yielded an estimate of 1410 LHNs (90% CI 1368â1454, see Experimental Procedures). Each tract consists predominantly of either output or local neurons giving an estimate of about 580 LH local neurons (LHLNs, 40%) and 830 LH output neurons (LHONs, 60%). These results show that LHONs are much more numerous than second order input PNs and within a factor of 2 of the number of third order MB Kenyon cells. The large number of KCs enables sparse odor coding, which is proposed to avoid synaptic interference during memory formation (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Masse et al., 2009</xref>).

Given the large number of LHNs, it seemed essential to identify lines targeting subpopulations to test our hypothesis that LHNs are stereotyped odor encoders. When we began our studies, the only relevant lines came from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanaka et al. (2004)</xref>, who identified four drivers labeling distinct populations of LHNs from a screen ofÂ ~4,000 GAL4 lines. We carried out an enhancer trap Split-GAL4 screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luan et al., 2006</xref>), eventually selecting 234 lines containing LHNs from 2769 screened (see Experimental Procedures for details). These lines gave us access to the majority of known classes of LHNs and were used for most functional studies in this paper. However they were rarely cell type-specific, making them less suitable for behavioral experiments.</p><p>In addition to the previous absence of genetic reagents, LHNs are morphologically extremely diverse and do not innervate discrete glomeruli or compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laissue et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). For all these reasons, there was no prior system to name and classify different LHNs. We devised a hierarchical naming system with three levels of increasing anatomical detail to disambiguate neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>): (1) <italic>primary neurite tract</italic>: the tract containingÂ fibersÂ connecting the soma to the rest of the neuron, (2) <italic>anatomy group</italic>: neurons sharing a common axon tract and broadly similar arborizations in the LH and target areas, (3) <italic>cell type</italic>: the finest level revealed by reproducible differences in precise axonal or dendritic arborization patterns. We use single cell data to illustrate these three levels for three closely related cell types (PV5a1, PV5b1, PV5b2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, see Materials and methods for details). This system was key to successful genetic screening as well as planning and reporting functional experiments.</p><p>Building on our initial screen, we also annotated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) the widely used FlyLight (often referred to as GMR lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jenett et al., 2012</xref>) and Vienna Tiles libraries (VT lines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tirian and Dickson, 2017</xref>). These lines are now very widely used in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurobiology, in part because co-registered 3D image data are publicly available (e.g. through virtualflybrain.org <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Milyaev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Manton et al., 2014</xref>). The vast majority of genetic driver lines labeled only a few LH anatomy groups (mean of 3.8) while just 21/422 lines contained more than 8; we did not find any lines specific to multiple LHN anatomy groups without labelling other neurons in the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Similarly, none of the primary neurite tracts proved LH specific, although some were highlyÂ LH enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This demonstrates how hard it is to obtain LH selective lines that label most or even a large portion of the LHNs. At the conclusion of our screen we had identified 69 distinct LHN anatomy groups â thatÂ is, neurons with substantially different axonal tracts/arborisation patterns âÂ each of which was consistently labeled by a subset of driver lines. This cellular and genetic diversity significantly exceeded our initial expectations and represented an almost order of magnitude increase over prior studies. It also contrasts very strongly with the seven genetically defined Kenyon cell types comprising the third order neurons of the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>This second screen of GMR/VT lines provides a link between our LHN classification and experimentally valuable resources including further driver lines and co-registered 3D image data (see Materials and methods). Indeed, building on these annotations we went on to prepare a large collection of highly specific intersectional Split-GAL4 lines selectively targeting specific LH cell types; this facilitates many experiments including behavioral analysis for which our first generation split-GAL4 reagents were less suitable (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>, sister manuscript).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single cell anatomy of the lateral horn</title><p>The results presented so far provide principled estimates of the number of LHNs, identify genetic reagents for their study and develop a hierarchical nomenclature classification system. The final part of our neuroanatomical groundwork was to carry out a large scale single cell analysis of the LH in order to gain an initial understanding of the variety of cell types that it contains.</p><p>Given our new estimate that there areÂ ~1400 neurons LHNs, what is the anatomical and functional diversity amongst this large number of neurons? To address this, we co-registered FlyCircuit neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>) and neurons recorded during this study, segmenting each neuron into predicted axonal and dendritic domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, see Materials and methods).

We found that there is no unique statistical definition (i.e. single cut height for NBLAST clustering) that is appropriate for all LH cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B'</xref>), even when these anatomical cell type can be validated by other cellular properties (see below). Nevertheless for those cell types with more than one neuron, NBLAST identified the correct,Â manuallyÂ ascribed cell typeÂ ~80% of the time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We identified a total of 261 LHN cell types divided into 34 local cell types (LHLNs) with arbors restricted to the LH and 227 LHON cell types with axons beyond the LH. Most cell types originate from the tracts identified by EM as containing the largest number of LHNs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). LHLNs are associated with about half the number of tracts as LHONs (i.e. 5 vs 12 major EM tracts, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Similarly the AV4 and PV4 tracts account for 73% of the estimated 580 local neurons, whereas it takes 5 LHON tracts to reach this proportion.</p><p>LHONs are more anatomically diverse, originating from 29/31 tracts as well as having a wide range of axonal projections. Some LHNs clearly had dendrites in multiple neuropils. We therefore focussed on a set of 134 <italic>core</italic> LHON cell types with &gt;50% their dendrites within the LH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1F</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). These LHONs project to a wide array of target areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The superior protocerebral neuropils (SLP, SMP and SIP) are the most extensively innervated; they are the location of âconvergence zones'Â where direct olfactory output from the LH may be integrated with learned olfactory information from the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). The ventrolateral protocerebrum (AVLP, PVLP) is the next major target; this area also receives extensive input from visual projection neurons originating in the optic lobes (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Panser et al., 2016</xref>) and is innervated by dendrites of descending neurons, including at least two now known to be downstream of LHONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huoviala et al., 2018</xref>). Some LHONs also have both axonal and dendritic domains in the LH. We noticed that few cell types project to the contralateral hemisphere, perhaps because most olfactory projection neurons in the adult fly already receive information from both antennae.</p><p>The most studied projections to the LH are GH146-GAL4 positive, excitatory uniglomerular projection neurons from the antennal lobe (AL) that run through the medial antennal lobe tract (mALT). 3D atlases of these uniglomerular PNs have been constructed previously based on co-registration and annotation of single cell data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Costa et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, there are numerous additional inputs to the LH. We annotated LH input neuronsÂ fromÂ FlyCircuit and divided them into 41 different groups based on the axon tract they use to reach the LH and their pattern of dendritic arborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-B</xref>), which we used as a proxy for the modality of the sensory information they encode. We extended the naming system of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al. (2012a)</xref> to include 26 types not previously identified (see Materials and methods). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al. (2012a)</xref> have described five mALT types, three mediolateral antennal lobe tract (mlALT) types, three lateral antennal lobe tract (lALT) types, and three transverse antennal lobe tract (tALT) PN types that project to the LH from the AL. PNs taking any tract can have uniglomerular, multiglomerular or non-glomerular dendritic arborisation in the AL, sampling broadly or sparsely from the available odor channels. Unlike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al. (2012a)</xref>, but as has been observed in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berck et al., 2016</xref>), we find that some of these mALT olfactory projections do not arborize in the MB calyx (data not shown). GABAergic olfactory input is known to be supplied via PNs traversing the mlALT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Wilson and Laurent, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Okada et al., 2009</xref>), whereas the majority of projections through the mALT and lALT are thought to be cholinergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al., 2012a</xref>). We were not able to find a few PN types that had been described in the literature to project to the LH, including AL-MBDL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al., 2012a</xref>).</p><p>Input distribution is not uniform within the LH. Excitatory uniglomerular and inhibitory GABAergic PNs project widely but spare a ventromedial stripe of the LH, which is the focus of multiglomerular olfactory neurons and other sensory inputs; this same arborization pattern is shared by two neuromodulatory neurons releasing octopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch et al., 2009</xref>) and serotonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Roy et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, excitatory multiglomerular projection neurons are heavily concentrated in the ventromedial LH, where their arbors intermingle with PNs from thermosensory and hygrosensory glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frank et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Frank et al., 2017</xref>); in addition undescribed projection neurons from the Wedge neuropil may carry mechanosensory wind input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Yorozu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Patella and Wilson, 2018</xref>). Gustatory projection neurons also innervate this domain, although these are concentrated in an anterior-medial domain adjacent to the LH (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2017</xref>). In conclusion, the ventral LH receives multimodal input and likely to be involved in multimodal integration while the remainder is predominantly olfactory. Due to sampling biases in the FlyCircuit dataset, it is very likely that some cell types are over-represented, while others may be missing altogether. It has been reported from electron microscopy that the mALT containsÂ ~288, the mlALT 88â100 and the tALTÂ ~60 fibers from the vicinity of the AL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tanaka et al., 2012b</xref>).</p><p>In order to enable more effective exploration of these data, we have prepared a number of downloadable data and source code resources (see Online resources).

However as we turn our attention to olfactory coding one question, one major question stands out. Why are there so many LHN cell types?

Our core odor set consisted of 36 odors although up to 53 odors were used for some cells in the study. LHONs generally showed little spiking in the absence of odor with a mean firing rate of 0.1 Hz. In contrast PNs showed a higher mean baseline firing rate of 1.4 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) consistent with previous reports (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Wilson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jeanne and Wilson, 2015</xref>). The baseline firing rate of LHLNs was intermediate with a firing rate of 1 Hz. Odor responses were reliable for all three groups and it was rare for a cell to respond to one odor presentation without responding to the other presentations of the same odor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Cell averaged single trial response reliability was slightly higher for LHONs. This probably reflects the higher baseline firing rate of PNs since when we considered only stronger responses, reliability for all groups approached 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>If we consider every single odor presentation, the mean firing rate was similar across PNs, LHLNs, and LHONs (4.4â5.2 Hz). However PNs (and LHLNs) responded to fewer odors then LHONs: 12% of odors elicited a significant PN response compared to 35% for LHONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>; see Materials and methods for definition of a significant response). Consistent with this, PN responses were sparser than LHONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F,G</xref>). If we consider significant excitatory odor responses only, we see that when an LHON responds to an odor, it does so with a lower firing rate: 21 Hz for PNs and 14 Hz for LHONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, LHONs are on average 10x quieter than PNs at baseline, show significant responses to 3x more odors, but have lower evoked firing rates, consequently firing a similar total number of spikes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Defining functional cell types</title><p>Our recordings indicated that cells fall into distinct groups based on their odor tuning profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For example, morphologically similar neurons belonging to the same anatomy group could be subdivided by their odor-evoked responses. Close inspection revealed subtle morphological differences between these subgroups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,E</xref>). However when looking over the entire cell repertoire it was evident that although we used a large odor set, many cells that were anatomically completely distinct, had rather similar odor responses that we could not reliably separate by automated analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,F</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44590.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comparing physiology and anatomy of different cell types.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Our pipeline for identifying cell types.Â (<bold>B</bold>) Odor responses for three cell types (nÂ =Â 2 neurons each) belonging to the same anatomy group.

We therefore used a two stage process. The first stage was to use coarse anatomical features (primary neurite and axon tract) to separate the cells into anatomy groups. The second stage then divided cells within an anatomy group based on their odor response properties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This finest level of classification into distinct cell types therefore depended solely on their functional properties. This classification was initially carried out manually and identified 64 functional cell types, of which 59 contain two or more exemplars and 42 contain 3 or more.</p><p>While some functional cell types had low variability in odor responses and were clearly segregated, others were less easily classified. In particular, we regularly observed that the common odor response profile of cells that we eventually assigned to the same functional cell type, was masked by differences in response magnitude or threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This variability may originate from differences in the number or strength of inputs to that cell type within or across animals. Given that we recorded from one cell per animal, we cannot exclude variation due to experimental factors (e.g. small differences in fly position or orientation, quality of recording and general state of the fly) that may affect the response strength. However we did not find any consistent relationship between cell-recording parameters (cell capacitance, membrane resistance and pipette resistance) and the strength of the response, suggesting that this is not an artifact of recording conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore recent analysis (FigureÂ 6of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>) of new whole brain EM data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>) suggests that within one animal, LHNs of the same cell type can receive varied numbers of PN inputs that could well account for the observed response differences. This is also consistent with the recent observations of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al. (2018)</xref> who found that LHNs originating from the same GAL4 line showed similar but not identical profiles of PN input as revealed by optogenetic mapping; however that study did not attempt to formalize cell type definitions and therefore did not conclude whether this variability was associated with distinct cell types or variations in the inputs within a cell type.</p><p>Finally, we would also like to emphasize that a requirement of co-clustering of LHNs by odor response alone is actually very stringent. PNs are generally assumed to be highly stereotyped odor responders, but we found that many PNs were not perfectly clustered using the approach of cutting a dendrogram formed by clustering odor responses. This was also true for earlier results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al.

We were specifically concerned with the finest level of classification (i.e. cell type) and whether odor tuning differences (among cells with similar coarse anatomy) or fine anatomical differences would individually be sufficient to define a cell type. We selected all the functional cell types for which we had more then three filled, traced and co-registered cells (122 out of a total of 141; 42 cell types) and began by dividing them into six pools based on their primary neurite tract.

First, the mean correlation across cells is significantly higher for LHONs than for PNs or LHLNs. Second, the LHON heatmap shows considerable off-diagonal correlation structure that is largely absent from the PN and LHLN heatmaps. These two differences are obviously not independent â the higher overall correlation across LHONs may also result in more neurons with overlapping odor response profiles. It is important to understand the nature and origin of these differences between second order PNs and third order LHONs since the correlation structure of odor responses across each neuronal population will have a significant impact on its odor coding capacity.</p><p>One trivial explanation for the high cross-correlation between LHON responses in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) is that we are repeatedly sampling a small number of cell types many times. Having defined and validated LHN cell types in the previous two sections, we can set this trivial explanation aside by generating new heatmaps in which we aggregate all of the odor response data for recordings from the same cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). For the LHONs in our dataset this resulted in a a 38 Ã 38 cell type heatmap. Comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref> vs B-C, it should be clear that while there are PNs with strongly correlated odor responses, these groups are located along the diagonal.

This procedure maintains the same firing rates and tuning breadths for each cell type, but disrupts the correlation structure across cell types that would result from extensive similarities in odor profiles across types. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8AââCâ</xref> presents the results of this manipulation, which clearly removes the off-diagonal structure for all three groups of cells, leaving almost no cases of elevated cross-correlation. This effect is clearly much larger for LHONs than for PNs (quantified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Increased tuning breadth alone therefore cannot explain the extensive off-diagonal cross-correlation structure for LHONs, but instead biases in the odor response properties across cell types appear to be the main factor.</p><p>This first analysis suggests that in the absence of strong biases in the odors that excite LHONs, tuning breadth has no substantial impact on the population cross-correlation.

However we can also see that if we compare with PNs, LHONs had consistently higher cross-correlation scores, even for cell types with low odor response probabilities (left of red line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). One issue with this last comparison is that the mean cross-correlation scores for narrowly tuned LHONs still included comparisons against both broad and sparse LHONs. We therefore further limited our analysis to consider the cross-correlation only between sparse LHON cell types. Once again LHONs showed higher cross-correlation scores (p=2.7E-5) than PNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). This also indicates that the number of cell classes is not the main reason for the high correlation since by limiting our analysis to sparse classes only we also matched the number of PN and LHON classes (20 and 22 classes, respectively).</p><p>Summarizing, we conclude that LHONs sample odor space less homogeneously than PNs leading to higher cross-correlation in LHON responses than their PN inputs. We further show that increased tuning breadth of LHONs and the increased number of LHON classes are not the main reason for this high correlation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Encoding of odor categories</title><p>We have already explored a number of aspects of odor coding by LHNs. For example we have seen that LHNs, as a population, respond to 3 times more odors than their PN inputs and that they sample odor space inhomogeneously. We hypothesized that these features of LHN odor coding arise because they pool specific odor input channels that signify odors of common behavioral significance. The circuit origins of behavioral significance, which can be summarized at its very simplest level as a binary valenceÂ â whether odors are attractive or repulsive â have received considerable attention recently (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Knaden and Hansson, 2014</xref>). However the observed behavioral valence is extremely dependent on numerous factors including the exact behavioral paradigm and odor concentration used. Therefore rather than trying to examine LH odor coding from the perspective of the behavioral valence reported for different odors in the literature, we initially focussed on encoding of well-defined chemical features.</p><p>We first categorized our odor set based on the presence of alcohol, aldehyde, amine, carboxyl, ester, phenyl chemical groups. We then examined odor encoding at the population level of PNs, LHLNs, and LHONs using principal components analysis. The first principal component consistently encoded response magnitude (data not shown). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows the population response trajectories projected into the space of the second and third principal components, and color-coded by odor category. Two features of this analysis seemed particularly noteworthy. First, there was a progressive increase from PNs to LHONs in how spread out odor representations were in this principal component space. Second, LHON responses appeared to separate certain odor categories, especially amine containing odors (typical of decomposing biological matter) versus acetates (typically light, fruity odors).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44590.016</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Odor categorization in the LH.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Population representations of odors.Â Responses are projected into the spaces of the second and third principal components, and color-coded by odor category.

We treated each cell as a binary classifier for a given odor category, thatÂ is signaling the presence or absence of that category and measured its performance using a normalized area under the ROC curve (AUC) score (see Materials and methods). LHONs and, to a lesser extent, LHLNs, but not PNs convey category information in their odor responses, when compared with shuffled control distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). The LHON population has the largest fraction (70%) of category-informative cells, followed closely by LHLNs, which have nearly twice as many category-informative cells as PNs (data not shown). Among the six categories, four were highly represented in the LHON population and amine categorizers appeared to be the most selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). These results indicate that LHNs indeed develop a novel ability to encode higher order odor features that are more likely to be behaviorally relevant to the fly, confirming a longstanding hypothesis in the field.</p><p>As noted earlier, PCA analysis suggested that population odor responses were increasingly spread out moving from PN through LHLN to LHON population responses. In the case of PNs, the second and third principal components that are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> are dominated by a small number of odors with large values. We wondered if this might conceal a more regular structure as we observed for LHONs. We therefore repeated the PCA analysis after carrying out an adaptive normalization procedure boosting responses to all odors (see Materials and methods). However as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, this did not reveal any strong categorical organization in PNs.</p><p>We also asked whether there was any association between particular odor categories and brain regions within and outside the lateral horn (i.e. locations of LHON dendrites and axons, respectively). We used a clustering approach to partition these regions into 25 compact âsupervoxelsâ (see Materials and methods) and then asked if these were associated with LHONs encoding particular odor categories. Both within the LH and in the axon target regions in the superior protocerebrum we found regions that were strongly associated with four of the odor categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>, amines, esters, aldehydes and carboxylic acids. These included several well-separated domains in the output regions, suggesting that there might be distinct groups of downstream target for LHONs with different category specificity.</p><p>Given the improved selectivity of individual LHONs for specific odor categories we also tested the ability of populations of LHNs to identify odor category or identity. To do this we repeatedly generate random subpopulations of cells for a given number of cell types, where each cell was the sole representative of a particular cell type. We then trained linear support vector classifiers (SVC) to perform either identity or category decoding on a trial-by-trial basis for each time bin (see Materials and methods), selecting a single SVC tuning parameter that maximized accuracy using one half of the random samples. We then reported performance summaries for the other half of the random samples using the selected SVC tuning parameters.</p><p>As we expected, LHN populations were better than PNs and LHLN at identifying odor category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). At the very low end of the graph (just one cell type used for decoding) only LHONs could identify odor category when compared with shuffled control distributions, consistent with the ROC analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>. They maintained their superior performance over the entire range number of cell types tested. One important question for future work would be to determine what is the biologically relevant size of LHON population that might feed into downstream neurons â the anatomy of LHONs with axon projections to disparate higher brain areas make it unlikely that there would be integration of large numbers of LHON cell types.</p><p>In comparison, neither PNs, LHONs, or LHLNs showed above chance odor identification performance when only one class was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>). As we increased the number of cell types in the decoding population, performance improved for all groups but LHONs gradually improved compared with PNs and LHLNs. In future it will be interesting to compare these results with KCs by obtaining odor response data in equivalent conditions. While this analysis is certainly consistent with our hypothesis that stereotyped integration in the LH could enable genetically determined categorical odor representations, there is also a weakness that cannot obviously be overcome without additional data: this population decoding analysis tests the ability of random subsets of neurons to predict the category or identity of all our test odors. However given the stereotyped nature of LHN responses, we propose that particular LHN populations are dedicated for particular odor categories. In this regard, future analysis based on comparing the responses of LHNs integrating known olfactory channels will be instructive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Integration of odor channels by LHNs</title><p>Many of our observations (increased tuning breadth, increased single cell categorization ability, reduced representational dimensionality) suggest that the LHONs pool olfactory information to better inform the behavioral significance of an odor. Although this provides a rationale for the observed differences in odor coding, it does not account for them mechanistically. Previous light level studies have attempted to predict PN to LHN connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>) based on light level overlap and a handful of these predictions have been validated (or refuted) electrophysiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FiÅek and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Nevertheless light level mapping, especially when carried out across brains cannot reliably predict actual synaptic connections.</p><p>In order to compare our observations about LHN odor coding with measurements of the PN to LHN convergence ratio, we leveraged a newly available whole brain EM dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>).

We selected an anatomically diverse sample of 29 LHONs and 17 LHLNs derived from 10 and 5 primary neurite tracts, respectively (seven neurons are from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>, the remainder P Schlegel, ASB, GSXEJ, in preparation). These neurons were reconstructed to completion in the lateral horn, enabling us to analyze the complete repertoire of excitatory PN input onto their dendrites originating from 51 glomeruli (see Materials and methods).</p><p>All neurons analyzed had a small number of strong inputs but most had a long tail of weaker inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). Therefore although they received at least one input from 13 glomeruli on average (range 0â33), if we considered only those glomeruli accounting for more than 1.5% of total input synapses to a given LHN, then LHLNs received 5.0Â Â±Â 1.8 significant inputs from uniglomerularnputs from uniglomerular excitatory olfactory PNs, and LHONs received 5.2Â Â±Â 2.9 (mean ÃÂ Â±Â standard deviation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>) with a range of 0â13. One AD1b1 LHON received no uniglomerular excitatory olfactory PN input, despite having dendritic innervation in the LH, indicating that some LHN types receive majority input from other neurons within the LH. These numbers provide a key parameter to start modeling the circuit origins of the odor coding properties of LHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). They are also comparable with recent optogenetic mapping observations on PN-LHN functional connectivity which obtained an estimate of 4.8 glomeruli/LHN based on optogenetic mapping of PNs innervating 39 glomeruli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44590.017</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Structural connectivity betweenÂ antennal lobeÂ glomeruli and third order olfactory neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Input tuning curves for a set of EM reconstructions comprising 17 LHLNs, and 29 LHONs (Schlegel, Bates et al. <italic>ms in prep</italic>) whose dendrites are restricted to the LH.

In sum, a reasonable cut-off for the observed structural connectivity in our EM-reconstructed wiring diagram reveals that the average LHN and each KC may sample the same number of glomeruli, via uniglomerular excitatory olfactory PNs.

The cell type weighted averages for glomerular inputs onto Kenyon cells were comparable across both data sources (EM, 5.2Â Â±Â 2.9, LM, 6.0Â Â±Â 1.2), although the EM average was slightly lower, possibly due to differences in how the two studies counted claws. Intriguingly the mean number of glomerular inputs is highly comparable between KCs and LHNs despite large differences in odor coding properties. However there are obvious differences: Comparing EM data, there are many fewer synapses onto KC dendrites compared with LHONs (77Â Â±Â 29 vs 467Â Â±Â 278). Secondly the proportion of feed-forward excitatory PN inputs was much lower for LHONs (79Â Â±Â 5% vs 41Â Â±Â 14%). In both cases the majority of other inputs appear local in origin, with the single giant APL inhibitory neuron being the major remaining input for KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zheng et al., 2018</xref>), while LHONs received many distinct inputs as we have recently shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al.

In theÂ future it will be extremely interesting to determine how intrinsic and local circuit properties shape the very different odor coding by neurons in the LH and MB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Odor coding in LH</title><p>Our principal finding is that lateralÂ horn neurons (LHNs) as a population are genetically and anatomically defined cell types with stereotyped odor responses. Starting from recordings of genetically defined populations we cross-validated fine scale anatomical differences and odor tuning for 37 LHN cell types; this confirms that stereotypy is a general feature of theÂ lateralÂ horn (LH) and not particular to specialist odor pathways such as those that process pheromone information, which may retain a labeled line logic all the way from the periphery. Although we see evidence of narrowly tuned LHNs dedicated to the processing of specific odors, the population as a whole shows 3x more odor responses than their olfactory projection neuron (PN) inputs. The increased tuning breadth may reflect a transition to a more behaviorally relevant coding scheme. This is consistent with our findings that LHNs show significantly improved odor categorization compared with PNs, apparently due to stereotyped pooling of related odor channels. The chemical categories that we analyzed are probably not of direct ethological relevance to the fly, but serve as proxies â further explorations of olfactory neuroecology are clearly necessary. For example we saw limited evidence for simple representations of olfactory valence in LHN responses.</p><p>It is instructive to compare the odor tuning properties we find across the lateral horn with those reported for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body. Major differences in the mushroom body (MB) include the lack of response stereotypy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murthy et al., 2008</xref>) and sparser odor tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Turner et al., 2008</xref>); the distribution of odor tuning in the LH also appears to be widerÂ â thatÂ is LHNs appear more functionally heterogeneous. However, there are also similarities â there is divergence of PNs onto a larger population of third order neurons in both cases. Furthermore baseline firing rates are very low in both LHNs and Kenyon cellsÂ (KCs) and the evoked firing rates are also lower than in their PN input. This could reflect energetic, spike economy considerations or a need to binarize neural responses prior to memory formation or organizing behaviors.</p><p>It is also interesting to compare response properties with recent recordings from the mammalian posterolateral cortical amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lurilli and Datta, 2017</xref>), which has been compared to the LH, since it receives spatially stereotyped input from the olfactory bulb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Sosulski et al., 2011</xref>) and is required for innate olfactory behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Root et al., 2014</xref>). (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lurilli and Datta, 2017</xref>) found that odor tuning properties were very similar to the mammalian piriform cortex (which has been compared to the mushroom body). Both regions showed decorrelated odor representations (whereas we find that LHN odor responses show significant correlations suggestive of a focus on particular combinations of olfactory channels) and odor tuning in the cortical amygdala was actually somewhat sparser. In further contrast to our observations in the LH they found no evidence for categorization of odors by chemical class and crucially no evidence for response stereotypy in a way suggestive of stereotyped integration of defined odor channels. We would however caution with respect to the last point that had we recorded from a small fraction of randomly selected neurons of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> LH, we might easily have missed response stereotypy. It is only because we were able to use genetics to bias our sampling, and also to record from a significant fraction of the whole LH population, that we could obtain clear evidence for odor response stereotypy. Nevertheless, these differences seem marked and it will be very interesting to compare the logic of these systems across organisms. One point to note is that the circuits in the fly may be more compact: LHNs can in a few cases connect directly to fourth order neurons with descending projections to the nerve cord likely to have a direct impact on motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huoviala et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Circuit mechanisms</title><p>There are some similarities between the increase in tuning breadth that we observe at the PN-LHN transition and what has previously been reported at the first synaptic layer of the olfactory system (the olfactory receptor neuron to PN synapse). In the antennal lobe broadening appears to depend on a compressive non-linearity, which boosts weaker inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhandawat et al., 2007</xref>) and possible excitatory local interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Olsen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Shang et al., 2007</xref>). Although a direct comparison between the extent of broadening in the antennal lobe and LH is not possible without measuring odor responses from many receptor neurons under the same stimulus conditions (as we did for PNs and LHNs) it seems likely that the effect is larger in the LH. Importantly the mechanism here appears quite different, with direct pooling of feed-forward inputs.</p><p>Our initial EM connectomics observations suggest that a typicalÂ outputÂ LHN (LHON) receives strong inputs from 3 to 7 excitatory PNs albeit with a long tail of weaker connections, some of which are likely to have an impact. Intriguingly this number (referred to as the synaptic degree, K, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Litwin-Kumar et al., 2017</xref>) is not that different from the seven inputs reported for KCs in the mushroom body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). How is it that LHONs and KCs listen to rather similar information but produce very different responses? It is true that the inputs received by LHNs will in general be more highly correlated; this is both because LHNs appear to receive input from all the PNs originating from a given glomerulus (when there are &gt;1) and because those PNs coming from different glomeruli often have related odor tuning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, we argue strongly that the rules of integration that result in broadening in LHONs and a sharp reduction in tuning breadth in KCs are likely to differ significantly. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FiÅek and Wilson (2014)</xref> have shown that LHON firing rates scale linearly with their PN inputs, while <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gruntman and Turner (2013)</xref> showed that KC membrane potential linearly integrates dendritic inputs. Differences in the integrative properties could result from both intrinsic and circuit mechanisms (i.e. local interneuron interactions), but two factors likely to have a major impact are the spatial distribution of synapses and the spike threshold. PN inputs are broadly distributed across LHON dendrites (Schlegel, Bates et al, in preparation), whereas PN inputs onto KCs are highly clustered at individual dendritic claws. The many individual connections at each KC claw may be integrated to produce a reliable response that is nevertheless usually below the spike threshold â therefore multiple input PNs must be co-active and KCs act as coincidence detectors. In contrast the inputs on LHON dendrites may be integrated in a more graded fashion with a lower spike threshold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FiÅek and Wilson, 2014</xref>). Of course the biggest difference is that LHNs receive stereotyped inputs according to their anatomical/genetic identity (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>) and this provides a mechanism for the odor response stereotypy that we observe.</p><p>We would also like to highlight some additional differences in circuit architecture between the MB and LH that may be of functional significance. First the MB calyx receives only excitatory PN input, whereas, there is a population of almost 100 inhibitory PNs that project to the LH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al., 2012a</xref>). Second we find that the LH contains an estimated 580 local neurons (most of which are inhibitory, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>), whereas the mushroom contains just one local inhibitory neuron, the APL. We suspect that a major reason for this difference is again related to the stereotyped vs non-stereotyped design of these two centers. The APL is not selective but appears to pool all KC inputs to implement a winner take all gain control mechanism, suppressing more weakly activated KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</xref>). Our preliminary EM results show that at least some LHLNs integrate small numbers of input channels (2â3 strong inputs). We suggest that they then make stereotyped connections either reciprocally onto their input PNs or onto other specific neurons in the LH.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Cell types in the central brain</title><p>There is renewed interest in the identification of cell types in the brain as an important step in the process of characterizing circuits and behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Zeng and Sanes, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2019a</xref>). Historically, cell types have been best classified by morphology and the most detailed work has been in the sensory periphery (e.g. 55 cell types in the mouse retina: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Masland, 2001</xref>). Recently single cell transcriptomics has begun to match this morphological classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shekhar et al., 2016</xref>) and also to enable more detailed exploration of diversity in deeper brain regions (e.g. 133 cell types in mammalian cortex: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). However, relating cell types to functional and network properties especially in higher brain areas remains challenging.</p><p>One of the major surprises from our work is our identification of 165 anatomically distinct LHN cell types; our cross-validation of anatomical and odor response properties for 37 leads us to believe that most of these will turn out to be functionally stereotyped as well. Furthermore our light level survey is incomplete; we predict that complete EM data could reveal more than 250 LHN cell types. In short there are more cell types in the lateral horn than have yet been identified in the whole of the mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). This disparity raises a number of issues.</p><p>One interesting observation is that it was easier to identify cell types anatomically than by odor response profile alone. It has recently proven possible to characterize 30 retinal ganglion cell types in the mouse based solely on their visual response properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baden et al., 2016</xref>). It may be that this highlights a difference between the richness of achievable visual stimulation protocols with odor delivery; although our core 36 odor set was large by the standards of the field, this is still a small fraction of the world of possible odors for the fly. Nevertheless there appear to be many more LHNs than retinal ganglion cell types and we find examples of neurons that appear to be solely distinguished by their projection patterns (presumably defining different downstream partners) which are only revealed through anatomical characterization. For these reasons we believe that response properties alone are insufficient to define cell type and this seems likely to be the case in other higher brain areas.</p><p>Initial evidence from EM connectomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>) has shown that two specific LHN cell types integrate stereotyped sets of olfactory channels with similar odor response profiles. This is paralleled by the recent work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al. (2018)</xref>, who showed that morphologically similar neurons sampled from the same or different GAL4 lines showed similar functional connectivity; furthermore they showed that the patterns of co-integration were not random, but that certain pairings of PN inputs were over-represented in the PN population. These observations are likely to be at the heart of the category selectivity that we observe in LHON responses. It will be exciting to integrate functional and anatomical properties more deeply with circuit properties. Furthermore our genetic screening identifies at least 69 molecular profiles based on expression of driver lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This molecular diversity underlies our ability to generate cell type specific split-GAL4 lines in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al. (2019)</xref>. The existence of such a rich and coupled genetic and anatomical diversity raises interesting questions about how connection specificity can be achieved during development in this integrative brain area.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>What is the behavioral function of the lateral horn?</title><p>The lateral horn is one of two major olfactory centers in the fly. The hypothesis that it might play a specific role in unlearned olfactory behaviors dates back at least to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heimbeck et al. (2001)</xref>. This has been strengthened by observations about the relative anatomical stereotypy of input projections to the mushroom body and lateral horn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless in spite of this general model of a division of labour between LH and MB, functional evidence has been hard to come by. Some arguments about LH function have been based on experiments that manipulate mushroom body neurons; here it is worth noting that there are olfactory projections neurons that target areas outside of these two principal centers (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tanaka et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>) so the lateral horn cannot rigorously be concluded to mediate behaviors for which the mushroom body appears dispensable.</p><p>In this experimental vacuum a large number of hypotheses have been proposed for LH function. One obvious suggestion based on anatomy was that LHNs should integrate across olfactory channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Marin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Wong et al., 2002</xref>). Of course integration can have opposing effects on tuning. For example (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Luo et al., 2010</xref>) proposed that LHNs might have highly selective odor responses and early recordings from narrowly tuned pheromone responsive neurons are consistent with this idea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Ruta et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kohl et al., 2013</xref>). However <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kohl et al. (2013)</xref> also observed more broadly tuned neurons that clearly integrated across olfactory channels and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">FiÅek and Wilson (2014)</xref> showed quite linear integration of two identified olfactory channels. Our electrophysiological recordings together with first EM connectomics results suggest that integration across multiple odor channels and broadening of odor responses are the norm.</p><p>Turning to the biological significance of LHNs for the fly, one suggestion, based on anatomically discrete domains for food and pheromone odors, is that the LH might organize odors by behavioral significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jefferis et al., 2007</xref>). Others have suggested that the LH might mediate innate responses to repulsive odors only (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2003</xref>) or that the LH might organize odor information by hedonic valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Strutz et al., 2014</xref>). Although our survey of LHN odor responses is not yet conclusive on any of these points, we did find clear evidence for an improved ability to categorize chemical groups of odorants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Further work integrating more information about the behavioral significance of different odors should be instructive.</p><p>One synthesis of these different ideas is that the MB performs odor identification, whereas the LH/lateralÂ protocerebrum performs odor evaluation, both learned and innate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Galizia, 2014</xref>). Although we have no evidence to support a direct role for the LH in evaluation of learned olfactory signals, new work from our group has identified a class of lateral horn neurons that integrates both innate (directly from the antennal lobe) and learned olfactory information (from MB output neurons) of specific valence; these LHNs are required for innate appetitive behavior as well as learned aversive recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>). We have also identified multiple LHN axon terminals as targets of mushroom body output neurons, suggesting that mushroom body modulation of innate olfactory pathways may be a general strategy of learned behavioral recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>). These results emphasize the extensive interconnection between these brain areas and should caution against oversimplifying their distinct roles in olfactory behavior. Nevertheless synthesizing the results in this study with other new work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dolan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huoviala et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>) does support the hypothesis that stereotyped integration in the LH could support genetically determined categorical odor representations, while the MB may enable identification of specific learned odors.</p><p>We finally return to a key question posed at the start of the manuscript: why does the LH need so many cells and cell types? At this stage we would suggest that LHNs are likely to show both stereotyped selectivity for odor categories and specificity for different aspects of odor-guided behavior. Specific combinations of the same odor information could be used to regulate distinct behaviors by targeting different premotor circuits (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Indeed our group has recently identified a requirement of a specific LHN cell type (AV1a1) in egg-laying aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huoviala et al., 2018</xref>) to the toxic mold odorant geosmin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Stensmyr et al., 2012</xref>) even though this is one of more than 70 cell types that receive geosmin information from olfactory PNs within the LH. The picture that this paints is of a complex switchboard for olfactory information with many more outputs than we can yet understand. It seems likely that different paths for information flow through the LH may be modulated by external signals such as the internal state of the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">BrÃ¤cker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Sayin et al., 2018</xref>). The next few years should see very rapid progress in understanding the logic of circuits within the LH and their downstream targets through the impact of connectomics approaches combined with the anatomical and functional characterization and tool development that we have begun in this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al.

In conclusion, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lateral horn now offers a very tractable model to understand the transition between sensory coding and behavior.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Enhancer trap Split-GAL4 screen</title><p>We hypothesized the low yield of previous screens to identify LH driver lines was due to a combination of extensive genetic heterogeneity amongst LHNs and the use of classic enhancer trap GAL4 lines, each of which labeled many neuronal classes; if an expression pattern labels many neurons, expression in a small subpopulation may be missed either because they are obscured by brighter neurons or because neurons of interest do not have a common highly organized structure that observers can more easily discern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ito et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>With these concerns in mind, we carried out a Split-GAL4 screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Luan et al., 2006</xref>) to generate a more complete and selective set of lines. Split-GAL4 driver lines achieve their increased specificity by the use of two hemidrivers, enhancer trap activation domain lines (ET-AD) and the other for enhancer trap DNA binding domains lines (ET-DBD), each of which must be co-expressed within a cell in order to reconstitute a functional transcription factor. The first stage of our screen was only designed to identify ET-AD and ET-DBD lines that are enriched for LHNs. We dissected 2255 AD hemidrivers and 514 DBD hemidrivers. At this stage we only rejected expression patterns that were either very broad with strong expression across the brain, or contained no labelling at all in the LH.

Lines were selected and annotated based on expression patterns. At the second stage of the screen lines that had similar clusters were crossed and the final expression pattern evaluated and the best lines in terms of specificity and strength of expression were selected for electrophysiology. As we carried out the physiology screen using lines generated in our lab, GMR and VT lines became available for screening. As these lines were sometimes sparse enough to be used directly for physiology we selected some GMR lines for recording as well.</p><p>ET-AD insertions were screened by crossing to Cha-DBD (in theory targeting cholinergic excitatory neurons) with a GFP reporter, while ET-DBD insertions were crossed to elav-AD (in theory targeting all neurons).

This provides flexibility for the addition of new cell types, while still ensuring that anatomically and functionally related neurons have similar names; this naming strategy may be useful for other brain areas without clearly defined compartments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Computational neuroanatomy</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Neuropil volumes</title><p>Using a standard female template brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ito et al., 2014</xref>) we calculated that the first olfactory relay, the AL, has a volume of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1.5</mml:mn><mml:mo>Ã</mml:mo><mml:mpadded width="+5pt"><mml:msup><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mn>5</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mpadded></mml:mrow><mml:mo>â¢</mml:mo><mml:mi>Î¼</mml:mi><mml:mo>â¢</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mn>3</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. Normalizing with respect to the AL, the LH and whole MB occupy relative volumes of 65% and 93%, respectively. However while second order projection neurons leaving the AL make synapses throughout the LH, in the MB they are restricted to the calyx region (relative volume 32% i.e. about half the LH). Similarly, while third order Kenyon cells are completely intrinsic to the MB, LH output neurons have axonal processes outside the LH. Using light level skeleton data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>), we find that the on average LHNs have almost exactly the same amount of arbor outside the LH as they have within the LH; note that this calculation was carried out after aggregating by cell type, to avoid cell types that are present at higher frequencies in the FlyCircuit dataset from skewing the results. We therefore conclude that the arbors of third order LHNs are actually likely to occupy a greater volume than MB Kenyon cells (an estimated 130% of the AL volume vs 93%).</p><p>On 17th December 2018, the PubMed search (âmushroom bodyâ AND Drosophila) OR (âmushroom bodiesâ AND Drosophila) returned 1002 results, whereas (âlateral hornâ AND Drosophila) OR (âlateral protocerebrumâ AND Drosophila) returned 77 results.

Note that to ensure reproducibility, the physplitdata package includes every spike from our study (469 cells, 638602 spikes). We determined if cells showed a significant increase in firing to an odor, by an exact one-sided Poisson test of the number of spikes in windows 0.7â2.2 s after trial onset; we compared odor and control (blank) stimuli using data from four trials per cell (physplit.analysis function poissonTestOdoursSF). We adjusted raw p values to control the false discovery rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>) using R's p.adjust function; responses for a given cell-odor pair were declared significant for FDR adjusted p &lt;Â 0.01. For single trial response detection we used the same method as above but the responses for a given cell-odor pair were declared significant for FDR adjusted to a slightly more permissive p &lt; 0.04 (single trials necessarily contain less information than the four trials used above). The detection probability for each cell-odor pair was first calculated, then cell response reliability was calculated by averaging across all the significant cell-odor pairs for each cell. Since the weakest significant odor responses (as initially assessed using four trials) necessarily had lower detection probability we also tested the effect of selecting only cell-odor response pairs above a variety of thresholds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1E</xref>), which resulted in a small increase in response reliability.

For automatic assignment of cell types by physiological or anatomical similarity, we used hierarchical clustering of the NBLAST or odor response similarity matrix using Wardâs method as implemented in the R function hclust.

The resulting scores indicated whether the presence of a response by a cell type was an indicator for an odor category. For each cell type we also generated five shuffled responses by randomly permuting the odor labels on the responses. We then computed the maximum AUC scores across odor categories within each cell type, and within each of the shuffles per cell type. Averaging maxima over the shuffles yielded one unshuffled maximum AUC score, and one shuffled one.

The overall procedure is to repeatedly generate random subpopulations of cells of a given size, where each cell is the sole representative of a particular class. We then train linear classifiers to perform identity or category decoding on a trial-by-trial basis for each time bin. The classifiers used have a single parameter that has to be tuned, so we train classifiers for a range of settings of this parameter and store the cross-validated accuracies. We then report the results for the parameter value that maximized the accuracy.</p><p>For each run a population of N classes were selected based on a random seed, where N varied from one up to a maximum of 50 (for LHONs). A single cell was then chosen to represent each class. For shuffle trials, the odor labels of the responses were shuffled independently for each cell, bin, and trial. The 120 (30 odors x four trials) responses for each cell in each bin were given numerical labels according to the task (Category or Identity classification). This category label was then assigned to all trials of that class (Category or Identity).</p><p>Linear support vector classifiers (SVC) were then trained independently for each bin using the scikit-learn OneVsRestClassifier (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scikit-learn.org/">https://scikit-learn.org/</ext-link>). Linear SVCs have a single parameter âCâ which must be tuned. To perform this tuning we trained classifiers for each of a fixed set of C values, and then determined the best C value (see below). This optimal C value (determined separately for each bin) was then used in the performance plots. The range of C values typically used in practice are powers of 10 spanning a âsufficiently broadâ range. We chose to use a range of 10^[â8,â7â¦1] as manual inspection showed that the optimal C values were usually within this range, and no consistent plateauing behavior (where the optimal C value appears clipped to either limit of the range of C values used) was observed.</p><p>We recorded the cross validated accuracy for each of 4 cross-validation runs as reported by the scikit-learn cross_val_score function. This procedure yields for each bin and each C value, four accuracy values (one from each cross-validation run). We next determine the optimal C value for each bin. To do so, we proceed as follows:</p><p>For each time bin of each cell we</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Computed the mean accuracy after training the support vector classifier over four cross-validations.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Split the multiple runs for each time bin x cell into two halves</p></list-item><list-item><p>Computed the best C value thatÂ is the one with the highest accuracy, using the first half of the data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>For each bin of the data in the second half, kept only the result for the best C value for that bin.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Computed the mean (traces) and standard deviation (envelopes) of the accuracy over random seeds in the performance plots.</p></list-item></list><p>This split procedure reduces the bias associated with selection of the parameter C by measuring performance over independent random samples from those used to tune C.

In parallel we calculated the average amount of cable overlap for each cell type the 25 LH input supervoxels and 25 LH output defined earlier. We then combined these two data sources to create a supervoxel-category score by calculating the mean supervoxel score, selecting only the classes whose score was maximal for that category. In this way a high voxel score was generated only when classes were both specific for an odor category and had dense arborization in a specific voxel.

In order to make our cell type annotations for FlyCircuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chiang et al., 2011</xref>) and dye filled skeletons, and our stimulus response data more easily available to the community, we created an interactive R Shiny Web app (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://shiny.rstudio.com">shiny.rstudio.com</ext-link>), which can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flyemdev.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk:8080/LHlibrary">http://jefferislab.org/si/lhlibrary</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bates and Jefferis, 2019c</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/LHlibrary">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/LHlibrary</ext-link>), based on data collated from several studies, found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/jefferislab/lhns">https://github.com/jefferislab/lhns</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2019a</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/lhns">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/lhns</ext-link>). Skeletons can be viewed within a template brain in 3D, response data can be plotted for specific odors and cell types, and skeletons and response data can be downloaded as SWC and CSV files respectively. Significantly, this âLH libraryâ also hosts maximal projection images (brain and ventral nervous system), single skeletons from multi-color FlpOut, and 3D vector clouds representing sparse split-GAL4 lines that label LH cell types (from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dolan et al., 2019</xref>, sister manuscript). The LH library also contains other available datasets that relate to the LH, including PN response data from a calcium imaging study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Badel et al., 2016</xref>) and functional connectivity data from GH146 uniglomerular PNs providing input to LHNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al., 2018</xref>). We were able to cross-match 80/89 3D morphologies reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jeanne et al. (2018)</xref> onto 26 LHN cell types in our data set. Finally we also include predicted connectivity to a wide range of cell types (ASB) to enable the rapid generation of connectivity hypotheses that can be tested functionally or through EM tracing. This web application can also be run directly on an end userâs own computer to increase response speed.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank G Johnson, P Hasel, B Gyenes, and J Roote for their assistance with Split-GAL4 screening.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Ilona C Grunwald Kadow (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Frechter et al. present a comprehensive and impressive dataset characterizing a brain center that for multiple reasons has been 'dismissed' for further analysis from many studies dealing with chemosensory processing in insects and in particular in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. As the authors point out (i.e., 'This large investment in neuropil volume argues for the significance of the LH in sensory processing, whereas the literature currently contains 13 fold more studies of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> MB than LH'), the LH is far understudied and this present work together with its companion manuscript (Dolan et al., 2019 <italic>eLife</italic>) will contribute significantly to changing this imbalance of knowledge.</p><p>The authors conclude that the LH shows highly stereotyped odor responses, which can be best described as responses to odor categories rather than odor valence. Furthermore, comparing the LH to the cortical amygdala reveals that these two brain regions encode innate information in a different form.</p><p>(Please see the detailed comments below. Additional analysis as suggested would be very interesting but not essential at this stage given that the manuscript is already quite voluminous.</p><p>The authors should address key points in a rebuttal, carry out additional analysis only if compatible with a speedy publication, and invest a time into their figures and figure legends.)</p><p>The authors' main findings/achievements are. These are listed so that the comments that follow can be seen in this perspective.</p><p>A) Anatomy/tools:</p><p>1) Using EM tracing techniques, they estimate that the number of LHNs (~1400) is significantly larger than expected from previous estimates.</p><p>2) Genetic screening of a couple of thousand lines allows them to identify 234 split-Gal4 lines for labeling specific subsets of LHNs. They further identify 69 different subgroups of LHNs based on these and other lines and a three-level system of anatomical categories.</p><p>3) Based on these lines, they generated a collection of specific Split-Gal4 lines for further characterization (see also sister manuscript Dolan et al.)</p><p>4) In a next step, they combine different neuroanatomy databases to further subcategorize cell types based on morphology. For instance, they define intrinsic LHNs, LH output neurons, different projection zones including shared zones with MB output etc. They also make all this data is available and searchable online (the link did not work for me, howeverâ¦)!</p><p>B) Type:</p><p>1) They record electro-physiologically from ~600 cells including LHINs, LHONs, PNs and find that LHNs have higher input resistance and lower capacitance as compared to PNs; a finding not only interesting in regard to their function/coding, but also of relevance for other questions such as lifetime, metabolism of PNs vs. LHNs.</p><p>2) Another important finding is that LHONs respond to ~3x more odors than PNs.</p><p>3) The authors used different criteria to try to define cell types based on anatomy and/or function. They used automated clustering analysis and found that many cell types fell into the same odor response type and anatomical (at least on the level of the primary neurite morphology) categories that they had defined by hand.</p><p>4) Based on odor responses they define 33 cell types with stereotyped responses, and argue that this type of response stereotopy is likely also true for the remaining anatomical classes with insufficient response information.</p><p>C) Coding/function:</p><p>1) Prior work hypothesized that the LH might code for valence. Given the observed response profiles as well as the important aspect of behavioral context, the authors argue that 'good vs. bad' are unlikely categories for LH odor coding. Instead, they test several other hypotheses including chemical features.</p><p>2) They find that ~70% of LHONs respond by odor categories such as amine vs. acetate or pheromones.</p><p>3) This type of categorization held true also for LHON targets in other brain regions suggesting segregating pathways depending on odor category/behavioral context.</p><p>4) Using the whole brain EM data set by Davi Bock and colleagues, they map out connections between uniglomerular PNs and LHNs and find that ~5 PNs input to every LHN, which is interestingly similar for KC input!</p><p>5) However, in contrast to KC input, LHON/PN synapses were much more numerous and LHONs, in addition, received significantly more input from other local neurons.</p><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) Overall, this is a well written, impressive manuscript. It is obvious that much more analysis could be done in the future, and that this work will open the way for many different studies including behavior and circuit mapping. Together with its sister manuscript (Dolan et al., 2019 <italic>eLife</italic>), this work builds an extremely powerful, comprehensive, and informative package that should appear ideally back-to-back. In fact, as Aso et al., 2014 a and b, have done for the MB, these two manuscripts will provide a strong push for the LH.</p><p>2) There are concerns regarding figures and figure legends. In the figures, most writing is too small. While we understand that this is difficult to change, we would encourage the authors to think of ways to put additional labeling (for instance of some of the axes) to just indicate what kind of more detailed information is 'hidden' in small print. Similarly, short figure legends can be great, but once again we would have greatly appreciated some more details in the legends, which could even include some of the 'take-home' messages of the particular panel or figure. Given the breadth and length of the manuscript, a reader is otherwise forced to jump back-and-forth between main text, legend, and Materials and methods constantly. And most readers are not ready to spend a lot of time to read a paper. In addition, many of the links provided by the authors did not work, please check this.</p><p>3) The authors discuss the hypothesis that the mushroom body is for odor identification while the LH is for odor evaluation/classification. This could potentially be very nicely tested with their existing data, by asking: how good is the population of LHN recordings at identifying odors? â i.e., is it worse than PNs? Possible metrics:</p><p>a) Figure 7 looks at correlations in odor response profiles between different LHON, LHLN and PN types. Could they reverse this and instead look at correlation in population responses, between different odors? Are population responses more correlated for LHNs than for PNs? (Of course, this would need similar controls as the rest of Figure 7 to ensure that any difference isn't an artifact of the number of cell types recorded).</p><p>b) Cluster analysis based on individual trials â how well separated are the clusters corresponding to each individual odor? How many errors are made when identifying which odor is a single trial? (as in Hige et al. Nature 2015 â where MBONs performed worse than KCs) (confounding factor here is that LHN responses are more reliable than PNs â but if LHNs are <italic>worse</italic> than PNs at clustering, then the confound is in the other direction)</p><p>c) ROC/AUC analysis like they do in Figure 8 for odor categories.</p><p>4) Can the authors calculate lifetime and population sparseness for LHLNs, LHONs, and PNs (as an additional measure beyond just% of odors with significant responses)?</p><p>5) We have concerns about the calculation of LH neuropil volume. They calculate the total neuropil volume of the LH, then multiply by a factor of 2 on the basis that on average, LHNs have the same amount of arbor outside the LH as inside. This is based on light level skeleton data which I'm guessing reveals length but not volume. What if LHNs have thinner axons outside the LH than inside? Also, a distribution concern: What if LHNs with very short axons have a greater proportion of the axon outside the LH, while LHNs with very long axons have a smaller proportion outside the LH? Then on average LHNs would have the same amount of arbor inside as outside the LH, yet the total amount of neuropil outside the LH would be smaller than the total amount inside. Can the authors rule out these possibilities or place some confidence bounds on their estimate?</p><p>6) The authors use the Rand index of ~ 0.6 to say that their manual classification is &quot;well-grounded&quot; â but we don't have any intuition for whether a Rand index of 0.6 is &quot;good&quot;. Would they also have said their classification was &quot;well-grounded&quot; if the Rand index was, say, 0.2? (i.e. is this basically an unfalsifiable statement) Can this be benchmarked against some examples where the reader can have some intuitive grasp?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44590.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments:</p><p>1) Overall, this is a well written, impressive manuscript.

This could potentially be very nicely tested with their existing data, by asking: how good is the population of LHN recordings at identifying odors? â i.e., is it worse than PNs? Possible metrics:</p><p>a) Figure 7 looks at correlations in odor response profiles between different LHON, LHLN and PN types. Could they reverse this and instead look at correlation in population responses, between different odors? Are population responses more correlated for LHNs than for PNs? (Of course, this would need similar controls as the rest of Figure 7 to ensure that any difference isn't an artifact of the number of cell types recorded).</p><p>b) Cluster analysis based on individual trials â how well separated are the clusters corresponding to each individual odor? How many errors are made when identifying which odor is a single trial? (as in Hige et al. Nature 2015 â where MBONs performed worse than KCs) (confounding factor here is that LHN responses are more reliable than PNs â but if LHNs are worse than PNs at clustering, then the confound is in the other direction)</p><p>c) ROC/AUC analysis like they do in Figure 8 for odor categories.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this question, which has pushed us to add an interesting additional analysis to the paper. We considered all three of the metrics that they suggested (including carrying out the analysis in âaâ and corresponding with Glenn Turner to verify the details of the analysis in âbâ). However in the end, we concluded that none of these suggestions were effective ways to address the underlying question, âHow good is the LHN vs. PN population at identifying odors?â for our data.</p><p>Instead we adopted an approach similar to the one used by Bhandawat et al., 2007. We used a linear classifier (specifically a support vector classifier) to predict odour identity from neuronal population responses. We constructed a virtual population of PNs or LHONs by selecting a single cell for each cell type. We then trained the support vector classifier to predict odor identity and tested its performance using a leave one out cross-validation step. Bootstrapping the selection of different neurons gave an indication of variability in this performance. We also tested the impact of varying the number of cell types on the prediction accuracy. These results are included at the end of Figure 9 (formerly Figure 8) and described in the text (subsection âEncoding of odor categoriesâ, fifth paragraph). Additional methodological details are provided (Materials and methods subsection âMeasuring population decoding accuracyâ).</p><p>The summary of these new results is that LHONs showed a consistent advantage in odour categorisation for cell populations as well as single cells. However for odor identification, LHON populations (but not single LHONs) outperform PNs, which is probably not the reviewerâs prediction. The likely reason for this is again the tuning breadth of LHONs â they respond to more odours (by integrating multiple input channels). Effectively for a given number of cell types an LHN population has more information than a PN population â indeed some of our test odours almost never produced a significant PN response, while still exciting numerous LHNs. All of this forces us to the conclusion that we mention in the text â that a better understanding of this relationship may need to await an improved understanding of the odour channels that LHONs actually integrate. Forthcoming connectomics data means that within the next 1-2 years we should have such data.</p><p>Now returning to the initial motivation. As the reviewers noted, we discussed the âhypothesis that the mushroom body is for odor identification while the LH is for odor evaluation/classificationâ. We do indeed favour a version of this hypothesis, concluding our discussion of this point (emphasis added):</p><p>âNevertheless synthesizing the results in this study with other new work (Dolan et al., 2018a,b; Huoviala et al., 2018; Jeanne et al., 2018) does support the hypothesis that stereotyped integration in the LH could support genetically determined categorical odor representations, while the MB may enable â<italic>identification of specific learned</italic>â odors.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However we would also note that we do not feel that it makes a strong prediction about the relative performance of PNs vs LHONs in odor identification. It does make a stronger prediction about relative odor identification performance of LHONs vs Kenyon cells, but that is not something that we can test at this point â it would odour response data for a large KC population with our stimulus conditions.</p><p>4) Can the authors calculate lifetime and population sparseness for LHLNs, LHONs, and PNs? (as an additional measure beyond just% of odors with significant responses).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added lifetime and population sparseness measures to the new Figure 4 (formerly the lower half of Figure 3) and reference these panels in the text (Results subsection âOdor responses of lateral horn neuronsâ, fourth paragraph). These results follow the anticipated trends i.e. decreasing sparseness for PNs, LHLNs, LHONs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) We have concerns about the calculation of LH neuropil volume. They calculate the total neuropil volume of the LH, then multiply by a factor of 2 on the basis that on average, LHNs have the same amount of arbor outside the LH as inside. This is based on light level skeleton data which I'm guessing reveals length but not volume. What if LHNs have thinner axons outside the LH than inside?</p></disp-quote><p>This an interesting point. We have recently measured the volume to cable length ratio of axonal and dendritic arbours for a sample of LHONs (using as yet unpublished auto-segmentation data generated by Peter Li and collaborators, available in preprint form at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1101/605634">https://doi.org/10.1101/605634</ext-link>); we find that the axonal arbours have ~70% larger volume:length ratio than dendrites on average. Therefore it seems that LHN axons are thicker than their dendrites and we can reassure the reviewers that this concern does not hold.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, a distribution concern: What if LHNs with very short axons have a greater proportion of the axon outside the LH, while LHNs with very long axons have a smaller proportion outside the LH? Then on average LHNs would have the same amount of arbor inside as outside the LH, yet the total amount of neuropil outside the LH would be smaller than the total amount inside. Can the authors rule out these possibilities or place some confidence bounds on their estimate?</p></disp-quote><p>We summed the total arbour volume outside the LH for one sample flycircuit neuron for each of 167 cell types and compared it with the summed arbour volume inside the LH for the selected neurons. The particular distributional concern mentioned by the reviewers therefore does not apply, since we divided the two summed volumes rather than calculating the mean of 167 cable ratios. Of course we cannot exclude the possibility that neurons with extensive arbours outside the LH may be overrepresented in flycircuit, but we have taken a large sample and we only report our figures one figures to 1 s.f. and make it clear that this is an estimate.</p><p>We therefore think that our statement âwe estimate that the total volume of LHN arbors is therefore actually 40% greater than the MBâ remains a reasonable summary.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors use the Rand index of ~ 0.6 to say that their manual classification is &quot;well-grounded&quot; â but we don't have any intuition for whether a Rand index of 0.6 is &quot;good&quot;. Would they also have said their classification was &quot;well-grounded&quot; if the Rand index was, say, 0.2? (i.e. is this basically an unfalsifiable statement) Can this be benchmarked against some examples where the reader can have some intuitive grasp?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that few readers may have any intuition about what constitutes a âgoodâ value of the adjusted Rand index. The adjusted Rand index does show that the classification accuracy is well above chance (since the adjusted Rand index would be 0 at chance performance); we have pointed this out in the text (subsection âFine scale anatomical clustering confirms LHN classificationâ, second paragraph). However we now also report in the text (third paragraph of the aforementioned subsection) the final proportion correctly classified by anatomy and relate this to Figure 7E, which shows excellent agreement between the NBLAST anatomical clustering and functional cell types.</p></body></sub-article></article>
