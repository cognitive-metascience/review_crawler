In vitro application of ivacaftor/lumacaftor or ivacaftor/tezacaftor to CF monocytes showed a significant reduction in IL-18, whereas IL-1β was only reduced with ivacaftor/tezacaftor. Thirteen adults starting ivacaftor/lumacaftor and eight starting ivacaftor/tezacaftor were assessed over three months. Serum IL-18 and TNF decreased significantly with treatments, but IL-1β only declined following ivacaftor/tezacaftor. In (LPS/ATP-stimulated) PBMCs, IL-18/TNF/caspase-1 were all significantly decreased and IL-10 was increased with both combinations. Ivacaftor/tezacaftor alone showed a significant reduction in IL-1β and pro-IL-1β mRNA.

The relationship between these two key drivers of disease progression remain poorly understood. We and others have recently provided evidence supporting the hypothesis that the NLRP3-inflammasome is a key regulator of inflammation in CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McElvaney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peckham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scambler et al., 2019</xref>). We’ve demonstrated that both CF epithelia and monocytes/serum from patients with CF exhibit an enhanced pro-inflammatory signature when compared with healthy controls and patients with non-CF bronchiectasis. We observed CF-specific increases in IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1 activity, in addition to ASC-speck release, that were all reversed by pre-treatment with epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Peckham et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scambler et al., 2019</xref>). In this paper, we examine the therapeutic potential of controlling inflammation with CFTR modulators. These small molecules are known to correct CFTR dysfunction and partially restore CFTR-mediated ENaC inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cholon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pranke et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The NLRP3-inflammasome senses multiple damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Amongst the latter, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is a major component of the outer membrane of two of the main pathogens found in CF airways, the gram-negative bacteriae such a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa)</italic> and members of the <italic>Burkholderia cepacia complex (B. cenocepacia)</italic>. It has been reported that the latter organism can trigger the NLRP3-inflammasome and exacerbate the proinflammatory response, both through inflammasome activation and IL-1β/IL-18 processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Rimessi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gavrilin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Rosales-Reyes et al., 2012</xref>). In this regard, in both murine and human CF, NLRP3 activity contributes to IL-1β-dependent inflammation which can be negatively regulated by anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1Ra) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McElvaney et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Iannitti et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, the NLRP3 inhibitor, MCC950, reduces IL-1β levels in the lungs, decreases airway inflammation and improves airway clearance of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">McElvaney et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, defective CFTR expression and function appears to be driving inflammation, by lowering the threshold of innate immune defences and reducing the ability of myeloid cells, such as neutrophils and macrophages to resolve infection and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnaby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonfield et al., 2012</xref>). Conditional inactivation of <italic>Cftr</italic> in myeloid cells of mice resulted in a dysfunctional immune response, with <italic>Cftr</italic>-lacking mice taking longer to resolve inflammation and to rectify infection, when compared to wild-type (WT) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonfield et al., 2012</xref>). Finally, in young children with CF, inflammation can be detected in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, in the absence of infection, and this process is mainly driven via NLRP3-inflammasome activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rosenow et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">McElvaney et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The introduction of CFTR modulators into clinical practice has resulted in a paradigm shift in therapeutic options, whereby targeting the clinico-pathogenic origin of the defective CFTR rather than the secondary effects of CFTR dysfunction has become a reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">VX17-445-103 Trial Group et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">VX17-445-102 Study Group et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">VX08-770-102 Study Group et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Taylor-Cousar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">TRAFFIC Study Group et al., 2015</xref>). These drug regimens were primarily developed to improve cell-surface expression and function of the CFTR anion channel but there are limited data on whether they can directly modulate CF-related inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnaby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hisert et al., 2017</xref>). Treatment of primary bronchial epithelial cell cultures (BECs), bearing two Phe508del mutations, with the combination of ivacaftor/lumacaftor (IVA/LUM) depresses CXCL8 transcription, p38 MAPK phosphorylation and reduces serum levels of several proinflammatory cytokines, in response to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnaby et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ruffin et al., 2018</xref>). Treatment with the single agent, ivacaftor, currently approved for patients with gating mutations, such as G551D, has also been reported to reduce sputum levels of neutrophil elastase, IL-8, and IL-1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">VX08-770-102 Study Group et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hisert et al., 2017</xref>), and these changes may reflect improved clinical health rather than a direct anti-inflammatory consequence of increased CFTR function.</p><p>The aims of our study were firstly, to assess whether CFTR modulators could directly downregulate the increased serum and (innate-immune) cell-derived IL-1β and IL-18 cytokine signature in cells harvested from adults with CF, and secondly, to explore differences in response between drug regimens as a guide to inform future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monocyte cytokine responses in healthy controls versus drug-naïve individuals homozygous for Phe508del</title><p>We have previously established that monocytes isolated from clinically stable ‘drug-naïve’ CF patients (homozygous for Phe508del) have an increased secretion of IL-18 and IL-1β when compared to healthy control (HC) monocytes. This response was attenuated in vitro with the addition of inhibitors either targeting components of the NLRP3-inflammasome or the ENaC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Scambler et al., 2019</xref>). Using monocytes isolated from clinically stable patients homozygous for the common Phe508del CF mutation, we examined whether the in vitro application of clinically approved CFTR modulator combinations (IVA/LUM and IVA/TEZ), could also regulate IL-18 and IL-1β levels. In parallel we established whether these combinations could influence HC cells devoid of pathogenic CFTR mutations. We monitored monocyte stimulated cytokine responses, in cells harvested from drug-naïve patients with CF, in the presence or absence of IVA/LUM or IVA/TEZ combinations. In vitro pre-administration of IVA/LUM for 24 hr to CF monocytes in culture halved the seven-fold rise in IL-18 observed in their absence (p&lt;0.0001, for responses to stimulation with LPS-ATP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In complete contrast, there was no drug-induced attenuation of the near six-fold rise in LPS-ATP-stimulated IL-1β levels (p=0.9434, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Although HC cells showed a two-fold elevation in cytokines after exposure to LPS-ATP alone, IVA/LUM could not attenuate this small rise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Also, in marked contrast, the in vitro pre-administration of the other drug combination, IVA/TEZ, for 24 hr, significantly reduced the post-stimulus increments in both IL-18 (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and IL-1β levels (p=0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), in monocytes of patients with CF. IVA/TEZ also had no discernable reductive effect on monocytes from HC volunteers in the presence/absence of LPS and ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cytokine secretion in NLRP3-stimulated monocytes with a differential response between CF (homozygous Phe508del) and HC (healthy controls) following in vitro exposure to either IVA/LUM or IVA/TEZ.</title><p>ELISA assays were used to detect A, C IL-18; B, D IL-1β secretion in monocytes from patients with CF-associated mutations (n = 10 IVA/LUM; n = 4 IVA/TEZ) vs HC (n = 4).

Our rationale was that blood is routinely drawn from such patients every few months, thus making any findings much simpler to incorporate into future studies. Thus, blood samples were taken from patients starting IVA/LUM therapy (n = 13) or IVA/TEZ (n = 8) at baseline (pre-therapy), and again at one month and three months of treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). All patients receiving these therapies met the criteria for the UK compassionate use program, that is reflective of their percent predicted forced expiratory volume (ppFEV<sub>1</sub>) of less than 40 (HC values are typically greater than 80). To ensure maximal clinical stability, patients received a pre-emptive course of intravenous antibiotics prior to starting treatment. Over this three month study period there were no significant differences in C-reactive protein (CRP), ppFEV<sub>1</sub>, forced vital capacity (ppFVC), white blood count (WBC), neutrophil count, weight (kg) or body mass index (BMI) in either group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> for IVA/LUM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> for IVA/TEZ).</p><p>To obtain normal ranges for serum cytokines, baseline ranges were established from 10 HC and 51 clinically stable drug-naïve CF patients (with ppFEV<sub>1</sub> ranging from 12 to 90; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>).

As a result several novel anti-inflammatory agents are now being developed with the aim of slowing down disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, 2020</xref>). As recurrent episodes of CF inflammation are the direct result of CFTR dysfunction, it follows that correcting CFTR itself should influence the aberrant changes in innate immunity present in CF, and downregulate the self-propagating inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Mesureur et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The present study provides evidence of differential downstream regulation of inflammation, in vivo, following short term administration of IVA/LUM or IVA/TEZ. We observed a direct effect of CFTR modulators in both serum and NLRP3-stimulated PBMCs. Treatment with either IVA/LUM or IVA/TEZ significantly reduced serum and NLRP3-stimulated IL-18levels, TNF secretion and caspase-1 activity. There was also an increase in serum IL-10, which is a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine that downregulates the inflammatory response and ameliorates immunopathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asadullah et al., 2003</xref>). Only IVA/TEZ significantly reduced serum and NLRP3-stimulated IL-1β secretion and <italic>pro-IL-1β,</italic> mRNA transcripts. This difference is potentially important, as IL-1β is significantly elevated in CF and has a wide range of biological effects, associated with both infection and inflammation. Similar differences were also seen following the addition of IVA/TEZ drug to monocytes isolated from clinically stable ‘drug-naïve’ CF patients, homozygous for Phe508del.</p><p>Both LUM and TEZ exert their clinical effects by increasing the processing and trafficking of mature CFTR protein to the cell surface. When combined with the potentiator, IVA, they partially rectify CFTR function and alter CFTR-ENaC coupling, which results in the inhibition of the elevated amiloride-sensitive sodium transport that is characteristic of CF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cholon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Pranke et al., 2017</xref>). Studies of nasal potential differences and rectal intestinal current measurements (ICM) studies suggest that dual combination therapy rescue Phe508del CFTR, by approximately 10% to 18% of normal, with both drugs having a similar effect on ion transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gentzsch and Mall, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Graeber et al., 2018</xref>). The disparity in IL-1β secretion was, therefore, surprising and may result from off-target effects, which have been reported with CFTR modulators. For instance, IVA can influence various solute carriers in vitro and reduce the stability of LUM-rescued Phe508del-CFTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chin et al., 2018</xref>). Clinically, IVA/LUM has also been associated with unexplained increased respiratory adverse events, which can occur relatively acutely after starting treatment. Symptoms include dyspnoea and chest tightness, features which have not been reported with IVA/TEZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Habib et al., 2019</xref>). It might also be the case that pharmacokinetics of LUM and TEZ may differ.</p><p>During this study, combination therapy was only available through a Vertex compassionate use program, with treatment inclusion criteria including lung transplant assessment and a ppFEV1 &lt;40%, for at least two months. This is in contrast to reported phase three clinical trials which recruited stable patients with significantly higher lung function. In those studies, treatment over a 24 week period resulted in modest but significant improvements in lung function of around 3%, with reduced pulmonary exacerbations and a decrease in annual rate of ppFEV1 decline vs matched controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Konstan et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, in adults with severe obstructive lung disease receiving IVA/LUM, significant improvements in FEV<sub>1</sub> can be absent in the first six months of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wark et al., 2019</xref>). While our study was not designed to investigate clinical efficacy, the absence of significant changes in clinical parameters, during our three month study period, was consistent with stable disease rather than a decline in health, as might be expected in a population with severe lung disease.</p><p>The association between CF and increased secretion of both IL-18 and IL-1β, as well as <italic>pro-IL-1β</italic> mRNA transcripts, may suggest that inhibiting IL-1β alone, with drugs such as anakinra, an IL-1 receptor antagonist, may prove less effective than drugs which target CFTR and, thereby, modify both IL-18 and IL-1β secretion. However baseline IL-1β levels remained elevated and additional targeting of the IL-1 receptor, could significantly enhance clinical effect, especially in patients on IVA/LUM where IL-1β was not significantly downregulated.</p><p>The effect of IVA/LUM and IVA/TEZ was lost at 36 hr post-oral therapy, but was regained following re-incubation with the corresponding drugs in vitro. This suggests that the anti-inflammatory properties of CFTR modulators can be prolonged, when drug levels are sustained through in vitro administration, but also highlights the additional effect of CFTR modulators on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. This finding has potential implications for patients who struggle with compliance, as missing a single dose will influence inflammatory cytokine levels, and may lead to unwanted side-effects as well as influencing the effectiveness of the therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abbott and Bilton, 2015</xref>).</p><p>From this study, it seems that IL-18 and IL-1β are the most reliable biomarkers to inform drug effectiveness at downregulating inflammation in CF. Although TNF is not elevated in serum or PBMCs from CF relative to HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2, C</xref>), it has been shown by independent research groups, that the CFTR is actively involved in the regulation of TNF, via the NF- κB pathway in lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hunter et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vij et al., 2009</xref>). For example, transient-transfection of WT CFTR into CFTR-naive H441 lung epithelial cells, dose-dependently down-regulates both the basal and TNF evoked NF-κB activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hunter et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Some consideration should also be given to other biomarkers, such as IL-6, which did not change significantly with treatment and to the anti-inflammatory IL-10 cytokine which rose significantly and may help discriminate individual and drug specific responses in future studies.</p><p>In summary, systemic inflammation plays a major role in the pathogenesis of CF and, to our knowledge, this pilot study is the first to demonstrate that CFTR modulators have potent innate anti-inflammatory properties, that can be measured in the clinic, both ex vivo and in vitro. Differences in drug effects on regulation of the inflammatory response highlight the importance of optimising biomarkers of inflammation, when assessing their individual treatment efficacy, which can substantially vary between patients. The introduction of newer, and more effective, drug combinations may prove highly efficacious at normalising the inflammatory response in CF, with the prospect of controlling disease progression. We believe our approach creates a template for a candidate cytokine protocol for future evaluation in CF trials of dysregulated inflammation in CF.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Biological sample (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>Human Blood Samples</td><td>St James's University Hospital</td><td>Health Research Authority REC reference 17/YH/0084</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Lymphoprep</td><td>Axis Shield</td><td>Cat# 1114544</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Pan Monocyte Isolation Kit, human</td><td>Miltenyi Biotec</td><td>Cat# 130-096-537</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Lipopolysacchride Ultrapure EK</td><td>InvivoGen</td><td>Cat# tlrl-eklps</td><td>10ng/ml</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>ATP</td><td>InvivoGen</td><td>Cat# tlrl-atpl</td><td>5 mM, <break/>30 min</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Lumacaftor (LUM)</td><td>AdooQ Bioscience</td><td>Cat#A10986</td><td>3 μM, 24 hr</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ivacaftor (IVA)</td><td>Cayman chemicals</td><td>Cat#15145</td><td>5 μM, 24 hr</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tezacaftor (TEZ)</td><td>TargetMol</td><td>Cat#T2263</td><td>5 μM, 24 hr</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>IL-1 beta Human Matched Antibody Pair</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# CHC1213</td><td>Assay sensitivity &lt; 31.2 pg/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>IL-18 Human Matched Antibody Pair</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# BMS267/2MST</td><td>Assay sensitivity 78 pg/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>IL-6 Human Matched Antibody Pair</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# CHC1263</td><td>Assay sensitivity 15.6 pg/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>TNF alpha Human Matched Antibody Pair</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# CHC1753</td><td>Assay sensitivity &lt; 15.6 pg/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>IL1RA Human Matched Antibody Pair</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# CHC1183</td><td>Assay sensitivity &lt; 31.2 pg/mL</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>(TMB) substrate solution</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat# T0440</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Caspase-1 Colorimetrix Assay</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>Cat# BF15100</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>High-Capacity cDNA Reverse Transcription Kit</td><td valign="top">ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>Cat# 4368814</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>GraphPad Prism7</td><td>Graphpad software</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patients</title><p>Adult patients entering the Vertex compassionate use program for IVA/LUM (n = 13) and IVA/TEZ (n = 8) were prospectively recruited between 2016 and 2019, from the Leeds Regional Adult CF Unit.

combinations downregulate inflammation differently in cystic fibrosis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Rebecca Coll (Reviewer #1) and Siroon Bekkering (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript provides additional evidence that systemic and cellular inflammation is of importance in CF. The study highlights the cellular anti-inflammatory effects of potent pharmacological inhibitors. The reviewers consider the data convincing and the subject generally compelling, but feel that the manuscript is difficult to follow and needs significant editing and re-organisation. Also, the mechanistic aspects should be discussed in more detail.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The grammar and sentence construction need to be improved throughout the manuscript.</p><p>2) The layout of the figures is not helpful to the reader. There is a rationale for grouping the two treatments in Figure 2 and Figure 3, but this makes comparing the data quite difficult as the reader to look between the two figures. We recommend that the data are grouped in a way that follows the description in the text.</p><p>3) Figure 2A and B appear to have been partially mislabelled – 2A should be IL-18 and 2B should be IL-1beta.</p><p>4) Although the authors measure caspase-1 activity as an additional non-cytokine based NLRP3 activation assay, in their previous publication the authors measured ASC specks in CF patient samples – did they do this in this study? This would be interesting data to include.</p><p>5) In subsection “NLRP3 inflammasome activation in patients receiving IVA/LUM or IVA/TEZ therapy” there is a description of mRNA levels in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, and Figure 3—figure supplement 3. There is a reference to NLRP3 mRNA which is shown in Figure 2K and Figure 3K but in the supplements NLRC4 mRNA appears to have been measured. This is however not discussed at all in the text. Have the genes been mixed up here?</p><p>6) There needs to be more discussion on the differential effects on IL-1beta between lumacaftor and tezacaftor. Is this related to the mechanism of action of these drugs?</p><p>7) How does the variability in cellular and systemic effects observed in the PBMCs of these patients correlate with the effects of these drugs in vivo? In the Introduction, the authors mention that not all CF patients benefit the same from these drugs and that efficacy varies. From Figure 2—figure supplement 1 it seems that these drugs did not have any effect on CF in these 3 months. Is that as expected? How long does it take for these drugs to see differences?</p><p>8) How do the authors think that the different drugs works intracellularly? The authors have tested one hypothesis but any mentioning of this hypothesis or other potential mechanisms is missing in the Discussion section. Are there any future directions to find out how it works? And does this have implications for drug efficacy in reducing CF?</p><p>9) The effects on serum IL-1beta are quite impressive. The lesson to be derived from this is that even when the intervention shows an effect on IL-1beta, this level of the cytokine is still in an inflammatory range. Hence a case could be made (in contrast with what the authors say in the Discussion section) that the clinical effect could be enhanced by combining treatment with anakinra. This point should be discussed in detail.</p><p>10) If samples and budget allow, it would be really interesting to perform RNA sequencing on the monocytes of these patients before and after treatment, also to find out pathway differences between the treatments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.54556.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The grammar and sentence construction need to be improved throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made significant changes to improve both grammar and sentence structure throughout the document.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The layout of the figures is not helpful to the reader.

We have checked to see what samples we have remaining but we don’t have enough to produce a consistent data set. In our previous study (Scambler et al., 2019), ASC specks formation in CF patient samples correlated with both IL-1βand IL-18 cytokine secretion and intracellular caspase-1 activity. Due to the limited amount of sample available, we chose to look at caspase-1 activity in this study as a read out of NLRP3-inflammasome activation. The reviewer comments will help reshape the design of future studies which we are hoping to undertake as new drugs become available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In subsection “NLRP3 inflammasome activation in patients receiving IVA/LUM or IVA/TEZ therapy” there is a description of mRNA levels in Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 2—figure supplement 4, and Figure 3—figure supplement 3.

Is this related to the mechanism of action of these drugs?</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our discussion on CFTR modulators and their off-target effects. We have also added new references to support each statement.</p><p>“Both LUM and TEZ exert their clinical effects by increasing the processing and trafficking of mature CFTR protein to the cell surface. When combined with the potentiator, IVA, they partially rectify CFTR function and alter CFTR-ENaC coupling, which results in the inhibition of the elevated amiloride-sensitive sodium transport that is characteristic of CF (4, 5). Studies of nasal potential differences and rectal intestinal current measurements (ICM) studies suggest that dual combination therapy rescue Phe508del CFTR, by approximately 10% to 18% of normal, with both drugs having a similar effect on ion transport (24, 25). The disparity in IL-1β secretion was, therefore, surprising and may result from off-target effects, which have been reported with CFTR modulators. For instance, IVA can influence various solute carriers in vitro and reduce the stability of LUM-rescued Phe508del-CFTR (26). Clinically, IVA/LUM has also been associated with unexplained increased respiratory adverse events, which can occur relatively acutely after starting treatment. Symptoms include dyspnoea and chest tightness, features which have not been reported with IVA/TEZ (27). It might also be the case that pharmacokinetics of LUM and TEZ may differ.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) How does the variability in cellular and systemic effects observed in the PBMCs of these patients correlate with the effects of these drugs in vivo? In the Introduction, the authors mention that not all CF patients benefit the same from these drugs and that efficacy varies. From Figure 2—figure supplement 1 it seems that these drugs did not have any effect on CF in these 3 months. Is that as expected? How long does it take for these drugs to see differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We have offered an explanation as to why the systemic effects observed in PBMCs in our study don’t correlate with the patient’s clinical outcomes, in the text below, which has been added into the discussion. We have also added references to support each statement.</p><p>“During this study, combination therapy was only available through a Vertex compassionate use program, with treatment inclusion criteria including lung transplant assessment and a ppFEV1&lt;40%, for at least two months. This is in contrast to reported phase 3 clinical trials which recruited stable patients with significantly higher lung function. In those studies, treatment over a 24-week period resulted in modest but significant improvements in lung function of around 3%, with reduced pulmonary exacerbations and a decrease in annual rate of ppFEV1 decline vs matched controls (28). Furthermore, in adults with severe obstructive lung disease receiving IVA/LUM, significant improvements in FEV1 can be absent in the first six months of treatment (29). While our study was not designed to investigate clinical efficacy, the absence of significant changes in clinical parameters, during our three month study period, was consistent with stable disease rather than a decline in health, as might be expected in a population with severe lung disease.”8) How do the authors think that the different drugs works intracellularly? The authors have tested one hypothesis but any mentioning of this hypothesis or other potential mechanisms is missing in the Discussion section. Are there any future directions to find out how it works? And does this have implications for drug efficacy in reducing CF?</p><p>In the Introduction we have modified the sentence which now reads:</p><p>“We observed CF-specific increases in IL-18, IL-1β, caspase-1 activity, in addition to ASC-speck release, that were all reversed by pre-treatment with epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) and NLRP3-inflammasome inhibitors (2, 3). In this paper, we examine the therapeutic potential of controlling inflammation with CFTR modulators. These small molecules are known to correct CFTR dysfunction and partially restore CFTR-mediated ENaC inhibitory activity (4, 5).”</p><p>Furthermore, in the Discussion section we have added the following statement as indicated in the response to comment 6:</p><p>“Both LUM and TEZ exert their clinical effects by increasing the processing and trafficking of mature CFTR protein to the cell surface. When combined with the potentiator, IVA, they partially rectify CFTR function and alter CFTR-ENaC coupling, which results in the inhibition of the elevated amiloride-sensitive sodium transport that is characteristic of CF (4, 5). Studies of nasal potential differences and rectal intestinal current measurements (ICM) studies suggest that dual combination therapy rescue Phe508del CFTR, by approximately 10% to 18% of normal, with both drugs having a similar effect on ion transport (24, 25).”9) The effects on serum IL-1beta are quite impressive. The lesson to be derived from this is that even when the intervention shows an effect on IL-1beta, this level of the cytokine is still in an inflammatory range. Hence a case could be made (in contrast with what the authors say in the Discussion section) that the clinical effect could be enhanced by combining treatment with anakinra. This point should be discussed in detail.</p><p>We fully agree with the reviewers. We have added the following sentence in the Discussion section.</p><p>“However baseline IL-1β levels remained elevated and additional targeting of the IL-1 receptor, could significantly enhance clinical effect, especially in patients on IVA/LUM where IL-1β was not significantly downregulated.”10) If samples and budget allow, it would be really interesting to perform RNA sequencing on the monocytes of these patients before and after treatment, also to find out pathway differences between the treatments.</p><p>We are unable, at this point, to collect further samples from patients before and after treatment of IVA/LUM and IVA/TEZ. However, RNA sequencing data will be invaluable to our future studies once we are able to extend our budget.</p></body></sub-article></article>
