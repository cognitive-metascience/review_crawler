endocytic cargo to lysosomes in mammalian cells. Here, we report that these functions depend on SPOPL, a substrate-specific CUL3 adaptor. We find that SPOPL associates with endosomes and is required for both the formation of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and the endocytic host cell entry of influenza A virus. In SPOPL-depleted cells, endosomes are enlarged and fail to acquire intraluminal vesicles (ILVs). We identify a critical substrate ubiquitinated by CUL3-SPOPL as EPS15, an endocytic adaptor that also associates with the ESCRT-0 complex members HRS and STAM on endosomes. Indeed, EPS15 is ubiquitinated in a SPOPL-dependent manner, and accumulates with HRS in cells lacking SPOPL. Together, our data indicates that a CUL3-SPOPL E3 ubiquitin ligase complex regulates endocytic trafficking and MVB formation by ubiquitinating and degrading EPS15 at endosomes, thereby influencing influenza A virus infection as well as degradation of EGFR and other EPS15 targets.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13841.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13841.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13841.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Individual cells can move material, collectively referred to as cargo, from the outside environment into the cell interior via a process known as endocytosis. The cell then has different routes to transport the packages of cargo, called endocytic vesicles, to specific locations within the cell. Protein-based molecular machines move the cargo and control how it is selected and targeted to different destinations. For example, a molecular machine that contains a protein called CUL3 labels other components of the system with a chemical tag to regulate the route cargo takes in mammalian cells. However, it was not clear how CUL3 can selectively attach the chemical labels.</p><p>Gschweitl, Ulbricht et al. have now found that another protein called SPOPL provides selectivity for the CUL3-based machine during endocytosis in human cells. The experiments show that SPOPL attaches to endocytic vesicles, and that CUL3 and SPOPL work together to label a specific component of these vesicles called EPS15. The label changes how EPS15 interacts with other proteins. When SPOPL is not present in a cell, EPS15 is unnaturally stable and occupies many of the routes used by endocytic cargos. The cargo directly interacting with EPS15 is then routed on the fast lane to its destination, while other cargo accumulate in a kind of molecular traffic jam.</p><p>Other proteins like SPOPL are specific for the endocytic system. Exchange of SPOPL with these similar proteins in the CUL3 machine is likely to chemically label a different set of endocytic proteins. Gschweitl, Ulbricht et al.’s next challenge is to identify the selectivity, targeting and coordination of these exchangeable components in the endocytic system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Endocytic trafficking is an essential cellular process for nutrition absorption, signal transduction, cell-cell communication and maintenance of cell homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Doherty and McMahon, 2009</xref>). Endocytosis is used for the uptake of exogenous and cellular cargo, including many viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cossart and Helenius, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edinger et al., 2014</xref>) or a cohort of plasma membrane proteins such as the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) with their respective ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tomas et al., 2014</xref>). Cargo entering the endosomal system can be delivered via early (EE) and late endosomes (LE) to lysosomes (LY) for degradation, or alternatively, recycled back to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maxfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wandinger-Ness and Zerial, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Transfer of cargo from EEs to LYs depends on an endosomal maturation process that involves a variety of protein- and lipid-based remodeling events. They include a small GTPase RAB5-to-RAB7 switch, a PtdIns(3)P to PtdIns(3,5)P<sub>2</sub> conversion, and changes in the luminal ion concentrations, most notably a decrease in pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huotari and Helenius, 2011</xref>). Together these changes prepare the endosomes for fusion with other LEs and LYs. Endosome maturation also involves sorting of membrane cargo destined for degradation into intraluminal vesicles (ILVs), thereby generating late endosomal vacuoles referred to as multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piper and Katzmann, 2007</xref>).</p><p>Ubiquitin has emerged as an important regulator of endocytosis and cargo degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clague et al., 2012</xref>). It serves as a signal for membrane quality control, endocytic internalization, endosome maturation, and cargo sorting into ILVs by the endosomal sorting complexes required for transport (ESCRTs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Piper et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, ubiquitination is indispensable for the interaction of EGFR with the ESCRT-0 complex member HRS and thus for efficient lysosomal targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eden et al., 2012</xref>). Specific deubiquitination enzymes (DUBs) like AMSH and UBPY associate with ESCRT components to cleave and recycle ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alwan and van Leeuwen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meijer et al., 2012</xref>). Ubiquitination also regulates the machinery involved in molecular sorting and the ILV formation, although this regulatory layer is less understood.</p><p>In a recent study, we observed that Cullin-3 (CUL3) is involved in regulating endosome maturation and endo-lysosomal trafficking in mammalian cells. In CUL3-depleted cells, late endosomes fail to mature properly. They are enlarged and often devoid of ILVs. EGFR degradation is delayed and its ligand EGF accumulates in LE/LYs. Moreover, the cells are resistant to influenza A virus (IAV) infection because instead of delivering their capsid components to the cytosol and the nucleus, the endocytosed virus particles remain associated with immature LE vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huotari et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>CUL3 is the scaffolding subunit common for a large subfamily of Cullin-RING E3 ubiquitin ligases (CRLs) that mainly use the RING-H2 finger protein RBX1 to recruit charged ubiquitin conjugating enzymes (E2s) and catalyse the transfer of ubiquitin onto substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lydeard et al., 2013</xref>). This is stimulated by the conjugation of the ubiquitin-like protein NEDD8 to the cullin subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Duda et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Saha and Deshaies, 2008</xref>) through an enzymatic cascade analogous to ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Enchev et al., 2015</xref>). CUL3 may be activated at endosomes by DCNL3, an E3 ligase for NEDD8, known to associate with membranes by virtue of a covalent lipid modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Meyer-Schaller et al., 2009</xref>). CRL activity is further modulated by deneddylation as well as non-catalytically by the COP9 signalosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Emberley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>In addition to CUL3, RBX1, and NEDD8, the CRL3 complexes contain a subunit that binds to CUL3 through a Bric-a-brac/Tramtrack/Broad (BTB) domain. The BTB domain-containing proteins possess diverse substrate recognition domains and function as CRL3-specific substrate adaptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pintard et al., 2004</xref>). There are about 150 different BTB domain-containing proteins in the human proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Stogios et al., 2005</xref>), indicating that a large cohort of CRL3 substrates exists, most of which are presently unidentified.</p><p>To gain mechanistic insight into the role of CRL3 in endocytic trafficking, we identified relevant BTB-adaptors by siRNA screening. We found that cells depleted of the BTB-adaptor Speckle-type POZ protein-like (SPOPL) were defective for IAV infection and showed aberrant late endosomal vacuoles resembling those observed after CUL3 depletion. Although SPOPL shares 81% sequence identity with the tumor driver Speckle-type POZ protein (SPOP) and these two adaptors dimerize in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errington et al., 2012</xref>), only SPOPL was found to associate with endosomes. We identified the endocytic adaptor EPS15 as a critical substrate of the CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> complex. Our results indicated that EPS15 ubiquitination by CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> is needed for efficient intraluminal vesicle formation during endosome maturation as well as for uncoating of IAV capsids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Influenza A virus infection and uncoating are dependent on the CRL3 substrate adaptor SPOPL</title><p>To identify the BTB-domain containing CRL3 substrate-adaptors involved in endosome maturation, we took advantage of the observation that IAV depends on CUL3 activity for cell entry and infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huotari et al., 2012</xref>). We performed siRNA screening in the lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 depleted for 130 human BTB-containing proteins using expression of the viral nuclear protein (NP) as read-out after IAV addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Depletion of 14 BTB proteins caused 50% or greater decrease in the number of IAV infected cells. Previously described assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Banerjee et al., 2013</xref>) were used to determine which step in the infection pathway was inhibited, including virus binding to cells, endocytic uptake, acid-conversion of viral hemagglutinin (HA), penetration by fusion, uncoating of the viral capsid, and nuclear import of the viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs). Out of 14 primary hits, we decided to follow up the BTB proteins SPOP and SPOPL because their depletion gave a phenotype of defective virus uncoating similar to that observed after CUL3 depletion. The other BTB-proteins identified in this screen were required for different steps of efficient IAV infection, and will be studied elsewhere.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13841.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The CRL3 substrate adaptors SPOP and SPOPL are crucial for influenza A virus (IAV) infection and uncoating.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) siRNA screen workflow for BTB adaptor proteins with similar IAV infection phenotypes as CUL3 (left).

They reduced the respective target gene expression efficiently as judged by quantitative RT-PCR. Notably, SPOP depletion also influenced mRNA levels of SPOPL, but not vice versa. Immunoblotting using a home-made, affinity-purified antibody specific for SPOPL confirmed downregulation of SPOPL at the protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Knockdown of SPOP or SPOPL with the siRNAs resulted in a reduction of viral NP expression in A549 and HeLa cells to levels comparable to CUL3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), but not as strong as upon depletion of a vATPase subunit (siATP6V1B2). As expected, cells that were depleted of either SPOP or SPOPL showed a block in IAV uncoating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). As a consequence, subsequent nuclear import of NP was also impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Aside from virus binding to the cell surface, which was elevated in SPOPL-depleted cells, we found that endocytosis, acidification and fusion of the viral particles were comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>).</p><p>The defects in IAV uncoating and nuclear import of vRNPs in SPOP or SPOPL-depleted cells were rescued by a brief acidic incubation of virus bound to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This is known to induce direct fusion of the viral particle at the plasma membrane, thus bypassing to some extent the need for endocytic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stauffer et al., 2014</xref>).

When visualized by the marker GFP-RAB5 using live cell imaging, early endosomes appeared normal in SPOPL-depleted cells compared to control siRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, the late endosomal system as monitored by GFP-RAB7 was severely distorted when SPOPL was depleted by a siRNA or a shRNA construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Moreover, the endosome-to-Golgi transport marker GFP-RAB9 revealed strongly enlarged vacuoles upon SPOPL depletion as well, implying a broad effect of SPOPL on the late endosomal transport system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Qualitative EM analysis of SPOPL-depleted cells showed that endosomal vacuoles were empty or contained little dense material and few ILVs were detectable compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

In contrast to SPOP, depletion of SPOPL caused changes in late endocytic markers, in particular the MVB markers EPS15, HRS, STAM and TSG101. The level of most early endocytic and recycling markers did not change (Clathrin, EPSIN1, Caveolin, Calnexin, RAB11). Notable, out of the tested receptors, EGFR and MET revealed significant level changes, while levels of VEGFR, IGF1R and HER2 - a close relative of EGFR - were not altered.</p><p>We purified endosomes from whole cell lysates and further fractionated them by density gradient centrifugation.

This analysis identified several ubiquitination sites in EPS15 including K693 and K801 that were ubiquitinated irrespective of the presence or absence of SPOPL. In contrast, ubiquitination of K793, located in the C-terminal domain of EPS15 close to the ubiquitin-interacting motifs (UIMs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), was significantly reduced in cells lacking SPOPL.</p><p>The MATH domains of SPOP and SPOPL are very similar and, in the case of SPOP, known to be responsible for substrate recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errington et al., 2012</xref>).

Indeed, the steady-state levels of EPS15<sup>S744-746A</sup>-GFP were increased at least six fold, concomitant with decreased EGFR levels, and no further increase of EPS15<sup>S744-746A</sup>-GFP levels was detected by simultaneously depleting SPOPL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, we analysed the EPS15<sup>K793R</sup> mutant, in which in addition to the lysine 793 the neighboring lysine 788 was mutated to an arginine to prevent spurious ubiquitination.

EPS15 not only promotes EGFR uptake via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, but it is also localized in places of intracellular sorting and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gucwa and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009</xref>). We used super resolution microscopy in structured illumination mode to localize EPS15 in SPOPL-depleted cells and controls. While EPS15 at the plasma membrane was unaffected by SPOPL depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), EPS15 accumulated in intracellular structures upon SPOPL-depletion and increasingly co-localized with the ESCRT-0 subunit HRS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The number and size of the EPS15-containing vesicles was unaffected suggesting that SPOPL-dependent ubiquitination of EPS15 is required to remove it from ESCRT-0 complexes. Because HRS is necessary for cargo sorting into the ESCRT pathway for MVB formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bache, 2003</xref>), it is plausible that the prolonged co-localization of EPS15 with HRS in the absence of SPOPL results in enhanced EGFR sorting to the lysosome. Indeed, the interaction of EPS15 and EGFR is reduced in SPOPL-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), while the interaction of EPS15 and HRS is stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), consistent with the idea that EPS15 ubiquitination promotes EGFR stabilization. Additionally, we did not detect enhanced EGFR colocalization with recycling endosomes marked by RAB11, although RAB11 staining is elevated in siSPOPL-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

After SPOPL depletion, the endocytic internalization of the exogenous cargo IAV and the cellular cargo EGF was not inhibited, the morphology and function of EEs appeared to be normal. However, the formation of LEs was compromised. RAB7 positive endosomes were enlarged and failed to acquire ILVs. We identified the endocytic adaptor protein EPS15 as a direct ubiquitination target of CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup>. Upon SPOPL depletion, EPS15 was enriched in endosomes co-localizing with the ESCRT-0 complex subunit HRS. Taken together, the results indicated that SPOPL together with CUL3 regulates the endosome pathway by ubiquitinating EPS15 and inducing its degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The degradation of EPS15 is required for ILV formation and possibly other aspects of endosome maturation. The immature LEs can support IAV acidification and penetration by membrane fusion but not uncoating of the capsids, a process that occurs on the cytosolic surface of LEs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> regulates EPS15 function at LEs via ubiquitination</title><p>EPS15 was originally identified as a substrate for the EGFR kinase that interacts with the clathrin assembly adaptors AP2 and EPSIN1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmerah et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fazioli et al., 1993</xref>). EPS15 possesses four domains: a N-terminal domain with three EH motifs, a central coiled-coil domain involved in dimerization, and a C-terminal regulatory domain with the AP2-binding site followed by two UIM motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Bergen en Henegouwen, 2009</xref>). Perturbation of EPS15 and EPSIN1 function blocks endocytosis of EGF and transferrin, demonstrating that they are part of the primary endocytic machinery at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carbone et al., 1997</xref>). In addition, EPS15 promotes vesicular trafficking intracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yuan et al., 2014</xref>). Overexpression of shorter isoforms (EPS15S, EPS15B) determines cargo recycling or degradation at endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Roxrud et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>EPS15 is moreover known to associate with the E3-ligases NEDD4 and Parkin (PARK2) and is mono-ubiquitinated by them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fallon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Polo et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Woelk et al., 2006</xref>). The putative E3 binding sites for these ligases are located in the extreme C-terminal end of the EPS15 regulatory domain close to the UIMs. The binding sites are distinct from the TSSSV motif required for interaction with SPOPL. Several ubiquitination sites have been reported in EPS15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Savio et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wagner et al., 2011</xref>) and most of them are not affected by downregulation of SPOPL in vivo as observed in our mass-spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). That different E3 ligases appear to ubiquitinate EPS15 in distinct sites, may have to do with its fate in different subcellular locations and/or with response to distinct signals.</p><p>Our findings support previous reports that ubiquitination inhibits the functions of EPS15. For example, a single ubiquitin in the C-terminal domain reduces binding of EPS15 to free ubiquitin thus impairing association with ubiquitinated client proteins and co-localization with EGFR on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoeller et al., 2006</xref>). Our own data shows that ubiquitination by the CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> complex inhibits EPS15 function in endosome maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). In this case, ubiquitination may control the timing and duration of EPS15 interaction with ESCRT-0, which in turn may influence ILV formation and the efficiency of lysosomal sorting and degradation of EGFR and other targets. It may also prevent the remodeling of the endosomal limiting membrane during endosome maturation, leading to loss of components needed for uncoating of incoming IAV capsids.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>EPS15 regulates EGFR trafficking at several steps</title><p>EPS15 forms a trimeric complex with the ESCRT components HRS and STAM and interacts with EGFR and HRS 30 min after EGF uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bache, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sigismund et al., 2005</xref>) Upon HRS depletion, EPS15 accumulates on endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gucwa and Brown, 2014</xref>). Our results showed that SPOPL depletion promotes endosomal co-localization of EPS15 with HRS. This implies that EPS15 association with HRS is important for EPS15 turnover and for targeting of the EGFR to lysosomes for degradation.</p><p>That EPS15 accumulates on ubiquitin-enriched endosomes suggests that in addition to HRS it is recruited by ubiquitinated clients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gucwa and Brown, 2014</xref>). A change in the phosphorylation state of EPS15 - either due to the mutation EPS15-Y850F or overexpression of the phosphatase PTPN3 – results in faster degradation of EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate that EPS15 promotes sorting of ubiquitinated EGFR at endosomes by interacting with HRS. Because upon SPOPL depletion EPS15 accumulates on HRS-containing vesicles and EGFR degradation is accelerated, we propose that the EPS15-HRS complexes actively promote sorting of EPS15 clients such as the EGFR and MET to lysosomes.</p><p>Interestingly, recent findings further demonstrate that EPS15 de-ubiquitination by USP9X affects EGFR internalization and its trafficking to lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Savio et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast to SPOPL depletion, the depletion of USP9X leads to slower degradation of EGFR. Therefore, it is evident that a cycle of ubiquitination / de-ubiquitination of EPS15 not only regulates the internalization pathway, but is also involved in the sorting of cargo in LEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Ubiquitination may increase EPS15 turnover in endosomes. This may first involve EPS15 binding to its own UIM domains followed by poly-ubiquitination to target EPS15 for proteasomal degradation. While SPOPL-depletion promotes the HRS- and ESCRT-dependent fast-forward sorting route for EPS15 client cargo, other sorting processes may be inhibited due to depletion of the ESCRT processing machinery. Indeed, ILV formation is a dynamic and tightly regulated process that involves recycling of the ESCRT components by VPS4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babst et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sachse, 2004</xref>). It is evident that ILV formation depends on SPOPL, and that loss of available ESCRT complexes due to loss of CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> activity prevents the reduction in the surface area of the endosomal limiting membrane. This is reflected in both the lack of ILVs and the apparent size-increase in LEs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The defect in IAV entry is caused by incomplete endosome maturation</title><p>The inhibition of IAV entry after SPOPL-depletion was similar to our previous observations with CUL3-depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huotari et al., 2012</xref>). This late penetrating virus was endocytosed normally and reached a late endosomal compartment acidic enough to induce HA-conversion and membrane fusion/hemifusion. However, the uncoating process that involves dissociation of the matrix protein M1 shell and release of the vRNPs from the endosome did not take place. Recent studies have indicated that uncoating of IAV capsids is a complex process that requires priming of the viral capsid prior to fusion by exposure to low pH and potassium ions in the lumen of endosomes as well as the function of the ubiquitin-vacuolar protein sorting system and interaction with a number of host cell factors in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banerjee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Khor et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin and Helenius, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stauffer et al., 2014</xref>). While we found that acidification of IAV occurred in the absence of SPOPL and CUL3, it is possible that the exposure to an elevated potassium concentration in late endosomes did not take place. It is also possible that cellular factors associated with LE membrane and needed for uncoating, such as the E3 ligase ITCH, did not associate with immature endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Su et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, the EGFR level could be crucial for IAV entry, since EGFR signaling is required for efficient IAV infection. Available evidence suggests that virus binding leads to lipid-raft clustering, which activates EGFR and other RTKs and facilitates IAV uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional CUL3 E3 ligase complexes are most likely active in the endocytic system</title><p>Given the strong homology between SPOPL and SPOP particularly in the MATH-domain, it is surprising that their subcellular localizations diverge, with SPOPL localizing to endosomes and preferentially ubiquitinating EPS15 in vivo. SPOP and SPOPL mainly differ by a 18 amino-acid insertion in SPOPL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errington et al., 2012</xref>) that may be responsible for their distinct subcellular localization, which likely underlies the observed substrate specificity. SPOP and SPOPL have also been shown to form heterodimers, and in vitro experiments have suggested that SPOPL may inhibit SPOP activity by attenuating self assembly in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errington et al., 2012</xref>). It will be important therefore to identify additional SPOP and SPOPL substrates, and further test the functional interaction of SPOP and SPOPL in physiological settings.</p><p>While we could demonstrate that CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> directly ubiquitinates EPS15, it is likely that SPOPL regulates additional substrates at endosomes. That EPS15, STAM, and to a lesser extent HRS levels were increased in SPOPL-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) raises the possibility that CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> directly or indirectly affects these ESCRT components.</p><p>Finally, it is clear that CUL3 must modify additional targets relevant for endocytic trafficking. Indeed, downregulation of SPOPL decreases EGFR levels, whereas CUL3-depletion results in greatly elevated levels of EGFR, most likely due to a reduced ability of endosomes to fuse with lysosomes. Our RNAi screen identified BTB-adaptors other then SPOPL, and a subset of them showed increased EGFR levels mimicking those defects associated with CUL3 (MG, AU and MP, unpublished results). Detailed analysis of these adaptors may shed light on additional functions of CUL3 at late stages of endocytosis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and RNAi-screening</title><p>HeLa Kyoto were kindly provided by Daniel Gerlich, A549 were obtained from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC), HeLa FRT cells were a kind gift of Stephen Taylor and HEK-293 FRT were bought from Life Technologies.

Beads were washed 4x at RT with binding buffer, and bound proteins eluted with either 20 mM glutathione in binding buffer or 100 mM Glycine pH 2.0 at RT. Eluates were immediately mixed with 4x LDS and DTT, boiled and analyzed by Coomassie Staining or immunoblotting.</p><p>Cullin-3 and RBX1 used for in vitro ubiquitination reactions were purified together as a complex from insect cells, and neddylated in vitro using purified components as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Orthwein et al., 2015</xref>). 0.5 μM CUL3-NEDD8-RBX1, 0.6 μM SPOPL, 0.2 μM UbE1 (Boston Biochem), 0.7 μM E2 (CDC34 or UBCH5B, produced as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enchev et al., 2012</xref>), 50 μM Ubiquitin (Boston Biochem) and 2 μM EPS15 were incubated in the presence of ATP for various times at 37°C.

Cell pellets were washed with ice-cold PBS and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen prior to lysis and digestion. After quickly thawing, pellets were resuspended in Urea lysis buffer (ULB) containing 9 M urea, 50 mM Ammonium Bicarbonate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, and 1 mM β-glycerophosphate such that the final protein concentration would be less than 5 mg/ml. A Branson 250 tip sonicator was used for lysis (power output of 15, duty cycle of 70%, 3 rounds sonication, cooling on ice between cycles) and the lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 20,000 rcf (g) for 15 min at 15°C. Reduction with 10 mM tris(2-carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP) was performed at RT for 30 min followed by alkylation with 20 mM iodoacetamide with the pH maintained at 7.5 and incubation for 30 min at RT protected from light. Samples were then diluted to 4 M urea with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate buffer (pH 8) and digested with LysC (1:100) in a shaking incubator at 37°C for 4 hr. Finally, each digest was diluted to a final concentration of 1 M urea with 100 mM ammonium bicarbonate and sequencing grade trypsin was added at 1:100 dilution for overnight digestion at 37°C in a shaking incubator. The next morning, the trypsin reaction was stopped by formic acid (FA) addition to a final concentration of 1% (pH &lt;3) and samples were placed on ice for 15 min for precipitation. Lysates were centrifuged at 2000 rcf (g) for 15 min at RT, desalted on c18 columns with 20 mg capacity and bound peptides were washed sequentially with 1 ml, 5 ml, and 6 ml of 0.1% FA in dH<sub>2</sub>O followed by 2 ml of 2% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% FA in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Finally, peptides were eluted with 3 x 3 ml 50% ACN in 0.1% FA in dH<sub>2</sub>O and lyophilized for 48 hr to remove all of the FA.</p><p>Immunoprecipitation of K-ε-GG modified peptides was carried out with an antibody-based system essentially as described in the Cell Signaling Technology, Inc. standard protocol for the PTMScan UbiScan kit. Eluted K-ε-GG peptides were desalted on self-packed StageTips as follows: StageTips were equilibrated with 50 μl 50% ACN in 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in dH<sub>2</sub>O (1x) followed by 50 μl dH<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% TFA (2x). Samples were loaded in two steps loading 50 μl each time and passing the solution through with a centrifuge at 2000 rcf (g) for 30 s. The bound peptides were washed with 55 μl dH<sub>2</sub>O with 0.1% TFA (2x) and eluted with 10 μl 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA in dH<sub>2</sub>O followed by a second elution pooled with the first of 20 μl 50% acetonitrile (ACN) in 0.1% TFA in dH<sub>2</sub>O. Solvents were evaporated in a thermal vacuum centrifuge to ~1 μl and the final peptide product was resuspended in 10 μl 2% ACN in 0.1% TFA in dH<sub>2</sub>O for analysis by LC-MS/MS on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Q-Exactive Plus in data-dependent analysis (DDA) mode. For this, peptides were separated on an EASY-nLC 1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled to a 15 cm fused silica emitter (75 μm inside diameter). The analytical column was packed with ReproSil-Pur C18-AQ 120 Å and 1.9 μm resin (Dr. Maisch HPLC GmbH) and peptides were separated with a 120 min gradient that went from 2%–35% acetonitrile in water with 0.1% formic acid. A top 12 method was used for DDA acquisition within a mass range of 300–1700 m/z using higher energy collisional dissociation (HCD) for peptide fragmentation resulting in high resolution MS/MS data for analysis.</p><p>Raw files were converted to mzXML using msconvert and searched with Comet as part of the TransProteomicPipeline version 4.7.0. Peptides were filtered for a 1% false discovery rate based on their peptide prophet scores and Skyline version 2.6.0 was used to integrate the area under the MS1 chromatography peaks to generate label-free quantification information. To do this, chromatographic traces were aligned for each quantified peak and integration areas were refined manually for multiple peptides of interest. For this, chromatographic traces were aligned and peak areas selected manually for the peptides of interest.</p><p>In this study, three modified EPS15 peptides were analyzed with the following sequences: Lys 693 (K693) IDPFGGDPFK*GSDPFASD<underline>C</underline>FFR, Lys 793 (K793) RSINK*LDSPDPFK, and Lys 801 (K801) LDSPDPFK*LNDPFQPFPGNDSPK. As controls, a peptide containing modified Lys 113 (K113) of β Actin (VAPEEHPVLLTEAPLNPK*ANR) and the polyubiquitin linkage peptide corresponding to Lys 11 (K11) of ubiquitin (TLTGK*TITLEVEPSDTIENVK) were quantified (K* = K-ε-GG modification; <underline>C</underline> = carbamidomethyl-modified cysteine). The results reported here represent biological triplicate experiments of RNAi depletion of SPOPL compared to siControl performed on separate days. Each data point within each biological replicate represents the results from technical replicate LC-MS/MS injections. Normalization for MS intensity variations between runs was performed by setting the value of the siControl for each individual biological replicate pair to 1 and scaling the RNAi depletion condition to this set value. Final reported results are the mean ± SD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Antibodies, drugs and siRNAs</title><p>The following antibodies were used in this study: anti-Actin (Millipore, MAB1501R, 1:1000 in WB), anti-AP2 (adaptin alpha)/(BD Transduction, 610502, 1:1000 in WB), anti-CUL3 (described in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sumara et al., 2007</xref>), 1:1000 in WB), anti-Clathrin (BD Biosciences, 610499, 1:3000 in WB), anti-EEA1 (BD Transduction 610457, 1:2500 in WB, 1:200 in IF), anti-EGFR (Millipore, 06–847, 1:1000 for WB, 1:500 in IF; or Biolegend, 352901, 1:200 in IF), anti-EPS15 mouse (BD Transduction, 610807, 1:250 in WB, 1:50 in IF), anti-EPS15 rabbit (Santa Cruz, sc-534, 1:200 in WB, 1:50 in IF), anti-GAPDH (Sigma G8795, 1:5000 in WB), anti-GFP (Roche, 11 814 460 001, 1:1000 in WB), anti-H4 (Abcam, ab16483, 1:1000 in WB), anti-HA.11 (Covance, MMS-101R, mouse, 1:1000 in WB and IF), anti-HRS (Sigma, WH0009146M1, 1:1000 in WB, 1:500 in IF), anti-LAMP1 (Santa Cruz, sc-20011 (mouse), 1:1000 in WB, 1:200 in IF or Abcam (rabbit) ab24170, 1:1000 in WB), anti-RAB11 (Sigma, R5903, 1:200 in IF), anti-SPOPL (rabbit polyclonal antibody raised against the N-terminal SPOPL peptide MSREPTPPLPGDMST+C and a SPOPL middle region peptide CKDGKNWNSNQATDIM and affinity-purified with the recombinantly expressed and purified SPOPL protein, 1:500 in WB), anti-SPOP (Abcam, ab81163, 1:500 in WB), anti-STAM (Santa Cruz, SC-133093, 1:500 in WB), anti-Tubulin (Sigma, T5168, 1:10000 in WB), anti-mouse IgG (H+L) CF405S (Biotum, BI-20080, 1:1000 in IF), anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor568 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, A-11036, 1:1000 in IF) and anti-K-ε-GG antibody (Cell Signaling Technology, cat. no. 5562).</p><p>Furthermore, following antibodies were used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>: anti-Calnexin (kindly provided by Ari Helenius), anti-Caveolin 1 (Santa Cruz, sc-894, 1:500 in WB), anti-CHMP6 (Sigma, SAB2701297, 1:1000 in WB), anti-EPS15R1(Novus Biologicals, NB100-88149, 1:500 in WB), anti-EPSIN1 (Santa Cruz, sc-8673, 1:500 in WB), anti-HER2 (Cell Signaling, 2165, 1:500 in WB), anti-IGF1R (R&amp;D Systems, MAB301, 1:1000 in WB), anti-LC3 (Novus Biologicals, NB600-1384, 1:1000 in WB), anti-MET (Santa Cruz, sc-10, 1:1000 in WB), anti-RAB7 (Cell Signaling, 9367, 1:1000 in WB), anti-SQSTM1 (American Research Products Inc., 03-GP62-C, 1:1000 in WB), anti-TSG101 (Novus Biologicals, NB200-112, 1:500 in WB), anti-VEGFR3 (Millipore, MAB3757, 1:500 in WB)</p><p>The following chemicals were used in this study: MG132 (Sigma, 1 – 5 μM final conc.), Bafilomycin A (BafA, Sigma, 50 nM final conc.), Cyclohexamide (CHX, Sigma, 10 μM – 1 mM final conc. dependent on assay), MLN-4924 (Active Biochem, 10 μM final conc.) and Chloroquine (CQ, Sigma, C6628, 20 μM final conc.).</p><p>All siRNAs were ordered from Qiagen, and their Allstar-negative and Allstar-death siRNAs were used for controls.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Ivan Dikic (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wade Harper, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and another is Jason MacGurn.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Your paper has now been seen by three reviewers. Overall, the reviewers think the paper is potentially interesting and appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> but in its current form falls short of what is necessary. In particular, the findings presented do not result in a clear and coherent model for the molecular function of the Cul3-SPOPL E3 ubiquitin ligase with respect to endosomal trafficking. In particular, the observation that SPOPL is required for MVB formation and for IAV entry, but EGFR is trafficked to the lysosome for degradation more rapidly in SPOPL-depleted cells suggests a significant disconnect in terms of the mechanisms proposed. The authors do attempt to address this apparent discrepancy in the Discussion (subsection “EPS15 regulates EGFR trafficking at several steps”, last paragraph) by suggesting that increased interaction between EPS15 and ESCRT-0 in SPOPL-depleted cells may enhance the trafficking of EPS15-interacting cargo (like EGFR) at the expense of other EPS15-independent cargos (presumably IAV). This seems like a reasonable hypothesis – and it is intriguing to speculate that Cul3-SPOPL could regulate cargo flux into the MVB pathway along a specific route – but there are many other observations that complicate this interpretation. For example, the morphological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and alterations to the abundance of multiple trafficking proteins (EEA1, HRS, STAM, EPS15, LAMP1, AP-2, almost every piece of trafficking machinery they probe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggest gross trafficking defects along the endocytic route. This is further complicated by the observation that depletion of SPOPL does not phenocopy depletion of CUL3 with respect to EGFR trafficking – and in fact results in an opposite trafficking phenotype.</p><p>So ultimately, the paper needs further work to elucidate a coherent mechanism. After discussions between the reviewers, we feel that the following experiments and improvements would help clarify the underlying mechanisms.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In the paper, you speculate that increased EPS15 engagement of ESCRT-0 simultaneously promotes EGFR trafficking to the lysosome but abrogates trafficking of cargo that don't engage EPS15. You could test this by knocking down SPOPL in a context where EPS15 cannot engage HRS (either a binding mutant or an EPS15 knockdown), which should restore the trafficking of non-EPS15 cargo. For example, coordinate knockdown of SPOPL and EPS15 should restore IAV infectivity/uncoating. Such an experiment would demonstrate that the observed trafficking defects are indeed dependent on excessive engagement of ESCRT-0 by EPS15.</p><p>2) Analysis of the trafficking of additional EPS15-dependent and EPS15-independent cargo would improve your ability to draw conclusions about general vs. specific trafficking defects.</p><p>3) The fact that every trafficking component probed exhibits altered stability when SPOPL is depleted is both interesting and problematic – since altered stability/abundance of factors like AP-2 could have severe trafficking consequences. To address the concern that the global membrane trafficking network is grossly perturbed in the absence of SPOPL and CUL3, you may consider probing how loss of Cul3-SPOPL affects trafficking more broadly (clathrin, EPS15R, epsins, other ESCRT components, GGAs, etc.). This would not need to be exhaustive, but it could reveal key insights into just how grossly perturbed trafficking is in these cells.</p><p>4) It would improve the paper to gain a sense of what is driving the de-stabilization of these factors in the absence of SPOPL. When SPOPL is depleted, is the decreased stability of other trafficking factors (LAMP1, AP-2) proteasome- or lysosome-dependent? (Presumably this is not mediated by some other CUL3 complex since loss of CUL3 also destabilized AP2.)</p><p>5) Some experiments still rely too heavily on overexpressed proteins. Further analysis using endogenous proteins is needed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, it is critical to show that treatment of MG132 or MLN4924 can elevate protein levels of endogenous EPS15. Also demonstrating physical association of EPS15 and SPOPL at endogenous protein levels is needed.</p><p>6) An analysis of the EPS15 mutant that cannot be ubiquitylated is needed to further understand the mechanisms involved and to fully demonstrate a role for SPOPL-dependent EPS15 ubiquitylation in the phenotypes observed.</p><p>7) Finally, the presentation of the RNAi screen is sub-optimal in that the identities of the other BTB proteins are not being revealed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13841.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Summary:</italic></p><p> <italic>Your paper has now been seen by three reviewers.

The authors do attempt to address this apparent discrepancy in the Discussion (subsection “EPS15 regulates EGFR trafficking at several steps”, last paragraph) by suggesting that increased interaction between EPS15 and ESCRT-0 in SPOPL-depleted cells may enhance the trafficking of EPS15-interacting cargo (like EGFR) at the expense of other EPS15-independent cargos (presumably IAV). This seems like a reasonable hypothesis – and it is intriguing to speculate that Cul3-SPOPL could regulate cargo flux into the MVB pathway along a specific route – but there are many other observations that complicate this interpretation. For example, the morphological data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and alterations to the abundance of multiple trafficking proteins (EEA1, HRS, STAM, EPS15, LAMP1, AP-2, almost every piece of trafficking machinery they probe in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) suggest gross trafficking defects along the endocytic route. This is further complicated by the observation that depletion of SPOPL does not phenocopy depletion of CUL3 with respect to EGFR trafficking – and in fact results in an opposite trafficking phenotype.</italic> </p><p>We agree, the observation that IAV infection is impaired while EGFR degradation is increased upon SPOPL depletion seems puzzling at first. As suggested, we have thus expanded the analysis of trafficking pathways in cells lacking SPOPL. Interestingly, our data now show that SPOPL depletion does not cause gross perturbations of the endosomal system but that SPOPL has rather specific effects on EPS15-dependent cargo and MVB homeostasis (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). IAV infection relies on proper MVB formation, but also on EGFR turnover. In fact, depletion of EGFR alone strongly impairs IAV infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>), and it is thus not surprising that regulation of EGFR trafficking by CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> has a strong impact on IAV infection.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13841.015</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>EGFR depletion inhibits influenza A virus uncoating.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.13841.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.13841.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-13841-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>We observe that binding of EPS15 and HRS is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E, F</xref>), while the interaction between EPS15 and EGFR is decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>), implying that EPS15 ubiquitination enhances EGFR degradation by altering its binding properties to EGFR. Supporting this hypothesis, it was recently shown that the DUB enzyme USP9X deubiquitinates EPS15 and increases its on/off binding dynamics to EGFR, thereby similarly enhancing EGFR degradation (Savio et al., 2016). Together, these data provide strong support that ubiquitination of EPS15 by CRL3<sup>SPOPL</sup> and de-ubiquitination by USP9X orchestrate EGFR trafficking to lysosomes at MVBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>Most of the trafficking defects are shared in cells depleted for CUL3 and SPOPL, with the notable exception of EGFR. Indeed, EGFR levels increase in cells depleted for CUL3 or treated with the CRL-inhibitor MLN-4924, but decrease in cells depleted for SPOPL. This phenotypic difference is however not surprising, since unlike SPOPL, CUL3 regulates several additional steps required for IAV infection. In fact, as shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, we identified many CUL3 adaptor proteins that influence IAV infection and might have an impact on endocytosis. Thus, while SPOPL regulates later steps of cargo delivery to LE / lysosomes, other adaptors might influence cargo uptake or other trafficking steps not affected by SPOPL. Therefore, depletion of CUL3 might inhibit EGFR degradation at other steps, while SPOPL specifically regulates the fate of EGFR at late endosomes/MVB formation. In summary, the observed difference in EGFR degradation in CUL3 and SPOPL depleted cells does not indicate that SPOPL functions independently of CUL3, but rather that CUL3 uses adaptors other than SPOPL to regulate additional steps that block EGFR trafficking to lysosomes (Huotari et al., 2012). Further studies are thus needed to unravel the molecular function of the here listed CUL3 adaptors for endocytosis, EGFR trafficking and IAV infection.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions: 1) In the paper, you speculate that increased EPS15 engagement of ESCRT-0 simultaneously promotes EGFR trafficking to the lysosome but abrogates trafficking of cargo that don't engage EPS15. You could test this by knocking down SPOPL in a context where EPS15 cannot engage HRS (either a binding mutant or an EPS15 knockdown), which should restore the trafficking of non-EPS15 cargo. For example, coordinate knockdown of SPOPL and EPS15 should restore IAV infectivity/uncoating. Such an experiment would demonstrate that the observed trafficking defects are indeed dependent on excessive engagement of ESCRT-0 by EPS15.</italic> As suggested by the reviewers, we performed additional experiments. The result supports the model of an excessive engagement of ESCRT-0 with EPS15 in SPOPL-depleted cells. We could now demonstrate that a simultaneous knockdown of EPS15 and SPOPL partially restores EGFR levels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), supporting the notion that SPOPL regulates EPS15 sorting function at late endosomes/MVB’s. We also tried to rescue IAV infection/uncoating by co-depleting EPS15 and SPOPL. However, EPS15 depletion alone already caused a significant reduction in IAV infection (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2A</xref>) indicating a broader function in endocytic traffic. Indeed, upon depletion of EPS15 we observed an increase in the ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-I components HRS, STAM and TSG101 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2B</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, LDL trafficking was impaired and late endosomes were strongly enlarged upon EPS15 depletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that EPS15 is not only responsible for cargo recognition and delivery to multivesicular bodies but also for the formation of ILV and proper late endosomal biogenesis itself. Not surprisingly therefore, double knockdown of SPOPL and EPS15 does not rescue IAV infection but instead has an additive effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2C</xref>). Even if HRS and STAM are freed from EPS15 during SPOPL depletion, IAV infection will still be inhibited due to broader changes in endosomal traffic caused by EPS15 depletion. We thus believe that this new data identified EPS15 as a critical factor in not only cargo internalization but also late endosomal progression. This underlines the importance of regulation of endosome maturation by SPOPL.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.13841.016</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>EPS15 depletion affects late endosomal maturation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Co-depletion of SPOPL an EPS15 has an additive effect on influenza A virus infection.

In addition to promoting the formation of clathrin-coated pits via interaction with AP2, it targets ubiquitinated proteins, such as EGFR, for endosomal uptake and lysosomal degradation (Li et al., 2014; Torrisi et al., 1999; van Delft et al., 1997). To evaluate whether SPOPL regulates general or specific effects of EPS15 we analyzed a number of receptor tyrosine kinases, classic targets of clathrin-dependent endocytosis, upon SPOPL depletion via western blotting (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Strikingly, out of five receptors only two were affected by SPOPL depletion: EGFR and MET, both known to associate directly with EPS15 (Parachoniak and Park, 2009; Torrisi et al., 1999). In contrast, the level of VEGFR3, IGF1R and even HER2, a close relative of EGFR, were not altered in SPOPL-depleted cells. These new data thus indicate that SPOPL specifically regulates the turnover of cargo that is directly targeted by EPS15.</p><p> <italic>3) The fact that every trafficking component probed exhibits altered stability when SPOPL is depleted is both interesting and problematic – since altered stability/abundance of factors like AP-2 could have severe trafficking consequences. To address the concern that the global membrane trafficking network is grossly perturbed in the absence of SPOPL and CUL3, you may consider probing how loss of Cul3-SPOPL affects trafficking more broadly (clathrin, EPS15R, epsins, other ESCRT components, GGAs, etc.). This would not need to be exhaustive, but it could reveal key insights into just how grossly perturbed trafficking is in these cells.</italic> To evaluate whether SPOPL depletion causes global changes in endosomal trafficking we analyzed additional endocytic trafficking markers in two different cell lines (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Importantly, we did not observe strong defects in early steps of endocytosis (clathrin, caveolin), the recycling pathway (RAB11 level), and ER homeostasis (Calnexin). Even the levels of RAB7, a marker for late endosomes did not change upon SPOPL depletion, despite late endosomes being strongly enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). However, we did observe a strong effect on proteins located to endosomes and multivesicular bodies, including the ESCRT-0 components EPS15, HRS and STAM, as well as ESCRT-I component TSG101. In contrast, the ESCRT-III component CHMP6 remained unaffected, suggesting dysregulation of the early ESCRT system involved in cargo-recognition and sorting. Importantly, while EPS15 was stabilized by SPOPL depletion in both cell lines, only minor effects were observed on its close relatives EPS15R and Epsin, underlining the specificity of SPOPL-induced EPS15 ubiquitination. In summary these data show that SPOPL-mediated ubiquitination of EPS15 causes specific defects at the step of ILV formation of multivesicular bodies resulting in dysregulation of late endosomal biogenesis. This new data is now shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and its implications are discussed in the revised text.</p><p><italic>4) It would improve the paper to gain a sense of what is driving the de-stabilization of these factors in the absence of SPOPL. When SPOPL is depleted, is the decreased stability of other trafficking factors (LAMP1, AP-2) proteasome- or lysosome-dependent? (Presumably this is not mediated by some other CUL3 complex since loss of CUL3 also destabilized AP2.)</italic> Upon further analysis we noticed that LAMP1 protein levels were only decreased by SPOPL depletion in HeLa cells while no such effect could be observed in A549 cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Similarly, AP2 reduction was cell line specific, and required efficient SPOPL depletion for rather long time periods (72 hours). It thus seems likely that the destabilizing effect on both proteins caused by SPOPL depletion is of secondary nature and most likely represents a context-dependent maturation defect. Co-treatment with proteasomal or lysosomal inhibitors would therefore be difficult to interpret and most likely cause unspecific changes in protein levels. After careful analysis of additional endosomal markers (see above, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), we concluded that SPOPL depletion causes trafficking defects mainly at multivesicular bodies and affects early endosomes and lysosomes only in a secondary manner. We have changed the revised text accordingly.</p><p><italic>5) Some experiments still rely too heavily on overexpressed proteins. Further analysis using endogenous proteins is needed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, it is critical to show that treatment of MG132 or MLN4924 can elevate protein levels of endogenous EPS15. Also demonstrating physical association of EPS15 and SPOPL at endogenous protein levels is needed.</italic> To address this point, we first performed co-immunoprecipitation experiments between endogenous EPS15 and SPOPL. As shown in the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (new panel D), EPS15 specifically interacts with SPOPL, but not SPOP, supporting the cell fractionation data. Moreover, we also analyzed co-localization of endogenous EPS15 with GFP-tagged SPOPL (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Together, these new data demonstrate that EPS15 specifically interacts with SPOPL at vesicular-like, late endosomal structures, and are now discussed accordingly in the revised result section. Finally, we also analyzed the levels of endogenous EPS15 in cells treated with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 or the CRL inhibitor MLN-4924. While we indeed observe a stabilization of GFP-tagged exogenous EPS15 as well as endogenous EPS15 in MG132-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), we do not observe a convincing stabilization of endogenous EPS15 levels after CRL-inhibition after MLN-4924 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). While we do not fully understand the reason for this observation, we assume that the pleiotropic effects on CRL inhibition may counteract the expected CUL3-SPOPL-mediated EPS15 stabilization in this situation. This hypothesis is further strengthened by the fact that the levels of ESCRT components are not increased upon MLN-4924 treatment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>). We have now adjusted the revised text accordingly.</p><p><italic>6) An analysis of the EPS15 mutant that cannot be ubiquitylated is needed to further understand the mechanisms involved and to fully demonstrate a role for SPOPL-dependent EPS15 ubiquitylation in the phenotypes observed.</italic> We found that EPS15 is ubiquitinated in a SPOPL-dependent manner on lysine 793 in vivo. As suggested, we now generated the corresponding non–ubiquitinatable K793R EPS15 mutant, and characterized its cellular defects (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). As expected, GFP-tagged EPS15-K793R localized to vesicle-like cytoplasmic structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), but its overall steady-state level was slightly lower compared to wild-type controls. Importantly however, the EPS15-K793R level did not increase upon SPOPL depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), and EPS15-K793R is also not degraded upon overexpression of SPOPL in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In addition to the non-binding EPS15<sup>S744-S746A</sup> mutant, this analysis strengthens our claim that SPOPL-mediated ubiquitination of lysine 793 contributes to EPS15 destabilization and regulates EPS15 activity towards EGFR sorting.</p><p><italic>7) Finally, the presentation of the RNAi screen is sub-optimal in that the identities of the other BTB proteins are not being revealed.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have changed <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and now list all BTB-proteins identified in the IAV infection screen.
