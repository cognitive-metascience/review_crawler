Here we identify a novel molecular mechanism by which IL-6 regulates CD4 cell effector function. We show that IL-6-dependent signal facilitates the formation of mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes to sustain high mitochondrial membrane potential late during activation of CD4 cells. Mitochondrial hyperpolarization caused by IL-6 is uncoupled from the production of ATP by oxidative phosphorylation. However, it is a mechanism to raise the levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> late during activation of CD4 cells. Increased levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presence of IL-6 are used to prolong <italic>Il4</italic> and <italic>Il21</italic> expression in effector CD4 cells. Thus, the effect of IL-6 on mitochondrial membrane potential and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an alternative pathway by which IL-6 regulates effector function of CD4 cells and it could contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06376.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06376.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06376.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Inflammation is a normal part of the body's response to an infection or injury and it helps to start the healing process. However, if left unchecked, inflammation itself can damage tissues, and diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis are the result of uncontrolled inflammation.</p><p>Certain immune cells release molecules that can either trigger or suppress inflammation. Interleukin 6 is an example of a ‘pro-inflammatory’ molecule, which regulates the activity of groups of immune cells collectively known as ‘CD4 cells’. People who are overweight or obese have higher levels of interleukin 6 than people of a healthy weight. Obesity and other metabolic conditions have been linked to problems with structures called mitochondria, which make a molecule called ATP that provides cells with the energy they need to survive. But it is not known if interleukin 6 can affect the activity of mitochondria inside CD4 cells.</p><p>Now, Yang et al. have discovered that interleukin 6 can affect the mitochondria inside CD4 cells and, in doing so, have identified a new way that interleukin 6 can regulate these cells' activity. Experiments involving immune cells from mice revealed that interleukin 6 triggers a cascade of signaling events that aid the formation of so-called ‘mitochondrial respiratory chain supercomplexes’ in CD4 cells. These are groups of proteins that work together in the membranes of mitochondria and are vital for the activity of these structures. The formation of these supercomplexes maintains a large voltage difference across the membrane of the mitochondria that occurs during the later stages of CD4 cell activation.</p><p>Yang et al. found that this voltage difference was not linked to the production of ATP, but that it did raise the levels of calcium ions inside the mitochondria. Further experiments revealed that these increased levels of calcium ions prolong the production of other pro-inflammatory molecules in the CD4 cells.</p><p>Following the discovery of a new pathway that regulates the activity of CD4 cells, the next challenge is to see if the parts of this pathway could be targeted with drugs to help treat inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Moreover, because interleukin 6 plays an active role in other diseases such as cancer, further studies of this new pathway may help explain how this molecule encourages cancers to progress and/or spread around the body.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06376.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06376.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mitochondrion</kwd><kwd>IL-6</kwd><kwd>Stat3</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>effector cytokine</kwd><kwd>NFATc2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R56AI094027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rincón</surname><given-names>Mercedes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P20GM103496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Rui</given-names></name><name><surname>Rincón</surname><given-names>Mercedes</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR019246-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Taatjes</surname><given-names>Douglas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interleukin 6 (IL-6) can mediate pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases through its effects on mitochondrial function.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Interleukin 6 (IL-6) is an inflammatory cytokine that is elevated in several autoimmune and inflammatory disorders, including rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kishimoto, 2005</xref>). Inhibition of IL-6 signaling by an anti-IL-6R antibody has been shown to be a highly effective therapy in treating patients with RA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tanaka and Kishimoto, 2012</xref>). IL-6 plays crucial role in regulating CD4 T helper cell differentiation and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dienz and Rincon, 2009</xref>). It enhances Th2 differentiation through an auto-feedback loop by upregulating autocrine IL-4 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rincon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diehl et al., 2002</xref>). IL-6 inhibits IFNγ production and Th1 differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Diehl et al., 2000</xref>). In combination with TGFβ, IL-6 also contributes to the differentiation of Th17 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ivanov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>). IL-6 inhibits regulatory T cell function and downregulates Foxp3 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pasare and Medzhitov, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dienz and Rincon, 2009</xref>). In addition, IL-6 alone, without the need of TGFβ, induces IL-21 expression, a mechanism by which it promotes the generation of follicular T helper (Tfh) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nurieva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dienz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diehl et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>IL-6 binds to its membrane receptor, which triggers signaling through gp130, a common transducer that activates Jak/Stat3 and Ras/MAPK pathways in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boulanger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heinrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kishimoto, 2005</xref>). Stat3 is a transcription factor present in cytosol but translocates to the nucleus upon stimulation where it mediates the expression of numerous genes. Stat3 has been previously implicated in the regulation of genes involved in cell survival and proliferation by directly binding to multiple survival genes, including <italic>Bcl2</italic>, <italic>Fos</italic>, <italic>Jun</italic>, <italic>Mcl1</italic> and <italic>Fosl2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hirano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bourillot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Durant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carpenter and Lo, 2014</xref>). Additionally, IL-6-dependent Stat3 activation plays an important role in the expression of several cytokine genes, including <italic>Il21</italic> and <italic>Il17</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mathur et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dienz et al., 2009</xref>). In addition to its role as a nuclear transcription factor, Stat3 has been found within mitochondria in liver, heart and some cell lines where it enhances the mitochondrial respiratory chain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gough et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wegrzyn et al., 2009</xref>). However, no studies have addressed whether IL-6 regulates mitochondrial function through Stat3.</p><p>IL-6 has for long been associated with metabolic changes and high levels of IL-6 in serum have been correlated with BMI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mohamed-Ali et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fried et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vgontzas et al., 2000</xref>). Recent studies indicate that IL-6 is linked to glucose homeostasis in adipose tissue and it participates in the switch from white to brown fat tissue in cancer-induced cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stanford et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petruzzelli et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether IL-6 has a direct effect on the metabolism of cells. But in the context of ischemia-reperfusion injury in cardiomyocytes, IL-6 has been shown to maintain mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smart et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the known role of IL-6 in the CD4 cell effector function, no studies have addressed whether IL-6 has an effect on mitochondrial function in CD4 cells.</p><p>Here we show that IL-6 plays an important role in maintaining MMP late during CD4 cell activation in a Stat3-dependent manner. IL-6-mediated mitochondrial hyperpolarization is, however, uncoupled from the oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production. Instead, IL-6 uses the high MMP to raise mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> and, consequently, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels to promote cytokine expression late during activation. Thus we have identified a previously undescribed mechanism by which IL-6 regulates CD4 cell effector function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IL-6 is essential to sustain MMP during activation of CD4 cells</title><p>Although the role of IL-6 in CD4 cell differentiation and cytokine gene expression is well established, little is known about the role of this cytokine in mitochondrial function. An essential function of the mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC), in addition to the transfer of electrons, is the generation of an electrochemical gradient across the mitochondrial inner membrane by accumulating H<sup>+</sup> at the intermembrane space. This electrochemical gradient, known as MMP, is used as a mechanism to generate ATP. Since IL-6 has been associated with maintaining MMP in cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Smart et al., 2006</xref>), we examined whether IL-6 regulates the MMP in CD4 cells during activation. Fresh CD4 cells were activated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Abs) in the presence or absence of IL-6 for different periods of times, stained with TMRE (an MMP indicator), and analyzed by flow cytometry. Most freshly isolated CD4 cells were hyperpolarized as shown by the high TMRE staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). However, cells activated in the absence of IL-6 depolarized progressively during activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the presence of IL-6 prevents mitochondrial depolarization during CD4 cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). After 48hr of activation, most CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 maintained a high MMP (TMRE<sup>high</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In contrast to IL-6, the presence of exogenous IL-2, the main growth factor of T cells, did not affect MMP in activated CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), supporting a selective role for IL-6 on MMP.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06376.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IL-6 sustains high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) late during activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MMP during activation of CD4 cells with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs over time in the presence or absence of IL-6, as determined by staining with TMRE and flow cytometry analysis.

IL-6 did not affect the overall mitochondrial mass as determined by the levels of COX IV (Complex IV subunit of ETC), NDUFS3 and NDUFA9 (Complex I subunits) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, the frequency of live cells among those activated in the presence of IL-6 was not significantly different from the frequency of live cells in the absence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the increase of MMP triggered by IL-6 is not a consequence of survival or change in mitochondrial mass.</p><p>Antigen presenting cells (APCs) are one of the major sources of IL-6 during CD4 cell activation. To examine whether IL-6 was required to maintain the mitochondrial hyperpolarization during antigen activation, naive CD4 cells were obtained from OT-II TCR transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnden et al., 1998</xref>) and activated with OVA peptide and APCs isolated from WT or IL-6 KO mice. Similar to CD4 cells activated with anti-CD3/CD28 Abs in the presence of IL-6, a large frequency of OT-II CD4 cells activated with WT APC showed a high MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). However, a blocking anti-IL-6 Ab drastically decreased the frequency of cells with high MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). In contrast to WT APCs, very low frequency of activated CD4 cells showed high MMP when APC from IL-6 KO mice were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Remarkably, addition of exogenous IL-6 to cells activated with IL-6 KO APCs restored high MMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Thus, these results indicate that IL-6 derived from APC during in vitro activation of CD4 cells is essential to maintain mitochondrial hyperpolarization.</p><p>To address the role of IL-6 in regulating the MMP in CD4 cells during in vivo activation, we performed adoptive transfer of OT-II CD4 cells into WT or IL-6 KO mice as hosts. Mice were then immunized with ovalbumin, and after two days, cells were harvested to examine their MMP. Similar to in vitro results, the fraction of OT-II cells maintaining a high MMP was significantly greater in WT mice relative to IL-6 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Together, these results indicate that IL-6 plays an essential role in maintaining the MMP during activation of CD4 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>IL-6 facilitates the formation of respiratory chain supercomplexes in CD4 cells during activation</title><p>Morphological states of highly pleomorphic inner membrane cristae reflect the different mitochondrial metabolic stages.

Similarly, there was no increase in the number of mitochondria in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the morphology of the mitochondrial cristae in cells activated with IL-6 was different from that of cells activated without IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The number of mitochondria with expanded and disorganized cristae was greater in CD4 cells activated in the absence of IL-6 compared with CD4 cells activated with IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the number of mitochondria with tight and organized cristae was higher in cells activated in the presence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Despite the increased MMP, IL-6 reduced the production of mROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Thus, the formation of RCS facilitated by IL-6 makes possible for this cytokine to sustain mitochondria hyperpolarization while minimizing the production of mROS during activation of CD4 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>IL-6-mediated mitochondrial hyperpolarization is uncoupled from OXPHOS</title><p>The energy released from the transport of H<sup>+</sup> from the mitochondrial intermembrane space to the mitochondrial matrix through F<sub>0</sub>F<sub>1</sub> ATP synthase, a subunit of Complex V, is coupled to ATP generation. Thus, an increased MMP elicited by IL-6 could potentially lead to an increase in mitochondrial ATP synthesis. We therefore examined ATP production in CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6. Surprisingly, despite of the increased MMP, intracellular ATP levels were not affected by IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). TCR stimulation has been shown to trigger rapid ATP release from CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yip et al., 2009</xref>). It was therefore possible that IL-6 increased ATP synthesis but also ATP release. However, analysis of ATP levels in culture supernatants of activated cells showed no difference in the levels of extracellular ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Since most ATP in activated T cells is generated through glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pearce et al., 2013</xref>), increased MMP by IL-6 could enhance mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) but have minimal effect on overall ATP levels. To further address the effect of IL-6 on mitochondrial OXPHOS, we examined oxygen consumption rate (OCR) using the Seahorse XF24 analyzer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98a">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). No statistically significant difference in basal mitochondrial OCR or maximal respiratory capacity was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Mitochondria uptake Ca<sup>2+</sup> through MCU at the cytoplasmic membrane near the extracellular calcium channels, as well as from ER storage, and serve as a delivery vehicle to increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rizzuto et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Soboloff et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, early during T cell activation mitochondria have been shown to relocate close to immune synapse and contribute to increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quintana et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Schwindling et al., 2010</xref>). To determine whether the increase in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elicited by IL-6 could affect the levels of free cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we examined the basal level of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in CD4 cells using Fura-2 AM as a calcium indicator. The levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, as determined by fluorometric ratio at 340 nm/380 nm (F<sub>340/380</sub>), in cells activated with IL-6 were higher than in cells activated without IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). It has been previously shown that TCR stimulation fails to induce cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in activated CD4 cells, as determined by flow cytometry analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagaleekar et al., 2008</xref>). Similarly, no Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux was triggered by TCR stimulation in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 (data not shown). However, similar to the results with Fura-2 staining, analysis of the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> baseline by Indo-1 staining and flow cytometry analysis also revealed higher baseline in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 relative to cells activated in the absence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Maximum cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels triggered by the calcium ionophore, ionomycin were comparable between CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, the presence of IL-6 during activation maintains increased levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>To demonstrate that this increased cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> was dependent on high mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we examined the effect of CGP-37157, a blocker of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cox et al., 1993</xref>). As previously demonstrated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delmotte et al., 2012</xref>), treatment with CGP-37157 resulted in increased levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, the treatment with CGP-37157, lowered the cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 to the levels found in those without IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), indicating that this increase was dependent on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. In addition, reducing the MMP in IL-6-stimulated cells by treatment with inhibitors of Complex I (rotenone) and Complex III (antimycin) also lowered the levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar effects were found by the treatment with CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). IL-6 therefore provides a mechanism for CD4 cells to maintain elevated levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> through its effect on the MMP and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The regulation of the MMP and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elicited by IL-6 is Stat3 dependent</title><p>In addition to its role as a transcription factor, several studies have shown the presence of Stat3 in mitochondria where it regulates the ETC primarily in tissues with high mitochondria content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gough et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wegrzyn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heusch et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lachance et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erlich et al., 2014</xref>). Although IL-6 is a major activator of Stat3, no studies have previous address the regulation of Stat3 in mitochondria by this cytokines. However, the maintenance of high MMP late during activation of CD4 cells by IL-6 could possibly be mediated by Stat3. We first examined whether Stat3 could also be present in mitochondria in activated CD4 cells by Western blot analysis using extracts from different subcellular fractions. As expected, Stat3 was present in both the nucleus and cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Interestingly, however, high levels of Stat3 were also present in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). GAPDH and COX IV were used as cytosolic and mitochondrial fraction markers, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). To examine whether localization of Stat3 in mitochondria was influenced by IL-6 during CD4 cell activation, we performed Western blot analysis using mitochondrial extracts from CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6 as well as from freshly isolated CD4 cells. Only low levels of Stat3 were present in the mitochondrial fraction from freshly isolated CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). High levels of Stat3 were detected in mitochondria from activated cells, but these levels were further upregulated by IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, as a control, the levels of NDUFA9 were not affected by IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). IL-6 did not have an effect on the total levels of Stat3 either, as determined by Western-blot using whole cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also examined whether Stat3 in mitochondria was phosphorylated. No phospho-Stat3 was detected in mitochondria from freshly isolated CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Phospho-Stat3 was present in mitochondria of activated CD4 cells, but the levels were substantially higher in the presence of IL-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

CD4 cells from wild-type (<italic>Stat3</italic><sup>+/+</sup>) mice and T-cell conditional Stat3 knockout (<italic>Stat3</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Takeda et al., 1998</xref>) were activated in the absence or presence of IL-6, and MMP was examined 48 hr later. Interestingly, IL-6 failed to increase MMP in Stat3-deficient CD4 cells during activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>), indicating that effect of IL-6 on MMP in CD4 cells is dependent on Stat3. To address whether this effect of Stat3 dissociates from its activity as a transcription factor, we used CD4 cells from mice expressing a mutant Stat3 (mut-<italic>Stat3</italic>) carrying a deletion at V<sup>463</sup> residue (Stat3-Δ463) that prevents DNA binding but does not affect Stat3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Steward-Tharp et al., 2014</xref>). This mutation was found in autosomal dominant hyperimmunoglobulin E syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holland et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Minegishi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>). Expression of mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> in mice has been shown to act as dominant-negative and inhibit Stat3 mediated transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Steward-Tharp et al., 2014</xref>). CD4 cells from WT and mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mice were activated with or without IL-6 and MMP was examined after 48 hr. IL-6 was still able to increase MMP in CD4 cells from mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In addition, we also tested the effect of Stattic, a well characterized inhibitor of Stat3 that blocks dimerization of Stat3 through phosphor-Tyr<sup>705</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schust et al., 2006</xref>). The presence of Stattic, even at a relatively high concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schust et al., 2006</xref>), did not affect the MMP in IL-6-treated CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Thus, correlating with the accumulation of Stat3 in mitochondria, the increased MMP in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 requires Stat3, but it is independent of Stat3-mediated transcription.</p><p>Although the presence of Stat3 in mitochondria and its role as regulator of ETC activity has now been widely reported in different cell types, no previous studies have addressed the role of Stat3 in mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. To further determine whether IL-6 increases mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> through Stat3, we examined mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6. Interestingly, in the absence of Stat3, IL-6 failed to maintain elevated levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). To show that this effect was not dependent on Stat3 transcriptional activity we also examined mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in CD4 cells from mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mice. Unlike Stat3 deficient CD4 cells, IL-6 was capable to increase mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I,J</xref>). To further examine whether Stat3 is necessary for the regulation of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> elicited by IL-6, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were measured in <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>+/+</sup> or <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6 using the Fura-2 AM assay. Unlike <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>+/+</sup> CD4 cells, IL-6 failed to increase cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in <italic>Stat3</italic><sup>−/−</sup> CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Together, these data show for the first time that Stat3 contributes to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in response to IL-6 and, consequently, cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p><p>Previous studies have demonstrated the association of Stat3 with Complex I of the ETC through GRIM-19, a component of Complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lufei et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gough et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wegrzyn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tammineni et al., 2013</xref>). No studies have reported whether Stat3 is present in the ETC SCs. Our studies above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) indicate that IL-6 facilitates the formation of ETC SCs in CD4 cells. We therefore examined whether mitochondrial Stat3 could also be recruited to the SCs. BN-PAGE was performed using mitochondrial extracts generated with digitonin from CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6. SC region of BN-PAGE was excised and resolved by Western blot analysis for Stat3. As described above, the levels of SCs were increased in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 as determined by the levels of NDUFA9 and NDUFV1 subunits of Complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Interestingly, Stat3 was also present in the SC region isolated from IL-6-treated CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). Thus, Stat3 is recruited to the ETC SCs, where it can regulate activity of Complex I through interaction with GRIM-19.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is essential for IL-6 to sustain the production of IL-21 and IL-4 late during activation of CD4 cells</title><p>IL-6, in the absence of other cytokines, is the major inducer of IL-21 production by CD4 cells in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nurieva et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Suto et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dienz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Diehl et al., 2012</xref>). Stat3 is considered the main transcription factor that induces <italic>Il21</italic> gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Nurieva et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaplan et al., 2011</xref>). However, since Stat3 but not its transcriptional activity is required for IL-6 to sustain MMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> during the activation of CD4 cells, this could be an additional mechanism by which IL-6 promotes the production of IL-21. We therefore examined the ability of IL-6 to induce IL-21 production in CD4 cells from mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mice where Stat3 is present but its transcriptional activity is impaired. Similarly to human CD4 cells from patients with Hyper IgE syndrome expressing mut-<italic>Stat3</italic>, CD4 cells from mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mice have been shown to fail to produce IL-17, another cytokine gene regulated by Stat3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ma et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Milner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Renner et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Beaucoudrey et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Minegishi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Durant et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Steward-Tharp et al., 2014</xref>).

We therefore investigated whether the sustained high MMP elicited by IL-6 late during the activation of CD4 cells could contribute to the production of IL-21 triggered by this cytokine. CD4 cells were activated in the presence or absence of IL-6 for 42 hr and treated with rotenone and antimycin (R/A) or CCCP (to depolarize mitochondria) for another 6 hr. IL-21 levels in the supernatants were determined by Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Although there were already substantial levels of IL-21 at 42 hr in cells activated with IL-6, these levels steeply rose in the next 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, the increase in IL-21 levels was prevented by the treatment with R/A or CCCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), indicating that the late production of IL-21 was dependent on the increased MMP caused by IL-6. To further address whether IL-6-mediated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> contributes to the late production of IL-21, CD4 cells were activated in the presence or absence of IL-6 for 42 hr, and treated with CGP-37157 to inhibit mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> export for another 6 hr.

Similarly, CGP-37157 prevented the increase in IL-21 production late during activation in mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> CD4 cells, without effecting IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>We and others have shown that IL-6 can also promote the production of IL-4 during activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rincon et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diehl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Heijink et al., 2002</xref>).

We therefore examined the effect that interfering with MMP or Ca<sup>2+</sup> has on IL-4 production later during activation. Similar to IL-21, the levels of IL-4 were increased in the last 6 hr in IL-6-stimulated CD4 cells, however R/A, CCCP or CGP-37157 prevented this increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that the increased MMP and cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulated by mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> caused by IL-6 also contributes to the late production of IL-4. In contrast, IL-6 had no effect on IL-2 production and treatment with R/A, CCCP or CGP-37157 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). We also examined the relative contribution of transcription-independent function of Stat3 in the regulation of these other cytokines by IL-6.

RU360 however had no effect on IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

After activation, they rapidly switch to anabolic growth and biomass accumulation. This adaption to aerobic glycolysis is specifically required for effector functions in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2013</xref>). IL-2 and IL-15 have been reported to regulate mitochondrial respiration and the balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van der Windt et al., 2012</xref>). IL-2 has been shown to support aerobic glycolysis, while IL-15 increases spared respiratory capacity and oxidative metabolism by enhancing mitochondrial biogenesis and FAO in CD8 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pearce et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">van der Windt et al., 2012</xref>). IL-6 has been recently shown to regulate glucose homeostasis in myeloid cells and induce the switch from white adipose tissue to brown fat in cancer induced cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mauer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Petruzzelli et al., 2014</xref>). Here we show that IL-6 enhances the MMP in CD4 cells. However, this is uncoupled from oxidative phosphorylation (i.e. ATP synthesis). In addition, IL-6 does not alter the balance between glycolysis and oxidative glycolysis during activation. Instead, we show that a sustained MMP elicited by IL-6 leads to an effect on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. No other studies have linked cytokine effects to mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> in CD4 cells.</p><p>While endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been extensively studied in T cells, less is known about mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis in T cells. Mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> has been previously shown to modulate store-operated calcium signaling early upon T cell activation at the immunological synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hoth et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Quintana et al., 2007</xref>). Here we show that IL-6 uses MMP to sustain elevated levels of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> late during activation and, consequently, elevated levels of cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. We have previously shown that the expression of IP<sub>3</sub>Rs is downregulated during the activation of CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagaleekar et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore possible that the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in CD4 cells is reprogramed during activation. ER- IP<sub>3</sub>R is the main source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> during early activation of naive CD4 cells at the synapse. However, mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> could be the major source to sustain cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> in activated CD4 cells. Our data indicate that IL-6 sustains cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> late during activation by increasing the MMP and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This provides a potential mechanism by which Tfh cells have increased free cytosolic calcium levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shulman et al., 2014</xref>). More importantly, we show here for the first time that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a key role in promoting increased production of cytokine by effector CD4 cells. Although IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is essential for the initial induction of cytokine gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Feske, 2007</xref>), we have previously shown that IP<sub>3</sub>R-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> is not responsible for late production of cytokines by activated CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagaleekar et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> for cytokine production is also reprogrammed during activation of CD4 cells. Although we cannot discard the effect of other transcription factors, our study shows that mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> is required for IL-6 to keep NFATc2 in the nucleus, and that NFAT contributes to late expression of <italic>Il21</italic> and <italic>Il4</italic>.</p><p>Mitochondrial respiration has been shown to lead to ROS production caused by proton leaks and ROS can lead to oxidative injury. A number of recent studies have shown that mROS can function as signaling intermediates, and the mROS signaling is required for antigen-specific T cell activation and subsequent IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Byun et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schieke et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sena et al., 2013</xref>). Although IL-6 increases the MMP, we did not observe an increase in the levels of mROS correlating with the effect of IL-6 facilitating the formation of respiratory SCs. The presence of ETC SCs is emerging as a novel but highly relevant aspect of the mitochondrial function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acín-Pérez et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Althoff et al., 2011</xref>). The function of these SCs is to facilitate the transfer of electrons between ETC complexes to minimize the risk of electron leak and, thereby, the risk of producing harmful ROS. Our study demonstrates for the first time the presence of ETC SCs in CD4 cells, and the effect that IL-6 has in promoting the formation of these SCs during activation of CD4 cells. This could be a mechanism by which IL-6 can sustain elevated MMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> while minimizing the production of mROS. Although the association of Stat3 with individual complexes of the ETC has been previous described in heart and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gough et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wegrzyn et al., 2009</xref>), here we show for the first time the presence of Stat3 in the ETC SCs in CD4 cells. Stat3 may also be present in mitochondrial SCs in other tissues such as heart.</p><p>Thus, here we identify a novel mechanism by which IL-6 promotes the production of IL-21 and IL-4 late during the activation of CD4 cells. This new mechanism involves Stat3 but as a factor regulating MMP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> instead of its function as mediator of transcription. Our studies also reveal a novel function of mitochondrial respiration in the control of cytokine production through its effect on mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6J mice were purchased from Jackson Laboratories.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Calcium signaling is a critical factor involved in T cell activation, differentiation and function. Therefore, understanding of the regulatory mechanisms involved in governing these procedures is an interesting and important topic for controlling T cell responses. In this study, Rui Yang et al. present an interesting finding that IL6 affects CD4 T cell effector functions, especially IL-21 and IL-4 production, via the regulation of mitochondrial calcium and membrane potential, a molecular link that has not been explored before. Specifically, the data here show that IL-6 promotes mitochondrial supercomplex assembly and high mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) in a mechanism that is uncoupled from mitochondrial ATP production by oxidative phosphorylation. Rather, IL6 maintains MMP during activation of CD4 cells by increasing the number of mitochondria with tight and organized cristae. Although this study provides some interesting findings, the mechanism(s) could be more clearly delineated and better support for the relevance of mitochondrial calcium storage in T cells would strengthen this study. Also, further addressing the mechanism of modulation of mitochondrial function by which Stat3 regulates IL-4 and IL-21 gene expression downstream of IL-6 would be of outstanding interest and extend the scope of the study. Below are several comments for the authors to consider:</p><p>1) Since mitochondrial activity is critical to sustain MCU activity to facilitate calcium uptake into mitochondria, inhibiting mitochondrial activity by CCCP reduced mitochondrial calcium levels. However, cytosolic calcium level of CCCP-treated cells also dropped. On the other hand, treatment with mitochondrial calcium exporter inhibitor CGP-37157 suppressed cytosolic calcium level. These findings are difficult to interpret: whether the cytosolic calcium level is controlled by mitochondrial calcium uptake or release or through the coordination of both import and release. This point is not clear and the experimental support is lacking. The authors also should monitor the mitochondrial calcium level in CGP-37157 treated cells to confirm the changes in mitochondrial calcium level.</p><p>2) Similar to point #1, the authors should determine the total calcium level in IL-6 treated T cells in the presence or absence of CCCP. It is possible that mitochondrial calcium uptake has to be increased in IL-6 treated cell to prevent the net loss of intracellular calcium, which can be detrimental for initiating IL-21 and IL-4 expression. Moreover, the authors should examine the effect of RU360 (MCU inhibitor) on IL6-treated CD4 T cells. This approach will be more specific to examine how mitochondrial calcium uptake affects the effector functions of IL6-treated cells because mitochondrial membrane potential affected by CCCP and antimycin cannot address this point.</p><p>3) After IL-6 treatment, CD4 T cells increased mitochondrial membrane potential and the formation of respiratory chain complexes. However, there is no difference on ECAR and OCR activities. This finding is interesting, but it is not clear whether IL6 treatment leads to changes on mitochondrial number and size, which can affect the readout of mitochondrial membrane potential and ROS production. The authors need to stain the cells with MitoGreen and MitoDeepRed to examine these parameters. Moreover, it may be interesting to analyze the protein expression of mitochondrial complexes and metabolite profile in control and IL6 treated CD4 T cells. These approaches may allow them to determine the underlying mechanisms that affect the MMP but not ECAR and OCR levels.</p><p>4) For the cytosolic calcium measurement, the authors measured the FURA-2 intensity. However, the kinetics of calcium accumulation upon TCR stimulation should be measured (including both baseline and stimulated conditions). IL-6 treatment may affect both baseline (as showed in this manuscript) and the activation kinetics due to the regulation provided by mitochondrial calcium uptake and release.</p><p>5) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, mutant-STAT3 has been used to test whether the DNA-binding ability of STAT3 is required for affecting mitochondrial membrane potential. However, the information of this mutant is lacking. Moreover, the <italic>Tyr705</italic> mutant should be included to examine whether the IL-6 signaling induced STAT3 phosphorylation and dimerization can be involved in affect CD4 T cell mitochondrial activity.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, the authors stated that IL-6 promotes the accumulation of Stat3 in mitochondria during CD4 T cell activation. However, is the effect on mitochondrial cristae organization and super-complex assembly dependent of the presence of Stat3 in mitochondria? The authors should perform experiments with Stat3 KO and <italic>Stat3</italic>-mut to determine whether the effect of IL-6 on mitochondrial cristae shape and mitochondrial supercomplex assembly is Stat3-dependent and/or depends on their relocation to mitochondria.</p><p>7) In the same line, does R/A, CCCP or CGP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>) in IL-6 activated T cells affect Stat3 positioning to mitochondria?</p><p>8) To unequivocally demonstrate the role of Stat3 in the regulation of IL-21 and IL-4 gene expression, the authors should increase cytosolic calcium levels in Stat3 KO and <italic>Stat3</italic> mut T cells and assess IL-21 and IL-4 gene expression upon IL-6 activation.</p><p>Also, it would be important if the authors could show that the production of IL-21 and IL-4 in vivo was able to occur in the mutSTAT3 or mito-STAT3 T cells. I think this study highlights a novel aspect of IL-6 signaling and pushes the mechanism to a good extent in vitro, but they have little reconfirmation of their findings in vivo.</p><p>Combining the data from the O'Shea paper where the mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mouse is first described, with the current study, the findings suggest that mito-STAT3 is needed for IL-21 and IL-4 (as described in this paper), but nuclear STAT3 is required for IL-17. It would be great if the authors could better validate this split in STAT3 functions for these cytokines downstream of IL-6. I think this would provide an important distinction in how these cytokines are regulated in the T cells, which is implied by the studies here, but not formally demonstrated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06376.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Since mitochondrial activity is critical to sustain MCU activity to facilitate calcium uptake into mitochondria, inhibiting mitochondrial activity by CCCP reduced mitochondrial calcium levels.

We now provide a better description (in the subsection headed “IL-6-mediated high MMP results in elevated mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels”) summarizing what is known and how our data are integrated in this model. Briefly, previous studies have shown that mitochondria uptake calcium through microdomains formed between mitochondria and plasma membrane or between mitochondria and ER. This uptake of calcium is promoted by maintaining high mitochondrial membrane potential. Then, mitochondria release calcium to the cytosol and regulate more local cytosolic calcium homeostasis. Thus, both uptake and release of mitochondrial calcium are key. For instance, early during activation of T cells, it has been shown that mitochondria relocate to the synapsis and contribute to the uptake of extracellular calcium. We now provide a better description of this model.</p><p>In addition, following the suggestion from the reviewers, we now provide new data showing that inhibition of calcium release by CGP-37157 results in increased mitochondrial calcium as expected (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Similar to point #1, the authors should determine the total calcium level in IL-6 treated T cells in the presence or absence of CCCP.

Following the recommendations from the reviewers, we now show (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) that treatment with CCCP suppresses the increased cytosolic calcium levels in IL-6 treated cells, further supporting the contribution of mitochondria to the increased cytosolic calcium in these cells.</p><p>Addressing the experiments suggested by the reviewers using RU360 (MCU inhibitor) has been a major challenge since this inhibitor cannot be found commercially anymore. We tried several distributors but it was indefinitely back ordered. Our only alternative was to establish a collaboration with other experts in the field who have this inhibitor. We have now established a collaboration with Dr. Muniswamy Madesh (an expert in mitochondrial calcium uniporter, MCU) we obtained the RU360 inhibitor and performed the suggested experiments. We show now that RU360 treatment reduces mitochondrial calcium in IL-6-treated CD4 cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). In addition, we have also tested the effect of RU360 in cytokine production and we now show that it inhibits the production of IL-21 in IL-6-treated CD4 cells (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). We thank the reviewers for the suggestions, although it was challenging to obtain this inhibitor, these data clearly enhance the quality of our study.

We already addressed it in our first submission with some of the experiments proposed by the reviewers, but we apologize since we did not make major emphasis and it was probably missed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> of the initial version we showed that the levels of NDUFA9 and NDUFS3 (two independent subunits of Complex I) as well as Cox IV (a subunit of Complex IV) are similar between CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6. Since there was only one brief sentence with no conclusions, we have now rewritten the section (“IL-6 is essential to sustain mitochondrial membrane potential during activation of 107 CD4 cells”) to conclude that there was no difference in mitochondria content.</p><p>Nevertheless, using TEM studies, we now show that the number of mitochondria in IL-6 treated cells is not increased relative to cells activated without IL-6 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>4) For the cytosolic calcium measurement, the authors measured the FURA-2 intensity. However, the kinetics of calcium accumulation upon TCR stimulation should be measured (including both baseline and stimulated conditions). IL-6 treatment may affect both baseline (as showed in this manuscript) and the activation kinetics due to the regulation provided by mitochondrial calcium uptake and release</italic>.</p><p>The kinetics of cytosolic calcium release upon TCR stimulation in CD4 cells activated in the absence or presence of IL-6 is an interesting point and obvious question to ask, primarily if not aware of one of our previous published studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagaleekar et al., 2008</xref>). A number of years ago, addressing whether calcium flux was increased in CD4 cells activated with IL-6 because we had previously shown that IL-6 increased NFAT transcriptional activity we obtained novel and unexpected results. Using flow cytometry analysis as the standard method to examine calcium flux in T cells, we found that stimulation with anti-CD3 Ab failed to induce calcium flux in activated CD4 cells independently whether IL-6 was present or not. We went further and showed that this is in part due to the downregulation of IP<sub>3</sub>R expression during activation, and as a result no calcium flux is observed, in contrast to the calcium flux detected in naïve CD4 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nagaleekar et al., 2008</xref>). However, although no calcium flux could be triggered by anti-CD3 treatment, we observed that the cytosolic calcium baseline detected by flow cytometry analysis was higher in CD4 cells activated with IL-6, as the reviewers predicted. We did not follow these studies further, but they led us to an evidence to identify the potential role for the sustained mitochondrial membrane potential in CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6. We have now included data showing the increased cytosolic calcium baseline in IL-6-activated CD4 cells (analyzed by flow cytometry analysis), while the levels reached by ionomycin (maximum levels) or EGTA (calcium blocker) are comparable (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, mutant-STAT3 has been used to test whether the DNA-binding ability of STAT3 is required for affecting mitochondrial membrane potential.

In the revised version we now provide a more detailed description of this mutant prior to the description of the experiments we performed (in the subsection headed “The regulation of the MMP and mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> elicited by IL-6 is Stat3 dependent”).</p><p>To address the contribution of the STAT3 phosphorylation/dimerization in mitochondrial activity we now provide data showing that Stattic, a pharmacological inhibitor of STAT3 that prevents dimerization of STAT3 through P-Tyr<sup>705</sup>, does not prevent the increase in mitochondrial membrane potential caused by IL-6 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and 1B</xref>). In addition, we have tried a large range of concentrations for this inhibitor, but no effect in MMP was found. Thus, STAT3 is required for IL-6 to sustain mitochondrial membrane potential, but STAT3 dimerization is not a required.</p><p><italic>6)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>, the authors stated that IL-6 promotes the accumulation of Stat3 in mitochondria during CD4 T cell activation.

However, the reviewers are correct that there is no evidence for Stat3 being associated with supercomplexes. To address this question we embarked on challenging studies to test if Stat3 is present in supercomplexes in CD4 cells. We have now performed experiments using digitonin-generated mitochondrial extracts from CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of IL-6, and BN-PAGE to resolve the supercomplexes. The supercomplex region was then excised and protein eluted. The eluted protein was resolved by standard SDS PAGE, and western blot analysis was used to detect Stat3. The supercomplex region was then, eluted and used to run another electrophoresis gel followed by Western blot analysis to test for Stat3. The results show clearly the presence of Stat3 in supercomplexes primarily in those isolated from CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>). In correlation with the data we had in the first version these data also show an accumulation of supercomplexes in IL-6-activated CD4 cells as determined by the levels of Complex I subunits and Complex IV subunit. These results will represent the first demonstration that Stat3 is indeed recruited to the ETC supercomplexes.</p><p>Based on previous published studies, mitochondrial cristae shape can influence the formation of the mitochondrial supercomplexes, but we are not aware of evidence to support that the formation of the supercomplexes could influence the shape of cristae. We therefore think that most likely the presence or absence of Stat3 should not affect the cristae shape. Nevertheless, we have performed TEM for <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> and mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> CD4 cells activated in the presence of IL-6. Relative to WT CD4 cells, there were no statistical differences in the distribution of cristae shape in either <italic>Stat3</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> or mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> CD4 cells. We provide here the results for the perusal of the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>).

While this is an interesting alternative scenario, we believe that this would better be the subject for a follow up study.

Unfortunately, we did not have access to sufficient number of mice for in vivo studies. We were able to do the in vitro experiments suggested by the reviewers with the mut-<italic>Stat3</italic> mice, but we did not have mice for in vivo experiments where a large cohort of mice from the same sex is needed. Neither Dr. O’Shea nor his collaborator at NIH, who also maintains a colony of these mice, could provide us with sufficient mice.
