Here, we present a four-dimensional expansion of chemical mapping called lock-mutate-map-rescue (LM<sup>2</sup>R), which integrates multiple layers of mutation with nucleotide-resolution chemical mapping. This technique resolves the core mechanism of the adenine-responsive <italic>V. vulnificus add</italic> riboswitch, a paradigmatic system for which both Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) conformational selection models and non-MWC alternatives have been proposed. To discriminate amongst these models, we locked each functionally important helix through designed mutations and assessed formation or depletion of other helices via compensatory rescue evaluated by chemical mapping. These LM<sup>2</sup>R measurements give strong support to the pre-existing correlations predicted by MWC models, disfavor alternative models, and suggest additional structural heterogeneities that may be general across ligand-free riboswitches.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>riboswitch</kwd><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>conformational ensemble</kwd><kwd>compensatory mutagenesis</kwd><kwd>SHAPE</kwd><kwd>secondary structure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM102519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Rhiju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM122579</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Das</surname><given-names>Rhiju</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new biochemical method tests whether or not the pre-existing RNA structural correlations couple small molecule binding to gene expression in a paradigmatic riboswitch.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Conformational changes in RNA molecules are ubiquitous features of gene regulation in all living cells. Recent years have seen an explosion of discoveries of <italic>cis</italic>-acting mRNA elements that sense small molecules, proteins, RNAs, and other environmental conditions and then modulate transcriptional termination, ribosome recruitment, splicing, and other genetic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Henkin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nudler and Mironov, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gesteland et al., 2006</xref>). Beginning with classic work by Yanofsky and colleagues in the 1970s, these discoveries have been associated with elegant models of allostery in which each molecule interconverts between distinct RNA secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanofsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gutiérrez-Preciado et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monod et al., 1965</xref>). If these multiple states could be characterized in detail and quantitatively modeled, they would offer potential new substrates for biological control and new targets for antibiotic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jones and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite this strong interest in RNA conformational change, directly testing the base pair correlations posited to underlie RNA allostery have been difficult for most systems. Experimental barriers remain even for the compact and self-contained riboswitches, which occur in eukaryotes and appear pervasive throughout bacteria. A riboswitch is a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory RNA domain composed of two segments: (1) an ‘aptamer’ segment that forms an intricate tertiary structure to specifically bind small molecule ligands, such as nucleobases or amino acids, and (2) a ‘gene expression platform’ segment that interacts with other molecular machines like the ribosome to modulate gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fernández-Luna and Miranda-Ríos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gilbert and Batey, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breaker, 2012</xref>). In many cases, the coupling of ligand binding to changes in the gene expression platform has been reconstituted in vitro in small model RNAs, enabling detailed biophysical analysis. Nevertheless, in most of these cases, the mechanism underlying the coupling of ligand binding to gene expression remains under question, suggesting the need for new concepts and new biophysical methods to understand RNA allostery.</p><p>A particularly well-studied – but still incompletely understood – example of an allosteric RNA is the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch, a ~120 nucleotide element that resides in the 5´ untranslated region (UTR) of the <italic>add</italic> adenosine deaminase mRNA of human pathogenic bacterium <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>. This riboswitch can directly bind adenine and controls translation of the mRNA in response to adenine in vivo. Domains of this RNA have been subjected to nearly every biochemical and biophysical technique available, including crystallography, single molecule measurements, and time-resolved X-ray laser diffraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal and Breaker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero and Das, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stoddard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rieder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neupane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenleaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemay and Lafontaine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stagno et al., 2017</xref>). Almost all work on the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch to date have assumed some variation of a Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (MWC, also called ‘conformational selection’ or ‘population shift’ models) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Monod et al., 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunasekaran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Changeux and Edelstein, 2005</xref>). In the absence of adenine, the RNA dominantly forms a stable <italic>apo</italic> secondary structure whose aptamer region is in a fold incompatible with adenine binding and whose gene expression platform, a ribosome binding site and AUG start codon, is sequestered into helices (blue, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). High adenine concentrations stabilize the ligand-binding secondary structure in the aptamer region and rearrange the secondary structure around the gene expression platform so that it is freed to recruit the ribosome and translation machinery (gold, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The signature prediction of the MWC model is that the <italic>holo</italic> RNA secondary structure should also exist in the absence of adenine, albeit as a high energy conformation within the <italic>apo</italic> ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle panel; gold). In terms of the riboswitch functional domains, when the RNA occasionally fluctuates to form an aptamer secondary structure compatible with ligand binding, the gene expression platform is predicted to concomitantly open, even without the adenine ligand. This prediction for the ligand-free ensemble is analogous to the classic MWC model of oxygen binding by hemoglobin, involving interconversion between thermodynamically stable hemoglobin structures (tense and relaxed, dominating <italic>apo</italic> and holo, respectively), with transient sampling of the <italic>holo</italic> oxygen-binding structure even in the absence of oxygen. This prediction for hemoglobin and numerous other protein systems have been supported through decades of studies on protein allostery that include direct detection of transient <italic>holo</italic>-like states in the <italic>apo</italic> ensemble even in the absence of small molecules needed to fully stabilize the <italic>holo</italic> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Changeux and Edelstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaton et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29602.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Models of the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Three-state models for conformational changes and ligand binding in the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch.

Multidimensional NMR spectroscopy, NMR relaxation studies, designed model systems, and supporting measurements from stopped-flow kinetics and calorimetry revealed detailed single-nucleotide-resolution base pairing information and intriguing temperature dependences for the complex structural ensemble of the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reining et al., 2013</xref>). Although similar in some respects to previously proposed MWC models, the new model contradicted a standard MWC assumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gunasekaran et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Changeux and Edelstein, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eaton et al., 1999</xref>): it proposed that, in the absence of adenine, riboswitches that sample the correct aptameric secondary structure do not also concomitantly open their ribosome binding sites and increase gene expression, as predicted by MWC conformational selection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, middle panel; mixed blue and gold, red rectangle outline). Despite this fundamental distinction, the non-MWC model appears fully consistent with all available data, and it remains unclear what pre-existing structural correlations, if any, underlie the allosteric mechanism of the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch. As an illustration of current uncertainties in the system, the same group that first proposed an non-MWC model for the <italic>add</italic> RNA has recently revived the MWC framework to interpret newer single molecule measurements on the same system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warhaut et al., 2017</xref>). Understanding the mechanism of allostery is particularly important for developing strategies for controlling riboswitches. For example, potential antibiotics that attempt to constitutively turn on expression of the <italic>add</italic> gene by selectively stabilizing the aptamer secondary structure may not succeed if the MWC model is incorrect.</p><p>Here, we develop an experimental approach that resolves the allosteric mechanism of the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch. To help avoid previous confusion in state definitions, we first cast the question of mechanism into one of determining the statistical correlation or anticorrelation of specific helix elements. We then expand a previously reported method that integrates compensatory rescue with chemical mapping readouts (mutate-map-rescue, M<sup>2</sup>R) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian and Das, 2016</xref>) to enable dissection of these helix-helix correlations. The method takes advantage of a Bayesian framework and simulations to connect experimental observables to underlying helix frequencies, and gives experimental results on the wild type <italic>add</italic> sequence that agree with predictions from all available models. Then, by identifying ‘lock’ mutants that stabilize helices posited for each state and carrying out further rounds of M<sup>2</sup>R in these lock mutant backgrounds, we infer how the presence of one helix enhances or suppresses the presence of other helices. The resulting data unambiguously discriminate between MWC and non-MWC models and also suggest additional structural heterogeneity for the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch. We end by discussing how the presented method may be useful for generally dissecting allostery in RNA-based gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Defining the question in terms of helix-helix correlations</title><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29602.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mutate-map-rescue (M<sup>2</sup>R) enables inference of helix frequencies.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Interrogation of base pairs by compensatory mutagenesis and chemical mapping, illustrated on a four-way junction (nts 126–235) of the <italic>E. coli</italic> 16S ribosomal RNA.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, a conventional way to phrase questions about allostery is to posit a small number of states and then to design experiments to probe properties of those states. For example, for the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch, previous models partitioned the states in the <italic>apo</italic> ensemble into <italic>apoA</italic> and <italic>apoB</italic>, depending on whether the aptamer secondary structure is correctly formed or not, respectively. We would then design experiments to discriminate whether <italic>apoA</italic> has its gene expression platform open or closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, in practice, this way of posing the question can be confusing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> show cartoons of the ensemble of RNA conformations that illustrate the potential complexities. First, there may be RNA secondary structures present in the actual <italic>apo</italic> ensemble that include some but not all helices of the aptamer secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>), and it then becomes ambiguous whether they should count as members of the <italic>apoA</italic> or <italic>apoB</italic> state. In addition, there may be secondary structures that include or are entirely composed of helices not shown in any of the presented models (marked with pink arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Indeed, in principle, there are a vast number of secondary structures that need to be considered. Not only are there several possible helices that can be formed by the RNA, but there are an exponentially large number of combinations of such helices, each giving rise to a distinct secondary structure.</p><p>We sought to define the allosteric mechanism in terms of the possible helices that the RNA can form, rather than this vast number of possible secondary structures. In the presence of adenine, there are three helices P1, P2, and P3 that define an adenine-binding aptamer secondary structure at nucleotides 15–81, with a well-defined tertiary structure that has been determined through crystallography. A linker including an additional hairpin (P5, nts 89–110) connects the aptamer to the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and AUG start codon (nts 112–122), which are open and available for ribosome recruitment. In the absence of adenine, all available models posit that the riboswitch forms a secondary structure ensemble dominated by a new P4 domain that pairs with the Shine-Dalgarno sequence and the AUG start codon (nts 112–122). The P4 domain includes potentially three helices, here called P4A, P4B, and P4C. P4A contains nucleotides that were originally part of P1 (the ‘switch region’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batey, 2012</xref>], nts 76–81, cross-hatched in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left). When P4A forms, some or all of the aptamer helices may rearrange into an alternative secondary structure or, potentially, a large set of alternative secondary structures. NMR experiments directly detected two alternative helices, P1B and P2B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), but do not rule out other helices being present at significant fractions if their conformational dynamics renders them invisible to the spectroscopy methods applied. Despite these potential complexities, there are a small number of Watson-Crick helices that feature in the current MWC and non-MWC models: P1, P2, P3, P4A, P4B, P4C, and P5. Additional helices may also be relevant to the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch mechanism. For example, numerous helices arose in preliminary modeling of the riboswitch based on conventional 1-dimensional SHAPE and mutate-and-map measurements (Supplementary Materials; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

In the absence of adenine, the riboswitch may occasionally sample the helices P1 or P2 (or both simultaneously), which are signatures of the adenine-bound state. The MWC conformational selection model would assume that any such thermally sampled secondary structure should also have an open gene expression platform, just like the adenine-bound <italic>holo</italic> and without the P4A or P4B domains. That is, there should be an anticorrelation between the presence of, e.g., P1 and P4B, in the ligand-free ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There should be similar anticorrelations between, e.g., P2 and P4A. (For clarity of presentation, here and below, we will use P1 and P4B (colored gold and blue, respectively, in figures) to illustrate core concepts and data in detail, and then summarize additional independent measurements for other helix-helix pairs, such as P2 and P4A.)</p><p>More quantitatively, suppose that P1 and P4B arise with 50% frequency in the ligand-free <italic>add</italic> riboswitch structural ensemble. If there is no allosteric ‘communication’ between these two elements, the joint frequency of observing both P1 and P4B should be 50% x 50% = 25%. The MWC model predicts that the actual joint frequency of these two elements is significantly lower: the formation of P1 in the aptamer destabilizes the P4B helix that sequesters the gene expression platform, even in the absence of adenine.

We discovered an approach to such helix frequency inference when revisiting the use of compensatory mutation experiments for RNA structure read out through SHAPE chemical mapping (selective 2´-hydroxyl acylation with primer extension) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian and Das, 2016</xref>). Mutate-map-rescue (M<sup>2</sup>R) experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) enable incisive confirmation or falsification of candidate base pairs. Strong evidence for a candidate base pair comes from observations that mutation of either side of a base pair (mutant A or mutant B) disrupts the SHAPE profile of the RNA; and that the compensatory double mutation (mutant AB) restores the SHAPE measurements to the wild type (WT) profile. In our prior work on a four-helix junction from the <italic>E. coli</italic> 16S ribosomal RNA (nts 126–235), we were able to successfully use such ‘quartets’ of SHAPE profiles (WT, mutant A, mutant B, mutant AB) to discriminate between three conflicting structural models derived from prior SHAPE data on the wild type RNA alone, from mutate-and-map data (SHAPE profiles of all single mutants), and from phylogenetic and crystallographic models of the protein-bound ribosome (illustrative data for three base pairs given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). However, we were also initially surprised to observe compensatory rescue for helices that should have been mutually exclusive in the 16S rRNA. These helices involved the same nucleotides partnered to nucleotides differing by a single-nucleotide register shift (P4a and shift-P4a, not to be confused with P4A in the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch; see blue and green base pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Resolving this paradox, studies on designed mutants and quantitative fits suggested that both registers were indeed present but in different subsets of the RNA’s structural ensemble, at helix frequencies of ~20% and~80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In our studies on the 16S rRNA four-way junction, the strongly populated helix shift-P4a was associated with mutate-map-rescue data that showed unambiguous rescue while the less populated helix P4a was associated with ‘partial’ rescue. In the latter case, disruptions in SHAPE reactivity induced by single mutations were alleviated by their concomitant compensatory mutation, but new features distinct from the wild type SHAPE profile also appeared (yellow arrow, bottom panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We speculated that such ‘partial rescue’ might generally be a hallmark of base pairs that are present at low frequency in an RNA’s structural ensemble. We envisioned the structural ensembles shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, illustrating a case where a candidate base pair is present at 50% frequency in the wild type RNA structural ensemble (structures with gold highlight rectangle in top left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The compensatory double mutant (structures with gold highlight rectangle in bottom right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) might retain the structures with the candidate base pair at approximately 50% frequency, while the other members of the structural ensemble would be more likely to rearrange (bottom structure of bottom right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The single mutants would rearrange all structures, including the ones that had the target base pair (other structures, bottom left and top right panels, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), providing an assessment of the maximum level of disruption that might be restored by the compensatory mutant. In general, however, this picture is not expected to be exact. Some compensatory double mutations might over- or under- stabilize the structures with the target base pair. The RNA may also be excessively sensitive or insensitive to disruption by single mutations. Therefore, we expected that testing all the base pairs of a target helix through separate mutate-map-rescue experiments for each base pair would be critical for assessing helix frequencies, and a careful treatment of uncertainties would be important for establishing statistical confidence.</p><p>To test this idea, we first developed a quantitative ‘rescue factor’ metric that allowed us to avoid human inspection that might bias assessments:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">R</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">u</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">f</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo form="prefix" movablelimits="true">max</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">W</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">T</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mspace width="negativethinmathspace"/><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where the root mean squared difference <italic>RMSD</italic> between two SHAPE profiles <italic>d</italic> over probed nucleotides <italic>i</italic> = 1 to <italic>N</italic> is given by:<disp-formula id="equ5"><label>(5)</label><mml:math id="m5"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A,B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation (4)</xref>, the term <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>WT</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>AB</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula> captures the extent of rescue, as compared to a maximal amount of disruption of the SHAPE profile given by the maximum of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>WT,A</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced> <mml:mi/></mml:math></inline-formula>and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>WT,B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>. We confirmed that this rescue factor recovered expert assessments for presence or absence of rescue in the previous 16S rRNA data as well as in newly collected M<sup>2</sup>R experimental data, including the <italic>Tetrahymena</italic> ribozyme P4-P6 domain and a blind RNA-puzzle modeling challenge, the GIR1 lariat capping ribozyme (Materials and Methods and Appendix Results). We also developed a separate category-based classification to check that compensatory rescue of different base pairs within the same helix gave concordant results, and again that automated analysis reproduced manual analysis (Appendix Results).</p><p>We then sought to test our hypothesis of a quantitative relationship between rescue factor and helix frequency in an RNA’s structural ensemble. To accumulate good statistics and ensure good comparisons to ‘ground truth’, we carried out simulations of M<sup>2</sup>R experiments for structural ensembles of hundreds of naturally derived RNA sequences using the <italic>RNAstructure</italic> simulation package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Reuter and Mathews, 2010</xref>. These in silico tests confirmed that observation of strong rescue over all the base pairs of a helix implies high helix frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Importantly, these tests also showed that modest rescue ratios could be informative. Values lower than one but greater than zero corresponded to ‘partial’ rescue, where the reactivities at some nucleotides revert to wild type (WT) values but others do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, center). As expected, individual base pair tests were noisy, but averaging rescue factors over tests on three or more base pairs gave values that showed a striking correlation with helix frequencies (compare gray and black points, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, absence of rescue (rescue factor close to zero; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, bottom) gave upper bounds on the helix frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). To estimate uncertainties in these estimates, we used a Bayesian framework to derive posterior probabilities of each helix frequency given the observed rescue factor, calibrated based on these simulations. These posterior probability distributions represent our belief, informed by experiment, at all helix frequencies from 0% to 100% and provide a complete representation of our uncertainty; ‘fatter’ distributions correspond to larger uncertainties in helix frequencies. For ease of reading in the main text and in summary tables, we give median values of the helix frequency posterior probability distributions. Our simulation and experimental studies suggested that compensatory rescue measurements, including ones that resulted in partial or no detectable rescue, could be used to estimate helix frequencies and uncertainties for those values, though we sought more detailed experimental tests, as described next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Tests of helix frequency estimation on wild type add riboswitch sequence</title><p>To test the applicability of M<sup>2</sup>R helix frequency estimation for understanding complex RNA structural ensembles, we first applied the method to the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch with and without adenine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).

Indeed, aptamer helices P1 (53%) and P2 (31%) were detectable, as they gave partial rescue in mutate-map-rescue experiments. For illustration, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> shows SHAPE profile quartets and rescue factors for each base pair of P1; the inferred probability distributions over P1 helix frequencies is given as a gold curve underneath, and extends across helix frequencies ranging from 0.2 to 0.75.

For example, numerous P1- or P2-locking mutants exhibited increased reactivity in the distal gene expression platform region (nts 105–122) relative to the adenine-free WT RNA, at a level comparable to the adenine-bound WT RNA. This observation already suggested that mutation-based locking of P1 or P2 opens the gene expression platform, favoring the MWC model over the non-MWC model, although it depends on an assumption that increase in SHAPE reactivity correlates with reduced base pairing, which does not always hold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cordero et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deng et al., 2016</xref>). We also observed similarities in the gene expression platform between these adenine-free P1 and P2-stabilizing mutants and adenine-bound WT RNA in profiles acquired with chemical modifiers besides SHAPE reagents (dimethyl sulfate, glyoxal, ribonuclease V1, terbium(III), and ultraviolet irradiation at 302 nm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). For other helices P1B, P4A, and P4B, we were able to find double-base-pair mutants that gave similar SHAPE profiles to each other, supporting the use of those mutants as helix-locked variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Interestingly, for each of these three target helices, there was one double-base-pair mutant with spikes in SHAPE reactivity at positions 78 and 85, which also appear in the wild type RNA but not the P1 or P2-lock mutants (red arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This observation suggested that these double-base-pair mutants for P1B, P4A, and P4B stabilized the same state; we therefore chose these variants as the lock mutants. Further evidence that these mutants were appropriately locked came from excellent two-state fits that recovered the adenine-free wild type chemical mapping profiles across five modifiers from the profile for any of these P1B- P4A- or P4B- lock mutants with the profiles for any of the P1 or P2-locking mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). (P2B and P4C were short two-base-pair helices; since only one candidate double-base-pair lock mutation could be tested and did not allow such cross-checks, we chose to not go forward with P2B and P4C locking experiments.)</p><p>Compensatory mutation experiments in locked mutation backgrounds allowed us to confidently determine whether MWC-predicted anticorrelations exist in the adenine-free structural ensemble of the riboswitch. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> shows M<sup>2</sup>R data for the P1 helix in the context of P4B-stabilizing mutations (lock-P4B; U82A, C83G, G115C, A116U). In contrast to the observation of partial rescue of P1 in the wild type RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), these data show no rescue for P1 in the lock-P4B mutational background. The inferred P4B helix frequency drops from 53%% to 5%; the shift in posterior probability distribution to lower helix frequency values is clear (faded gold to gold curves; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Stated simply, locking P4B strongly reduces P1. These results support the anticorrelation between P1 and P4B expected from the MWC model, as opposed to the independence of the helices expected from the non-MWC model.</p><p>To statistically evaluate the MWC vs. non-MWC model, we computed the correlation value <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext>(P1,P4B)</mml:mtext></mml:math></inline-formula> through <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation (2)</xref>, taking into account the full uncertainties in helix frequencies shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>.

The posterior support for the non-MWC model [<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mtext>(P1,P4B)</mml:mtext><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>] from this ‘flipped’ lock-P1 experiment is somewhat higher than the lock-P4B experiment above, but still small (0.039; full posterior distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). If the data for the two experiments are combined, the posterior support for the non-MWC model becomes quite small, 4 × 10<sup>–5</sup>.

Therefore, a single secondary structure such as <italic>apoB</italic> may not be an appropriate description of the structural ensemble. Further evidence for structural heterogeneity came from the incomplete match in SHAPE profiles for mutants that lock different helices of the putative <italic>apoB</italic> state. For example, lock-P4A and lock-P1B showed reproducible differences in SHAPE reactivities at the 5´ end of the RNA (nts 13–20) that were larger than, e.g., differences between lock-P1 and lock-P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and we did not discover any alternative locking mutations that brought them into agreement.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Four-dimensional chemical mapping for complex RNA ensembles</title><p>Complex secondary structure ensembles underlie many, and perhaps most, RNA regulatory elements. Understanding how a panoply of structures underlies the allosteric mechanism of these elements requires assessing not just the frequencies of different helices in the RNA structural ensemble but how the presence of one helix enhances or suppresses the frequency of others. This study has introduced a ‘four-dimensional’ expansion of chemical mapping that offers an experimental route to this information. The strategy is to ‘lock’ one helix into place through mutations (dimension 1) and to then introduce mutations elsewhere (dimension 2). Perturbation of the chemical mapping profile at other nucleotides (dimension 3) provides evidence of involvement by the mutated nucleotide in RNA structure, perhaps a second helix. If compensatory mutation of a candidate partner in the second helix (dimension 4) then gives no, partial, or complete rescue of the mapping profile, the frequency of the second helix can be inferred to be low, medium, or high, with uncertainties estimated from simulation. Importantly, quantitative inferences of helix-helix correlations from this lock-mutate-map-rescue (LM<sup>2</sup>R) workflow do not require interpretation of how SHAPE reactivity corresponds to Watson-Crick pairing probability, which can lead to erroneous conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tian et al., 2014</xref>). In that sense, the method is analogous to three-dimensional and four-dimensional pulse sequences that enable structural conclusions to be derived from NMR. Inferences from multidimensional NMR are based on the changes of spectroscopic signals (chemical shifts, magnetization transfer rates) rather than on absolute values of those signals, whose relationships to features of macromolecule structure are not yet understood in quantitative detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wüthrich, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The LM<sup>2</sup>R method currently has limitations regarding the length of RNAs that can be probed. The current throughput of PCR assembly and capillary electrophoretic sequencing enables single-nucleotide-resolution mapping of approximately 192 constructs per experiment at the signal-to-noise needed for statistically sound conclusions. With this throughput, in vitro dissection of the co-occurrence or anticorrelation of helices underlying a ~ 120 nucleotide RNA domain was feasible over a 1–2 month period. However, for RNAs much longer than 200 nucleotides, the expense and time of preparing mutations would likely become prohibitive.</p><p>The LM<sup>2</sup>R method also currently has limitations regarding which kinds of functional elements can be interrogated for correlation or anticorrelation. Our study has focused on helix elements, which can be selectively probed and selectively locked through mutation of helix base pairs. However, other functional elements in RNA folding and gene regulation include single-stranded regions and non-Watson-Crick pairings that underlie tertiary structure. For example, in the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch the functional elements in gene expression are the single-stranded AUG and Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site. We used the helices in the P4 domain to allow locking and probing (by compensatory rescue) of this region. A more general approach to lock and probe such single-stranded elements might be to sequester them with designed oligonucleotide probes and to assess dissociation constants for such probes, respectively. For tertiary contacts or non-Watson-Crick paired junctions, it is less clear how to generally lock the elements or to carry out compensatory mutagenesis to probe the elements, in which case, LM<sup>2</sup>R may need to continue relying on Watson-Crick helices near these elements as proxies.</p><p>As a final caveat, the current LM<sup>2</sup>R method relies on the RNA system being at equilibrium so that the correlation <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1 equ2 equ3">Equations (1)-(3)</xref> are valid and also so that extensive computer simulations can be carried out that allow conversion of observed rescue factors to helix frequencies. It will be important to evaluate whether LM<sup>2</sup>R, or some time-dependent extension of the method, could be applied to RNAs that change their structures in non-equilibrium scenarios involving co-transcriptional RNA folding, recruitment of energy-dissipating machines like the ribosome or RNA polymerase, or other behaviors that depend on intrinsically kinetic mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yanofsky, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Watters et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title><italic>Resolving the core mechanism of the</italic> add <italic>riboswitch</italic></title><p>This work demonstrates application of four-dimensional chemical mapping to resolve a fundamental biochemical question.

In LM<sup>2</sup>R experiments locking P1 and P2, which are specific to the aptameric secondary structure, the rescue data showed depletion of P4 helices that would sequester the ribosome binding site.

This model is consistent with all data collected in this study as well as all measurements on the <italic>V. vulnificus add</italic> riboswitch published to date. First, a number of prior studies applied techniques that do not directly read out base pairing but are sensitive to ligand binding and can quantify energetics and kinetics. Functional measurements in vitro and in vivo, use of fluorescent reporters, and single-molecule force experiments all have suggested that the riboswitch is rather ‘leaky’, forming the aptamer secondary structure at ~40% frequency at 20–30°C, even without adenine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lemay et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mandal and Breaker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Batey, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cordero and Das, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stoddard et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rieder et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neupane et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lemay et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenleaf et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wickiser et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lemay and Lafontaine, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reining et al., 2013</xref>). Second, X-ray crystallographic studies have been limited to constructs with just the aptameric region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stagno et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stoddard et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang and Ferré-D'Amaré, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gilbert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards and Batey, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Serganov et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daldrop et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delfosse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gilbert et al., 2007</xref>); these structures all show P1, P2, and P3 helices, in accord with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Third, the detailed NMR measurements that suggested the alternative <italic>apoA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) were also consistent with the <italic>apoA</italic> base pairings in the MWC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) spectroscopy unambiguously established that pairings in both P1 and P4A occur in the absence of adenine, but could not infer whether these helices might co-occur or be mutually exclusive; our LM<sup>2</sup>R data strongly support the latter scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Fourth, analogous to our locking approach, the NMR study used a variant MutP2 (A29C, A30G, U40C, U41G) to stabilize the aptamer secondary structure. While our chemical mapping measurements suggest that this mutant only partially stabilizes P2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), both the NMR study and our LM<sup>2</sup>R measurements detect suppression of P4A in this background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), supporting the anticorrelation between P2 and P4A in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Fifth, our SHAPE and multi-probe chemical mapping data suggest partial opening of P5 in <italic>apoA</italic> and <italic>holo</italic> (brown curves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), and our LM<sup>2</sup>R analysis suggests only partial formation of P2B and P1B when P4A is locked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These observations are again consistent with NMR studies which could unambiguously detect P5 and estimate relative frequencies of, e.g., P2 vs. P2B, but could not establish these helices’ absolute frequencies. Sixth, newer single molecule FRET measurements detect transient formation of the L2/L3 tertiary contact prior to adenine binding (dashed lines in <italic>apoA</italic> of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and stabilization upon adenine binding to <italic>holo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warhaut et al., 2017</xref>). These data are consistent with, and indeed were interpreted within, an MWC framework in which formation of the aptameric secondary structure occurs in concert with opening of the gene expression platform, even without adenine ligand present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Warhaut et al., 2017</xref>). Seventh, the prior detailed NMR analysis led to a compelling model of riboswitch temperature robustness that involves compensating the improving affinity of the aptamer for adenine at colder temperatures by a pre-equilibrium that favored <italic>apoB</italic> over <italic>apoA</italic> at those temperatures. Although the precise predictions of the switching efficiencies of this model are affected by whether <italic>apoA</italic> involves opening the gene expression platform, approximately the same temperature compensation occurs in the MWC conformational selection model (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>There is now concordance across numerous measurements for an MWC model that posits strong secondary structure similarities between an <italic>apoA</italic> state that transiently forms the aptamer secondary structure without adenine ligand and the ligand-bound <italic>holo</italic> state. We also propose herein that further heterogeneity is likely to be present in members of the <italic>apo</italic> ensemble that do not present the aptamer secondary structure, grouped into <italic>apoB</italic>. LM<sup>2</sup>R measurements indicate weak or no correlation of the tested signature helices of <italic>apoB</italic> (P1B, P4A, and P4B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Furthermore, numerous alternative secondary structures are possible for this state (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The presence of these myriad alternative helices, each at low population, would explain their detection difficulty with this and prior bulk equilibrium techniques but their appearance in single-molecule measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neupane et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting this picture, higher-order M<sup>2</sup> analysis in single mutant backgrounds isolate and confirm numerous alternative secondary structures for the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). We note that there are no functional reasons for the <italic>apoB</italic> ensemble to maintain a single secondary structure – it simply has to disallow adenine binding while keeping the gene expression platform closed in P4. Without selection for a pure single structure, we therefore suggest that <italic>apoB</italic> has remained structurally heterogeneous, and the exact populations of its helix pairings outside the P4 domain may shift in different solution conditions and flanking sequences while still being compatible with riboswitch function. We further speculate that ‘non-functional’ states of other riboswitches and RNA gene regulatory modules may have highly heterogeneous structures and, indeed, this feature might explain why those states have been refractory to conventional structural biology approaches developed primarily to dissect protein structure/function.

measurements</title><p>Before carrying out extensive mutagenesis and compensatory rescue experiments, we tested whether one-dimensional SHAPE profiling on the WT RNA might discriminate between MWC and non-MWC models (main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the absence of adenine, the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch SHAPE profile (main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed protections and exposures throughout the aptamer region (nts 14–80), and incubation with 5 mM adenine gave reduced reactivity throughout this region, consistent with formation of P1, P2, and P3, and RNA tertiary structure formation at and around the adenine binding pocket, as expected for the <italic>holo</italic> state. In addition, weak adenine-dependent increases in SHAPE reactivity in the expression platform, the Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding site and the AUG codon (nts 112–122), supported the adenine-coupled opening of the expression platform that is the hallmark of riboswitch function (main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In between these two regions, nucleotides 105–111 also modestly increased in SHAPE reactivity upon adenine binding, although, in both the MWC and non-MWC models, this segment is predicted to be sequestered into a P5 helix in all states (main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). However, this observation can be accommodated into both the MWC and non-MWC models by assuming partial opening of P5 in the adenine-bound <italic>holo</italic> state (see Discussion) and therefore does not discriminate between the models.</p><p>Overall, while consistent with available models, these SHAPE data do not discriminate between them due to difficulties in interpreting these data: changes in SHAPE reactivity do not necessarily reflect changes in base pairing frequencies. Nucleotides that do not form Watson-Crick pairs can appear protected or reactive depending on changes in their local environment. Conversely, nucleotides that form Watson-Crick pairs can appear partially reactive, especially if the pairs are at the edges of helices. For these reasons, we turned to mutate-and-map measurements (described next) and higher-dimensional techniques (compensatory rescue; described in the main text) that do not require detailed interpretations of the absolute reactivity values at particular nucleotides, but rather changes in reactivities integrated across all nucleotides.</p><p>Prior to rescue experiments, which involve double compensatory mutants, we systematically scanned single mutants of each nucleotide to its complement, followed by SHAPE profiling across the riboswitch, which gave the two-dimensional patterns in main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>. Automated analyses of these mutate-and-map (M<sup>2</sup>) data to determine the dominant secondary structure and to infer an approximate structural ensemble supported both the MWC and non-MWC models but did not carry the precision to discriminate between them (main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s7-2"><title>Mutate-map-rescue (M<sup>2</sup>R) – application generality and automated classification</title><p>Our prior work on mutate-map-rescue (M<sup>2</sup>R) tested RNA structures by disrupting a base pair by single mutation, and testing whether compensatory double mutations restore such perturbations, but relied on manual inspection to assess rescue, and focused on a single model system, a four-way junction domain of <italic>E. coli</italic> 16S rRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tian and Das, 2016</xref>). We first sought to assess the generality of M<sup>2</sup>R approach by applying it to other RNA elements. First, we deployed M<sup>2</sup>R on the lariat-capping GIR1 ribozyme, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>) to test helix P5 from crystallographic model against its alternative version (alt-P5), which was predicted by our M<sup>2</sup>-based model with a 2-register shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). For each base pair tested, we compared the SHAPE profiles of WT (wild type), two single mutants, and the double mutant (rescue) in a ‘quartet’. With the local perturbations caused by single mutants in the P5/alt-P5 region, double mutants based on the P5 successfully restored the SHAPE profile to WT, while double mutants based on the alt-P5 failed to rescue. Thus, M<sup>2</sup>R provided evidence for the P5 helix but not the register-shifted alt-P5, consistent with the crystallographic structure of the ribozyme.

Specifically, we asked: do M<sup>2</sup>R-validated base pairs have high base-pairing probability (BPP) in silico? To answer this question, we sought to automate the calling of M<sup>2</sup>R result with an automated classifier that would evaluate M<sup>2</sup>R data with results matching human inspection, and this study eventually led to the definition of the ‘rescue factor’ applied to the adenine riboswitch. Our first scoring function took into account the following two factors: 1) the amount of perturbation seen in each of the two single mutants, compared to wild type profiles; and 2) the similarity (rescuing effect) between double mutant and WT. We captured the latter effect through a rescue factor metric:<disp-formula id="equ6"><mml:math id="m6"><mml:mtext>Rescue factor</mml:mtext><mml:mo>≡</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mn>1.0</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>–</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>WT</mml:mtext><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mtext>AB</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">max</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>WT,A</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>,</mml:mo> <mml:mi/> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>WT,B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where<disp-formula id="equ7"><mml:math id="m7"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>A,B</mml:mtext><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:munderover><mml:mo movablelimits="false">∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:munderover><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mfenced close="]" open="[" separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msqrt></mml:math></disp-formula>and <italic>d<sub>A</sub></italic> and <italic>d<sub>B</sub></italic> are vectors of normalized SHAPE profiles, with the same length of <italic>N</italic> (see Appendix Methods for further details). The classifier returned a result from three categories: Validated, Falsified, or Uncertain; the last one was assigned for cases where either (1) single mutants failed to introduce discernible perturbations, or (2) the rescuing effect was ‘half-way’ and hard to assign. After training with the in vitro M<sup>2</sup>R data on the GIR1, P4-P6, and IRES measurements as well as in silico simulated counterparts, we obtained a classifier that recovered human expert calls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>).</p><p>Next, we simulated M<sup>2</sup>R in silico on 325 RNA families from the Rfam database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burge et al., 2013</xref>) whose lengths were in range between 100 and 250 nt. More than 37,000 base pairs were tested from helices that were longer than 2 bp and with predicted base pairing probability (BPP) greater than 1%. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref> shows the BPP distribution of the 4-category classification. These results confirmed that the Validated and Falsified categories corresponded to base pairs with high and low BPP. Unexpectedly, we also observed a quantitative correlation between the in silico predicted BPP and the ‘rescue factor’ metric that underlies our classification, even for base pairs that appear with BPP frequencies between 0.3 and 0.7 (main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Furthermore, for helices of longer length, this relationship became more well-defined. We reasoned that this correlation would enable estimation of BPP based on helix length and the ‘rescue factor’ metrics measured and averaged over all the base pairs for a given helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>), and that this quantitative metric would be more informative than a qualitative 4-category classification. Further support for using the ‘rescue factor’ to estimate a posterior probability for tested helix frequencies arose from our studies on the adenine riboswitch with and without adenine, which could be compared to ‘gold standard’ helix frequency estimates from NMR analysis, as described in the main text.</p><fig id="app1fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29602.030</object-id><label>Appendix 1—figure 3.</label><caption><title>Performance of 4-bin auto-score classifier.</title><p>Histogram of in silico (<bold>A</bold>) training data (16S-FWJ, P4P6, GIR1, Hox, PB2; total of 162 quartets), (<bold>B</bold>) test data (<italic>add</italic> single and double base-pair M<sup>2</sup>R; total of 242 quartets), and (<bold>C</bold>) Rfam family (total of 62484 quartets) simulations are shown by their classification, and grouped by the in silico predicted base-pairing probability (BPP).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29602-app1-fig3-v2"/></fig></sec><sec id="s7-3"><title>Current limitations of M<sup>2</sup>R and classifier</title><p>We trained an automated classifier based on previous M<sup>2</sup>R in vitro data combined with in silico simulations.

To stringently test the prediction, we expanded our chemical mapping protocol to include five additional modifiers beyond SHAPE: DMS (dimethyl sulfate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cordero et al., 2012b</xref>), glyoxal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banerjee et al., 1993</xref>), RNase V1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zou and Ouyang, 2015</xref>), terbium(III) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hargittai and Musier-Forsyth, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Harris and Walter, 2003</xref>), and ultraviolet irradiation at 302 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kladwang et al., 2012</xref>), giving a total number of 1920 measurements measured in three sequences that would test a two-state partitioning. As expected from the model of <italic>apoA</italic> vs. <italic>apoB</italic>, these multiple modifier profiles varied significantly between the lock-P1 and lock-P4A mutants, especially in the expression platform regions (see, e.g., nts 98–112).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Anna Marie Pyle (Reviewer #3), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Alain Laederach (Reviewer #2); Philip Bevilacqua (Reviewer #4).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All three reviewers were enthusiastic about the quality and significance of the work, but there were also serious concerns about the clarity and presentation of the manuscript. As written, reviewers felt that the paper would lack the impact that it deserves and made numerous suggestions for rewriting. Several important scientific issues were also raised and these will need to be rigorously addressed. With these changes and modifications, the reviewers are confident that this will be a high impact paper of major significance to the field of RNA structure and folding.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Each reviewer has indicated specific problems with the writing and presentation and these will all need to be addressed. The revised manuscript must be clear and comprehensible to the RNA community. There are specific scientific criticisms, such as point 8 from reviewer 3 that must be addressed in the revised text as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Tian and coworkers the authors analyze a remarkable structural data set they collected on the <italic>V. vulnificus</italic> riboswitch to address a very basic question about the underlying allostery governing its main mechanism of action. The precise question being interrogated is whether a population shift model really explains RNA allostery is this model or whether an alternative model is better as has been suggested in other studies. The resulting data, based on &quot;locked ensemble&quot; analyses demonstrated with the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> provides compelling evidence for the MWC model. Furthermore, the approach here is a completely novel application of SHAPE probing combined with mutation and mapping to answer a very fundamental biophysical question about RNA folding.</p><p>My one criticism of the paper, and I believe this is just a presentation issue is on the biological significance and generalizability of these results. I believe the authors could do a better job of explaining to the more biologically oriented reader why it is important to the function of RNA in the cell why RNA using a population shift model is important. Furthermore, I think the authors should take the time to (re)-explain why understanding folding in this system is &quot;paradigmatic&quot; and what the possible biological ramifications are of understanding the folding of the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch at this level of detail. As such I recommend the following major revisions:</p><p>1) I think the major reasoning for this study needs to be better illustrated and explained. It is important to remind the reader that the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch being studied is the aptamer domain of a regulatory switch and that allosteric interactions are likely key to the regulatory mechanism. Can the authors explain how functional regulation might differ under both folding models, perhaps even predict how each model would impact the kinetics? I think some kind of &quot;cartoon&quot; figure would go a long way to explaining this.</p><p>2) Similarly I think a workflow figure of some type is needed to explain how studying each &quot;locked ensemble&quot; can then be reintegrated into a more general understanding of allostery and folding mechanism. I hate to ask for more cartoons, but the authors need to somehow make this concept clearer in their presentation of their work.</p><p>3) More fundamentally there are some underlying assumptions here that it is possible to lock conformations. The design strategy for these different molecules needs to be better explained as well as the rationale for then being able to reintegrate each individual molecule’s unique folding properties into a general model of WT folding.</p><p>4) As impressive as the number and meta-analysis of all the mutate and map data is, I think the authors could move a lot of the data they show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to the supplement to focus more on the concepts and their biophysical interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this paper, the authors utilize an expanded form of the mutate and map procedure to dissect intermediate states involved in folding and activation of a riboswitch and to resolve controversies about the structural states that are actually visited in the ligand-free state. This is an area of intense interest because structural studies on riboswitches conducted to date do not actually explain how the riboswitch is kept OFF, as the ligand-free forms of these molecules can sample structural states that still expose the ribosome binding. This is an important paper and a rigorous study that exemplifies the power of RNA mapping studies for quantitative analysis of RNA folding.</p><p>Unfortunately, the paper suffers from two major flaws that prevent the authors from effectively making what are important points for the community.</p><p>1) This paper gets in its own way: It is written in confusing, convoluted language and important points are made using terms that are undefined and will be opaque to much of the RNA structural biology community. The authors are attempting to convey complex ideas in this paper, using a new approach that is inherently complex. This is an impossible task without clear, precise language and terminology.</p><p>2) The authors fail to utilize their figures as display items in support of their ideas. In the text, the authors make specific claims about their data, referring to complicated figures that lack clear notation <italic>on the figure</italic> to direct the reader to the actual result. Even in cases where the figures are intuitively interpretable, effects are small and therefore it is essential that the authors explain the figures more carefully, indicating exactly what they mean in the text.</p><p>Specific additional comments are below:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the language is quite opaque, which makes an already complicated system even more difficult to understand. Example: &quot;ligand binding to an aptamer region of the RNA shifts a pre- existing equilibrium between strikingly different secondary structures, resulting in allosteric exposure or sequestration of another sequence-distal region harboring a ribosome binding site or other gene expression platform (Fernández-Luna and Miranda-Ríos, 2008; Gilbert and Batey, 2006; Breaker, 2012).&quot; Even sophisticated readers will not know what &quot;allosteric exposure&quot; or &quot;sequestration&quot; mean in this context. The authors are actually explaining a simple phenomenon, but they need to use clear language that is not cluttered with jargon and terms with multiple meanings. Interestingly, and noted later in this review, the goals of this paper are clearly articulated within the Results section, suggesting that a rearrangement of the text and of the ideas might result in greater clarity (see point 6, below).</p><p>2) In paragraph 2 of the Introduction, in part due to the problem stated above, the authors have not clearly articulated the discrepancy between models, nor have they defined what exactly is meant by &quot;allosteric logic&quot;.</p><p>3) Again, the authors have not explained their premise well: &quot;Briefly, if mutation of either side of a base pair (mutant A or mutant B) disrupts the reactivities at other nucleotides in the RNA, but the compensatory double mutation (mutant AB) restores the SHAPE reactivities to the wild type (WT) profile, these observations suggest that the two sites were base paired in the starting WT sequence. Our prior work assumed that such observed compensation would arise with negligible probability if the mutated nucleotides were not paired.&quot; This reader was completely confused by this statement. What is different from the assumption in the prior work? I think the meaning got lost in the double negative describing the prior work, but I cannot be sure what he means.</p><p>4) Subsection “Inferring helix frequencies through quantitative compensatory rescue”. Please clearly define exactly what is meant by &quot;helix frequency&quot; in the text. On what experimental metric is it deduced and how is it calculated? If it is in the Materials and methods, then refer to that in the Results section &quot;Helix frequency is defined as XXX and it was calculated as described in Materials and methods&quot;.</p><p>5) &quot;[…] median values of the helix frequency posterior probability distributions&quot;. What is the meaning of &quot;posterior&quot; in this context? Helix frequency distribution has not even been clearly defined yet – so it is vexing that there is now a posterior form of it.</p><p>6) Subsection “The <italic>add</italic> riboswitch system”, first two paragraphs. In the Results, the authors finally articulate the structural issues that are being examined in the paper. Almost the entire content of those paragraphs should be used as the Introduction, rather than the present musing on allostery. For example, the reader needs to learn that &quot;The major uncertainty regards what happens when adenine is not present but the RNA nevertheless samples a secondary structure poised to bind adenine, with P1, P2, and P3 formed. This state is termed apoA.&quot; It would be clearer to emphasize this right from the beginning, rather than initiating the paper with a treatise on allostery.</p><p>7) &quot;Unexpectedly, in between these two regions, nucleotides 105-111 also modestly increased in SHAPE reactivity upon adenine binding, although, in both the MWC and non-MWC models, this segment is predicted to be sequestered into a P5 helix in all states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).&quot; This sounds really interesting, but if one looks closely at the figure and lines up nucleotides 105-111, the effect being referred to is small, and potentially attributable to partial stacking of this region near the helix rather than helical formation itself. This reviewer is concerned that the authors are overinterpreting the small effects that are side-effects of the SHAPE method itself (see point 8).</p><p>8) A general criticism of the science rather than the writing: A potential flaw in the analysis is the strict interpretation of SHAPE signals in this analysis: The authors assume that shape data can be interpreted in a strictly binary way – representing a population of paired or unpaired duplexes. But SHAPE reactivity is not strictly indicative of base pairing and instead reflects the relative &quot;floppiness&quot; of a 2'-OH – not whether it is paired or not. As a result, there can be partially ordered conformations, and conformationally restricted conformations of a motif that is not double stranded yet can give SHAPE protections of varying magnitude. These issues raise concern about the focus on subtle effects being studied by the investigators.</p><p>9) Another result that sounds really interesting but is difficult to discern from the data presented: &quot;Compared to the WT sequence, many of these mutants gave protections or enhancements in the 5 ́-most aptamer region of the riboswitch (nts 25-32) and concomitant exposures or protections (respectively) near the 3 ́ end of the riboswitch (nts 105- 122), which included both the start codon and Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>).&quot; Exactly where in the figures is this shown? It must be indicated on the display item.</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>: Please define &quot;cumulative posterior possibility&quot; in the Results portion of the text (or better yet, come up with a term that is simpler), as an understanding of the parameter is a prerequisite for analyzing the data presented.</p><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and throughout text: If the MWC model is correct, then why isn't the riboswitch constitutively ON 40% of the time in the absence of adenine? Or is the level of &quot;leaky&quot; expression commensurate with the authors' estimates of the population of this state?</p><p>12) &quot;Similarly, compensatory rescue targeting P2 gave a significant helix frequency (42%) when P1 was locked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As a further check, both models under question predicted the absence of P4A in apoA; indeed, in either the lock-P1 or lock-P2 background, we did not detect compensatory rescue targeting P4A, and could set an upper bound on its frequency of 4%. Finally, we tested the helix frequency of P4B, which was predicted to be absent (0%) in apoA by the MWC model and present (100%) in the non-MWC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).&quot; This is interesting, but the authors do not indicate exactly which parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> support this model. They simply refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which is a complex figure lacking any direction to the reader. One cannot evaluate the veracity of the authors' claim.</p><p>13) Last paragraph of the Results: Again, the authors need to refer directly to the features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref> that support the helix frequencies being described in the text, and presumably graphed in parts E and F. When inspected by this reviewer, the display items in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> did not clearly indicate the results claimed. They need to be indicated on the display and referred to in the text.</p><p>14) First paragraph of the Discussion: &quot;Four-dimensional chemical mapping offers an experimental route to this information that is unique in its high throughput and use of standard equipment (capilly electrophoretic sequencers).&quot; It is clear from the data provided in this paper that this is not a high throughput method, in fact it is quite the contrary. Also: one presumes that the authors mean &quot;capillary&quot;. Any reference to this being a simple or high throughput experiment should be removed, as it unfairly inflates expectations within the community of the methods that should be reasonably applied in structural studies any other RNA molecule.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic> </p><p>Tian and co-workers provide a deep, high-resolution picture of structural transitions in a functional RNA molecule, the adenine riboswitch using a method they pioneered called &quot;lock-mutate-map-rescue&quot;. The authors lock various helices in place through mutations and then judge the effects on the remainder of the molecule via HT rescue experiments. The results favor the famous MWC model originally developed to explain allostery in proteins via conformational selection. The authors clearly address work of another study on the subject and the issue of whether in the absence of ligand the binding site is open, and the concern that existing data support both MWC and non-MWC models. The authors' work has been tested statistically using Bayesian statistics. Importantly, they show that conventional 1D SHAPE experiments cannot differentiate between MWC and non-MWC models, motivating their current approach. Mutants are made that stabilize P1 and P2 that are outside of the critical P4 switch helix, and neither favor formation of P4B. And the converse experiment of locking P4B did not form P1 and P2. This led to the main finding, which is that gene expression is ON even in the absence of ligand as long as the aptamer is folded, albeit rarely sans ligand. This is an important and influential finding.</p><p>We have two major concerns.</p><p>1) At many times the paper is very difficult to follow. Figures are often not described in a way that the reader can access. The language is at times highly specialized and ill defined. If the authors can explain their data in an accessible way, it will greatly increase the impact of the findings.</p><p>2) While an elegant method, 4D chemical mapping is not without its concerns. Our only major concern is the general assumption that locking a helix informs on the natural RNA conformational switch. Could locking a helix prevent certain natural pathways that involve transient interactions between helices, such as pseudoknots involving helices themselves, including defects, or could a lock prevent the need to transiently unfold a helix during the switching.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29602.097</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] My one criticism of the paper, and I believe this is just a presentation issue is on the biological significance and generalizability of these results.

We now state in first paragraph of introduction: “If these multiple states could be characterized in detail and quantitatively modeled, they would offer potential new substrates for biological control and new targets for antibiotic development.” Later in the Introduction, “Understanding the mechanism of allostery is particularly important for developing strategies for controlling riboswitches.

I think some kind of &quot;cartoon&quot; figure would go a long way to explaining this.</p></disp-quote><p>We now devote more space in the Introduction to explain how the short length and early modeling of the <italic>add</italic> system has made it paradigmatic in studies of RNA conformational change: “A particularly well-studied – but still incompletely understood – example of an allosteric RNA is the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch, a ~120-nucleotide element that resides in the 5´ untranslated region (UTR) of the <italic>add</italic> adenosine deaminase mRNA of human pathogenic bacterium <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>. […] Almost all work on the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch to date have assumed some variation of a Monod-Wyman-Changeux model (MWC, also called</p><p>‘conformational selection’ or ‘population shift’ models)”. For related issues on presentation raised by reviewer #3, please see below. For a discussion of kinetic mechanisms (which we cannot currently probe), please see response to reviewer #4 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Similarly I think a workflow figure of some type is needed to explain how studying each &quot;locked ensemble&quot; can then be reintegrated into a more general understanding of allostery and folding mechanism. I hate to ask for more cartoons, but the authors need to somehow make this concept clearer in their presentation of their work.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree that the workflow was not clear from the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. In fact, in discussions with other colleagues and from these reviews, we realized that a more fundamental point of confusion was in defining the question. We have therefore dramatically changed the presentation to define a single ‘binary’ question addressed in the manuscript: is there strong anticorrelation or correlation between the functional elements at play in the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch.</p><p>We have eliminated the prior <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, and indeed any other figures from our original manuscript that show base pairing probability matrices, which are not necessary for understanding the experimental method or the question, and were confusing.</p><p>Instead, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> now shows cartoons of structural ensembles in MWC vs. non-MWC models, and defines the question in terms of a correlation value. The first section of Results is entirely new, and explains why we need to define the question in terms of correlations, and why locking one helix and measuring the frequency change of other helices can answer the question. Again, given the importance of this conceptual background, we give explicit illustrations of the possible models. For example, we have added a paragraph to the first section of results: “More quantitatively, suppose that P1 and P4B arise with 50% frequency in the ligand-free <italic>add</italic> riboswitch structural ensemble. If there is no allosteric ‘communication’ between these two elements, the joint frequency of observing both P1 and P4B should be 50% x 50% = 25% […]”, and this discussion corresponds to new cartoon panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) More fundamentally there are some underlying assumptions here that it is possible to lock conformations. The design strategy for these different molecules needs to be better explained as well as the rationale for then being able to reintegrate each individual molecule’s unique folding properties into a general model of WT folding.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree – we now give a new main text <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that shows how different locking mutants for each helix produce SHAPE profiles that are distinct with wild type but similar to each other; this cross-comparison provided important consistency checks that we were locking the targeted helices through independent mutations. Furthermore, we describe two-state fits that demonstrate recovery of wild type SHAPE, DMS, and other data based on mixtures of profiles from the lock mutants. There is now a more careful discussion of these mutants in the Results, in the paragraph that begins with “To identify appropriate locking mutants, we noted that a number of double-base-pair compensatory mutants for P1, P2, P1A, P4A, and P4B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) exhibited SHAPE profiles that differed from WT RNA but agreed well with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) […]”.</p><p>In particular, we spell out evidence for locking carefully for P1A, P4A, and P4B: “For other helices P1B, P4A, and P4B, we were able to find double-base-pair mutants that gave similar SHAPE profiles to each other, supporting the use of those mutants as helix-locked variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). […] Further evidence that these mutants were appropriately locked came from excellent two-state fits that recovered the adenine-free wild type chemical mapping profiles across five modifiers from the profile for any of these P1B- P4A- or P4B- lock mutants with the profiles for any of the P1 or P2-locking mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).”</p><p>In terms of the rationale for how measurements on mutants allow inferences on the wild type folding, we now give two new panels <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A and 2B</xref> showing how mutate-map-rescue was developed on a prior model system (a four-way junction of the <italic>E. coli</italic> rRNA) and – importantly – cartoons of the structural ensembles that illustrate how results of compensatory mutagenesis provide information on helix frequencies of the wild type.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) As impressive as the number and meta-analysis of all the mutate and map data is, I think the authors could move a lot of the data they show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to the supplement to focus more on the concepts and their biophysical interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that those SHAPE and mutate-and-map data are not necessary for the general reader, and distract from our main point – that we can experimentally probe correlations and anticorrelations. We have moved the mutate-and-map data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> to supplementary figures for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We have moved description of those data to the Supplemental Information. In addition, we have re-focused all main text figures to mainly showing raw data for P1, P4B, and their lock mutants, which illustrate all the relevant measurements and concepts.

Examples include marking “mixed” conformations with red rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; “yellow arrow” marking deviations from compensatory rescue in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; and use of a gold/blue highlighting scheme through all figures to track P1 and P4B as illustration helices.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even in cases where the figures are intuitively interpretable, effects are small and therefore it is essential that the authors explain the figures more carefully, indicating exactly what they mean in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>Similar points were made by reviewers #2 and #4; please see our description of extensive changes in response to both reviewers above and following.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific additional comments are below:</p><p>1) In the Introduction, the language is quite opaque, which makes an already complicated system even more difficult to understand. Example: &quot;ligand binding to an aptamer region of the RNA shifts a pre- existing equilibrium between strikingly different secondary structures, resulting in allosteric exposure or sequestration of another sequence-distal region harboring a ribosome binding site or other gene expression platform (Fernández-Luna and Miranda-Ríos, 2008; Gilbert and Batey, 2006; Breaker, 2012).&quot; Even sophisticated readers will not know what &quot;allosteric exposure&quot; or &quot;sequestration&quot; mean in this context. The authors are actually explaining a simple phenomenon, but they need to use clear language that is not cluttered with jargon and terms with multiple meanings. Interestingly, and noted later in this review, the goals of this paper are clearly articulated within the Results section, suggesting that a rearrangement of the text and of the ideas might result in greater clarity (see point 6, below).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the Introduction was confusing, introducing too many terms without explanation or figure illustration. We have extensively rewritten the Introduction. For example, we eliminated the sentence pointed out by the reviewers in favor of a more concrete picture of an RNA conformational change in the adenine riboswitch (now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, rather than being delayed to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in the original manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In paragraph 2 of the Introduction, in part due to the problem stated above, the authors have not clearly articulated the discrepancy between models, nor have they defined what exactly is meant by &quot;allosteric logic&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now moved significant portions of this more concrete ‘Results’ section up to the Introduction. We have also better spelled out the analogy between the MWC (population shift/conformational selection) mechanism to the classic allosteric mechanism for hemoglobin. We have changed the name ‘allosteric logic’ (which is not really in wide use) to the more conventional ‘allosteric mechanism’ in the title and throughout.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Again, the authors have not explained their premise well: &quot;Briefly, if mutation of either side of a base pair (mutant A or mutant B) disrupts the reactivities at other nucleotides in the RNA, but the compensatory double mutation (mutant AB) restores the SHAPE reactivities to the wild type (WT) profile, these observations suggest that the two sites were base paired in the starting WT sequence. Our prior work assumed that such observed compensation would arise with negligible probability if the mutated nucleotides were not paired.&quot; This reader was completely confused by this statement. What is different from the assumption in the prior work? I think the meaning got lost in the double negative describing the prior work, but I cannot be sure what he means.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated the sentence with the double negative, which was indeed convoluted. To make this abstract statement more concrete, this Results section now presents actual data from our prior study that illustrate cases of complete rescue, no rescue, and partial rescue. Perhaps most importantly, as also suggested by reviewer #2, we include a more detailed cartoon of what is happening to the structural ensemble upon mutations and compensatory mutations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “Inferring helix frequencies through quantitative compensatory rescue”. Please clearly define exactly what is meant by &quot;helix frequency&quot; in the text. On what experimental metric is it deduced and how is it calculated? If it is in the Materials and methods, then refer to that in the Results section &quot;Helix frequency is defined as XXX and it was calculated as described in Materials and methods&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a definition of helix frequency (“Each data point represents a helix whose rescue factor and simulated helix frequency has been averaged across all its base-pairs.”). We also motivate use of the helix frequency better through a new first Results section explaining why we want to look at helix-helix correlations and what that means in terms of helix frequencies as our desired experimental observable. This early section also includes cartoons of the potential structural ensembles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C and D</xref>), which helps clarify why helix frequencies are the relevant observables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;[…] median values of the helix frequency posterior probability distributions&quot;. What is the meaning of &quot;posterior&quot; in this context? Helix frequency distribution has not even been clearly defined yet – so it is vexing that there is now a posterior form of it.</p></disp-quote><p>We neglected to explain terms like posterior distribution, which are used in statistics and Bayesian analysis, but will not be widely known to our target readership. In Results, “These posterior probability distributions represent our belief, informed by experiment, at all helix frequencies from 0% to 100% and provide a complete representation of our uncertainty; ‘fatter’ distributions correspond to larger uncertainties in helix frequencies.” Perhaps most importantly, we now present these distributions over helix frequency as probability density distributions (rather than cumulative probability distributions that rise from 0 to 1, as in our original manuscript) e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and 4. These pictures are more intuitive than the previous cumulative distributions – the peaks in these probability density distributions correspond to the most probable values of the helix frequency and the widths convey uncertainty. In presentations to colleagues here at Stanford, these new pictures have been immediately understandable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Subsection “The add riboswitch system”, first two paragraphs. In the Results, the authors finally articulate the structural issues that are being examined in the paper. Almost the entire content of those paragraphs should be used as the Introduction, rather than the present musing on allostery. For example, the reader needs to learn that &quot;The major uncertainty regards what happens when adenine is not present but the RNA nevertheless samples a secondary structure poised to bind adenine, with P1, P2, and P3 formed. This state is termed apoA.&quot; It would be clearer to emphasize this right from the beginning, rather than initiating the paper with a treatise on allostery.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved most of this section to the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) &quot;Unexpectedly, in between these two regions, nucleotides 105-111 also modestly increased in SHAPE reactivity upon adenine binding, although, in both the MWC and non-MWC models, this segment is predicted to be sequestered into a P5 helix in all states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).&quot; This sounds really interesting, but if one looks closely at the figure and lines up nucleotides 105-111, the effect being referred to is small, and potentially attributable to partial stacking of this region near the helix rather than helical formation itself. This reviewer is concerned that the authors are overinterpreting the small effects that are side-effects of the SHAPE method itself (see point 8).</p><p>8) A general criticism of the science rather than the writing: A potential flaw in the analysis is the strict interpretation of SHAPE signals in this analysis: The authors assume that shape data can be interpreted in a strictly binary way – representing a population of paired or unpaired duplexes. But SHAPE reactivity is not strictly indicative of base pairing and instead reflects the relative &quot;floppiness&quot; of a 2'-OH – not whether it is paired or not. As a result, there can be partially ordered conformations, and conformationally restricted conformations of a motif that is not double stranded yet can give SHAPE protections of varying magnitude. These issues raise concern about the focus on subtle effects being studied by the investigators.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that the subtleties in interpreting SHAPE data preclude use of those data to model structures and structural ensembles, and have published extensively on this information gap (see, e.g., Kladwang et al., “Understanding the Errors of SHAPE-Directed RNA Structure Modeling”, Biochemistry2011 and Tian et al., “High-throughput mutate-map-rescue evaluates SHAPE-directed RNA structure and uncovers excited states”, <italic>RNA</italic> 2014). Indeed, those problems are what motivated us to integrate several layers of mutations with SHAPE to get information that does not rely on specific models for how SHAPE relates to structure or on specific computational models of RNA structure. However, we did not explain that motivation or those caveats well. In the Results section describing estimation of helix frequency from quantitative compensatory rescue, we now start by summarizing a prior study that actually falsified a model guided by SHAPE data alone.</p><p>In describing SHAPE reactivity changes that occur upon locking, we now give a disclaimer: “This observation already suggested that mutation-based locking of P1 or P2 opens the gene expression platform, favoring the MWC model over the non-MWC model, although it depends on an assumption that increase in SHAPE reactivity correlates with reduced base pairing, which does not always hold.”.</p><p>We have also added an explanation to the Appendix: “Overall, while consistent with available models, these SHAPE data do not discriminate between them due to difficulties in interpreting these data: changes in SHAPE reactivity do not necessarily reflect changes in base pairing frequencies. […] For these reasons, we turned to mutate-and-map measurements (described next) and higher-dimensional techniques (compensatory rescue; described in the main text) that do not require detailed interpretations of the absolute reactivity values at particular nucleotides, but rather changes in reactivities integrated across all nucleotides.”</p><p>We also underscore the independence of our new method from the (still poorly understood) relationship of SHAPE data to underlying structure in the first paragraph of Discussion: “Importantly, quantitative inferences of helix-helix correlations from this lockmutate-map-rescue (LM<sup>2</sup>R) workflow do not require interpretation of how SHAPE reactivity corresponds to Watson-Crick pairing probability, which can lead to erroneous conclusions. In that sense, the method is analogous to three-dimensional and four-dimensional pulse sequences that enable structural conclusions to be derived from NMR even as the relationships of chemical shifts to macromolecules structure are not yet understood in quantitative detail.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Another result that sounds really interesting but is difficult to discern from the data presented: &quot;Compared to the WT sequence, many of these mutants gave protections or enhancements in the 5 ́-most aptamer region of the riboswitch (nts 25-32) and concomitant exposures or protections (respectively) near the 3 ́ end of the riboswitch (nts 105- 122), which included both the start codon and Shine-Dalgarno ribosome binding sequence (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-B</xref>).&quot; Exactly where in the figures is this shown? It must be indicated on the display item.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to reviewer 2, we have moved these ‘preliminary’ mutate-and-map data to figure supplements and text, and removed this particular statement. Although the noted protections/enhancements in the mutate-and-map data beyond experimental error and are reproducible (e.g., in different salt conditions tested in Cordero and Das, 2015 “Rich RNA structure landscapes revealed by mutate-and-map analysis”), these fine details of SHAPE data are difficult to interpret.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>: Please define &quot;cumulative posterior possibility&quot; in the Results portion of the text (or better yet, come up with a term that is simpler), as an understanding of the parameter is a prerequisite for analyzing the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see response to suggestion 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and throughout text: If the MWC model is correct, then why isn't the riboswitch constitutively ON 40% of the time in the absence of adenine? Or is the level of &quot;leaky&quot; expression commensurate with the authors' estimates of the population of this state?</p></disp-quote><p>The riboswitch is indeed constitutively on at 30-40% level in all prior experiments that have looked at the RNA, even in vivoin <italic>E. coli</italic>. The switch appears leaky. We now state this explicitly in the Discussion: “Functional measurements in vitro and in vivo, use of fluorescent reporters, and single-molecule force experiments all have suggested that the riboswitch is rather ‘leaky’, forming the aptamer secondary structure at ~40% frequency at 20–30 °C, even without adenine.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12) &quot;Similarly, compensatory rescue targeting P2 gave a significant helix frequency (42%) when P1 was locked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, Figure 4—figure supplement 2, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). As a further check, both models under question predicted the absence of P4A in apoA; indeed, in either the lock-P1 or lock-P2 background, we did not detect compensatory rescue targeting P4A, and could set an upper bound on its frequency of 4%. Finally, we tested the helix frequency of P4B, which was predicted to be absent (0%) in apoA by the MWC model and present (100%) in the non-MWC model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).&quot; This is interesting, but the authors do not indicate exactly which parts of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> support this model. They simply refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which is a complex figure lacking any direction to the reader. One cannot evaluate the veracity of the authors' claim.</p><p>13) Last paragraph of the Results: Again, the authors need to refer directly to the features in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-D</xref> that support the helix frequencies being described in the text, and presumably graphed in parts E and F. When inspected by this reviewer, the display items in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> did not clearly indicate the results claimed. They need to be indicated on the display and referred to in the text.</p></disp-quote><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> was too complex because we were showing too much information within single panels and not clearly showing the relevant comparisons. We now show panels, one-by-one for each comparison being made. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we show how the helix frequency of P4B is unambiguously lower when helix P1 is locked by only showing the relevant two traces in one panel, and with a big arrow marked ‘lock’. We also call out these separate figure panels in the main text as they are being described.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14) First paragraph of the Discussion: &quot;Four-dimensional chemical mapping offers an experimental route to this information that is unique in its high throughput and use of standard equipment (capilly electrophoretic sequencers).&quot; It is clear from the data provided in this paper that this is not a high throughput method, in fact it is quite the contrary. Also: one presumes that the authors mean &quot;capillary&quot;. Any reference to this being a simple or high throughput experiment should be removed, as it unfairly inflates expectations within the community of the methods that should be reasonably applied in structural studies any other RNA molecule.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed any reference to the method as simple or high-throughput. We fixed the misspelling of “capillary”. We have added two full paragraphs of the Discussion better explaining that the method does indeed require numerous measurements, that there may be limitations for RNAs with longer lengths, and that the method is limited to inferring correlations between helical elements and cannot yet probe correlations involving single-stranded elements or tertiary contacts except insofar as nearby helix elements can act as proxies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>[…] 1) At many times the paper is very difficult to follow. Figures are often not described in a way that the reader can access. The language is at times highly specialized and ill defined. If the authors can explain their data in an accessible way, it will greatly increase the impact of the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>This concern was also presented by reviewers #2 and #3, and we have made extensive revisions to the presentation as noted above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) While an elegant method, 4D chemical mapping is not without its concerns. Our only major concern is the general assumption that locking a helix informs on the natural RNA conformational switch. Could locking a helix prevent certain natural pathways that involve transient interactions between helices, such as pseudoknots involving helices themselves, including defects, or could a lock prevent the need to transiently unfold a helix during the switching.</p></disp-quote><p>The presented method is applicable to systems at equilibrium. This regime does appear relevant for molecules like the <italic>add</italic> riboswitch which reversibly turns on and off gene expression through release or hiding of the ribosome binding site; equilibrium measurements and descriptions are also the foundation for our understanding of protein allostery in, e.g., hemoglobin. We do not yet know if the presented 4D chemical mapping might allow dissection of kinetic mechanisms. This limitation was not clear in the original manuscript, and so we have added to Discussion: “As a final caveat, the current LM<sup>2</sup>R method relies on the RNA system being at equilibrium so that the correlation equations (1)-(3) are valid and to convert observed rescue factors to helix frequencies. It will be important to evaluate whether LM<sup>2</sup>R, or some time-dependent extension of the method, could be applied to RNAs that change their structures in highly non-equilibrium scenarios involving co-transcriptional RNA folding and recruitment of energy-dissipating machines like the ribosome or RNA polymerase.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
