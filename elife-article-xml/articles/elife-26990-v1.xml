Although we understand much about the architecture and dynamics of thin lamellipodia made by slow-moving cells on flat surfaces, conventional light microscopy lacks the spatial and temporal resolution required to track complex pseudopods of cells moving in three dimensions. We therefore employed lattice light sheet microscopy to perform three-dimensional, time-lapse imaging of neutrophil-like HL-60 cells crawling through collagen matrices. To analyze three-dimensional pseudopods we: (i) developed fluorescent probe combinations that distinguish cortical actin from dynamic, pseudopod-forming actin networks, and (ii) adapted molecular visualization tools from structural biology to render and analyze complex cell surfaces. Surprisingly, three-dimensional pseudopods turn out to be composed of thin (&lt;0.75 µm), flat sheets that sometimes interleave to form rosettes. Their laminar nature is not templated by an external surface, but likely reflects a linear arrangement of regulatory molecules. Although we find that Arp2/3-dependent pseudopods are dispensable for three-dimensional locomotion, their elimination dramatically decreases the frequency of cell turning, and pseudopod dynamics increase when cells change direction, highlighting the important role pseudopods play in pathfinding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell migration</kwd><kwd>microscopy</kwd><kwd>visualization</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>arp2/3</kwd><kwd>amoeboid motility</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH P41-GM103311</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Goddard</surname><given-names>Thomas D</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferrin</surname><given-names>Thomas E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005237</institution-id><institution>Helen Hay Whitney Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fritz-Laylin</surname><given-names>Lillian K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH/NIGMS U24 GM115370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Riel-Mehan</surname><given-names>Megan</given-names></name><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Graham T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fritz-Laylin</surname><given-names>Lillian K</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Bi-Chang</given-names></name><name><surname>Lord</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Betzig</surname><given-names>Eric</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM118119</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fritz-Laylin</surname><given-names>Lillian K</given-names></name><name><surname>Lord</surname><given-names>Samuel J</given-names></name><name><surname>Mullins</surname><given-names>R Dyche</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Neutrophil pseudopods are composed of multiple sheets that are inherently flat, protrude in three dimensions, and whose assembly correlates with cell turning.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Three hundred years, ago Anton van Leeuwenhoek’s simple microscope revealed ‘animacules’ changing shape as they moved through a drop of water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">van Leewenhoeck, 1677</xref>). Subsequent breakthroughs in microscope technology and molecular biology have strengthened the link between cell morphology and locomotion, and we now know that crawling cells from many eukaryotic phyla create a variety of dynamic protrusions that project forward, in the direction of migration.</p><p>Thin, flat protrusions produced by strongly adherent cells are generally called lamellipodia. Previous work, mainly on fibroblasts and epithelial cells, has established that movement of leading-edge lamellipodia is driven by growth of branched actin networks nucleated and crosslinked by the Arp2/3 complex. As they advance, these lamellipodia promote creation of new focal adhesions that provide traction and support continued movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Case and Waterman, 2015</xref>). This mode of cell migration appears to be restricted to the animal lineage, where it relies on the presence of specific ligands in the extracellular environment and plays essential roles in embryonic development, wound healing, and tissue homeostasis.</p><p>A more widely dispersed form of cell crawling—probably present in the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2017</xref>)—requires only weak, non-specific interaction with the extracellular environment and can achieve speeds several orders of magnitude faster than adhesion-based movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loomis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Preston and King, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lämmermann et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buenemann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Butler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loomis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Petrie and Yamada, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2017</xref>). This mode of cell migration is associated with formation of complex, three-dimensional pseudopods filled with branched networks of actin filaments, nucleated and organized by the Arp2/3 complex. These three-dimensional pseudopods may contribute to forward motion of crawling and swimming cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Van Haastert, 2011</xref>), but recent work has revealed that disrupting pseudopod formation can <italic>increase</italic> the speed and persistence of migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leithner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vargas et al., 2016</xref>), implying that complex pseudopods might be more important for exploring the external environment than for driving forward motion.</p><p>We know less about the morphology and function of complex pseudopods than adherent lamellipodia in part due to the technical limitations of live-cell light microscopy. Confocal and total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy, for example, provide adequate views of adherent lamellipodia because these structures are: (i) slow-moving, (ii) thin, and (iii) closely adhered to the microscope coverslip. In contrast, the complex pseudopods created by fast-moving cells: (i) grow quickly (10–100 um/min), (ii) adopt complex three-dimensional shapes, and (iii) often spend their lives far from a coverslip surface. In addition, photobleaching must be minimized in order to observe living cells for sufficient time to track their complex three-dimensional migration.</p><p>Although some work has suggested that two-dimensional lamellipodia of adherent cells reflect the flatness of the surface to which they are attached (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnette et al., 2014</xref>), no mechanisms have been proposed to explain the more complex morphologies of three-dimensional pseudopods created by fast, weakly adherent cells—especially when crawling through irregular environments. Moreover, it remains unclear whether these complex pseudopods are completely amorphous, or whether they share common, underlying structural features that might shed light on their functions and mechanisms of assembly.</p><p>To address these issues, we employed the recently developed lattice light sheet microscope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), which offers a unique combination of three-dimensional imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution and low phototoxicity. To render and interpret the large data sets produced by lattice light sheet microscopy, we developed new visualization software and combined it with biochemically defined molecular probes to detect and characterize pseudopods in living cells.</p><p>Using these new tools, we discovered that pseudopods created by fast-moving neutrophils are not entirely amorphous, but represent various arrangements of a single structural motif: a free-standing lamellar sheet. Thus, complex, three-dimensional pseudopods that appear amorphous in widefield and confocal microscopy turn out to be rosettes formed of multiple, interleaved lamella. Unlike adherent lamellipodia, these free-standing lamellar building blocks are not templated from a flat surface and their morphology strongly suggests that they arise from a linear arrangement of regulatory molecules associated with the plasma membrane. In addition, our automated methods for detecting and quantifying the size of complex pseudopods reveal that these dynamic cellular structures play a key role in cellular pathfinding.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Surface rendering of lattice light sheet data reveals three-dimensional dynamics of membranes and actin networks in migrating neutrophils</title><p>Neutrophil-like HL-60 cells build pseudopods that are filled with polymerized actin, easily visualized in fixed cells using phalloidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, we chose the utrophin-based actin probe, which binds preferentially to cortical actin surrounding the cell body and is largely excluded from the more dynamic, branched actin networks that drive pseudopod extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belin et al., 2014</xref>). When combined with a membrane marker, the selectivity of our utrophin-based actin probe enabled us to develop automated methods for identifying and tracking three-dimensional pseudopods in moving cells (see below).

Handling the raw data, we quickly realized that the ability of lattice light sheet microscopy to provide new insights into cell biology is hampered, in part, by the lack of computational tools for visualizing and analyzing three-dimensional fluorescence intensity data. The most widely used tools for analyzing microscopy data can perform basic operations such as thresholding, normalization, alignment, and drift correction, but these tools were designed to handle two-dimensional images. Rather than attempting to extend the capabilities of a primarily two-dimensional computational platform, we instead adapted software designed from the outset to manipulate and analyze three-dimensional data sets. Specifically, we chose the molecular visualization program UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) for this purpose because it is freely available and it incorporates the collective experience of the structural biology community in rendering and manipulating three-dimensional data.</p><p>Briefly, we added to UCSF Chimera the capability to import a time series of three-dimensional fluorescence intensity datasets. Once imported, these data can be rendered and manipulated by native UCSF Chimera functions, including elements of the ‘vseries’ toolkit, which perform volumetric versions of thresholding, normalization, alignment, and fitting. In addition, the capacity of UCSF Chimera to render surfaces of equal fluorescence intensity dramatically enhances the ability to judge proximity and/or co-localization of fluorescent probes in three dimensions. Finally, inspired by rendering tools available in professional animation software (e.g. Cinema4D; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.maxon.net">www.maxon.net</ext-link>), we added a tonal shading technique, called ambient occlusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tarini et al., 2006</xref>), to a recent UCSF Chimera release (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/ambient-jul2014/ambient.html">http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/data/ambient-jul2014/ambient.html</ext-link>). Tonal surface rendering with ambient occlusion makes cellular structures more easily interpretable by emphasizing the spatial relationships of three-dimensional surfaces and variations in surface texture. The enhanced ability to detect and interpret textures and protrusions can be seen by comparing traditional maximum intensity projection and rendered versions of confocal data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and similar renderings of the lattice light sheet data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Dynamic pseudopods are composed of intrinsically lamellar elements</title><p>Using these visualization tools, we observed two distinctive types of dynamic membrane protrusion at the leading edge of HL-60 cells crawling on fibronectin-coated coverslips: (i) thin, sheet-like lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref>), and (ii) ‘rosettes’ formed by the coincidence of multiple lamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">10</xref>).

Despite being unsupported, these pseudopods maintained a lamellar morphology with an approximately constant thickness throughout their lifetime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><p>To verify that the distinctive lamellar shape of pseudopodial sheets does not require interaction with a flat surface, we also imaged membrane-labeled HL-60 cells crawling through random collagen networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Regardless of whether cells crawled across glass or through a collagen matrix, their lamellar pseudopods shared several common features, including a similar profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and thickness (780 ± 137 nm standard deviation, n = 18 cells). The thickness measured from surface-rendered LLSm data agrees with measurements made on other types of data, including: raw lattice light sheet data (567 ± 64 nm on glass and 689 ± 86 nm in collagen); spinning disk confocal images of phalloidin-stained actin (505 ± 49 nm for a sheet and 533 ± 123 nm for a rosette petal); and scanning electron micrographs, which suggest a thickness of ~640 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fleck et al., 2005</xref>). Given the resolution of lattice light sheet microscopy (~230 nm in XY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2014</xref>]), we estimate that the actual thickness of lamellar pseudopods lies between 430 and 800 nm.</p><p>Lamellar pseudopods are not perfectly flat, and exhibit varying degrees of pucker and undulation. To determine whether the flatness of lamellar sheets is influenced by cell surface interactions, we first quantified their flatness by: (i) choosing points distributed along the leading edge of each pseudopod, (ii) using them to define a best-fit, reference plane, and (iii) calculating the average minimum Euclidean distance, or average vertical error, between the original points on the leading edge and the reference plane. Cells crawling across coverslips, as well as those crawling through collagen networks, build sheets with similar flatness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), raising the question of how cells can form flat structures without the surface template mechanism proposed for the assembly of flat lamellipodia of adherent cells (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Pseudopodial sheets interleave to form complex rosettes</title><p>In addition to simple sheets, HL-60 cells also produce more complex pseudopods. When imaged by conventional widefield or confocal microscopy these protrusions appeared as irregular, three-dimensional streaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, maximum intensity projection). However, when imaged at high resolution by lattice light sheet microscopy and visualized by three-dimensional surface rendering, these apparently amorphous structures turn out to be ‘rosettes,’ composed of multiple, lamellar components interleaved into rose-like patterns. Rosettes are assembled by cells crawling on a two-dimensional surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Videos 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">8</xref>), and by cells crawling through three-dimensional collagen meshes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video9">Video 9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video10">Video 10</xref>). In uniform fields of chemoattractant, both lamellar and rosette pseudopods are highly dynamic and ephemeral (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>Several lines of evidence argue that the lamellar elements forming these rosettes are identical to the lamellar pseudopods described above. Firstly, both sheet and rosette pseudopods largely excluded utrophin-based actin probes <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">(Figure 1B</xref>) and both types of protrusion disappeared in the presence of CK-666 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref>, and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video12">Video 12</xref>), a small-molecule inhibitor of the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nolen et al., 2009</xref>), arguing that sheets and rosettes are formed by rapidly assembling, branched actin networks. Secondly, lamellae within rosettes have the same thickness (690 ± 20 nm, n = 18, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) as the simple lamellar pseudopods. Thirdly, time-lapse image sequences often revealed pseudopodial sheets converging or branching to form rosettes (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>). Fourthly, in a uniform field of chemoattractant, pseudopodial sheets and rosettes both have a lifespan of approximately 60 s, from initial appearance to final disappearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). This lifetime remains similar whether cells are migrating across flat surfaces or through collagen networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), indicating that protrusion lifespan does not depend on external mechanical support. Finally, approximately 75% of both sheet and rosette pseudopods disappear in an identical manner, by collapsing into a tangle of linear structures that resemble filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> (rosette) and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> (sheet), see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><media id="video11" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26990-video11.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26990.024</object-id><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>Example of CK-666 treated cells migrating through a polymerized collagen network. </title><p>Video plays at 11 × real time.</p></caption></media><media id="video12" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-26990-video12.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26990.025</object-id><label>Video 12.</label><caption><title>Another example of CK-666 treated cells migrating through a polymerized collagen network. </title><p>Video plays at 11 × real time.

This analysis was limited to cells moving through three-dimensional collagen matrices because we found that the loss of Arp2/3 activity dramatically reduced adhesion of HL-60 cells to fibronectin-coated coverslips. This loss of adhesion posed particular problems for the vertically oriented coverslips used in our lattice light sheet microscope.

Despite the loss of dynamic pseudopods, cells treated with CK-666 retained the ability to migrate through collagen networks in a uniform field of chemoattractant. The treated cells, however, moved more slowly (5.42 vs 8.57 um/min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>) and appeared to travel along much straighter trajectories than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We used two methods to quantify and analyze cell turning in three dimensions. In one approach, we detect turns by estimating the first derivative of the cell’s trajectory to identify inflection points in the cell’s path. The second method computes the ratio of the path length traveled by the cell centroid over ten time points to Euclidean distance between the first and last points, and defines turns as regions where this ratio is larger than 2.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). According to both metrics, control cells changed direction 2 to 3 times more often than the CK-666 treated cells (method 1: 2.73 vs 1.15 turns/min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; method 2: 3.41 vs 1.09 turns/min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–F</xref>), and displayed greater turn activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The reduced turning frequency in CK-666 treated cells suggest that dynamic, Arp2/3-generated pseudopods play a role in initiating or facilitating direction changes. To further explore this possibility, we visualized the relationships between pseudopod formation and cell turning by overlaying the number and volume of dynamic pseudopods onto the three-dimensional trajectories of cells crawling through a collagen matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). In these plots, the line is a two-dimensional projection of the three-dimensional trajectory of the cell centroid projected to a plane that maximizes parallel coincidence, while the line width and color saturation indicate, respectively, the number and volume of dynamic pseudopods at every point. Control cell trajectories reveal frequent turns, each of which appears correlated with a dramatic increase in pseudopod dynamics. In contrast, CK-666 treated cells made less than half as many turns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>) and created fewer and smaller dynamic pseudopods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2D–E</xref>).

Light microscopy has also hinted at the existence of free-standing lamellar and rosette pseudopods, notably in images of crawling cells tilted 90 degrees from the conventional viewing angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sullivan and Mandell, 1983</xref>). Using fast confocal microscopy on confined dendritic cells, the Sixt lab recently observed what appeared to be dynamic sheet-like protrusions that do not require to be adhered to any substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leithner et al., 2016</xref>). Our rosettes also resemble protrusive structures observed in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> amoebae using Bessel beam plane illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). This similarity is heightened by surface-rendering of published <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> data using UCSF Chimera, and visualization techniques described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). From our current work and previous observations, we propose two basic principles that define pseudopod morphology in these and other cells that build lamellar pseudopods. First, fast-moving leukocytes can assemble free-standing lamellar pseudopods without the aid of a surface ‘template.’ Second, more complex three-dimensional pseudopods can be resolved into lamellar components. Although suggested by previous work, establishing these facts required following the entire ‘lifecycle’ of membrane protrusions, from initial emergence to final retraction, using high-resolution, three-dimensional, time-lapse imaging. The lattice light sheet microscope enabled us to see the birth of lamellar pseudopods as linear ridges as well as their maturation and coalescence into more complex shapes.</p><p>What is the relationship between the free-standing, lamellar pseudopods of fast-moving leukocytes and the surface-attached lamellipodia of slower cells? Several previous studies described free-standing lamellipodial ‘ruffles’ peeling back from the leading edge of fibroblast or epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ingram, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie et al., 1971</xref>), but their morphology was generally assumed to reflect transient attachment to a surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burnette et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, Ingram described ‘sheet-like’ protrusions growing on the dorsal side of adherent fibrosarcoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ingram, 1969</xref>), and Gauthier and co-workers discovered ‘fin-like’ protrusions that travel along the dorsal surface of adherent fibroblasts as they wrap around and crawl along thin nanofibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guetta-Terrier et al., 2015</xref>). These sheets and fins do not appear to form on an external substrate, but their morphology and molecular composition suggest that adherent cells may also be capable of making free-standing lamellar protrusions, independent of surface interaction. Although they resemble attached lamellipodia, the pseudopodial sheets we describe are thicker (~430–800 nm vs. &lt;200 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie et al., 1971</xref>)) and grow at faster rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ingram, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Abercrombie et al., 1971</xref>). In addition, the assembly and regulation of free-standing pseudopodial sheets may require different actin regulatory molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fritz-Laylin et al., 2017</xref>). More work is required to understand the relationships between adhesion-independent pseudopods and the lamellipodia of adhesive cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Lamellar protrusions imply linear organization of regulatory molecules</title><p>How do fast-moving leukocytes produce sheet-like protrusions, even when moving through complex three-dimensional environments? Reconstitution of Arp2/3-dependent branched actin network assembly provides a simple explanation: in vitro, the morphology of a branched actin network is determined by the spatial arrangement of the regulatory molecules that activate the Arp2/3 complex. One-dimensional arrangement of Arp2/3 activator along a thin glass fiber, for example, produces a flat, sheet-like actin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Achard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hu and Kuhn, 2012</xref>), while a two-dimensional square of Arp2/3 activator produces a more three-dimensional rectangular solid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bieling et al., 2016</xref>). Mathematical models of branched actin network formation agree with these reconstitution results and suggest that, once formed, a thin, flat actin network should remain stable as it grows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmeiser and Winkler, 2015</xref>). Generalizing, we propose that the approximate dimensionality of nucleation and polymerase activity on the membrane is one less than the approximate dimensionality of the actin network (and protrusion) generated by this activity. In other words, a filopodium (dimension ~1) grows from a point source (dimension ~0) of nucleation/polymerase activity while a lamellar pseudopod (dimension ~2) grows from a line source (dimension ~1). We therefore propose that the two-dimensional nature of lamellar protrusions follows as a direct consequence of the one-dimensional organization of the Arp2/3 activation machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We are currently exploring possible mechanisms that may give rise to this linear organization of Arp2/3 activators.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26990.037</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model showing how localization of Arp2/3 activator (activated WAVE complex, green) could result in the formation of a lamellar protrusion independent of surface interactions.</title><p>Once formed, a flat protrusion would continue growth as a planar projection as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmeiser and Winkler, 2015</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-26990-fig7-v1"/></fig><p>This model for the assembly of flat pseudopods is supported by previous observations that activators of Arp2/3-dependent actin assembly appear in linear patterns on the membrane.

These results provide a simple explanation for recent work from the Sixt lab, who found that reducing WAVE activity in dendritic cells abolishes pseudopod formation, yet accelerates the crawling of cells in simple confined spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leithner et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, the pseudopod-deficient dendritic cells fail to reorient in changing gradients of chemoattractant, and migrate more slowly toward a chemotactic source within complex three-dimensional environments compared to control cells. Similarly, in another recent paper, the Piel and Lennon-Dumenil labs found that Arp2/3 activity at the front of migrating dendritic cells was responsible for speed-fluctuating behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vargas et al., 2016</xref>).

Do any of these morphologies provide functional, selective advantages, or do they represent an element of randomness in cellular evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonner, 2013</xref>)? We speculate that broad, lamellar pseudopodia and extended rosettes may be uniquely adept structures for probing a cell’s environment. A pseudopodial sheet is much thinner than a spherical bleb but can sweep out a comparable volume. Linear filopodia, in contrast, would have to move both back and forth and side to side to search the same volume, and would provide limited surface contact.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>High-resolution three-dimensional microscopy requires new visualization tools</title><p>Three-dimensional time-lapse imaging with high spatial and temporal resolution poses significant challenges to the analysis tools and workflow developed for two-dimensional imaging. Specifically, lattice light sheet microscopy requires effective methods for: (i) handling large datasets (~20 GByte per time-lapse sequence); (ii) normalizing, aligning, and drift-correcting multiple fluorescence channels in three dimensions; (iii) identifying three-dimensional features of interest; and (iv) quantifying the shape and movement of complex surfaces. The most widely used open-source software for image analysis is not well suited to these tasks, and commercial software for rendering three-dimensional data is expensive (~$10,000 per license, plus yearly fees) and difficult to modify. To address these practical problems we modified UCSF Chimera to accept three-dimensional lattice light sheet microscopy datasets. UCSF Chimera is a freely available, open-source software platform developed to render and analyze three-dimensional atomic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>) and density maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goddard et al., 2007</xref>). Most of the tools we describe here are available in the recent release and we encourage others to use them (See Materials and Methods for list of online resources).</p><p>In three-dimensional time-lapse movies, pseudopods change shape rapidly, making them difficult to identify solely by morphology. We, therefore, developed a new method for automated pseudopod detection, which exploits a biochemical peculiarity of the utrophin actin-binding domain. Utrophin localizes to the actin network that forms the cell cortex, but is largely excluded from the rapidly assembling, branched actin filaments created by the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belin et al., 2014</xref>). Our utrophin-based probe localizes to cortical actin networks proximal to the plasma membrane everywhere except within rapidly assembling networks that drive pseudopod extension. When imaged in three dimensions and combined with a marker for the plasma membrane, the absence of a utrophin-based actin probe provides a simple method to identify dynamic pseudopods and track their size and movement. Previous studies described methods to identify and track cell protrusions in two-dimensional images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosgraaf and Van Haastert, 2010</xref>), but, to our knowledge, this represents the first automated method for identifying and measuring pseudopods in three dimensions. Similar approaches will likely prove useful for defining other irregular cell structures.</p><p>Modern data visualization provides more than just pretty pictures; it can facilitate the analysis of experimental results and the formulation of scientific questions. Here, three-dimensional visualization enabled automated pseudopod detection and analysis of the relationship between pseudopod formation and cell turning. Additionally, surface rendering resolved the complex and apparently amorphous protrusions into lamellar sheets, an observation that immediately suggested a one-dimensional signaling system model. We trust that these visualization and analysis tools will provide similar breakthroughs to other areas of biological investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Polymerized cortical actin filament were labeled with a high-affinity actin binding domain from utrophin fused to the red fluorescent protein mCherry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belin et al., 2014</xref>), and plasma membrane labeled by fusing a palmitoylation sequence from Lyn kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Inoue et al., 2005</xref>) to the green fluorescent protein mEmerald.

For two-dimensional migration, differentiated HL-60 cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated coverslips for 30 min before coverslip was moved to the imaging chamber. For three-dimensional migration, cells were overlayed onto coverslips containing pre-formed 1.7% collagen matrix polymerized from a 1:1 mixture of of unlabeled (Advanced Biomatrix catalog no. 5005) and FITC-conjugated (Sigma catalog no. C4361) bovine skin collagen, using standard protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sixt and Lämmermann, 2011</xref>).

For 2D migration, differentiated HL-60 cells were allowed to adhere to fibronectin-coated coverslips for 30 min before coverslip was moved to the imaging chamber at 37°C. The data was acquired on a Hamamatsu ORCA-Flash 4.0 sCMOS camera, where the moving cell was imaged by exciting each plane with a 488 nm laser at ~10 µW (at the back aperture of the excitation objective) for 5 ms, with an excitation inner/outer numerical aperture of 0.55/0.48 respectively and a corresponding light sheet length of 15 µm. At each time point, the cells were imaged by sample scanning mode and the dithered light sheet at 400 nm step size, thereby capturing a volume of ~70 µm x 90 µm x 40 µm (corresponding to 672 × 908 × 201 pixels in deskewed data) every 1.2 s (which includes 1 s acquisition time and 0.2 s pause between each time point). There are 143 time points for the continuous imaging periods of 2.86 min in duration. For three-dimensional migration, mCherry- utrophin HL-60 cells were overlayed onto coverslips containing pre-formed 1.7% collagen matrix polymerized as described (14) using 50% FITC-collagen (Sigma) and allowed to migrate into the network for one hour before removing the coverslip to the imaging chamber. The cell moving inside the collagen was imaged by exciting each plane with a 488 nm laser (collagen) and 568 nm laser (HL-60) at ~20 µW and 10 µW (at the back aperture of the excitation objective) for 5 ms separately before moving to the next z plane, with an excitation inner/outer numerical aperture of 0.4/0.325 respectively and a corresponding light sheet length of 20 µm. At each time point, the cells were imagined by objective scanning mode and the dithered light sheet at 250 nm step size, thereby capturing a volume of ~70 µm x 36 µm x 35 µm (corresponding to 672 × 352 × 141 pixels in raw data) every 1.4 s (which includes 1.3 s acquisition time and 0.1 s pause between each time point). There are 250 time points for the continuous imaging periods of 5.83 min in duration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Image alignment, compression and normalization</title><p>With the datasets we collected the imaged volume was typically five times larger than the cell along each axis so that the cell did not crawl out of view. To enable real-time playback from any vantage point we used compression and thresholding of the image data to reduce its size by as much as a factor of 100 utilizing that the cell at any instant only occupied a small portion of the imaged box. To compensate for scope drift we aligned static features (extracellular collagen filaments) of each three-dimensional image to the preceding time maximizing cross-correlation to correct microscope jitter. We normalized the intensity levels by shifting the mean to 0 and scaling the intensity for each three-dimensional image so enclosed cell volume was constant at a standard intensity value (arbitrarily chosen equal to 100). This corrected variations in normalization introduced by microscope deconvolution software and also compensated for photobleaching which reduced intensity levels by approximately a factor of 2 over the imaged time periods.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Rendering images</title><p>The observed cell protrusions undergo continuous change in shape and can emerge from all sides of the cell. To communicate these features in two-dimensional static images we exported the surface mesh from UCSF Chimera as a Wavefront (.obj) file, and imported them into Cinema4D, a three-dimensional animation software package. We used the shading technique of ambient occlusion (recessed areas appear dark) and the Sketch and Toon Shader both with default settings to clearly visualize the three-dimensional dynamic behavior (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</bold></p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Real-time viewing of the data with ‘vseries’ toolkit</title><p>We developed ‘vseries’ software within UCSF Chimera to analyze the large crawling cell data sets. The ‘vseries’ toolkit includes command line implementation and a Volume Series GUI. It enables users to view and manipulate an ordered sequence of volumetric datasets, and apply analysis commands to some or all of the volumetric maps at once. We used three-dimensional interactive visualization to see all aspects of the cell motion allowing any feature to be examined at any time in the cell motion. The new software visualization and analysis capabilities have been distributed as the ‘vseries’ command of the UCSF Chimera visualization program. To mark features of interest we also developed three-dimensional interactive surface visualizations for viewing in a web browser with the ability to hand place markers (small spheres) on desired cell features, and annotate them with text descriptions and choice of color. This software enables collaborative online annotation of the data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Quantification of protrusion thickness and flatness</title><p>To measure thickness of the rendered three-dimensional cells, surface meshes were imported into Cinema4D and markers were created to measure the top-to-bottom distance along the edge of a pseudopodial sheet. Flatness was measured in UCSF Chimera by first placing markers along the edge of the sheet using the ‘Markers’ function (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/current/docs/ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html">http://www.rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/current/docs/ContributedSoftware/volumepathtracer/framevolpath.html</ext-link>) and then running a Python script that calculates the best fit plane and measures the distances from the plane to the markers. We also measured the thin edge of lamellar sheets intersecting raw lattice light sheet images at 90° (567 ± 64 nm on glass and 689 ± 86 nm in collagen) at half maximum fluorescence intensity). We also measured phalloidin-stained actin imaged using confocal microscopy (505 ± 49 nm for a sheet and 533 ± 123 nm for a rosette petal) intersecting the confocal plane at 90°, measured at half maximum fluorescence intensity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Quantification of cell movement and protrusion activity</title><p>To quantify the motions we measured cell centroid position as a function of time to obtain speed, direction, and changes of direction. This capacity is now included as the ‘vseries measure’ command. For each volume in the volume series, the command calculates the centroid (x,y,z) coordinates, the distance from the previous centroid (‘step’), the cumulative distance along the piecewise linear path from the first centroid, the surface-enclosed volume, and the surface area. The results are saved in a text file. The centroid is the center of mass of the density map based on map regions above the threshold; we set the threshold to our already established normalized level of 100.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification of protrusion activity</title><p>To automate identification of the irregularly shaped protrusions, we took advantage of the fact that utrophin-based cortical actin labeling entered nascent protrusions slowly while membrane labeling was always present in the protrusions. We computed difference maps between the imaged membrane and actin channels, applied spatial smoothing using a Gaussian filter with a standard deviation of 0.5 µm to reduce noise. The resulting enclosed volumes were marked as individual protrusions if they were greater than 1 µm<sup>3</sup>, less than 15 µm from center, and outside cell center radius or larger than 15 µm<sup>3</sup>. For each volume in the volume series we calculated the total volume of all the protrusions, the distance of each protrusion from the cell center, the angle between the line connecting the cell centroid to protrusion centroid and the cell centroid path, and the number of protrusions. This calculation was implemented as a Python script (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6scode1">Figure 6—source code 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Quantification of turning points</title><p>Changes of cell direction appeared correlated with emergence of multiple protrusions in different directions. To examine this correlation we used principal component analysis to find the primary plane of motion for graphing a cell centroid path in two dimensions. The first method we used for quantifying direction changes was to calculate the sliding time window ratio of the path length over the Euclidean distance between end-points using an interval of 10 time points. A ratio greater than 2.5 was considered turning. Our second approach was a Savitzky–Golay filter to calculate an estimate of the derivative. Time points were considered turnaround points if the derivative was zero and the cell had traveled at least 1 µm from the last turnaround point. Both of these methods were written in R Studio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6scode2">Figure 6—source code 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Conventional microscopy</title><p>RICM, TIRF, and spinning disk confocal microscopy were performed on a Nikon Ti-E inverted microscope equipped with a Spectral Diskovery and an Andor iXon Ultra EMCCD. RICM illumination (also called ‘interference reflection microscopy’) was produced with a 50/50 beamsplitter (Chroma 21000) in the dichroic cube and a 550 nm excitation filter (Thorlabs FB550-10) after a halogen epi lamp. Sufficient neutral density filters were placed after the halogen lamp and the aperture diaphragm was adjusted to maximize the contrast of the RICM images. RICM and TIRF images were interleaved less than 500 ms apart by rotating the RICM cube in and out of the path every other frame. All hardware was controlled using Micro-Manager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Edelstein et al., 2010</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Michael Sixt, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. Matthieu Piel, one of the other two reviewers, has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their study Fritz-Laylin et al. study the morphology of 3D migrating amoeboid cells (mainly HL60 derived neutrophils) using high resolution high speed light sheet microscopy. They find that what was previously called pseudopodial extension is actually an array of lamellipodia in varying configurations – from one single sheet to rosettes. They show this quantitatively by applying a new modality of image analysis using several reporter lines. Pharmacology is used to inhibit the Arp2/3 complex which left locomotion intact but decreased the extent of cell turning. An important insight is also that previously described waves of actin polymerisation are not an internal feature of the cell but are rather lamellipodial tips sliding along the ventral surface of the cell.</p><p>The authors conclude that lamellipodia can form independently of adhesive contacts, that lamellipodia are important for cell turning but not necessarily for locomotion and that WAVE waves are tips of expanding lamellipodia.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that this is brilliant imaging and the conclusions are important for the community, although the study is very observational and in its functional implications overlapping with two papers in Nat Cell Biol on Dendritic cells by the groups of Lennon-Dumenil and Sixt. One reviewer feels that the work is too phenomenological for <italic>eLife</italic> and suggests that BAR domain proteins potentially important for lamellipodial flatness should be investigated in detail. As this will go beyond the two months revision time the reviewers agreed during the consultation process that emphasis should be put on the general morphological part and the authors should employ at least one other classical amoeboid cell type to proof the principle. T cell blasts might be a suitable and easy to handle example.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26990.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All three reviewers agreed that this is brilliant imaging and the conclusions are important for the community, although the study is very observational and in its functional implications overlapping with two papers in Nat Cell Biol on Dendritic cells by the groups of Lennon-Dumenil and Sixt.

Using scanning electron microscopy, we observed similar lamellar protrusions in fixed Jurkat T cells, another amoeboid cell type that employs fast, low-adhesion crawling through complex environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We have also added additional references to and discussion of published literature showing similar shaped protrusions on other cell types to the existing Discussion:</p><p>“We identified similar lamellar and rosette protrusions in published scanning electron micrographs of several different cells types, including differentiated HL-60 cells (Fleck et al., 2005), Jurkat T cells (Nicholson-Dykstra and Higgs 2008) [PMID: 18720401] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>), human neutrophils migrating through a chemoattractant gradient (Zigmond and Sullivan, 1979), dendritic cells (Coates et al., 2003; Fisher et al., 2008; Felts et al., 2010), T-cells (Brown et al., 2003) and monocytes (Majstoravich et al., 2004) from human blood, as well as Dictyostelium amoebae (Gerisch et al., 2013). Light microscopy has also hinted at the existence of free-standing lamellar and rosette pseudopods, notably in images of crawling cells tilted 90 degrees from the conventional viewing angle (Sullivan and Mandell, 1983). Using fast confocal microscopy on confined dendritic cells, the Sixt lab recently observed what appeared to be dynamic sheet-like protrusions that do not require to be adhered to any substrate (Leithner et al. 2016). Our rosettes also resemble protrusive structures observed in Dictyostelium amoebae using Bessel beam plane illumination (Gao et al., 2012). This similarity is heightened by surface-rendering of published Dictyostelium data using UCSF Chimera, and visualization techniques described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>).”</p><p>In our Discussion of the Sixt paper, we now also included the work by Lennon-Dumenil:</p><p>“These results provide a simple explanation for recent work from the Sixt lab (Leithner et al., 2016), who found that reducing WAVE activity in dendritic cells abolishes pseudopod formation, yet accelerates the crawling of cells in simple confined spaces. Interestingly, the pseudopod-deficient dendritic cells fail to reorient in changing gradients of chemoattractant, and migrate more slowly toward a chemotactic source within complex three-dimensional environments compared to control cells. Similarly, in another recent paper, the Piel and Lennon-Dumenil labs found that Arp2/3 activity at the front of migrating dendritic cells was responsible for speed-fluctuating behavior (Vargas et al., 2016). Together with these findings in dendritic cells, our results suggest that the three-dimensional pseudopods produced by fast-moving leukocytes promote the cell turning required for exploration of the local environment.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
