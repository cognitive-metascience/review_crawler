of SNARE proteins serve mechanistic functions that go beyond passive anchoring of the force-generating SNAREpin to the fusing membranes. Here, we show that conformational flexibility of synaptobrevin-2 TMD is essential for efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and actively promotes membrane fusion as well as fusion pore expansion. Specifically, the introduction of helix-stabilizing leucine residues within the TMD region spanning the vesicle’s outer leaflet strongly impairs exocytosis and decelerates fusion pore dilation. In contrast, increasing the number of helix-destabilizing, ß-branched valine or isoleucine residues within the TMD restores normal secretion but accelerates fusion pore expansion beyond the rate found for the wildtype protein. These observations provide evidence that the synaptobrevin-2 TMD catalyzes the fusion process by its structural flexibility, actively setting the pace of fusion pore expansion.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17571.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17571.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17571.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons signal to other cells by releasing chemicals known as neurotransmitters. The neurotransmitters are stored in the neuron in small membrane-bound compartments called vesicles. When a neuron receives an electrical impulse, this ultimately triggers the vesicles to fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the gap between the neurons. This process is known as exocytosis. Other cells called neuroendocrine cells, which can receive signals from neurons, also undergo exocytosis to release chemicals into the bloodstream.</p><p>A group of membrane-bound proteins called SNAREs help a vesicle to fuse with the cell membrane. SNARE proteins are embedded in both the vesicle and cell membrane, and force them into close proximity. When the two membranes make contact, a small channel called the fusion pore forms and expands to release the vesicle’s contents out of the cell.</p><p>Synaptobrevin-2 is a SNARE protein found in the vesicle membrane. The part of the protein that sits in the membrane is called the transmembrane domain; however, it is not clear whether this domain plays any role in membrane fusion.</p><p>The transmembrane domain of synaptobrevin-2 is rich in certain amino acids that are thought to make it flexible, thereby allowing it to bend and tilt in the membrane. Dhara, Yarzagaray et al. altered these amino acids in such a way that made this domain either more or less flexible than in the normal protein. The results show that in both neurons and a type of neuroendocrine cell called chromaffin cells, exocytosis is significantly reduced and the fusion pores open more slowly when the transmembrane domain is less flexible. By contrast, exocytosis occurs normally when the transmembrane domain is more flexible; however, the fusion pore expands more rapidly than normal.</p><p>These results suggest that the flexibility of the transmembrane domain of synaptobrevin-2 promotes membrane fusion and sets the pace at which the fusion pore expands. It is likely that the transmembrane domain disturbs the surrounding membrane in a way that enables these events to happen. Further work is needed to address whether this is the case.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17571.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17571.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>exocytosis</kwd><kwd>synaptobrevin</kwd><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ADG322699</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lindau</surname><given-names>Manfred</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1027</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohrmann</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruns</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRK1326</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohrmann</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name><name><surname>Bruns</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MO2312/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mohrmann</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Homburger Forschungsförderungsprogramm von Universitätsklinikum des Saarlandes</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bruns</surname><given-names>Dieter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structural flexibility of the synaptobrevin-2 transmembrane domain promotes membrane fusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>SNARE-mediated membrane fusion comprises a series of mechanistic steps requiring both protein-protein as well as protein-lipid interactions. Protein-protein interactions involving SNARE proteins in the fusion process have been explored in great detail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jahn and Fasshauer, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>), but the functional role of SNARE-lipid interplay has remained enigmatic. Previous studies provided conflicting views on the requirement of proteinaceous membrane anchors of SNARE proteins for efficient neurotransmitter release or vacuole-vacuole fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fdez et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grote et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pieren et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rohde et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Even more unclear is how a proteinaceous TMD may regulate the membrane fusion process. Experiments in reduced model systems have suggested that lipidic SNARE-anchors are inefficient in driving proper fusion between artificial liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McNew et al., 2000</xref>), cells expressing ‘flipped’ SNAREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Giraudo et al., 2005</xref>), or between liposomes and lipid nanodiscs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2012</xref>). However, these experiments were unable to track kinetic intermediates <italic>en route</italic> to fusion (e.g. priming, triggering or fusion pore expansion) leaving the questions unanswered whether and if so, at which step TMDs of SNARE proteins may regulate fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang and Lindau, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Langosch et al., 2007</xref>). In comparison to other single-pass transmembrane proteins, SNARE TMDs are characterized by an overrepresentation of ß-branched amino acids (e.g. valine and isoleucine, ~40% of all residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langosch et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Neumann and Langosch, 2011</xref>]), which renders the helix backbone conformationally flexible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quint et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Stelzer et al., 2008</xref>). In an α-helix, non-ß-branched residues like leucine can rapidly switch between rotameric states, which favor van der Waals interactions with their i ± 3 and i ± 4 neighbors, thereby forming a scaffold of side chain interactions that defines helix stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lacroix et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Quint et al., 2010</xref>). Steric restraints acting on the side chains of ß-branched amino acids (like valine and isoleucine) instead favor i ± 4 over i ± 3 interactions leading to local packing deficiencies and backbone flexibility. In vitro experiments have suggested that membrane-inserted short peptides mimicking SNARE TMDs (without a cytoplasmic SNARE motif) exhibit a significant fusion-enhancing effect on synthetic liposomes depending on their content of ß-branched amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofmann et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langosch et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, simulation studies have shown an inherent propensity of the SNARE TMDs or the viral hemagglutinin fusion peptide to disturb lipid packing, facilitating lipid splay and formation of an initial lipid bridge between opposing membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kasson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Markvoort and Marrink, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Risselada et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Here, we have investigated the functional role of the synaptobrevin-2 (syb2) TMD in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis by systematically mutating its core residues (amino acid positions 97–112) to either helix-stabilizing leucines or flexibility–promoting ß-branched isoleucine/valine residues. In a gain-of-function approach TMD mutants were virally expressed in v-SNARE deficient adrenal chromaffin cells (dko cells), which are nearly devoid of exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borisovska et al., 2005</xref>). By using a combination of high resolution electrophysiological methods (membrane capacitance measurements, amperometry) and molecular dynamics simulations, we have characterized the effects of the mutations in order to delineate syb2 TMD functions in membrane fusion. Our results indicate an active, fusion promoting role of the syb2 TMD and suggest that structural flexibility of the N-terminal TMD region catalyzes fusion initiation and fusion pore expansion at the millisecond time scale. Thus, SNARE proteins do not only act as force generators by continuous molecular straining, but also facilitate membrane merger via structural flexibility of their TMDs. The results further pinpoint a hitherto unrecognized mechanism wherein TMDs of v-SNARE isoforms with a high content of ß-branched amino acids are employed for efficient fusion pore expansion of larger sized vesicles, suggesting a general physiological significance of TMD flexibility in exocytosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Stabilization of the syb2 TMD helix diminishes synchronous secretion</title><p>To study the potential impact of structural flexibility of the syb2 TMD on fast Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent exocytosis, we substituted all core residues of the syb2 TMD with either leucine, valine or isoleucine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and measured secretion as membrane capacitance increase in response to photolytic uncaging of intracellular [Ca]i. Replacing the syb2 TMD by a poly-leucine helix (polyL) strongly reduced the ability of the syb2 mutant to rescue secretion in v-SNARE deficient chromaffin cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Indeed, a detailed kinetic analysis of the capacitance changes revealed that both components of the exocytotic burst, the rapidly releasable pool (RRP) and the slowly releasable pool (SRP), were similarly diminished, and the sustained rate of secretion was reduced, but no changes in exocytosis timing were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The similar relative decrease in both, the RRP and the SRP component, could indicate that the polyL mutation interferes with upstream processes like the priming reaction leading to impaired pool formation and reduced exocytosis competence. By studying SNARE complex assembly with recombinant proteins, we found that the polyL variant affects neither the rate nor the extent of SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This renders the possibility unlikely that the mutant syb2 TMD allosterically affects the upstream SNARE motif leading to altered interaction with its cognate SNARE partners. Thus, the secretion deficiency in polyL expressing cells is not due to impaired SNARE complex formation, i.e. by causing changes in vesicle priming, but rather reflects defective vesicle fusion.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17571.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Helix stabilizing amino acids in the syb2 TMD diminish secretion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of syb2 and corresponding TMD mutants (polyL, polyV, polyI, polyLV).

Thus, substitution of a substantial amount of amino acids within the syb2 TMD with either type of ß-branched residue is tolerated without affecting secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C,D</xref>). Since both, polyV and polyI mutants can functionally replace the wildtype protein, it seems likely that membrane fusion does not critically depend on conserved key residues at specific positions within the syb2 TMD. To substantiate this hypothesis, we substituted single highly conserved TMD amino acids, the G<sup>100</sup>L, or those residues that remain unchanged in the polyV mutant (syb2 V<sup>101</sup>A and syb2 V<sup>112</sup>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). None of these mutations interfered with the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered secretion response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover a variant, in which all TMD core residues were substituted by an alternating sequence of leucine and valine (denoted polyLV) in order to match the ~50% ß-branched amino acid content of the syb2 TMD, also rescued secretion like the wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

The polyL variant not only lowered the frequency of exocytotic events but also profoundly slowed transmitter release from the vesicle, compatible with the phenotype of a fusion mutant. The release events were characterized by a decreased amplitude and increased rise-time as well as half-width of the amperometric signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). In clear contrast, expression of either polyV or polyI variant accelerated catecholamine release compared to controls, as indicated by significantly higher spike amplitudes, reduced rise-times and half-width values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Evidently, modifying the content of ß-branched amino acids within the TMD causes correlated changes in spike waveform, even producing a gain-of-function phenotype in pore expansion kinetics for TMDs enriched in ß-branched residues. Moreover, TMD mutations also affected the prespike signal and its current fluctuations, which report transient changes in neurotransmitter flux through the early fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>). The polyL mutation prolonged the expansion time of the initial fusion pore, lowered its current amplitude and diminished fluctuations in the signal time-course compared with the wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The polyV and polyI variants shortened prespike duration, increased its amplitude, and current fluctuations. Taken together, the polyL and poly I/V mutants oppositely affect both, the prespike and the spike phase of transmitter discharge, implying that conformational properties of the syb2 TMD govern the fusion process from the opening of the nascent fusion pore to its final expansion.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17571.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PolyL and polyV (or I) mutations oppositely alter the kinetics of prespike signals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Exemplary prespike events and analysis of their current fluctuations (highlighted area) during transmitter discharge through a narrow pore.

Based on the X-ray crystallographic structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stein et al., 2009</xref>), syb2 and its mutant variants were embedded in an asymmetric membrane (mimicking the physiological lipid composition of synaptic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>]) and structural flexibility was calculated from the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF) of the backbone atoms for each peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The results show that conformational flexibility of the TMD region is significantly lowered in the polyL and increased in the polyV variant compared with the wildtype protein. Similarly, changes in the root mean square displacement (RMSD) of the Cα-atoms relative to an ideal α-helix (syb2 0.104 ± 0.004 nm; polyL 0.067 ± 0.003 nm, p&lt;0.001; polyV 0.139 ± 0.005 nm, p&lt;0.001, one-way analysis of variance versus syb2) are paralleled by alterations in α-helix content of syb2 TMD (79 ± 0.56%) and its variants (polyL 83 ± 0.56%, and polyV 65 ± 5.6%). Taken together, changing the frequency of ß-branched residues within the syb2 TMD substantially varies conformational flexibility, which clearly correlates with alterations in the kinetics of the nascent fusion pore as well as in the spike waveform.

We also found that this acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein was largely inefficient in reconstituting Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis in chromaffin cells (21% of syb2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>), albeit showing similar expression levels and sorting to granules as the wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, while expression of syb2-CSP raises secretion significantly over the level of the dko (2% of syb2), the phenotype is still more severe than the secretion deficits seen with the polyL variant (35% of syb2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>), reconfirming that the proteinaceous membrane anchor provides an autonomous facilitating function in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis. Furthermore, like the polyL mutant, the lipid-anchored syb2 prolonged the time course of transmitter discharge during the spike phase (without changing the event charge) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) and even more strongly slowed down kinetics of the early fusion pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). Collectively, these results highlight the important role of the proteinaceous syb2 membrane anchor in membrane fusion, generally facilitating fusion initiation and pore expansion. Our data obtained with the acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein appear to deviate from the previously reported results by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhou et al. (2013)</xref>, wherein the mutant protein significantly rescued synaptic transmission compared to a syb2-RST-mVenus construct serving as control. However, as reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al. (2016)</xref>, the syb2-RST-mVenus construct does not support wildtype like fusion both, in neurons and neuroendocrine cells due to the presence of a positively charged arginine residue in the C-terminal end of the syb2 TMD. Indeed, a previous study has shown that insertion of charged residues in the C-terminal end of the syb2 TMD impairs the release response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ngatchou et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, the reduced ability of the syb2-RST-mVenus construct to rescue neuronal exocytosis may have led to an overestimation of the acylated syb2-CSP response providing an explanation for the apparently discrepant results.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17571.014</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Lipid anchored syb2 failed to support normal secretion from chromaffin cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean capacitance responses upon intracellular perfusion with 19 µM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the indicated groups.

Viral expression of the polyV mutant rescued evoked synaptic transmission to the level of wildtype cells, while the polyL mutant largely failed to support neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>), which is reminiscent of our findings in neuroendocrine cells. Immunofluorescence analyses confirmed that polyL and polyV mutant proteins were indeed targeted to synaptic vesicles with comparable efficiency as the wildtype protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2E–G</xref>). To test whether the flexibility of the syb2 TMD is also critical for quantal signaling, we recorded spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (mEPSCs) in the presence of 1 µM TTX using mass cultures of hippocampal neurons. Compared with the wildtype syb2 protein, expression of the polyL mutant in syb2 ko neurons significantly reduced the frequency of spontaneous events, whereas the polyV mutant fully rescued spontaneous release (ko+syb2: 1.46 ± 0.24 Hz, n = 52; ko+polyL: 0.49 ± 0.12 Hz, n = 23; ko+polyV: 1.42 ± 0.31, n = 21). Notably, the frequency of mEPSCs recorded for the polyL mutant is more than 20fold higher compared to syb2 ko neurons (0.02 ± 0.005 Hz, n = 8), emphasizing the gain-of-function phenotype of the TMD mutant. In contrast, we failed to detect significant alterations in the mean amplitude of the polyL or polyV-mediated mEPSCs compared with the wildtype controls. Potential changes in the release profile of small synaptic vesicles (SSVs) may be masked by dendritic filtering of the receptor-mediated response. Moreover, release from SSVs might be less dependent on TMD-mediated acceleration of fusion pore expansion due to the high curvature of the vesicle, as will be discussed below.</p><p>Taken together, comparable deficits in exocytosis are observed for the TMD mutants in neurons as well as neuroendocrine cells indicating similar structural requirements for v-SNARE TMDs to initiate fusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The membrane-bridging interactions of SNARE proteins bring vesicle and plasma membrane into close apposition and mediate membrane fusion, but the mechanistic events leading to the formation and control of the exocytotic fusion pore have remained unknown. Here, we studied whether the syb2 TMD serves mechanistic functions beyond the passive membrane-anchoring of the force-generating SNARE complex. By systematically changing the structural flexibility of the syb2 TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), we observed secretion phenotypes that highlight the functional impact of the TMD at various stages of membrane fusion. Our experiments provide first evidence that the syb2 TMD plays an active role in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis, acting as a crucial catalyst for membrane merger and fusion pore. These observations raise the important question how TMDs actually contribute to the fusion mechanism.</p><p>While the TMD variants tested here leave the stimulus-secretion coupling unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), mutant syb2 variants designed to dissipate the force transfer between SNARE motif and TMD have been reported to clearly prolong the exocytotic delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>), providing independent evidence for a distinctive and autonomous function of the TMD in membrane fusion. Neither the overall expression level nor colocalization analyses with the intrinsic marker protein cellubrevin delivered evidence for inefficient sorting of the different mutant proteins to chromaffin granules, thus attributing potential fusion deficits to changes in TMD-mediated function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). An exciting interpretation of our data is that TMD mutations may change protein-lipid interactions during Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent fusion by altering the conformational dynamics of the helical backbone. Indeed, previous NMR-studies have shown that increasing the content of ß-branched amino acids of TMD mimic peptides profoundly enhanced lipid mobility and wobbling of lipid head groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agrawal et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">2007</xref>). Hydrophobic nucleation events, in which lipid tails from opposite membranes initially interconnect the adjacent leaflets, have been identified as a highly energy-demanding step <italic>en route</italic> to fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kasson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Risselada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Smirnova et al., 2010</xref>). The reduced fusogenicity of vesicles in chromaffin cells expressing either rigid polyL or lipid anchored syb2 variants indicates that the interplay between flexible SNARE TMDs and surrounding lipids could promote hydrophobic tail protrusion and thereby fusion initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Indeed, our results are supported by previous in vitro work, showing that isolated SNARE TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Langosch et al., 2001</xref>) or syb2-juxtamemembrane region-TMD constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tarafdar et al., 2015</xref>) facilitate liposome-liposome fusion. A similar dependence on protein-lipid interactions for membrane fusion has previously been observed with viral fusogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kasson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Tamm et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis and viral fusion engage common mechanisms to drive membrane fusion. Given that the formation of an initial lipid stalk is generally observed in direct vicinity of SNARE TMDs in MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Risselada et al., 2011</xref>), TMD-rigidifying mutations (e.g. polyL mutation) may lower the probability of lipid splay and thereby produce more unsuccessful fusion attempts with vesicles arrested in a trapped state prior to membrane merger. As fusion mutants are usually expected to slow down stimulus secretion coupling, a scenario where vesicles are led into a trapped state would explain why helix-rigidifying mutations do not alter the kinetics of the exocytotic burst component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Regardless of the exact underlying mechanism, our results support a model wherein conformational flexibility of a proteinaceous v-SNARE TMD is required to surmount the energy barrier for initial membrane merger.</p><p>Fast and efficient discharge of bulky cargo molecules from large secretory vesicles is bound to expansion of the exocytotic fusion pore. Since bilayer bending mechanics allow pores of smaller vesicles to expand more rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez de Toledo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chizmadzhev et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</xref>), increasing the content of ß-branched amino acids in the v-SNARE TMD can ease the expansion of a lipidic pore for larger vesicles as they fuse. Our results show that systematically changing the number of helix-destabilizing, ß-branched valine or isoleucine residues in the syb2 TMD leads to correlated changes in fusion pore behavior. In particular, increasing the number of ß-branched residues within the N-terminal half of the TMD causes an unprecedented gain-of-function phenotype, wherein fusion pore dilation is even accelerated beyond the rate found for the wildtype protein, emphasizing the key role of structural dynamics of the syb2 TMD in membrane fusion. Both, substitution of the syb2 TMD with a lipid anchor or with rigidifying leucine residues strongly slowed down kinetics of transmitter discharge, demonstrating the inherent propensity of the syb2 TMD to promote fusion pore expansion. An attractive explanation for this phenomenon could be that structural flexibility within the N-terminal half of the syb2 TMD counters the highly negative curvature of the membrane’s outer leaflet to drive expansion of the narrow fusion pore neck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). Similarly, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-bound synaptotagmin-1 (syt1) induces positive curvature to the cytoplasmic leaflets of the fusing membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hui et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Martens et al., 2007</xref>) and thereby may destabilize the early fusion pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dhara et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, it stands to reason that SNARE force-mediated membrane straining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kozlov et al., 2010</xref>) and TMD-mediated lipid perturbation together with syt1’s ability to bend membranes are synergistic mechanisms that provide mutual reinforcement to form a nascent lipid bridge between membranes and to drive subsequent pore expansion.</p><p>As an alternative hypothesis, membrane-spanning v- and t-SNARE TMDs have been proposed to form channel structures that are aligned in a stacked manner to generate a gap junction-like pore through the vesicular membrane and plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han and Jackson, 2005</xref>). However, this concept of a proteinaceous fusion pore is difficult to reconcile with our observation that an acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein lacking the TMD can still significantly raise secretion over dko levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Furthermore, TMD variants furnishing hydrophobic, identical residues can rescue (polyLV, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>) or even speed up (polyV and polyI) transmitter discharge, albeit these helices neither exhibit any polarity nor asymmetry with respect to the side-chain volume of residues that could generate different surfaces of the putative proteinaceous pore.</p><p>Homotypic TMD-TMD interactions have been implicated in fusion between vacuoles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hofmann et al., 2006</xref>) and may be involved in a supramolecular assembly of SNARE proteins that precedes the hemifusion state along the fusion pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lu et al., 2008</xref>). However, considering the phenotypes within our set of different TMD mutants (G100L, polyV, polyI, polyLV, polyL-Ct, polyL-Nt), we found that neither key residues for syb2 TMD dimerization (G<sup>100</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fdez et al., 2010</xref>), nor those that comprise the interacting helical face of the TMDs (L<sup>99</sup>, C<sup>103</sup>, I<sup>106</sup>, I<sup>110</sup>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laage and Langosch, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roy et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tong et al., 2009</xref>]), play a significant role for membrane fusion or fusion pore expansion.</p><p>In this context, it is noteworthy that neither deletion nor substitutions of membrane-proximal tryptophane (Trp) residues within the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of syb2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borisovska et al., 2012</xref>) were found to alter the tonic secretion response or fusion pore properties as observed here with the TMD mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, it is unlikely that TMD mutants interfere with functions of the Trp moiety which influences the electrostatic surface potential by controlling the JMD position at the membrane-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Borisovska et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, the fully zippered cis-SNARE complex (all SNAREs in one membrane) also establishes several stabilizing interactions between the TMDs of syb2 (I98, L99, I102, I106) and syntaxin-1 (syx1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stein et al., 2009</xref>) that might be compromised by mutating the TMD core residues. Yet, several lines of evidence render the possibility unlikely that such a scenario is responsible for functional deficits observed with the TMD mutants. First, the complete substitution of syx interacting residues in syb2 TMD with valine (or isoleucine) had no effect on the total secretion and even accelerated fusion pore expansion compared with the wildtype protein. Secondly, the polyV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and the polyLV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) mutants exhibited different kinetics of fusion pore expansion, even though the crucial amino acids I98, I102 and I106 were substituted by valine residues in both mutant variants. These results counter the view that perturbations of ‘lock and key’ like protein-protein interactions between syb and syx TMD are responsible for the functional effects of the TMD mutants. Third, neither short insertions of amino acids (e.g. 2 residue KL insertion) nor insertion of 2 helix breaking proline residues, immediately upstream of the syb2 TMD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>), which should interfere with N- to C-terminal zipping of SNAREs into the bilayer spanning helical bundle, were found to affect overall secretion or fusion pore properties. Even a 5 amino acid insertion had no functional consequences on fusion pore dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kesavan et al., 2007</xref>). These results together with the strong fusion deficits observed for polyL and polyL-Nt mutants suggest thatconformational flexibility of the syb2 TMD (within the cytoplasmic leaflet of the membrane) rather than defined protein-protein interactions upon progressive zipping of syb2/syx TMDs facilitates secretion and fusion pore expansion. Thus, heterodimerization between v- and t-SNARE TMDs likely succeeds but does not promote fusion pore opening and expansion. Notably, single point mutations (G100L, V101A, V112A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), may similarly change structural flexibility of the TMD. Yet, given the observed proportionality between the number of ß-branched amino acids and fusion pore parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), they are not expected to detectably affect fusion pore dynamics.</p><p>The increasing energy barrier for larger vesicles to overcome bilayer bending within their nascent fusion pores is documented in amperometric recordings, showing that larger vesicles form more stable initial fusion pores (i.e. longer prespike duration, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez de Toledo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chizmadzhev et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang and Jackson, 2010</xref>]). The observed systematic dependency of fusion pore dynamics on the number of ß-branched amino acids in the syb2 TMD raises the question whether structural flexibility of TMDs indeed varies among other v-SNARE isoforms and thus could facilitate cargo release in the context of diverse physiological processes. Interestingly, v-SNARE isoforms responsible for exocytosis of differentially-sized secretory vesicles show a considerable degree of variability regarding the content of ß-branched amino acids within the N-terminal half of their TMDs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). v-SNARE proteins, like VAMP7 and VAMP8, contain more than 70% ß-branched amino acids within this TMD region and thereby are well-suited for exocytosis of large zymogen granules and mast cell vesicles facilitating rapid pore expansion and release of their bulky cargo molecules such as interferon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krzewski et al., 2011</xref>) and hexoaminidase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lippert et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Others, like cellubrevin (VAMP3) or syb2 (VAMP2), with an intermediate content of ß-branched amino acids (33% and 44%, respectively), are responsible for exocytosis of smaller-sized vesicles such as chromaffin granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borisovska et al., 2005</xref>), cytotoxic T-cell lytic granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matti et al., 2013</xref>) or small-synaptic vesicles (SSV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schoch et al., 2001</xref>), whereas syb1 with only 22% ß-branched amino acids preferentially mediates SSV exocytosis to release classical neurotransmitters at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Li et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the number of helix-destabilizing ß-branched amino acids within the N-terminal half of different v-SNARE TMDs appears to be evolutionary adapted to the size of vesicles to catalyze fusion pore expansion and facilitate bona fide cargo release. Such a mechanism could also tip the balance between an expanding or non-expanding fusion pore, on the one hand ensuring efficient discharge of bulky cargo molecules from large vesicles and on the other hand favoring release of small cargo as well as rapid recycling of SSVs by reducing the likelihood of complete merger with the plasma membrane.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17571.017</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>TMD sequence alignment of exocytotic v-SNARE variants.

Taken together, SNARE proteins do not only act as force generators by continuous molecular straining on membranes, but also catalyze membrane merger via structural flexibility of their TMDs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Culture of chromaffin cells and hippocampal neurons</title><p>Experiments were performed on embryonic mouse chromaffin cells prepared at E17.5–E18.5 from double-v-SNARE knock-out mice (dko cells; Synaptobrevin-/-/Cellubrevin-/-, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Borisovska et al., 2005</xref>]) or syb2 knock-out mice (syb2 ko; Synaptobrevin-/- [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schoch et al., 2001</xref>]).

The insertion of the transmembrane domain of syb2 in an asymmetric bilayer was carried out using a self-assembly procedure described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the atomistic structure was converted into a coarse-grained (CG) representation using a PerlScript file adapting the Martini coarse-graining method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Monticelli et al., 2008</xref>). The CG protein was positioned at the center of a box with dimensions of 10 × 10 × 11 nm along with overlapping boxes of randomly placed cytoplasmic (CP) lipids and intravesicular (IV) lipids. The composition of CP lipids was 22 Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-PS (POPS), 76 Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-PE (POPE) and 92 cholesterol (CHOL) molecules and IV lipids was 22 Palmitoyl-sphingomyelin (PPCS), 66 Palmitoyl-Oleoyl-PC (POPC) and 52 CHOL. The resulting lipid box was filled with CG water and an appropriate number of Na<sup>+</sup> ions were added to preserve electro-neutrality. This was followed by 1000 steps of energy minimization using steepest descent algorithm after which ten production runs were carried out, each for 200 ns, using a time step of 2 fs. The effective time sampled in the production runs was therefore 2 μs. The CG simulations were analyzed for tilt angle of syb2 transmembrane domain and location of WW domain with respect to the phosphate groups of the membrane. The martini force field employs secondary structure constraints that do not allow changes in conformational states. Based on the CG analyses a representative structure was chosen and converted to an atomistic (AT) representation using a reverse transformation protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wassenaar et al., 2014</xref>). Starting from the reverse-transformed atomistic wildtype structure of the syb2 C-terminal domain in the membrane, residues 97–112 were mutated to either Leu or to Val residues using Modeller to generate the respective mutants. The generated atomistic representations of syb2, polyL and polyV mutants were initially equilibrated for 2 ns with position restraints on the backbone heavy atoms using a harmonic force constant of 1000 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–2</sup>. After this short equilibration, three 40 ns long production simulations were performed for the wildtype starting from different random velocities.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich as the Senior editor and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. One of the three reviewers has agreed to reveal his identity: Matthijs Verhage (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. Generally, we are pleased to inform you that all three reviewers appreciate both the relevance of the questions asked and the high quality of the experimental work, and there is consensus that your work is acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> provided it is revised along the lines described below.

In accordance with the reviewer’s suggestion, we have reformulated the title of the manuscript as <italic>‘</italic>v-SNARE transmembrane domains function as catalysts for vesicle fusion’.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors do not sufficiently address the idea that SNARE-zippering is most likely a three step process in which the linker region at the membrane also interacts, as a last step. Stein et al. 2009 conclude that at least 10 amino acids interact with the Syntaxin linker/TMD, most of them in the syb TMD. This issue is insufficiently addressed.

This should be clearly indicated in the text.</italic> </p><p>While SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) is largely mediated by the cognate SNARE motifs, previous studies have also shown that the TMD of v-SNAREs changes stability to the SNARE complex (Stein et al., 2009). This prompted us to examine whether the loss of function phenotype seen in polyL mutant is due to altered SNARE complex formation, a scenario that may serve as potential explanation for the observed reduction of the flash evoked response. To further clarify this point, we now rephrased our statement:</p><p>“By studying SNARE complex assembly with recombinant proteins, we found that the polyL variant affects neither the rate nor the extent of SNARE complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).[…] Thus, the secretion deficiency in polyL expressing cells is not due to impaired SNARE complex formation, i.e. by causing changes in vesicle priming, but rather reflects defective vesicle fusion.”</p><p><italic>Second, the paper does not sufficiently address possible effects of Syb2 mutagenesis on interaction with the Syntaxin linker and TMD domains.

This should be discussed.</italic></p><p>In the original manuscript we have discussed a potential interference with heteromeric interactions between TMDs of Syntaxin and Synaptobrevin. Still, we fully agree with the reviewer’s suggestion that this issue requires a more elaborated discussion. Furthermore, we also included a discussion of phenotypic differences between TMD mutants and previously measured mutations in the juxtamembrane domain of syb2 (Borisovska et al., 2012). Accordingly, we have rephrased and extended the text:</p><p>“In this context it is noteworthy, that neither deletion nor substitutions of membrane-proximal tryptophane (Trp) residues within the juxtamembrane domain (JMD) of syb2 (Borisovska et al., 2012) were found to alter the tonic secretion response or fusion pore properties as observed here with the TMD mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). […] Thus, heterodimerization between v- and t-SNARE TMDs likely succeeds but does not promote fusion pore opening and expansion.”</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear why the poly-L mutant produces a strong impairment of secretion, in all phases of release, including the sustained phase that is considered to consist of vesicles not primed at the start of the stimulus. The kinetics of release are very similar, suggesting that the whole release process is scaled down or that the number of release sites is strongly reduced. There is no explanation for this important finding and it is not addressed in the Discussion.</italic></p><p>Our findings with the polyL mutant show a strong impairment of secretion at all phases of release, which we attributed to altered fusogenic properties of the syb2 protein, as discussed in the second paragraph of the Discussion section. Alternatively, one might suggest that the TMD mutants may somehow change the ‘priming’ reaction upstream of the final fusion event. However, as outlined already under point #1) and described in the first paragraph of the subsection “Stabilization of the syb2 TMD helix diminishes synchronous secretion”, we find no evidence of impaired SNARE complex formation with polyL mutant. In contrast, our MD simulations provide significant evidence for altered conformational flexibility of the polyL TMD that can be held responsible for the reduced fusion activity of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In good agreement, previous NMR-studies have shown that increasing the content of ß-branched amino acids of TMD mimic peptides profoundly enhanced lipid mobility and wobbling of lipid head groups (Agrawal et al., 2010; Agrawal et al., 2007), which could lower the energy barrier for fusion. Furthermore, our results are supported by previous in vitro work, showing that isolated SNARE TMDs (Langosch et al., 2001) in the absence of any cytoplasmic domain of syb2 facilitate liposome-liposome fusion. Overall, these data provide strong evidence that structural features of v-SNARE TMDs are crucial for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-triggered exocytosis, enabling TMDs to actively promote the fusion process.</p><p>As described above, the reviewer also suggests that the number of release site may be reduced in polyL mutant expressing cells. While this hypothesis cannot be rigorously excluded, to best of our knowledge we are not aware about results from the literature supporting such a scenario. Indeed, it is difficult to envision how TMD mutant variants of a vesicular protein may alter the number of release sites on the plasma membrane.</p><p><italic>3) Throughout the manuscript the authors state that the syb2 TMD plays &quot;an active role&quot; and even &quot;catalyses&quot; fusion. It is not clear what exactly the basis is for this statement. It seems likely that, since zippering starts at the N-terminals and then proceeds until the TMD, the TMD plays a rather passive role and simply follows the rest of the proteins. For the interpretation it seems not essential to make these claims. The authors should either provide clear experimental evidence/reasoning for this conclusion or adjust the conclusions.</italic></p><p>Our functional analyses clearly show that substitution of amino acids with helix stabilizing leucine residues specifically in the N-terminal half of the TMD strongly reduces both, overall secretion and fusion pore dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). This secretion deficit indicates an active, fusion promoting role of the syb2 TMD and has been verified by independent measurements of membrane capacitance and catecholamine secretion (amperometry). This conclusion is further substantiated by the experimental evidence outlined under point #2). In addition, a similar reduction in exocytosis and slowing of fusion pore kinetics was observed by replacing the syb2 TMD with an acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein confirming that conformational flexibility of a proteinaceous v-SNARE TMD is required for fusion. Moreover, an unprecedented gain of function phenotype accelerating the kinetics of fusion pore expansion beyond the rate of wildtype cells was seen with three different TMD mutants (polyV, polyI and polyI-Nt mutants). This further underlines an active, fusion promoting role of the syb2 TMD that clearly goes beyond simple membrane anchoring. These results and possible mechanisms by which the syb2 TMD promotes fusion have been discussed in detail in the Discussion section.</p><p><italic>4) The data using CSP anchors deviate from the data previously obtained by the Sudhof lab. The authors should acknowledge this and provide possible explanations.</italic> </p><p>As requested, we have now included a paragraph providing an explanation for the apparent differences between our data obtained with the acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein in chromaffin cells and the previously reported results by Zhou et al., 2013 in neurons:</p><p>“Our data obtained with the acylated syb2-CSP fusion protein appear to deviate from the previously reported results by Zhou et al., 2013, wherein the mutant protein significantly rescued synaptic transmission compared to a syb2-RST-mVenus construct serving as control. […] Consequently, the reduced ability of the syb2-RST-mVenus construct to rescue neuronal exocytosis may have led to an overestimation of the acylated syb2-CSP response providing an explanation for the apparently discrepant results.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
