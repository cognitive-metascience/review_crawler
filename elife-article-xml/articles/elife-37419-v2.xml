We establish serine-arginine-rich splicing factor 3 (SRSF3) as an essential regulator of RNAs encoding key components of the mouse pluripotency circuitry, SRSF3 ablation resulting in the loss of pluripotency and its overexpression enhancing reprogramming. Strikingly, SRSF3 binds to the core pluripotency transcription factor <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA to facilitate its nucleo-cytoplasmic export independent of splicing. In the absence of SRSF3 binding, <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA is sequestered in the nucleus and protein levels are severely downregulated. Moreover, SRSF3 controls the alternative splicing of the export factor <italic>Nxf1</italic> and RNA regulators with established roles in pluripotency, and the steady-state levels of mRNAs encoding chromatin modifiers. Our investigation links molecular events to cellular functions by demonstrating how SRSF3 regulates the pluripotency genes and uncovers SRSF3-RNA interactions as a critical means to coordinate gene expression during reprogramming, stem cell self-renewal and early development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SR protein</kwd><kwd>RNA processing</kwd><kwd>pluripotent</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>mRNA export</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1042851</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Beilharz</surname><given-names>Traude H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1092280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Knaupp</surname><given-names>Anja S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000923</institution-id><institution>Australian Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polo</surname><given-names>Jose M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008717</institution-id><institution>Sylvia and Charles Viertel Charitable Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Polo</surname><given-names>Jose M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004012</institution-id><institution>Jane ja Aatos Erkon Säätiö</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anko</surname><given-names>Minna-Liisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000925</institution-id><institution>National Health and Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GNT1043092</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Anko</surname><given-names>Minna-Liisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA-binding protein SRSF3 mediates critical changes in RNA processing of pluripotency genes, which reveals functional consequences of regulated RNA processing during stem cell self-renewal and early development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) can be generated from various cell types by the enforced expression of transcription factors such as OCT4, KLF4, SOX2 and MYC (OKSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>). Reprogramming requires a complex coordination of cellular events to transition cells from a differentiated to a self-renewing fate. Many aspects of the molecular machinery governing pluripotency have been uncovered, with the focus on transcriptional regulation, and chromatin modifications. The master transcription factors OCT4, SOX2 and NANOG together with many other factors maintain pluripotency both in iPSCs and embryonic stem cells (ESCs) derived from the inner cell mass of the blastocyst stage embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Los Angeles et al., 2015</xref>). Chromatin modifiers, such as the polycomb repressive complex 1 and 2 (PRC1/2), control self-renewal and differentiation potential by repressing lineage-specific genes and they reset the epigenetic landscape during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De Los Angeles et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006</xref>).</p><p>RNA processing mediated by RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) encompasses many steps in the life of an RNA including pre-mRNA splicing, termination and polyadenylation, nonsense mediated decay (NMD) and mRNA export, with potential to significantly modify the gene expression output at each step. Global changes in alternative splicing (AS) and polyadenylation (APA) patterns take place during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cieply et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ji and Tian, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohta et al., 2013</xref>) but the functional significance of the differential RNA processing is not well understood. Remarkably, ESCs express more than 500 different RBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>), the RBPs investigated to date highlighting the potential of RNA regulation in the control of pluripotency. For instance, MBNL1/2 splicing factors act as negative regulators of pluripotency and reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2013</xref>), the ectopic expression of the splicing factor ESRP1 enhances reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cieply et al., 2016</xref>) and SRSF2 regulates alternative splicing in human pluripotent stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2014</xref>). FIP1 (encoded by <italic>Fip1l1</italic>) promotes maintenance of pluripotency by activating ESC-specific APA profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lackford et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>SRSF3 (serine-arginine-rich splicing factor 3) belongs to the family of SR protein splicing factors. We and others have previously shown that SRSF3 regulates constitutive and alternative splicing as well as other steps of RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Änkö et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Auyeung et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cavaloc et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Steitz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller-McNicoll et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). At the cellular level, SRSF3 expression is regulated during cell cycle, SRSF3 overexpression in cancer cells enhances cell proliferation and its depletion leads to a cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jumaa et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kurokawa et al., 2014</xref>). SRSF3 plays a pivotal role during development as <italic>Srsf3</italic>-null mice fail to form blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jumaa et al., 1999</xref>). SRSF3 was also identified as a potential regulator of reprogramming in an RNAi screen performed in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohta et al., 2013</xref>), but the molecular or cellular mechanisms mediated by SRSF3 during reprogramming are not known. Despite the global identification of SRSF3 RNA targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ankö et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Änkö et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Müller-McNicoll et al., 2016</xref>), the functional significance of SRSF3 RNA-binding activity in vivo remains poorly characterised.</p><p>Here, we establish how SRSF3 governs pluripotency through its activities in RNA metabolism. Using individual-nucleotide resolution UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), we have identified a pluripotency circuitry directly regulated by SRSF3. We provide evidence for the critical role of SRSF3 in NANOG protein expression through its splicing-independent activity in the nucleo-cytoplasmic export of <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA. However, SRSF3 function is not limited to regulating <italic>Nanog</italic>. To coordinate the pluripotency gene expression program, SRSF3 binds to multiple other (pre-)mRNAs encoding core pluripotency transcription factors, chromatin modifiers and RNA processing factors, including the export factor <italic>Nxf1</italic>. By combining SRSF3 RNA-binding sites with RNA-sequencing and functional data, we demonstrate that SRSF3 operates through multiple RNA processing mechanisms to tune and coordinate gene expression at the post-transcriptional level to establish and maintain pluripotency.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SRSF3 facilitates reprogramming</title><p>To investigate the role of SRSF3 in reprogramming and self-renewal, we generated a reprogrammable tamoxifen inducible <italic>Srsf3</italic> knockout mouse model (<italic>Srsf3</italic>-KO/OKSM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In cells isolated from these mice, reprogramming can be activated by Dox leading to reversible expression of OKSM factors, and Cre-recombinase can be induced by 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen (4OHT), resulting in the deletion of exons 2–3 of <italic>Srsf3</italic>.

The numbers of AP positive colonies were significantly reduced in SRSF3-depleted cells compared to controls and untreated (−4OHT) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The few AP-positive colonies that were generated from SRSF3-deficient MEFs consistently failed to form teratomas (n = 5, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The failure of SRSF3-depleted cells to induce the pluripotency program was further confirmed by a strongly reduced expression of <italic>Nanog</italic> and endogenous <italic>Pou5f1</italic> (encoding OCT4) from day 13 onwards when Dox - and ectopic OKSM expression - was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). We did not detect significant increase in cell death in SRSF3-deficient MEFs during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), similar to previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohta et al., 2013</xref>). As the first phase of reprogramming involves the activation of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Polo et al., 2012</xref>), we also assessed cell proliferation in SRSF3-deficient reprogramming cells. We detected a systematic reduction in the number of SRSF3-depleted cells when compared to controls, whereas SRSF3 overexpression led to an increase in cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>).</p><p>To assess the role of SRSF3 in the activation of the pluripotency program during the second phase of reprogramming, we first reprogrammed the cells for 8 days after which SRSF3 depletion was induced and AP-positive colonies detected at day 16. SRSF3 was efficiently depleted following 4OHT treatment by day 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and the number of transgene-independent AP positive colonies was significantly reduced at day 16, accompanied by a reduced expression of pluripotency markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). These data demonstrate that SRSF3 is required to activate the pluripotency program during reprogramming.</p><p>Finally, we determined if SRSF3 overexpression could improve the reprogramming outcome. Reprogrammable MEFs were transduced with a vector encoding <italic>Srsf3</italic> and a GFP reporter or only GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Twenty-four hours later, reprogramming was induced with Dox and transgene-independent iPSC colonies were detected by AP labelling at day 16. SRSF3 overexpression in MEFs resulted in a significantly greater number of AP-positive colonies compared to GFP only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Flow cytometric analysis of cell surface marker expression at reprogramming days 6 and 16 further supported the enhanced reprogramming efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>). This analysis demonstrates that SRSF3 is not only essential for reprogramming but is also able to boost the generation of AP-positive colonies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SRSF3 is essential for the maintenance pluripotency</title><p>To further address the role of SRSF3 is pluripotent cells, we generated iPSCs from <italic>Srsf3</italic>-KO/OKSM MEFs without 4OHT exposure and cultured them for multiple passages before Cre activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Light microscopic inspection showed a rapid loss of iPSC colony morphology following SRSF3 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). NANOG protein expression was strongly reduced in SRSF3-deficient iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), supporting the exit from pluripotency.

Similar to MEFs, SRSF3 depletion in iPSCs led to a reduction in cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Whereas SRSF3-deficient MEFs showed no cell death, the level of AnnexinV/PI-negative cells was reduced in SRSF3-depleted iPSCs compared to controls, indicative of an increase in apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). To exclude that the loss of pluripotency in SRSF3-deficient cells was due to apoptosis, we treated SRSF3 depleted and control iPSCs with the caspase inhibitor QVD and assessed pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Even in the absence of apoptosis, SRSF3 depletion led to a stark increase in the number of differentiating colonies and reduction in the expression of pluripotency markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>), demonstrating that SRSF3 directly contributed to the maintenance of pluripotency. In support of this and unlike SRSF1 and SRSF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>), SRSF3 depletion did not result in increased γH2Ax levels marking DNA double stranded breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>), suggesting that SRSF3 loss does not lead to genomic instability.

To investigate mechanistically if direct SRSF3 binding to <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA was required for its export, we generated <italic>Nanog</italic> expression constructs carrying either the wild type <italic>Nanog</italic> cDNA sequence including 3’UTR (hereafter WT-<italic>Nanog</italic>) or a <italic>Nanog</italic> cDNA sequence where silent mutations abolishing SRSF3-binding sites had been introduced (ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Following transfection into pluripotent cells, these constructs were expressed at similar levels, which did not exceed the endogenous levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As expected, RNA immunoprecipitation showed strongly reduced binding of SRSF3 to ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Nucleo-cytoplasmic fractionation demonstrated that ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA lacking SRSF3-binding sites was retained in the nucleus both in control and SRSF3-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, dotted bars). The intronless mRNA produced from the WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> construct was efficiently exported in control cells while it was retained in the nucleus in SRSF3-depleted iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, compare white and black bars). This demonstrates firstly, that SRSF3 binding is essential for <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA export and secondly, that SRSF3 activity in <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA export is independent of pre-mRNA splicing. We also transfected the WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> or ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> expression construct into HEK293 cells that do not express endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> and do not functionally depend on NANOG protein.

We quantified the levels of alternatively spliced isoforms with MISO (Mixture-of-Isoforms) probabilistic framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Katz et al., 2010</xref>) using the annotated AS events for mouse GRCm38/mm10. Each AS event was assigned a ‘percent spliced in’ (PSI) or ‘percent intron retained’ (PIR) value to represent the percent of transcripts with the exon or intron included. Using a cut-off of ΔPSI≥|0.2| and Bayes factor ≥5, SRSF3 depletion led to a change in 281 annotated AS events, of which the skipped exon (SE) was the most affected category, both in terms of absolute numbers and proportion of assessed events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Overall, more exons showed increase in skipping following SRSF3 depletion, in agreement with the role of many SR proteins in enhancing exon inclusion. Sixty-one percent of the altered AS events had associated SRSF3-binding sites within the transcript region based on our iCLIP data. Because skipped exons were the most affected AS type in the SRSF3 deficient cells providing a sufficient number of data points for global analysis, we next mapped SRSF3-bindings sites around these exons. SRSF3 binding was enriched within the regulated exons, with few sites also mapping up- and downstream (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Inspection of SRSF3-binding sites around exons decreasing in inclusion in SRSF3 depleted cells suggested that SRSF3 binding within the regulated exon or intron enhances inclusion across the AS types (SE, IR, A5SS and A3SS) which is in accordance with SRSF3-binding sites acting as splicing enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37419.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SRSF3 regulated alternative splicing in pluripotent cells and the dynamics of AS during reprogramming.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Different alternative splicing (AS) types affected by SRSF3 depletion in pluripotent cells.

We first determined cumulative changes in AS during reprogramming using MISO by comparing each of the time points to MEFs, which showed a gradual increase in AS from MEFs to iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, top panel) similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cieply et al., 2016</xref>).

A more detailed inspection detected a significant proportion of intronic SRSF3-binding sites mapping around so-called detained introns (DIs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,ii,iii</xref>). DIs are defined as introns spliced out at a slower rate than an average intron, thus representing a rate-limiting regulatory step during splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>). Only a small fraction of DIs were annotated as IR events and assessed by MISO but mapping of DIs to our JunctionSeq data identified differential DI inclusion from MEFs to iPSCs, with an increase in DI inclusion towards iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). SRSF3-binding sites were found in 37% of regulated DIs in contrast to only 27% of non-regulated DIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,iii</xref>). Similar to SRSF3 target RNAs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), DI enrichment was reported in genes encoding proteins involved in RNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, SRSF3-binding sites were detected within DI regions of RNA regulators such as <italic>Nxf1</italic> pre-mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). SRSF3-binding sites mapped to <italic>Nxf1</italic> intron 10, which was classified as DI and dynamically regulated during reprogramming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Although the level of intron containing <italic>Nxf1</italic> mRNA was similar in MEFs and iPSCs, up to 40% intron retention was detected in the reprogramming intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). SRSF3 ablation led to a decrease in the level of intron 10 containing <italic>Nxf1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting that SRSF3 binding is required for the dynamic changes in <italic>Nxf1</italic>-Int10 retention during reprogramming. The intron 10 containing <italic>Nxf1</italic> transcript encodes a short isoform of NXF1 protein that can bind to RNA but cannot interact with the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

Intriguingly, the full-length <italic>Ezh2</italic> mRNA was downregulated in <italic>Srsf3</italic>-KO iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>), providing evidence that SRSF3 specifically regulates the NMD-sensitive <italic>Ezh2</italic> variant. NMD inhibition increased and SRSF3 depletion decreased also the level of the intronless <italic>Epop</italic> mRNA encoding an ESC specific component of PRC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that SRSF3 controls the expression of multiple components of the PRC2 complex.

The functions of SR proteins, including SRSF3, have expanded from essential regulators of splicing to multifaceted mediators of RNA processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zhong et al., 2009</xref>). High-throughput technologies have allowed the cataloguing of SR protein targets, but the impact of SR protein RNA binding at the cellular level has remained largely elusive. Using our reprogrammable <italic>Srsf3</italic> knockout model that allowed a systematic investigation of SRSF3 activity in the generation and maintenance of iPSCs, we demonstrate that SRSF3 is required for both the proliferative phase and the later commitment to pluripotency. The proliferative response of the first wave of reprogramming was largely lost in SRSF3 deficient cells¸ in accordance with the previous RNAi screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ohta et al., 2013</xref>). However, SRSF3 depletion late during reprogramming also greatly reduced the generation of AP-positive pluripotent colonies. We show that SRSF3 controls the commitment to pluripotency directly by targeting key genes of the pluripotency network. Furthermore, overexpression of SRSF3 led to an increase in AP/SSEA1-positive cells, suggesting that SRSF3 could be used to enhance reprogramming efficiency.</p><p>Combination of iCLIP and RNA-seq revealed the significance of SRSF3-mediated RNA regulation for the establishment and maintenance of pluripotency. Remarkably, SRSF3 controlled the expression of the core pluripotency transcription factor NANOG by facilitating the nucleo-cytoplasmic export of <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA. The nuclear sequestration of <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA in SRSF3-deficient iPSCs led to greatly reduced NANOG protein levels. Consistent with this, the cellular phenotype of SRSF3-depleted pluripotent cells resembled that of <italic>Nanog</italic>-null cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>). We demonstrate that the function of SRSF3 in mRNA export is independent of splicing by showing that ectopically expressed intronless wild-type <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA is efficiently exported. Mutation of SRSF3 consensus binding sites abolished SRSF3 binding to <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA and resulted in the nuclear accumulation of the mRNA. In the absence of SRSF3-binding sites, the interaction between <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA and the export factor NXF1 was lost, suggesting that SRSF3 is necessary and sufficient for the recruitment of NXF1 to <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA. Interestingly, knockdown of THO complex components in ESCs resulted in mRNA export defects and loss of pluripotency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that RBP-regulated export of distinct mRNAs may be broadly used to control gene expression in pluripotent cells.</p><p>SRSF3 directly regulated the splicing of multiple pre-mRNAs encoding established pluripotency factors, including other RNA regulators. In particular, SRSF3 bound to pre-mRNAs containing post-transcriptionally spliced detained introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>), one such pre-mRNA encoding the export receptor NXF1. We demonstrate that during reprogramming intron detention is dynamically regulated and may significantly modulate gene expression output in cell fate transitions. SRSF3 bound to and regulated the inclusion of DIs, as exemplified by <italic>Nxf1</italic> pre-mRNA. This extends the well-established role of SRSF3 in enhancing exon inclusion by binding to exonic splicing enhancers to intronic enhancer sequences. SRSF3 increased the production of an intron containing <italic>Nxf1</italic> transcript variant that encodes a short NXF1 isoform incapable of interacting with the nucleopore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, SRSF3 interacts with NXF1 at multiple levels, firstly by regulating <italic>Nxf1</italic> splicing and secondly, by functioning as an mRNA export adaptor of NXF1 at the protein level. This suggests that SRSF3 can influence mRNA export both by regulating NXF1 isoform expression and by directly mediating the export of distinct mRNAs such as <italic>Nanog</italic> in pluripotent cells. More broadly, our data identifies SRSF3 as a regulator of DI-containing pre-mRNAs encoding RBPs beyond <italic>Nxf1,</italic> suggesting that SRSF3 may influence RNA processing in pluripotent cells not only by regulating its direct RNA targets but also through the regulation of other RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Finally, SRSF3 depletion in pluripotent cells led to the downregulation of hundreds of mRNAs, many of which were direct SRSF3 targets. Interestingly, these mRNAs were also regulated at the level of NMD in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>). SRSF3 depletion affected explicitly the level of the NMD-sensitive transcript variants, suggesting a link between SRSF3 and mRNA surveillance pathway. One functional class of NMD-sensitive SRSF3 target mRNAs was chromatin modifiers involved in resetting the epigenome during reprogramming. As a functional output SRSF3 depletion led to a global decrease in repressive H3K27me3 histone marks that are deposited on the promoters of lineage regulators to suppress differentiation in pluripotent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). Surprisingly, the NMD-sensitive transcript variants did not contain PTCs that typically mark mRNAs for degradation. Recent studies have demonstrated that besides degrading aberrant PTC-containing mRNAs, NMD targets many seemingly ‘normal’ mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imamachi et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurt et al., 2013</xref>). The mechanism by which normal mRNAs are targeted to NMD and the exact role of SRSF3 in the process will require further investigation.</p><p>Our results reveal the multifaceted role of SRSF3 in the control of gene expression programs during reprogramming and in self-renewing cells. The determination of SRSF3-mediated RNA processing in pluripotent stem cells not only highlights the significance of post-transcriptional gene regulation during self-renewal but also provides key mechanistic insights into SRSF3 functions during early development. <italic>Srsf3</italic>-null mice die before the blastocysts stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jumaa et al., 1999</xref>), the source of ESCs in the mouse embryo. It is tempting to propose that the mechanisms identified here are applicable to early development. Perhaps <italic>Srsf3</italic>-null embryos cannot establish the pluripotency program due to premature activation of lineage-specific genes following reduced H3K27me3 levels. With drastically decreased production of NANOG protein, pluripotency would not develop in mice, ultimately causing early embryonic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitsui et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Silva et al., 2009</xref>).

The mechanisms identified here may help elucidating the role of SRSF3 in malignant transformation as cancer (stem) cells share many features with self-renewing cells. In conclusion, our examination highlights the importance of RBPs in coordinating the gene expression program that is required to establish and maintain the pluripotent cell fate.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse strains, primary cells and cell lines</title><p><italic>Srsf3</italic> conditional allele was generated from <italic>Srsf3</italic><sup>tm1a(KOMP)Mbp</sup> knockout-first mice (Knock Out Mouse Project, KOMP, UC Davis Mouse Biology Program) via Flpe recombination.

In short, adapters and barcodes were removed from all reads before mapping to the mouse mm10 genome assembly. Uniquely mapping reads were kept to determine statistical significant crosslink sites. For this, iCLIP positions were randomised within co-transcribed regions and statistically significant binding sites (false discovery rate, FDR &lt; 0.05) were calculated. Three biological replicates for SRSF3-BAC and EGFP-NLS control ESCs were pooled for the analysis.</p><p>K-mer analysis was performed for motif search as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">König et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). One occurrence of k-mer (4-mers for noncoding RNAs and 5-mers for all RNAs) within the evaluated interval (−30,–5)(+5,+30) around the crosslink site was counted and weighted by 1.0. Reference data was generated 100 times by random shuffling of crosslink sites within corresponding genome segments and z-score was calculated relative to the randomized positions. The consensus binding motif was calculated from top 15 using MEME (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bailey et al., 2006</xref>). Gene Ontology analysis was performed using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Huang et al., 2009</xref>)</p><p>Paired-end RNA-seq reads aligned to the mm10 reference genome using STAR (v2.5.2) with default parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>). The iPS-1 and iPS-2 control replicates were merged using samtools-merge (Samtools v1.2); producing a combined alignment for the control condition. Differential splicing analysis was done using MISO v0.5.4 (LINK1; in a relaxed configuration where filter_results = False) and the mm10 alternative event annotation (version 2; LINK2). For each AS event type, the treatment replicates were compared to the combined control (using miso_compare); this identified putative treatment-sensitive AS events. The results were then filtered using MISO’s filter_events command (FILTERS: num-inc 1 = at least one inclusion read, num-exc 1 = at least one exclusion read, num-sum-inc-exc 10 = at least 10 reads of any kind in one of the samples’ delta-psi 0.20 = minimum 0.2 delta PSI, bayes-factor 5 = bayes factor at least 5). Similarly, the paired-end MEF-to-iPSC time-course reads were aligned to the mm10 reference genome using STAR (v2.5.2). The differential splicing analysis was done as above.</p><p>Splice junctions from the MEF-to-iPSC time-course were reconstituted from the corresponding transcript annotations, flanked by 100 nt up- and downstream of each junction. The resulting alignments were used as input for JunctionSeq analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anders et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hartley and Mullikin, 2016</xref>), which is based on the DEX-seq model but has been reported to detect readily novel splice junctions and intron retention. Briefly, exon coordinates from transcript models with a Transcript Support Level of 1 (the most stringent) were extracted and used as input for QoRTS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hartley and Mullikin, 2015</xref>), together with the alignments from the time-course RNA-seq data. The capability of QoRTS to call novel splice junctions from the data was enabled. The output from QoRTS, a flat exon/junction annotation file, was used together with the alignment data as input for the JunctionSeq software to detect differential exon/junction usage between time-points. Each time-point was contrasted against the original MEF cells (day-0) in one JunctionSeq run. In another run, each time-point was contrasted to the previous time-point. In a third run, all time-points were considered together in the one linear model to test for any effect at all of time-point on exon/junction usage. Log<sub>2</sub>-fold changes reported are all variance-stabilised transformation of the original log<sub>2</sub> fold-changes in expression estimates. In each of the pairwise contrast between timepoints, exonic/junction, features with a FDR &lt; 0.05 were classed as 'regulated', while others were classed either as unregulated (FDR &gt; 0.05), or 'untestable' (too few reads observed in both time points), by JunctionSeq.</p><p>Data for SRSF3 iCLIP was filtered for sites that also appeared in the GFP iCLIP control, then converted to bed format. This data was then merged with the exon/junction feature annotations from QoRTS (including de novo junction calls) using BedTools. Detained intron data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutz et al., 2015</xref>) was similarly merged with the QoRTS annotation. For k-means clustering of time-point data, a minimum autocorrelation filter (correlation between consecutive time-points) was set at 0.1, and maximum and minimum log<sub>2</sub> fold changes of 8.5 and 0.5, respectively, were also applied. The number of clusters was set to 20.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Juan Valcárcel is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The editors and referees agreed that there was too much further work needed to ask for a revised version at this point (see joint report below) and we are therefore returning your manuscript to you in case you wish to submit elsewhere. However, if you are willing and able to carry out the additional experiments and analysis requested, we would welcome the submission of a revised paper at a later date. This would be treated as a new submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ratnadiwakara et al. further explore the role of the SR protein SRSF3 in reprogramming using a tamoxifen inducible Srsf3 mouse KO model in conjunction with a system for Dox induced expression of OKSM factors to reprogram MEFs to iPSCs. The study confirms the prior report by Ohta et al. showing that Srsf3 is induced during reprogramming and that depletion or ablation of Srsf3 reduces reprogramming efficiency as well as a loss of established pluripotency markers in iPSCs and loss of iPSC colony formation. The investigators note that there is a substantial reduction in protein levels of the pluripotency gene Nanog, but not mRNA in iPSCs following inducible Srsf3 KO. Follow up experiments supported the concept that Srsf3 promotes nuclear export of Nanog mRNA. Subsequent iCLIP experiments identify Nanog as a direct target of Srsf3 with binding sites in the first and last coding exon. A model is proposed where Srsf3 ablation leads to a loss of Nanog export. The iCLIP results also reveal other Srsf3 associated transcripts encoding pluripotency markers as well of regulators of chromatin state and other RNA binding proteins. Further studies explore the role of Srsf3 in regulating alternative splicing and stability of several targets, including the export receptor Nxf1, which had previously been shown to associate with Srsf3 and play a role in export. How this might be mechanistically linked to the effects on Nanog localization is not clear. Subsequent studies use RNA-Seq to identify changes in gene expression across the reprogramming time course and identify enrichment of Srsf3 binding features in or near several regulated exons and introns. mRNA-Seq was not carried out after Srsf3 depletion – which would have allowed more direct identification of Srsf3-regulated alternative splicing events. Since Srsf3 levels increase during reprogramming, it is reasonable to assume that a fraction of regulated events will be influenced by Srsf3. RNA features regulated during reprogramming and with associated Srsf3 CLIP tags were therefore identified (&quot;SARFs&quot;). A large fraction of SARFs showed intron binding – rather than the exon binding characteristic of splicing enhancement by Srsf3 – and many of the intron binding events overlapped with &quot;detained introns&quot; identified by Boutz and colleagues. The remaining experimental data looked into some examples of potential Srsf3 regulated splicing events with possible connections to the observed phenotype.</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written and presented, and the initial experiments setting up the iPS system with Srsf3 KO carefully conducted. The results are of interest because they emphasize the role of coordinated, multilayer post-transcriptional mechanisms of regulation in cellular pluripotency. The report confirms the important role of Srsf3 in pluripotency and development and has the potential to further inform our understanding of the mechanisms by identifying a number of different processes and targets that may be directly regulated by Srsf3. However, given that previous publications (adequately referenced by the authors) have already reported a role for SRSF3 in cell reprogramming (including effects on alternative splicing and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of genes relevant for pluripotency, including Nanog), for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> the authors should make additional efforts to a) better document many of the experimental results, and b) consolidate the more novel aspects of their mechanistic findings (e.g. the role of SRSF3 on Nanog mRNA export).</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Function of SRSF3 in mRNA export (Figure 4): further work is required to rigorously prove that SRSF3 binding is essential for Nanog mRNA export, that this is the main post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation of this transcript and that it has an impact on cell reprogramming. Nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution analysis of Nanog transcripts (Figure 4C) is not convincing, including the surprising equal partition of <italic>Hprt</italic> mRNAs, the apparent variability in the fraction of Nanog nuclear transcripts under normal conditions (0.4 in Figure 4C, 1.0 in Figure 4F), the relatively small (2-3 fold) and equal amount of nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNA in KO cells (which hardly seems to qualify as an export block) and, most importantly, the absence of standard marker analysis of the nucleus/cytoplasmic fractionation.</p><p>Furthermore, the experiments in Figure 4D and 4E are difficult to interpret as they are not explained in the text, legends, or Materials and methods section. Presumably these are overexpressed cDNAs? Were there any introns in the plasmid? If not, there might be concerns that the Srsf3-dependent export might be related to this artificial setting? Quantification of the total RNA levels of WT and ΔSRSF3 mRNAs should be shown, as well as statistical significance of differences in Figure 4E.</p><p>Given that Muller-McNicoll et al. already reported a role for SRSF3 in <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA N/C transport, further demonstration that this is a limiting step in reprogramming would be expected. For example, is there evidence that the reduction in NANOG levels caused by the defect in transport is sufficient to compromise reprogramming (e.g. are ΔSRSF3 <italic>Nanog</italic> transcripts, expressed at levels comparable to endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic>, insufficient to mediate reprogramming)?</p><p>2) Documenting splicing changes associated with SRSF3 (Figure 5). The methods for quantitative analysis of splicing from RNA-Seq data and the subsequent follow up by qRT-PCR data in most cases did not allow assessment of the true degree of splicing change in KO cells or of the likelihood that identified events were truly connected to the phenotype. Specifically, none of the changes in splicing were expressed as changes in &quot;percent spliced in&quot; (PSI) or &quot;percent intron retention&quot; (PIR). Instead the focus was on statistically significant relative fold-changes of individual spliced junctions. Ideally, all the examples of regulated events should include quantitative information about the PSI changes observed.</p><p>Indeed from the genome browser views shown (Figure 5E,G and Figure 5—figure supplement 1E-H) only the increased Mbnl2 e6 inclusion (Figure 5E) was readily apparent by manual inspection. Even for this case, it would be helpful if the PSI values from RNA-Seq and from an RT-PCR spanning both introns flanking alt exon 6 (i.e. to look directly at inclusion versus skipping) were shown because the level of exon 6 in MEFs appears negligible, and hence it is not clear if a 3-fold increase in exon 6 splicing is quantitatively meaningful. It is also noted that the level of exon 6 inclusion in control cells does not change during the period of Srsf3 upregulation, calling into question the model where it promotes exon skipping. Figure 5E appears to show a substantial increase in PSI of Mbnl2 exon 6 between MEFs and iPSCs (judged from the relative height of the exon peaks – junction reads are not shown, Figure 5E and Figure 5—figure supplement 1F), as well as an increase in retention of introns 5 and 7. Yet in the time course in Panel F, the &quot;exon inclusion&quot; is quantitated by normalizing the exon 6-7 amplicon against <italic>Hprt</italic> and shows no change between day 1 and 16 (both are ~1.0). Perhaps this is because the qRT-PCR primers detect changes in both exon 6 PSI and expression level changes of Mbnl2, so that increased PSI is balanced by decreased overall Mbnl2 expression? If qRT-PCR is used to monitor relative changes in particular isoforms/alternative junctions, there should always be a separate primer pair across a constitutive junction in the same gene e.g. exon 7-8 in this case. A reciprocal primer pair should also ideally be used to assess the alternative &quot;feature&quot; – in this case Mbnl2 exon 6 skipping. Alternatively, RT-PCR using a single pair of primers in exons 5 and 7 could be used to give a direct read-out of PSI.</p><p>Similarly, the intron retention event in Nxf1 appears relatively low without an apparent difference in MEFs vs. iPSCs. This event does not appear in EST databases, raising the question as to whether the intron reads seen in the RNA-Seq represent unspliced introns that are nonetheless removed prior to export. While there is certainly a substantial reduction in intron 10 retention in response to Srsf3 KO (Figure 5H), intron retention appears to be a relatively minor pathway that does not appear to be strongly regulated during reprogramming (Figure 5—figure supplement E). Thus, the possible effect of Srsf3 to produce a possible truncated protein remains speculative and there is not sufficient evidence for &quot;SRSF3 binding led to increased intron inclusion and production of a transcript variant encoding a short isoform of NXF1.&quot;</p><p>3) RNA-seq analyses. Unfortunately, the authors did not carry out a corresponding RNA-Seq analysis of gene expression and splicing in Srsf3 KO cells compared to controls at a relevant time point (e.g. day 16) to more directly validate the functionality of the Srsf3 binding targets by iCLIP. This is a necessary experiment and would be particularly valuable given that the authors did not have immunoprecipitation or input controls for the iCLIP which has been shown in several studies to be important to identify bona fide direct targets.</p><p>It would also be useful to summarize the types of RNA feature that are detected by JunctionSeq (it does not appear to consider the &quot;classical&quot; alternative splicing event types involving reciprocally changing features (cassette exon, retained intron etc), but rather individual splice junctions). It might be worth considering using one of the analysis pipelines that analyses &quot;events&quot; and provides a deltaPSI output (e.g. MISO, rMATS, MAJIQ…).</p><p>4) Data supporting a role for SRSF3 in regulating mRNA stability or other events (Figure 6). These data are either counterintuitive or are difficult to understand at the gene level. There are no experiments using standard mRNA stability assays (such as changes in half life after actinomycin D) and it is not clear in each of the cases shown how NMD would explain the differences in mRNA levels. The authors would need to show clearly how premature termination codons (PTCs) are being introduced in order to understand how NMD is involved. For <italic>Ezh2</italic> and <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> do they propose that an alteration in splicing is rendering the transcripts subject to NMD? If NMD is being invoked to explain the reduction in total mRNA in 6A, then it is not clear why both Ex 2-3 and Ex 19-20 primers would not show reduced levels in KO. In the case of <italic>Epop</italic>, there is no indication as to how the authors think NMD would account for the reduction in mRNA levels from this intronless gene with no PTC. Did the observed overlap of SRSF3 CLIP tags with detained intron events (Figure 5) and NMD-associated events (Figure 6) represent statistically significant enrichments?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37419.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Function of SRSF3 in mRNA export (Figure 4): further work is required to rigorously prove that SRSF3 binding is essential for Nanog mRNA export, that this is the main post-transcriptional mechanism of regulation of this transcript and that it has an impact on cell reprogramming.

These clarifications are also provided in the amended Results section and/or Materials and methods section of the manuscript. In experiments presented in Figure 4D-G, a WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> overexpression construct was used as a control to assure that the lack of introns or the level of expression did not have an impact on the interpretation of the results. Furthermore, primers specific for the overexpressed constructs were used and the same primers were used to quantify both WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> and ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> levels. As shown in the new supporting figure, the WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> and ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> mRNAs were expressed at equal levels that were comparable to the endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA level (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). The WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> cDNA overexpressed in control pluripotent cells was exported similar to the endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA (Figure 4C, F). In SRSF3-KO cells, endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic>, overexpressed WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> and ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> mRNAs were all retained in the nucleus. We also transfected the WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> and ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> constructs into HEK293 cells that do not express endogenous <italic>Nanog</italic> but do express SRSF3 and NXF1 and show that similar to pluripotent cells WT-<italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA is exported while the ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> is retained. We further show that NXF1 is not able to bind to <italic>Nanog</italic> mRNA lacking SRSF3 binding sites but binds to WT-<italic>Nanog</italic>. Importantly, the use of the cDNA constructs allowed us to show that the function of SRSF3 in mRNA export can be separated from its activity in splicing.</p><p>There are conflicting reports on the effect of NANOG on reprogramming outcome and its role during reprogramming, suggesting that the exact timing of NANOG overexpression is likely critical. As determining the time window for NANOG overexpression in reprogramming is beyond the scope of this manuscript, we did not perform the experiment overexpressing ΔSRSF3-<italic>Nanog</italic> during reprogramming. We would like to note that similar to the role of SRSF3 in mRNA export, the depletion of the THO export complex involved in the export of a different set of mRNAs in pluripotent cells and during reprogramming, is sufficient to induce differentiation and inhibit reprogramming. This suggests that mRNA export is broadly used as a post-transcriptional mechanism to regulate pluripotency. We have referenced the THO paper in the manuscript.</p><p>Specific questions regarding Figure 4C and F nucleo-cytoplasmic distribution analysis: The values in 4C have been normalised to Ctrl (=1), so they are relative values. Similarly, in 4F the values have been normalised to Ctrl. Thus, values in Figures 4C and 4F are not directly comparable. This also means that <italic>Hprt</italic> levels are not equal in the nucleus and cytoplasm. Of note, at least for <italic>Actb</italic> mRNA in Mueller-McNicoll et al., 2017, the mature mRNA levels are equal in the nucleus and cytoplasm (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B of the paper). We have included the standard marker analysis for nucleo-cytoplasmic fractionation in Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We have included more detail in the text and figure legends to clarify the experimental design and data analysis. We have added the total mRNA quantifications in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Documenting splicing changes associated with SRSF3 (Figure 5).

We have used PSI or PIR values in all figures when possible. For the qPCR analysis of <italic>Nxf1</italic> intron retention, we expressed the data as% -retained (retained/total) which takes into account any changes in expression. We have used both MISO and JunctionSeq analysis in the context of the reprogramming time course (Figure 5 and Figure 6), as well as compared the two. To further consolidate the data, we have now focused on <italic>Nxf1</italic> splicing regulation and provide other regulated events as further examples of the dynamic SRSF3 mediated splicing during reprogramming. We have included in the Figure 6—figure supplement 1 data on previously identified transcripts with intron detention and show that we can detect these events, and in fact, <italic>Clk1</italic> and <italic>Mdm4</italic> that were previously investigated by Boutz et al. are regulated during reprogramming. This provides further support for the dynamic changes in intron detention during reprogramming, and the involvement of SRSF3 in the splicing of detained introns and exons flanking them.</p><p>Specific queries regarding Figure 5 (current Figures 5 and 6): Although PIR or PSI differences between MEFs and iPSC were not large, there was in each case a significant change in the course of reprogramming (for example, <italic>Nxf1</italic> intron retention increased from PIR 0.1 to 0.4 by day 12 which exceeds the commonly used significance criterion of 0.2). Furthermore, by only comparing MEFs to iPSC many important regulatory events are clearly missed and RNA processing changes during cell transitions need to be characterised throughout the process. There are a number of published papers (that we cite) on the <italic>Nxf1</italic> intron retention event and it is annotated in multiple genome databases so it is surprising if it does not appear in EST databases. It is hard to define what level of splicing is biologically meaningful and any cut-off is arbitrary. We feel that the strong loss-of-pluripotency phenotype is the best evidence for the biological significance of SRSF3 mediated splicing regulation during reprogramming and in pluripotent cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) RNA-seq analyses.

We focused our analysis on skipped exons because this is the largest group annotated and assessed by MISO and thus provided a sufficient number of data points for reliable analysis. The ‘SRSF3 RNA-map’ is first of its kind as previous SRSF3 CLIP-seq or RNA-seq studies have not mapped the binding sites to regulated exons.</p><p>We have now analysed the reprogramming time course RNA-seq data using MISO and JunctionSeq. We demonstrate that AS is affected across event types during reprogramming. We have included the proportions of the different types of AS events during the reprogramming time course. We originally chose to use JunctionSeq because it allowed an unbiased assessment of both annotated and novel RNA processing changes. Our focus was to determine the localisation of SRSF3 binding sites relative to splice junctions that change during reprogramming and therefore JunctionSeq was a good alternative. This analysis captured the previously reported cumulative increase in alternative splice site usage from MEFs to iPSCs (Ohta et al., 2013 and Cieply et al., 2016) and readily captured RNA processing changes across expression levels and independent of gene expression changes (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). The re-analysis using MISO did not change our interpretations. Importantly, it further confirmed that most splicing changes take place at day 3 and iPSC, and that the comparison of iPSCs to MEFs represents a cumulative increase in AS, the transition from day 12 to iPSC contributing most events.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Data supporting a role for SRSF3 in regulating mRNA stability or other events (Figure 6). These data are either counterintuitive or are difficult to understand at the gene level. There are no experiments using standard mRNA stability assays (such as changes in half life after actinomycin D) and it is not clear in each of the cases shown how NMD would explain the differences in mRNA levels. The authors would need to show clearly how premature termination codons (PTCs) are being introduced in order to understand how NMD is involved. For Ezh2 and Dnmt3a do they propose that an alteration in splicing is rendering the transcripts subject to NMD? If NMD is being invoked to explain the reduction in total mRNA in 6A, then it is not clear why both Ex 2-3 and Ex 19-20 primers would not show reduced levels in KO. In the case of Epop, there is no indication as to how the authors think NMD would account for the reduction in mRNA levels from this intronless gene with no PTC. Did the observed overlap of SRSF3 CLIP tags with detained intron events (Figure 5) and NMD-associated events (Figure 6) represent statistically significant enrichments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified this section. We have included the analysis of differential gene expression in SRSF3 depleted cells as well as compared DEGs to the data from Hurt et al., 2013. We have re-worded our conclusions based on the current Figure 7 to state that SRSF3 is involved in controlling the steady-state levels of distinct mRNAs regulated by NMD in pluripotent cells. Our data and the data by Hurt et al. show that in many cases only one mRNA (called isoform in Hurt et al.) is affected by NMD inhibition, suggesting that transcripts produced from a single gene can be differentially regulated. It is important to note that these mRNAs (isoforms) do not necessarily contain PTCs. Multiple recent studies (for instance, Imamachi et al., 2017, Colombo et al., 2017, Hurt et al., 2013 and Zund et al.) demonstrate that besides degrading aberrant mRNAs that harbor PTCs, NMD also targets many seemingly &quot;normal&quot; mRNAs that encode full-length proteins. Further studies are required to fully define how the NMD machinery recognises these mRNAs. We show that SRSF3 specifically binds to and regulates the abundance of NMD-sensitive mRNAs (isoforms).</p><p>Specific queries regarding Figure 7: We have now determined the half-lives of the mRNAs as in Ke et al., 2016 and added n values or statistics where relevant.</p></body></sub-article></article>
