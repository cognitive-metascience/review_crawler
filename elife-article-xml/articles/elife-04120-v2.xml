nuclear export of unspliced and singly-spliced viral mRNAs. Multiple Rev subunits assemble on the Rev Response Element (RRE), a structured region present in these RNAs, and direct their export through the Crm1 pathway. Rev-RRE assembly occurs via several Rev oligomerization and RNA-binding steps, but how these steps are coordinated to form an export–competent complex is unclear. Here, we report the first crystal structure of a Rev dimer-RRE complex, revealing a dramatic rearrangement of the Rev-dimer upon RRE binding through re-packing of its hydrophobic protein–protein interface. Rev-RNA recognition relies on sequence-specific contacts at the well-characterized IIB site and local RNA architecture at the second site. The structure supports a model in which the RRE utilizes the inherent plasticity of Rev subunit interfaces to guide the formation of a functional complex.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04120.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04120.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04120.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To be able to multiply, viruses have to first infect a host cell and then hijack the host's molecular machinery to make viral proteins. One stage of this process takes place in the nucleus of the host cell and involves the viral DNA being transcribed to make RNA molecules. These RNA molecules must then be exported from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, where the viral proteins are made.</p><p>In the case of HIV-1, a protein called Rev has an important role in the export process. The Rev protein, which is supplied by the virus, binds to a region on the viral RNA molecules called the Rev Response Element. The Rev protein then binds to a group of host proteins called the Crm1 export complex to send the viral RNA molecules to the cytoplasm.</p><p>Jayaraman et al. now provide the first in-depth 3D structure of two Rev molecules bound to a fragment of the Rev Response Element. The Rev molecules change shape when they bind to the element, and specific regions of the element were found to be important for this. The experiments suggest that the Rev Response Element directs the positioning of the Rev proteins on itself to match the shape needed to bind to Crm1 export complex. In parallel work from the same laboratory, Booth et al. have produced a 3D structure of the whole complex.</p><p>Both structures shed new light on how the HIV-1 virus is able to multiply in its host, which may aid future efforts to develop new treatments for the disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04120.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04120.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>protein-RNA structure</kwd><kwd>nuclear export</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P50GM082250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Frankel</surname><given-names>Alan D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005192</institution-id><institution>California HIV/AIDS Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jayaraman</surname><given-names>Bhargavi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A pliable hydrophobic interface in the HIV-1 Rev protein enables assembly of diverse oligomeric structures, guided by the RRE scaffold present in HIV-1 mRNAs.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retroviruses such as HIV have small genomes and utilize multiple strategies such as overlapping reading frames and alternative splicing, to encode their repertoire of proteins.

This assembled RNP then presents Leu-rich nuclear export sequence (NES) peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) to interact with the host export receptor, Crm1, targeting these RRE-containing mRNAs for export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>). In this paper we address the structural principles that govern assembly of the Rev oligomer onto the RNA and its consequences for Rev function.</p><p>The binding of Rev to the RRE is nucleated at the stem IIB hairpin, where the α-helical arginine-rich motif (ARM) of Rev (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>) binds in the major groove of the RNA and makes an extensive set of sequence-specific and electrostatic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malim et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cook et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Heaphy et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kjems et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battiste et al., 1996</xref>). The oligomeric complex proceeds to form by the sequential addition of Rev subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pond et al., 2009</xref>). Crystal structures of Rev oligomerization surfaces depict a central hydrophobic core that mediates interactions between Rev subunits and positions the ARMs on one side of the Rev oligomer to bind RNA and the NESs on the other side to recruit Crm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DiMattia et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daugherty et al., 2010b</xref>), highlighting the modular nature of the Rev domains.</p><p>In addition to the modular architecture of Rev, the RNA scaffold also plays a key role in defining the organization of the complex. Biochemical studies have shown that the RRE controls the oligomeric state of Rev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daugherty et al., 2010a</xref>), and a recent SAXS structure shows that the RRE adopts an ‘A’ shaped architecture poised to recruit Rev (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). It remains unknown how the RNA structure is matched to the arrangement of the Rev oligomer to form the export–active complex.</p><p>One particularly fascinating question is how the individual subunits of Rev recognize the RRE. An NMR structure of a single α-helical ARM bound to the IIB RNA hairpin has been known for quite some time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Battiste et al., 1996</xref>), and a second binding site in stem IA was identified that utilizes a different surface of the helical ARM from another subunit to recognize the RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty et al., 2008</xref>). Other binding sites in the RRE may use yet other recognition strategies that have not been defined. As a step towards understanding how individual binding sites are organized on the RRE, how their arrangement relates to the architecture of the Rev oligomer, and how the different sites are recognized by Rev, we solved the structure of a Rev dimer bound to an RRE fragment (IIB40) containing two Rev-binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This first high-resolution structure of a Rev-RRE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) uncovers yet another RNA recognition mode for Rev and shows how the remarkable plasticity of the Rev dimer allows it to adapt to the RNA framework.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rev dimer-RRE structure</title><p>To better understand how Rev assembles an oligomeric complex on the RRE, we sought to determine the crystal structure of a Rev-RNA complex.

Gel shift assays show that Rev binds to RRE stem II and to IIB40 with comparable affinity and cooperativity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that IIB40 recapitulates Rev assembly at the entire stem II junction.</p><p>We attempted co-crystallizations using ∼35–40 RNA variants with altered stem lengths and tetraloop sequences and obtained well-diffracting crystals with only a single Rev dimer-IIB40 complex.

Thus, mutation of Gln51 to alanine results in accumulation of Rev monomer-RNA complexes and ∼30-fold reduced affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

The modest effect of the mutation in the full-length context suggests that the Gln51 interaction may be less crucial during later stages of Rev-RRE assembly and the energetic contributions to cooperative binding may shift to other interactions, possibly coupled to further rearrangements of the Rev subunit interfaces.

It is formed by an A44-G76 base-pair, identified earlier by in vitro selection studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel et al., 1991</xref>), and a A42-U43 bulge that widens an otherwise narrow A-form major groove to accommodate the α-helix of the second Rev subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Both A42 and U43 are unpaired and A42 is co-axially stacked on stem IIB, consistent with biochemical mapping experiments showing increased accessibility of these nucleotides upon Rev binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charpentier et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2014</xref>). Neither base is directly contacted by Rev, suggesting that their primary role is to create the junction site architecture. Consistently, deleting the bulge results in exclusively monomeric binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and previous studies showed that simply introducing bulges with variable sequences juxtaposed to IIB is sufficient to mediate co-operative Rev binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zemmel et al., 1996</xref>). Most contacts at the junction site are to the phosphate backbone with the exception of Arg 43 and Arg44 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, Arg44 from both Rev subunits contacts the two binding sites on the RNA, in one case using water-mediated interactions not previously observed for RRE recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 1, 2</xref>).</p><p>The junction site in the full-length RRE is formed by three stems (IIA, IIB, and IIC), with only IIB and IIC present in the crystallized IIB40 RNA. Stem IIA likely forms an A-form helix that merges into the junction to determine the relative placement of the remaining RRE. The second Rev subunit is positioned in the crystal structure to use its higher order oligomerization surface to recruit a third Rev subunit with its ARM oriented towards stem IIA for sequential Rev assembly. Presumably, the overall ‘A’-shaped RRE topology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2013</xref>) and arrangement of binding sites dictates the positioning of newly recruited subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). The specific model for Rev-RRE assembly proposed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al.

Rev dimers formed later during assembly are likely positioned to bridge the two arms of the ‘A’-shaped RRE, presumably involving the IA site.</p><p>The diversity of RNA recognition by the Rev ARM is quite striking, now with examples of how Rev binds to three sites in the RRE, and yet other binding modes observed with in vitro selected nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xu and Ellington, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ye et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bayer et al., 2005</xref>). The current crystal structure shows that each of the two ARMs of the Rev dimer deeply insert into a distorted RNA major groove, each burying ∼1500 Å<sup>2</sup> of surface area, and that the same face of the ARM is used to contact the RNA in both cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). However their helical registers differ and recognition of IIB is highly sequence-specific compared to the junction site. Furthermore, at another characterized Rev-binding site in the RRE, stem IA, yet a different binding mode seems to be utilized, with mutational studies indicating a different face of the ARM used to bind the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The Rev-RNA interface at the junction site illustrates that protein contacts at individual RRE sites can be largely sequence-nonspecific if the ARM is optimally presented to the RNA, especially from the context of additional bound Rev subunits. While binding to some sites such as stem IIB or IA can show substantial specificity even in their isolated contexts, this does not seem to be the case for the remaining Rev binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty et al., 2008</xref>). Binding at these sites might require a more extensive RRE framework and neighboring Rev subunits and may differ from the configuration seen at the junction site, potentially adding further diversity to the recognition modes utilized by the ARM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Contributions of RNA-binding and dimer interface residues to Rev function</title><p>To test the functional implications of the observed interactions in the crystal structure, we monitored the effects of key mutations in Rev on RRE binding, viral RNA export, and viral replication.

In the dimer-RNA complex however, alanine substitution of Arg44, which contacts both RNA sites, was most deleterious (250-fold reduced affinity) followed by Asn40 (100-fold), Arg39 (30–50-fold), and Arg38 (10-fold) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These mutations, as well as mutation of Gln51 which hydrogen bonds across the dimer interface, were all defective in viral RNA export and translation in Rev-RRE-dependent Gag-Pol reporter assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Our structure of the Rev-RRE complex illustrates a direct physical coupling between RNA binding and protein oligomerization, where RNA binding drastically alters the conformational state of the Rev dimer. The architecture of the RRE and positioning of individual Rev-binding sites configures the predominantly hydrophobic protein–protein interfaces to form a cooperative complex. This is reminiscent of the DNA-induced hetero-dimerization of nuclear receptors, where DNA sequence and spacing between protein-binding half-sites configures the dimer interface and dictates the choice of dimerization partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Meijsing et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rastinejad et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The use of non-polar residues at protein–protein interfaces has been postulated to be an attractive choice for evolutionary change as it can readily accommodate structural perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lesk and Chothia, 1980</xref>). Structural studies of the HIV-1 capsid protein clearly illustrate the role of plasticity at interfaces to assemble complex structures such as fullerene cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Byeon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pornillos et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>). The simple modular structure of Rev, including its pliable protein–protein interface and diverse RNA-binding domain, highlights how a virus with limited coding capacity can build a large, asymmetric RNP using a small, homo-oligomeric protein to achieve remarkable structural and functional complexity.</p><p>Our structure expands the repertoire of known Rev dimer conformers to three, each with different crossing angles between the RNA-binding helices. Given the hydrophobic nature of the interfaces, other conformers are possible, especially when placed in the context of host–protein complexes. These conformers can be combined in multiple arrangements to generate oligomers with diverse architectures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Since Rev likely interacts with other host proteins to transport and package viral RNAs during the virus life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jager et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Naji et al., 2012</xref>), different quaternary structures of Rev may generate conformational states adapted to different host complexes at various stages of viral replication. This is highly reminiscent of the Ebola virus protein VP40, whose dimeric, hexameric, and octameric forms each have different roles in the viral life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bornholdt et al., 2013</xref>), again highlighting the value of adaptable homo-oligomers in small RNA viruses. Recent crystal structures of HIV Tat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tahirov et al., 2010</xref>) and Vif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guo et al., 2014</xref>) with host protein complexes illustrate the importance of scaffolding structures to enable viral proteins to adopt ordered, functional states. It is remarkable that for Rev, it is not the folding of a single polypeptide chain that is dictated by its scaffolding partner(s) but rather its oligomeric architecture.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04120.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Potential diversity of Rev oligomeric structures and functional implications.</title><p>Three types of Rev–Rev interactions observed by crystallography, Rev dimers in the RNA-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daugherty et al., 2010b</xref>) or RNA-bound states (the current structure) and a Rev dimer using the higher-order oligomer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DiMattia et al., 2010</xref>) are shown within the circle with Rev in grey and the Rev-ARMs in blue.

The ‘jellyfish’ model depicts Rev hexamers to be associated with the RNA on one side of the protein and NESs that recruit Crm1 export receptors on the other side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daugherty et al., 2010b</xref>). Recent structural studies show that the Rev-RRE complex binds a Crm1 dimer utilizing two NES-binding pockets positioned for Rev recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5a">Booth et al., 2014</xref>). This study also shows that the RRE plays an important role in assembly of the export complex by enhancing the affinity of the Rev oligomer for Crm1, probably by using the RNA scaffold to organize the Rev subunits and increase the local concentration of NES peptides for Crm1 binding. Additionally, SAXS studies of the RRE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fang et al., 2013</xref>) and SHAPE-seq analysis of Rev-RRE assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2014</xref>) reveal that the RNA is compact and pre-ordered to bind Rev. Consequently, it may be inferred that changes to the RRE scaffold can affect the overall arrangement of Rev subunits and redistribute the spatial availability of NESs for Crm1 recruitment and nuclear export (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Multiple studies support this hypothesis: (1) Resistance to a dominant negative mutant of Rev with a defective NES arose through two mutations in the RRE that changed the RNA structure but not Rev multimerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Legiewicz et al., 2008</xref>), consistent with an RNA-guided reorganization of Rev oligomers. (2) Conversely, Rev complexes formed with simple repeats of the IIB hairpin displayed high RNA-binding affinity but did not recapitulate full export activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Symensma et al., 1999</xref>), indicating that the specific RRE architecture properly arranges the Rev oligomer for function. (3) A study of cognate Rev-RRE pairs from HIV-infected patients found that mutations in the RRE were responsible for changes in activity as the pairs evolved during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sloan et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that small changes in RRE sequence can alter the architecture of the Rev-RRE complex to tune its functional output. Previous studies likened the RRE to a molecular rheostat, where it is sensitive to the intracellular Rev concentrations and export activity adjusts accordingly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mann et al., 1994</xref>). It appears now that RRE can also perform as a structural/evolutionary rheostat, where changes to RRE structure during the course of infection can rearrange the Rev oligomer and tune the levels of nuclear export. It will be interesting to determine if interactions with other host proteins exploit the Rev-RRE oligomer in other ways.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>We used a Rev 1–70 dimer construct harboring the higher-order oligomerization-disrupting mutations, Leu12Ser and Leu60Arg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Daugherty et al., 2010b</xref>), and a Glu47Ala surface-entropy reducing mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Goldschmidt et al., 2007</xref>) for initial crystallization screens.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), Wesley Sundquist (Reviewing editor), and 2 reviewers, one of whom, Jamie Williamson, agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Jayaraman et al. present a 3.2 A resolution crystal structure of a Rev dimer bound to a fragment of RNA corresponding to the high-affinity binding site (Stem loop IIB) of the Rev-response element (RRE) plus the adjacent IIABC junction. In order to crystallize the complex, the authors used a Rev construct in which two residues were mutated at one of the hydrophobic oligomerization interfaces, promoting formation with only a Rev dimer. While dimerization of Rev occurs using the same hydrophobic interfaces as previously reported, the structure reveals that the Rev dimer binds the RNA with a crossing angle that is much more acute than was previously shown in the dimer in the absence of RNA (50 deg vs. 120-140 deg.). The authors suggest that this degree of freedom (different crossing angles) may be exploited in the formation of higher order complexes. Strong biochemical and molecular virological analyses are presented in support of the structure.</p><p>The crystal structure is the first example of a high resolution structure of a Rev dimer-RNA complex, despite considerable efforts over two decades, and is thus an important advance. Important new contributions include: 1) the discovery that the crossing angle and hydrophobic interface of the Rev dimer can change quite dramatically (∼70 degrees) in response to RNA binding, which allows the two ARM helices to bind in adjacent major grooves of the RNA, and 2) the definition of a new Rev-RNA binding mode (seen for the Rev-RNA Junction site), which may represent the second step in cooperative assembly of Rev with the RRE. The manuscript is clear and well written, and the descriptions of the structure are very lucid. The study is of high technical quality, reveals remarkable molecular flexibility in both the Rev protein configuration and its RNA interactions, and represents an important advance in our understanding of the molecular basis for HIV-1 RNA export. This and the accompanying manuscript describing the EM of a Crm1 dimer bound to Rev-RRE are the most significant advance in this important story for many years.</p><p>Major issues (which must be addressed by the authors):</p><p>This work provides the most advanced structural framework for thinking about how the Rev-RRE export complex is assembled. No additional experiments need to be performed, but the text should be modified to put the observations into better context and to address the specific issues highlighted below.</p><p>1) There are now three different arrangements of the Rev dimer that have been observed, and surely there is interesting, and perhaps confounding, structural plasticity of the Rev dimer interface. This plasticity is portrayed as being a “strategy” of the virus, but the possibility that one or more of the in vitro structures may not reflect functional complexes. The manuscript skirts around this issue, and does not really address how to build the present complex into a functional Rev RRE complex, or how all of the structures may or not be consistent with that functional complex.</p><p>2) The authors should also discuss how well the junction serves as a proxy for the junction in the viral Stem II. In particular, Stem IIA is almost certainly an A-form helix that must merge into the junction, which is only two nucleotides in the crystallized construct. It is possible that the native Stem II RNA has a different conformation, and that the plasticity of the Rev-RRE interface has allowed crystallization of a non-native conformation.</p><p>3) There is no conclusive evidence that a second molecule of Rev binds to stem IIC in the context of the larger RRE, and the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, panels (d) and (e) provide little support since a mutation that is absolutely required for dimerization in the Stem II40 RNA has little to no discernable effects in the context of the larger RNA. While the authors argue that, in the context of a larger RNA, this mutation's effects can be overcome is an interesting idea, there is no actual evidence. A simpler explanation is that the complex uses a different pathway for oligomerization, or even that multiple pathways exist, and if one pathway is blocked then another can be readily utilized. The authors should address this issue more directly or present data showing that the observed complex is truly a part of the oligomerization pathway.</p><p>4) Another issue that needs to be addressed more directly is how the present structure fits into the Rev hexamer structure and the previously described jellyfish model. Is it possible to accommodate the second Rev-Rev interface seen in the Rev-only crystal structure with the Rev dimer conformation seen in the present structure? Is it possible to envision a plausible hexamer structure in the context of RNA with the present dimer interface?</p><p>5) The Wang lab at NIH has proposed a specific conformation of a Rev-RRE complex based on SAXS data. How does the present structure fit into that model?</p><p>6) The final figure is problematic. It is certainly fine to speculate, but while it is formally plausible that the RRE may guide Rev into an array of dimers with multiple crossing angles upon protein-RNA contact, there is as yet no experimental basis for this and the hexamers modeled here are entirely speculative. It is equally plausible, for example, that crossing angles similarly acute to the one reported herein are ubiquitously used for RNP assembly, with larger angles used for interaction with other host-cell proteins (or other variations on the same theme). This figure should be deleted or, alternatively, replaced with a figure that explains the authors’ current general model, particularly in light of the accompanying Crm1 dimer structure.</p><p>Other issues for the authors' consideration:</p><p>1) Title. Change “Rev oligomer” to “Rev dimer”. Throughout the manuscript there should be careful usage of “Rev oligomer”, which, in at least some places here and in the accompanying manuscript, is alluding to (at least) a hexamer, and in other places to a Rev dimer. Say “dimer” when “dimer” is meant. Similarly, we suggest sticking to the term “subunit” when a single polypeptide chain is meant and not alternating with “molecule”. A dimer is also a molecule.</p><p>2) Final sentence of the Abstract: “our studies support an RRE-directed Rev oligomer assembly, where RRE utilizes the inherent plasticity of Rev interfaces and optimally positions Rev subunits to match the architecture of the Crm1 export complex”. Omit. There is nothing here about Crm1 nor about a Rev oligomer larger than a dimer.</p><p>3) The three mutations in the crystallized Rev construct should be indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The position of the oligomerization-inhibiting mutations should be indicated on the structure.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> shows gel shift assays of Rev with RRE-Stem II and IIB40. It is clear the RNA below is a single species. However, the first observed shift shows a doublet band in the IIB40, and a smeared/fuzzy band in stem II. The authors should note this somehow as these are both evidence of conformational heterogeneity within their samples (the first being the presence of two stable conformations and the second a constant switching between two conformations). Further this doublet nature appears to be resolved upon the second Rev binding, indicating a resolving of this phenomenon.</p><p>5) The authors use a 240 nt RRE. They should state that the full RRE is ∼351 nt, and the smaller construct has been shown to be proficient, though not optimal, in nuclear export.</p><p>6) The Rev ARM-RNA IIB RRE interface generally agrees well with the analogous interface presented in the 1996 Battiste et al. NMR structure, but the crystal interface is described as being subtly different in detail. It seems equally likely, however, that the solution structure simply lacked precision, particularly given the state of NMR structural studies at that time. This should probably be acknowledged explicitly (or, if the authors wish to make a point of the differences, they should show that their current structure is incompatible with the earlier NMR data).</p><p>7) Figure 2C–figure supplement 1 is not useful in its current form.

The central finding of the paper, plasticity of Rev dimer interface, explains several intriguing observations in the literature (Discussion section) and connects the RNA architecture, which is a function of a continually evolving RNA sequence, to Crm1-dependent nuclear export activity and HIV replication (elaborated in the Discussion section).

A disruption that matched the position of the stem II junction relative to IIB site had the highest affinity and most efficient Rev oligomerization. Furthermore, although Rev was able to dimerize on an RNA containing any helix disruption positioned next to IIB, the exact sequence of the junction site, as it is in IIB40, displayed the highest affinity and cooperativity, comparable to RRE-stem II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Daugherty et al., 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, the reviewers pointed out a doublet/fuzzy band at the first observed shift in both IIB40 and stem II RNA, while the free RNAs and the Rev-dimer-bound RNAs migrate as single species.</p><p>This conformational heterogeneity in both RNAs in the Rev-monomer-bound species suggests similar binding patterns for both the RNAs. We have modified our manuscript in the first paragraph of the Results section under the title: Rev dimer-RRE structure and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> to reflect these points.</p><p>DMS probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charpentier et al., 1997</xref>) and SHAPE-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2014</xref>) studies on Rev-RRE complexes show melting of an AU base-pair from stem IIA at the junction, with G76 potentially base-pairing with the A from the melted base-pair upon Rev binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartel et al., 1991</xref>). Consistent with these studies, we observe in our structure that G76 indeed base pairs with A44 (corresponding to A from the melted base pair) and not A42 (see the Results section: Diversity of RNA recognition by the Rev ARM).</p><p>As the reviewers point out, stem IIA most likely is an A-form helix that must merge into the junction. We have now included a figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>) and corresponding text in the manuscript (in the Results section) under “Diversity of RNA recognition by the Rev ARM” to address this point. We have placed an A-form helix adjacent to the junction site, where it is likely to merge. Its position approximately determines where the remaining RRE is likely to be. If the second Rev subunit were to use its other hydrophobic interface to recruit a third Rev subunit, the ARM of the third Rev subunit would be positioned to contact the RRE, although it is possible that this interface is also plastic and could be further remodeled by the RRE.</p><p>The evidence that the junction site serves as a proxy for the RRE stem II junction is substantial, but we cannot formally rule out that its configuration differs in the context of stem IIA. Nonetheless, the basic inferences drawn from our structure, i.e. plasticity of the Rev dimer interface and the importance of the site architecture for Rev binding with few base-specific contacts, are unlikely to change.</p><p><italic>3) There is no conclusive evidence that a second molecule of Rev binds to stem IIC in the context of the larger RRE, and the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>, panels (d) and (e) provide little support since a mutation that is absolutely required for dimerization in the Stem II40 RNA has little to no discernable effects in the context of the larger RNA.

Their specific model proposes that stems IIB and IA template Rev assembly on the RRE and bridge the arms of the ‘A’ shaped RRE structure. However, DMS probing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Charpentier et al., 1997</xref>) and SHAPE-seq experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bai et al., 2014</xref>) indicate that Rev assembly nucleates at stem IIB and proceeds via stem II along the length of stem I, implying that Rev-binding at IA occurs after Rev binding to IIB and the stem II junction. Thus, our structure is consistent with the RRE chemical probing studies but does not support the specific model of an initial Rev-dimer assembling at IIB and IA. Our structure supports a more general model where the RRE topology and major groove spacing sets the arrangement of Rev oligomers, which could bridge the two arms of the RRE ‘A’ structure.</p><p><italic>6) The final figure is problematic.
