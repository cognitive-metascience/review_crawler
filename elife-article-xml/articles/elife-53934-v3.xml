However, the reason a specific dimer of HERs generates a stronger proliferative signal than other permutations remains unclear. Here, we used single-molecule immunoprecipitation to develop a biochemical assay for endogenously-formed, entire HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We observed unexpected, large conformational fluctuations in juxta-membrane and kinase domains of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. Nevertheless, the individual HER2-HER3 heterodimers catalyze tyrosine phosphorylation at an unusually high rate, while simultaneously interacting with multiple copies of downstream signaling effectors.

For example, tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) have been developed that target mutated epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFRs, the first member of the HER family) in lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finlay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Remon and Planchard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Stamos et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yun et al., 2007</xref>).

In particular, HER2-HER3 heterodimers reportedly exhibit the highest transforming capability among all possible combinations of HER family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pinkas-Kramarski et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tzahar et al., 1996</xref>). Indeed, elevated levels of HER3 expression correlate with poor prognosis in HER2-positive breast cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Junttila et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee-Hoeflich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vaught et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We anticipate that biochemical assays for the HER family receptors, especially their dimerized forms, will help answer the important question of how a specific combination of HERs can generate stronger proliferative signals than other combinations. If achieved, such a biochemical assay would also serve as a useful screening platform for drugs that inhibit specific types of HER dimer. The traditional route for the construction of such a biochemical assay would be to express and purify individual HERs and then to induce dimerization (or oligomerization) by adding their cognate ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Qiu et al., 2009</xref>). Although many dimeric structures have been reported for truncated parts of the HER family receptors including those of extracellular domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarado et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho and Leahy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Freed et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garrett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogiso et al., 2002</xref>), the reconstituted tyrosine (Tyr) kinase activity is marginally low even when attached to vesicle membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monsey et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), failing to reproduce the strong enzymatic capacity of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers. Reconstitution of full-length HER dimers offers even more experimental challenges, which largely arise from structural instability in their trans- and juxta-membrane domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Endres et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Red Brewer et al., 2009</xref>). Although in vitro dimer assembly has been demonstrated for full-length EGFRs, the enzymatic activity of these in vitro EGFR homodimers decays rapidly with time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mi et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, the development of a biochemistry assay for the HER dimers remains a daunting task.</p><p>Several groups, including our own, have recently reported the development of single-molecule pull-down and co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yeom et al., 2011</xref>). These experimental methods allow for rapid, non-destructive immobilization of specific cellular complexes on the imaging plane of a single-molecule fluorescence microscope. This makes the immunoprecipitated protein complexes amenable to various biochemical interventions, the results of which can be observed in situ with single-molecule fluorescence imaging. We noted that these unique features of the single-molecule pull-down and co-IP techniques may provide another way to construct a biochemical assay for the HER dimers. In addition, as demonstrated in single-molecule genome sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shendure et al., 2005</xref>), single-molecule fluorescence imaging has evolved rapidly toward higher throughput data production. This suggests that a HER dimer biochemical assay, if established via single-molecule pull-down and co-IP, should allow for high-throughput screening of inhibitors for a specific HER dimer pair.</p><p>In this study, we sought to establish a biochemical assay for the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. Instead of assembling this HER2 dimer in vitro, we formed HER2-HER3 dimers on live cell membranes with cognate ligands and then rapidly immunoprecipitated these endogenous HER2 dimers on an imaging surface of our single-molecule fluorescence microscope. Strikingly, when we extracted the immunoprecipitated HER2 complexes with cholesterol-like detergents, we found that the HER2 complexes preserved their Tyr kinase activity. We further found that while the HER2-HER3 heterodimer showed unexpected large conformational fluctuations in its cytoplasmic domains, it catalyzed Tyr phosphorylation with an unusually high catalytic rate. In addition, the HER2-HER3 heterodimer can interact with multiple copies of downstream interactors while carrying out Tyr phosphorylation. Our results provide biochemical underpinnings for how the HER2-HER3 heterodimer generates strong proliferative signaling in the physiological context.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Single-molecule immunoprecipitation of endogenous HER2-HER3 heterodimers</title><p>We first wanted to develop the capability to immunoprecipitate HER2-HER3 heterodimers on our single-molecule fluorescence spectroscope.

In particular, we confirmed that the HER2-eGFP expression level was equivalent to or even larger than the endogenous HER2 expression observed in the SKBR3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). When we examined photobleaching of individual complexes, more than 90% of the eGFP spots showed single photobleaching steps, indicating that despite the HER2 overexpression, mainly a single HER2 protein existed in individual HER2-HER3 hetero-complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>).

To this end, we added ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the reaction chamber to permit ATP hydrolysis by the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>).

These marked increases in the HER2 pTyr levels essentially required the addition of NRG1-β1 before the cell lysis, indicating that most of the pTyr residues were indeed generated within the HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). In addition, at the low surface density used in our experiments, the majority of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers are biochemically isolated from one another. Thus, the pTyr residues in the HER2 tail should be generated by its own kinase domain, suggesting an active <italic>cis</italic>-phosphorylation activity within a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer.</p><p>As we developed our protocol for cell lysis and single-molecule immunoprecipitation, we thus far used a mild cholesterol-like detergent, digitonin. We next asked whether this detergent condition was important for observing the Tyr kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers. To this end, we examined other mild detergents−CHAPSO, octyl-β-Glucoside (OG), n-dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM), Triton X-100 and GDN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chae et al., 2012</xref>). We found that all the detergents we tested could be used for the pull-down of HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In fact, many of these detergents improved the stability of the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers over digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>). However, when we tested the Tyr phosphorylation in the HER2-HER3 heterodimers, only GDN preserved the tyrosine kinase activity at levels comparable to digitonin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2e—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chae et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>We next titrated the digitonin and GDN concentrations and studied their effects on the levels of pTyr 1289 in the HER3 tail. Our results clearly indicated that digitonin and GDN should be maintained at levels above their respective critical micellar concentrations (CMCs) to maintain the Tyr kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). We further noted that restoring 0.1% digitonin (or 0.01% GDN) after depletion of digitonin or GDN to levels below their respective CMCs did not rescue the tyrosine kinase activity of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>, third step). Since both digitonin and GDN have structures similar to cholesterol, these results collectively suggest digitonin and GDN provide a membrane-like environment that is essential for maintaining the Tyr kinase activity of the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers.</p><p>In activating their Tyr kinase activity, the HER family receptors form an asymmetric dimer in their kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Red Brewer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>), which distinguishes HERs from other RTK families in terms of the activation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lemmon et al., 2014</xref>). We asked whether the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers use the asymmetric dimer for their Tyr kinase activity. We adopted the isogenic expression system with HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>), which we used to determine the single-molecule stoichiometry of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We first introduced mutations that impaired the activator function of either HER2 (V956R) or HER3 (V926R). Only the activator mutation introduced to HER3, not HER2, ablated the Tyr kinase activity of the resulting HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2h—source data 1</xref>). On the other hand, when we introduced a receiver mutation to HER2 (I714Q), we observed an impaired dimer kinase activity (there is no corresponding receiver mutation for HER3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2h—source data 1</xref>). These results indicate that the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers rigorously use the asymmetric dimer configuration for reconstituting their Tyr kinase activity. In this configuration, the HER3 kinase predominantly played the role of the activator and the HER2 kinase acted mainly as the receiver.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-molecule kinetic and conformational analysis of the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimer</title><p>Based on our established assay, we sought to study the biochemical mechanisms underlying the strong signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. To this end, we characterized the enzymatic kinetics of single HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We immunoprecipitated endogenous HER2-HER3 heterodimers from SKBR3 cell membranes and measured the increase in pTyr 1289 level (in the HER3 tail) as a function of increasing reaction time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). Because we experimentally confirmed the linearity of our single-molecule immunolabeling for pTyr1289 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>), our determined increase in pTyr1289 could be directly converted to a rate of the corresponding Tyr phosphorylation. By repeating these experiments with increasing concentrations of ATP, we obtained a Michaelis-Menten curve associated with the Tyr 1289 phosphorylation by single HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b and c</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>).

We confirmed immunoprecipitation of ligand-free HER2 complexes from the isogenic expression system with HEK293T cells, where we overexpressed eGFP-labeled HER2 proteins. Single-molecule photobleaching analysis revealed that the majority of the immunoprecipitated ligand-free HER2 complexes included two HER2 proteins, but a non-negligible fraction of complexes involved more than three HER2 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Thus, the stoichiometry is less strictly defined in this ligand-free case (this is why we refer to these immunoprecipitates as ligand-free HER2 complexes, not dimers).</p><p>As done for the HER2-HER3 heterodimer, we added ATP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> to the ligand-free HER2 complexes (immunoprecipitated from the SKBR3 cell membranes) and observed increases in the pTyr residues in the HER2 tails, indicative of the reconstituted Tyr kinase activity.

In our isogenic HEK293T cell expression system, we introduced an 11-residue sequence, YbbR, between juxta-membrane domain A (JM-A) and JM-B in the HER2 and HER3 proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). We examined different locations for insertion of the YbbR sequence and found that insertion after residue 694 (for HER2) and 684 (for HER3) with a flanking linker sequence maintained the Tyr kinase activity of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers (~40% compared with the wild-type (WT) dimers) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). For the EGFR dimers, asymmetric dimer formation has been shown to strictly require an anti-parallel coiled-coil structure for the JM-As (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jura et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Red Brewer et al., 2009</xref>).

We found that a broad <italic>E</italic> distribution for the ligand-free HER2 complexes with about 50% of populations showing <italic>E</italic> values lower than 0.5.

When examining time-resolved traces, we indeed observed transitions between high and low FRET states for a portion of single ligand-free HER2 complexes, while other complexes remained stable in either the high or low FRET state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>).

In addition, we found a fraction of individual HER2-HER3 heterodimers that showed repetitive shuttling between the high and low FRET states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we added HER2-targeting TKI, lapatinib, to our immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers. Lapatinib is known to selectively bind to non-active conformation of the HER kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wood et al., 2004</xref>). Indeed, we found that addition of lapatinib before ATP hydrolysis buffer significantly increased the low FRET populations (<italic>E</italic> &lt; 0.5) for both HER2-HER3 heterodimers and ligand-free HER2 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c and e</xref>, red versus black distributions). We note the possibility that different FRET populations, especially, those with low <italic>E</italic> values, reflect some degraded HER2 dimers or complexes. In addition, it is possible that solubilization of the HER2 dimers in micelles renders the low FRET populations (with JM-As dissociated) overestimated compared with the physiological populations in the cellular membranes. However, the FRET changes in response to the lapatinib incubation per se report detailed conformational changes in the single HER2 dimers. They also suggest that binding of lapatinib to the non-active conformation of the HER2 kinase domains leads to total dissociation of the asymmetric dimer of kinase domains. Altogether, our data suggest that the cytoplasmic domains of single HER2-HER3 heterodimers show significant conformational dynamics at an almost equal level to those of the ligand-free HER2 complexes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Single HER2-HER3 heterodimers interact with multiple copies of downstream interactors</title><p>We next asked whether this increase in pTyr led to an actual increase in interactions with downstream interactors.

There are seven known binding sites for PI3K per HER2-HER3 dimer (five on HER3 and two on HER2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hause et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones et al., 2006</xref>). Despite the larger size of p85α (i.e., 85 kDa versus 23 kDa of PLCγ<sub>SH2</sub>), we found multiple p85αs interacting with each HER2-HER3 heterodimer after reconstituted Tyr phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c and e</xref>). Antibody blocking experiments with pTyr-specific antibodies showed that different pTyr residues in the HER3 tail had differentiated contributions to the observed PPIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>). We also induced assembly of the full PI3K complex through co-expression of mCherry-labeled p85α and the eGFP-labeled catalytic p110 subunit (α isoform) in the same group of HEK293T cells. We found multiple copies of these full PI3Ks interact with single HER2-HER3 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that individual HER2-HER3 heterodimers can physically interact with multiple copies of downstream interactors simultaneously.</p><p>We noted that the single-molecule resolution of our co-IP imaging might provide a chance to answer the long-standing question of whether there is any specific order in the effector binding to the HER oligomers. To develop an insight into this question, we introduced the tyrosine-to-phenylalanine (Y-to-F) mutation to six different Tyr residues in the HER3 tail using our isogenic expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>). We reasoned that if there were any patterns dictating the orders of effector binding, we would observe marked drops in the effector binding in a certain set of mutants. This is because with no phosphorylation in the specific Tyr residue, any further bindings occurring in a predefined order (i.e., the pattern in the effector binding) would be prevented.</p><p>We collected time-resolved traces of p85α binding for the six mutants (total ~25,000 traces), and identified the number of p85α binding for individual traces as we did in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>. When examining the distributions of the p85α binding counts, we failed to observe any such marked changes in the p85α binding counts across the six Y-to-F mutants we studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h–m</xref>). All the mutants showed only slight decreases in the p85α binding counts, with virtually every peak being moved to exactly one less binding. These data suggest that the effector bindings in our in vitro setting largely occur in a stochastic manner without a specific pattern in their binding order.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Single HER2-HER3 heterodimers simultaneously carry out Tyr phosphorylation and downstream PPIs</title><p>So far, we examined reconstitution of the Tyr kinase activity and the PPIs with downstream interactors for single HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We next asked whether a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer can carry out these two functions simultaneously.

In addition, the C-terminal tails allegedly wrap around the asymmetric dimer of the kinase domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kovacs et al., 2015</xref>). There is thus an ample possibility that the conformations required for Tyr phosphorylation are incommensurate with PPIs with downstream interactors.

In contrast, we observed continuous binding events with a long tail that extended to tens of seconds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>), strongly suggesting that each HER2-HER3 heterodimer generates new pTyr residues while still interacting with more than one eGFP-p85α prey protein. Finally, we examined PPIs of the ligand-free HER2 complexes under the same concentrations of ATP, Mg<sup>2+</sup> and PTPN1. We found that unlike the case of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers, the fluorescence intensity distribution substantially shrank down upon addition of PTPN1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>, blue versus red distributions).

Remarkably, the presence of PTPN1 markedly altered the lapatinib inhibition curve, shifting the curve to lower lapatinib concentrations by almost two orders of magnitude at the highest PTPN1 concentration we used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>). Our observation suggests that the effective catalytic rate reduced by PTPN1 makes the HER2-HER3 heterodimers more vulnerable to lapatinib inhibition.

Instead of attempting in vitro assembly, we formed the HER2-HER3 heterodimers on live cell membranes by adding cognate ligands. After cell lysis, we induced rapid immunoprecipitation of these endogenously-formed heterodimers to the imaging surface of a single-molecule fluorescence microscope. After removing the cell extract via microfluidic buffer exchange, we examined the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers using various biochemical tools at single-molecule resolution. These biochemical data provided unprecedented details as to how HER2 generates strong proliferative signals, in particular, when complexed with HER3. We expect that provided with high-affinity antibodies for pulling down other target membrane receptors, the methods we describe here will be generally applicable beyond the HER family receptors to other important signaling receptors, including those used by the human immune systems.</p><p>Notably, we confirmed that the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers maintained their Tyr kinase activity. We found that the detergent used for cell lysis and immunoprecipitation is critical for the successful reconstitution of Tyr phosphorylation. Of the various detergents we tested, only digitonin, GDN, and GDN derivatives are able to preserve the Tyr kinase activity of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers. We further found that the different types of detergents can be exchanged but the concentration of each detergent has to remain above its respective CMC. Even a brief absence of detergent in the reaction buffer markedly impairs the Tyr kinase activity, suggesting irreversible structural changes are induced in the trans- and juxta-membrane domains during detergent depletion. GDN and digitonin have multiple glycosides and disogenin as the hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups, respectively. Comparison of this chemical structure with those of OG, DDM and CHAPSO, which failed in our function reconstitution of Tyr phosphorylation, suggests that the disogenin group plays an important role in reconstitution of the tyrosine kinase activity of the HER2 complexes. Presumably, the cholesterol-like structure of disogenin interacts with the membrane-associated domains of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers to critically modulate the tyrosine kinase activity.</p><p>In our reconstitution of Tyr kinase activity, we found that the kinase domains of HER2-HER3 heterodimers rigorously adopt the asymmetric dimer conformation. We further found that the HER3 kinase domain functions as the activator in the asymmetric dimer while the HER2 domain primarily functions as the receiver, consistent with the current prevailing view on the HER2-HER3 heterodimers. Because of these fixed roles, we initially presumed that the two kinase domains could be largely locked in the asymmetric dimer configuration with limited conformational fluctuations. Individual ligand-free HER2 complexes, on the contrary, have more than one HER2 kinase domains that likely play alternating roles as activator and receiver. We anticipated that the ligand-free HER2 complexes would experience substantial conformational fluctuations between active asymmetric dimer and ‘non-dimer’ conformations, in the latter of which the juxta-membrane and kinase domains are dissociated from one another.</p><p>Our single-molecule FRET measurements probing the JM-A domains indeed revealed that a substantial population (~50%) of the ligand-free HER2 complexes sample the non-dimer conformations, as reflected by the observed low FRET <italic>E</italic> values. Unexpectedly, a similar fraction (~35%) of the single HER2-HER3 heterodimers showed the same low <italic>E</italic> values, suggesting that their HER2 and HER3 kinase domains could be in largely dissociated states despite the fixed roles. In addition, when we measured the Michaelis-Menten curves, the single HER2-HER3 heterodimers and the ligand-free HER2 complexes exhibit highly similar <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values (29.2 and 16.5 μM). This result can be interpreted as the HER2-HER3 heterodimer and the ligand-free HER2 complexes spending similar fractions of time in the ATP-bound state at given ATP concentrations. Our observations collectively suggest that the kinase domains of HER2-HER3 heterodimers are highly dynamic, rather than being locked down, sampling the active dimer and the non-dimer conformations at a rate comparable to the ligand-free HER2 complexes.</p><p>How does the HER2-HER3 heterodimer then generate such persistent signaling despite the unexpected large conformational fluctuations in its cytoplasmic domains? The strong signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer can be explained by its unique repertories of downstream effectors and kinase substrates. Indeed, a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer carries seven binding sites for PI3K and we observed simultaneous binding up to five copies of p85α to a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer. However, when we examined only the generation of a single type of pTyr residue, the HER2-HER3 heterodimer and the ligand-free HER2 complexes still behaved so differently, suggesting the possibility that they are distinct from one another even at the biochemistry level. Our Michaelis-Menten analysis revealed that it is the catalytic rate (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat,max</sub>) that exhibits the largest contrast between the HER2-HER3 heterodimer and the ligand-free HER2 complexes. This led us to hypothesize that despite substantial conformational fluctuations, the HER2 and HER3 kinase domains exhibit a remarkably high enzymatic potency once they form the active dimer conformation together. This high catalytic rate likely enables the HER2-HER3 heterodimer to outcompete the phosphate activity and the inhibitor binding, thereby continuously generating new pTyr residues. Indeed, in the presence of excessive Tyr phosphatases that reduce the effective catalytic rate, the HER2-HER3 heterodimer becomes susceptible to lapatinib inhibition, accompanied by a plunge in IC<sub>50</sub> by two orders of magnitude.</p><p>At the same time, we observed that the single HER2-HER3 heterodimers can physically interact with multiple copies of downstream interactors. In our time-resolved single-molecule fluorescence imaging, we found that binding of multiple interactors persists even under harsh dephosphorylating conditions designed to mimic the environments of cellular cytoplasm. Our observation suggests that while satisfying the conformational requirements for the Tyr kinase activity, the cytoplasmic domains of HER2-HER3 heterodimers exploit the remaining conformational flexibility to make multiple PPIs with downstream effectors. Owing to this ability to multitask, the newly generated pTyr residues can directly lead to recruitment of additional downstream signaling proteins with no serious latency. Therefore, our observations provide a telltale hint that the unusually high catalytic rate and the ability to multitask could be the key biochemical contributors to the persistent signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers observed in the physiological milieu.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for key resources used.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell lines</title><p>Our HEK293T cell line was donated from Prof. Heo's lab.

We then additionally diluted each reaction mixture by 15x, added them to the chamber, incubated them for 15 min, and then washed them with ATP and MgCl<sub>2</sub>-containing imaging buffer. We used a final buffer containing 200 μM ATP and 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 0.1% (w/v) digitonin (in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl) to sustain kinetic activity. The imaging buffer we used for reducing the blinking and bleaching of dyes (especially CoA-Cy5) contained 1.5 mM Trolox, 2.5 mM PCA, and one unit/ml PCD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-molecule fluorescence traces for FRET calculation</title><p>We measured Cy3 and Cy5 fluorescence with a prism-type TIRF microscope that has a temporal resolution of 0.1 s/frame. The first few (~15) frames were excited with a 640 nm laser to check for the presence of Cy5 dyes. Then, the later frames were excited with a 532 nm laser for observations. The following scenarios were excluded: a) no Cy3 or Cy5 signal at either excitation, b) insufficient sum intensity (Cy3+Cy5) at the 532 nm excitation, c) Cy3:Cy5 stoichiometry obviously smaller or larger than 1:1. After this exclusion process, we manually checked and corrected the local backgrounds of each pair of FRET molecules. Also, we manually removed any blinking.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>FRET efficiency quantification</title><p>To ignore HER2 dimers that already lost their kinase activity, we had to exclude the traces which steadily showed low apparent FRET efficiency near 0.12 (the Cy3 leakage factor, beta). Considering that our traces show relatively noisy data, we eliminated the traces which never show the apparent FRET efficiency over 0.4. Using the intensity of the Cy3 donor(I(d)) and the Cy5 acceptor(I(a)) of the selected traces, we calculated the apparent FRET efficiency for the <italic>E</italic> histogram as follows: I(a)/ [I(d)+I(a)]. We calculated the corrected FRET efficiencies for the representative traces assuming Cy3 signal leakage (beta, around 0.12) as follows: [I(a)-beta*I(d)]/ [I(d)+I(a)]. Single-molecule traces were collected then donor-bleached frames were excluded. FRET efficiency value at each frame was calculated and collected for FRET efficiency distribution. Distribution was normalized by total population (total number of frame collected).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>HMM algorithm to find the number of probes and characterize binding kinetics</title><p>From images generated by selectively integrating pixels only where and when eGFP signals appeared, we selected ROIs (regions of interest) of 3 × 3 pixels each around local maximum pixels. We then recorded fluorescence traces from single ROIs and then removed the background by subtracting smoothed images (with 6 × 6 pixel kernels) from each frame. After scaling these traces from 0 to 1 (dividing by 800 (A.U), which is 10 times larger value then each single eGFP intensity value), we measured the BIC (Bayesian information criterion) values for various step numbers. Our method for calculating BIC values and the program we used to analyze the data were developed in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee, 2009</xref>). The program we used determines the BIC value along with a transition matrix and the position of each state using traces and a given number of states. We used the Origin program to fit the BIC values with piecewise linear functions for the purpose of determining the most likely number of states. BIC values were measured using representative traces from brightest spots (n ≥ 10) to find the maximum number of probes binding HER2 complex. After maximum number and position of state were measured, we applied the position of state as constant to find the number of states for the rest of inhomogeneous traces, assuming each Gaussian distribution only depend on number of probes binding. Because of the heterogeneity of each molecule, transition matrixes and standard deviations of each state were not fixed. We used the program described above to find the most likely state by fitting the piecewise step functions. We then used the fitted step functions to analyze the number of binding probes in each ROI and characterize their kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation.

By using fluorescent-based microscopic techniques, the authors characterized the stoichiometry, enzymatic activity, conformational dynamics and the downstream adaptor-binding capability of the heterodimer. As HER2-HER3 heterodimers play important roles in cancer development and metastasis, the method developed by the authors could potentially provide a different perspective for understanding the biology of ErbB receptors. While recognizing the potential of this study, the reviewers raised several important issues that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not immediately clear why the HER2/HER3 heterodimers captured on TIRF coverslips using anti-HER3 antibodies, which are presumably bivalent, were predominantly single HER2/HER3 heterodimers. Wouldn't each antibody on the cover slip be expected to capture at least two HER2s or HER3s? Unlikely HER2 or HER3 binding to one of the Fab arms would preclude binding to the other? This issue is important because it raises a question about the reliability of the monomer/dimer/oligomer assignments. Couldn't the fact that the &quot;majority&quot; of IP'ed HER2 included two HER2 molecules simply arise from the bivalence of the capturing antibody?</p><p>2) It needs to be clarified whether the eGFP used in the experiments was the wild type, dimeric form or the mutated, monomeric form. If it were the wild type eGFP, the raw data of photobleaching experiments and validation of their claims on single step photobleaching should be included.</p><p>3) A potentially interesting and important result reported but not discussed by the authors is the observation of phosphorylation in the HER2 tail in what are reported as HER2/HER3 heterodimers. It has long been a question how the HER2 tail gets phosphorylated within a HER2/HER3 heterodimer in which phosphorylation is believed only to occur in trans (HER3 is a pseudokinase with negligible kinase activity). It has been suggested that HER2/HER3 pairs must form higher-order oligomers for the HER2 tail to be phosphorylated, and Landgraf and colleagues selected a HER3-aptamer that blocks HER2 but not HER3 phosphorylation and is thought to act by blocking formation of a putative higher-order oligomer. If the authors have indeed shown that the HER2 C-tail can be phosphorylated within an isolated HER2/HER3 heterodimer, I think that is an important result. However, if the number of HER2/HER3 heterodimers is not correctly determined (see point 1) this conclusion is obviously not justified.</p><p>4) The authors state that their measured kinetic parameters are much greater than previous parameters measured for EGFR. However, I think they are in line with previous measurements. The authors report apparent <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub>'s for ATP of the HER2 kinase in HER2/HER3 heterodimers as 16-30 μM and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>'s in the 0.1-0.2/second range using the rate of appearance of fluorescence from antibodies recognizing pY in the C-tail. The authors observe a ~150-fold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> when ligand is present. These values are very similar to those observed by Qiu et al. for EGFR (47 μM <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> and 0.4/second <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>) using purified EGFR and a peptide substrate and who observed a ~500-fold increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> when ligand is present. The authors estimate a ~12 fold higher catalytic rate (boosting their 0.22/second <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> to 2.6/second) based on the presence of 12 tyrosines in the HER2/HER3 C-tails, but this assumption (i) seems flawed owing to potentially different <italic>k</italic>cat’s for different tyrosines, and (ii) renders the resulting <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> not comparable to <italic>k</italic>cat’s determined with a single-tyrosine containing peptide. I find the author's ability to measure what appear to be reasonable kinetic parameters with this indirect method to be impressive and remarkable, but don't find the results to justify a conclusion of catalytic rates an order of magnitude higher than previously reported.</p><p>5) In the enzymatic assay (Figure 3), an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and a Cy3-labelled secondary antibody were used for detecting the phosphorylation levels and the enzymatic kinetics of the heterodimer. Such quantification requires that the fluorescent intensity of bound Cy3 is linearly proportional to the tyrosine phosphorylation level. However, such an experimental calibration curve was missing in the manuscript.</p><p>6) The novelty of this report is the method and demonstration that it can be used to measure key biochemical and biophysical parameters of a key signaling and oncogenic ErbB oligomer. The authors tout the &quot;unusually high [catalytic] rate&quot; as underlying the stronger proliferative signal that has been observed for HER2/HER3 heterodimers, but this rationale is something of a straw man as the different signaling nature/strength of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer may just as easily explained by the different downstream effectors and kinase substrates of the HER2/HER3 pair. This needs to be addressed either by showing that the high catalytic rate is essential for the signaling potency of the HER2/HER3 pairing, or by correction of the related statements.</p><p>7) In the experiments, the authors found that HER2-HER3 heterodimer and ligand-free HER2 complex had similar <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> values but different <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values. Their interpretation was that these two complexes spend &quot;similar fractions of time in the enzymatically competitive state at given ATP concentrations&quot;. But from the point of view of enzymatic kinetics, such results indicated that both complexes have similar ATP binding affinity or spend similar fractions of time in ATP-bound state at given ATP concentrations. ATP-bound state may or may not be equivalent to the enzymatically competitive state, which is also hard to be defined in single-molecule experiments.</p><p>8) To study the conformational dynamics of the heterodimer, the authors introduced an 11-residue-long tag into the JM region of the receptors and labelled the receptors with Cy3/Cy5. However, the authors didn't show that the labelled heterodimers had similar activity as the wild type heterodimers. In addition, as the receptors extracted/purified in detergent were not stable, it was not clear whether the conformational dynamics observed in the experiments reflects the equilibrium among different association states or the stability of the complexes. A comparison of FRET efficiencies at different time points after IP may give a better indication.</p><p>9) Is the dynamic nature of the HER2-HER3 dimers inherent in vivo or an artifact of the absence of membrane in the in vitro systems? It is possible and perhaps even likely that cell membrane may stabilize the juxta-membrane dimer and consequently the kinase dimer.</p><p>10) The finding that multiple effectors can bind with one HER2/HER3 dimer is important. Is the effector binding at different pTyr sites entirely stochastic or there is a pattern dictating the effector binding? Is one tyrosine phosphorylation particularly critical? This seems a good opportunity to answer such questions using mutagenesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53934.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It is not immediately clear why the HER2/HER3 heterodimers captured on TIRF coverslips using anti-HER3 antibodies, which are presumably bivalent, were predominantly single HER2/HER3 heterodimers.

Given that the known dissociation constant for dimerization of the WT eGFPs is 110 μM, which is five orders of magnitude larger than the concentration we used for surface IP, we estimate that the probability of seeing any dimerizing behavior of WT eGFPs is extremely low in our photobleaching analysis.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Immunoprecipitation of HER2 (at 1 nM), HER3 (at 1 nM), and eGFP (at 10 pM) using each HER2, HER3, and GFP antibodies.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53934-resp-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A potentially interesting and important result reported but not discussed by the authors is the observation of phosphorylation in the HER2 tail in what are reported as HER2/HER3 heterodimers.

As we have detailed in our response to Comment 1, the probability for capturing two HER2-HER3 heterodimers with a single antibody is extremely low. In fact, even the co-localization of two HER2-HER3 heterodimers within a diffraction-limited spot (within ~500 nm) is quite unlikely to occur at the low surface density we used. Thus, the majority of the HER2-HER3 heterodimers used in our surface-IP experiments should be biochemically isolated from one another.</p><p>We have experimentally re-confirmed the active phosphorylation of the HER2 tail within these isolated HER2-HER3 heterodimers, which is now added as the main figure panels of Figure 2C and 2D in the revised manuscript. In particular, we found that our observed increases in the HER2 pTyr levels essentially requires the NRG1-β1 addition before the cell lysis, indicating that most of the pTyr residues have indeed been generated within the HER2-HER3 heterodimers.</p><p>Our observations support the hypothesis that a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer can phosphorylate its HER2 tail with a potency almost equal to that for the HER3 tail. This suggests an active <italic>cis</italic>-phosphorylation activity by the HER2 kinase in the HER2-HER3 heterodimer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state that their measured kinetic parameters are much greater than previous parameters measured for EGFR.

We provide evidence that the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> for phosphorylation of other Tyr residues is in a similar order to that of pY1289 (e.g., the data points for pY1197, pY1222, pY1276 and pY1328 in Figure 3C and the corresponding data points in Figure 3D). However, we note that these observations do not directly lead to the conclusion that all these pTyr residues are generated to the same extents in each HER2-HER3 heterodimer. It is possible that only a subset of the Tyr residues is generated in a given HER2-HER3 heterodimer while the collection of these HER2-HER3 heterodimers shows the similar degrees of phosphorylation for different Tyr residues as a whole group.</p><p>Perceiving the potential pitfall in our analysis, we have removed the relevant analysis and the sentence in Discussion. In the revised manuscript, we have instead added a new set of data showing the high <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> would be pivotal to the persistent signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer as well as to its resistance against lapatinib (see our response to Comment 6 for details).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the enzymatic assay (Figure 3), an anti-phosphotyrosine antibody and a Cy3-labelled secondary antibody were used for detecting the phosphorylation levels and the enzymatic kinetics of the heterodimer.

However, such an experimental calibration curve was missing in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer comment, we examined the linearity in our single-molecule immunolabeling with pTyr-specific antibodies. To increase the amount of surface pTyr residues in a linear fashion, we increased the total protein concentration of the SKBR3 cell lysate used for the surface IP. Under our sparse pull-down condition, the amount of the immunoprecipitated HER2 dimers or complexes linearly increased (as we show in Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, G).</p><p>We then carried out our immunolabeling for pTyr1289 (in the HER3 tail) and pTyr1196 (in the HER2 tail), respectively. We found that both immunolabeling counts indeed increased linearly with the total protein concentration. These data show the linearity of our assay, which in turn validate our determination of <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>M</sub> in Figures 3C and 3D. These new data sets are included as Figures 3—figure supplement 1A,B in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The novelty of this report is the method and demonstration that it can be used to measure key biochemical and biophysical parameters of a key signaling and oncogenic ErbB oligomer. The authors tout the &quot;unusually high [catalytic] rate&quot; as underlying the stronger proliferative signal that has been observed for HER2/HER3 heterodimers, but this rationale is something of a straw man as the different signaling nature/strength of the HER2/HER3 heterodimer may just as easily explained by the different downstream effectors and kinase substrates of the HER2/HER3 pair. This needs to be addressed either by showing that the high catalytic rate is essential for the signaling potency of the HER2/HER3 pairing, or by correction of the related statements.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that the strong proliferative signal of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer can be explained by its different repertories of downstream effectors and kinase substrates. Indeed, a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer carries seven binding sites for PI3K and we observed simultaneous binding up to five copies of p85α to a single HER2-HER3 heterodimer (e.g., Figure 5E). We have edited the Discussion section to explicitly state this fact in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Yet, when we examined only the generation of a single type of pTyr residue, the HER2-HER3 heterodimer and the ligand-free HER2 complexes still behaved so differently with the former being much more resilient than the latter in the Tyr kinase activity. This suggests that they are distinct from one another even at the biochemistry level (for example, Figure 3C versus 3D). To better understand this persistent biochemical behavior, we designed a new set of experiments in which we added HER2-targeting TKI, lapatinib, to inhibit the reconstituted Tyr kinase activity. We measured the degree of inhibition as a gauge of the signaling potency of the HER2 oligomers (i.e., the stronger the signaling activity is, the lower the inhibition would be at a given lapatinib concentration). We determined the lapatinib inhibition curves for the HER2-HER3 heterodimer and the ligand-free HER2 complexes, respectively and found that the IC<sub>50</sub> values are 10 times higher for the HER2-HER3 heterodimer, likely reflecting its known strong resistance against the lapatinib inhibition (Figures 7B and 7C; red curves).</p><p>To examine the role of the high catalytic rate in the observed persistent biochemical behaviors, we added increasing concentrations of PTPN1 and re-examined the lapatinib inhibition curves. Remarkably, we found that the presence of PTPN1 markedly shifts the lapatinib inhibition curve of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer to a lower concentration range, up to two orders of magnitude at the highest PTPN1 concentration we studied (2.5 μg/ml). We reasoned that these PTPN1s in excess rapidly remove the generated pTyr residues and are thus expected to reduce the net effective catalytic rate, but without affecting the conformational changes of the HER2 oligomers (for example, those observed in Figure 4). Our results then suggest that as the catalytic rate wanes down, the HER2-HER3 heterodimer becomes more vulnerable to the lapatinib inhibition.</p><p>Our new observations seem to corroborate our hypothesis that the high catalytic rate makes a substantial contribution to the strong signaling potency of the HER2-HER3 heterodimer. Indeed, the ligand-free HER2 complexes that have a much lower catalytic rate instantly loses their signaling potency upon small addition of PTPN1 (Figure 7C). We have included these new observations in the revised manuscript as the main Figure 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In the experiments, the authors found that HER2-HER3 heterodimer and ligand-free HER2 complex had similar K<sub>M</sub> values but different k<sub>cat</sub> values. Their interpretation was that these two complexes spend &quot;similar fractions of time in the enzymatically competitive state at given ATP concentrations&quot;. But from the point of view of enzymatic kinetics, such results indicated that both complexes have similar ATP binding affinity or spend similar fractions of time in ATP-bound state at given ATP concentrations. ATP-bound state may or may not be equivalent to the enzymatically competitive state, which is also hard to be defined in single-molecule experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We edited the corresponding words as follows:</p><p>“This result can be interpreted as the HER2-HER3 heterodimer and the ligand-free HER2 complexes spending similar fractions of time in the ATP-bound state at given ATP concentrations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) To study the conformational dynamics of the heterodimer, the authors introduced an 11-residue-long tag into the JM region of the receptors and labelled the receptors with Cy3/Cy5. However, the authors didn't show that the labelled heterodimers had similar activity as the wild type heterodimers. In addition, as the receptors extracted/purified in detergent were not stable, it was not clear whether the conformational dynamics observed in the experiments reflects the equilibrium among different association states or the stability of the complexes. A comparison of FRET efficiencies at different time points after IP may give a better indication.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer comment, we determined the catalytic rates of the YbbR sequence-inserted HER2 oligomers and compared the values with those of the WT ones. We found that the YbbR-inserted oligomers maintained about 40% of the enzymatic activity for both HER2-HER3 heterodimer and ligand-free HER2 complexes (included as new Figure 4B in the revised manuscript). The large contrast between these two types of the HER2 oligomers was also maintained after the YbbR insertion. We examined a myriad of positions in the HER2 and HER3 kinase domains for the YbbR insertion. In fact, we found that only the positions reported in this work maintained the Tyr kinase activity to a reasonable extent. Although the YbbR-inserted HER2 oligomers may not be perfectly matching with the WT oligomers in terms of the enzymatic activity, the data presented in this work could provide unique insights into the conformational changes occurring in the cytoplasmic domains of HER2 and HER3.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s concern that the different FRET populations (in particular, low FRET populations) simply reflect some degraded HER2 oligomers, rather than different microstate sampling in the equilibrium. It is noteworthy that the incubation of the HER2 oligomers with lapatinib selectively enhanced the low FRET populations (Figure 4C and 4E). The observed FRET changes upon a biochemical treatment per se reflect conformational changes occurring within the HER2 oligomers.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we stated the possibility that some of the low FRET populations represent degraded species as well as toned down our relevant statement.</p><p>“We note the possibility that different FRET populations, especially, those with low <italic>E</italic> values, reflect some degraded HER2 dimers or complexes. In addition, it is possible that solubilization of the HER2 dimers in micelles renders the low FRET populations (with JM-As dissociated) overestimated compared with the physiological populations in the cellular membranes. However, the FRET changes in response to the lapatinib incubation per se report detailed conformational changes in the single HER2 dimers. They also suggest that binding of lapatinib to the non-active conformation of the HER2 kinase domains leads to total dissociation of the asymmetric dimer of kinase domains.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Is the dynamic nature of the HER2-HER3 dimers inherent in vivo or an artifact of the absence of membrane in the in vitro systems? It is possible and perhaps even likely that cell membrane may stabilize the juxta-membrane dimer and consequently the kinase dimer.</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed in our response to Comment 8, we cannot rule out the possibility that some low FRET populations reflect degraded HER2 oligomers. At the same time, as the reviewer points out, the observed broad FRET distributions, with many of the HER2 oligomers being in the JM-A dissociated state, may be an artifact of our in vitro pull-down experiments.</p><p>As we report in Figure 2, the detergent concentrations should always be kept above their respective CMCs to preserve the Tyr kinase activity of the single HER2-HER3 heterodimers. Even brief depletion of detergents largely abolishes the Tyr kinase activity. These observations indicate that the immunoprecipitated HER2-HER3 heterodimers are solubilized in detergent micelles, rather than exposed to the aqueous environment.</p><p>Yet, the membrane proteins experience much higher lateral pressure in the lipid bilayers than they do in micelles. There is a possibility that the low FRET populations are overestimated in our in vitro experiment when compared with the physiological populations found in the cellular membranes. In the revised manuscript, we also included this point in our discussion of the FRET data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The finding that multiple effectors can bind with one HER2/HER3 dimer is important. Is the effector binding at different pTyr sites entirely stochastic or there is a pattern dictating the effector binding? Is one tyrosine phosphorylation particularly critical? This seems a good opportunity to answer such questions using mutagenesis.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very interesting question. Inspired by the reviewer comment, we have introduced the Y-to-F mutation to six different Tyr residues in the HER3 tail using our isogenic expression system.</p><p>We reasoned that if there were any patterns dictating the orders of effector binding, we would see marked drops in the binding counts in certain mutants. This is because with no pTyr generated in the specific Tyr residue, we could prevent any further bindings occurring in a predefined order (i.e., the pattern in the effector binding).</p><p>We collected a huge set of time-resolved traces for the six mutants (total ~25,000 traces), and carried out analysis of identifying the number of p85α binding for individual traces. Unfortunately, we failed to observe any such marked changes in the p85α binding counts across the six different Y-to-F mutants we examined. All the mutants showed only slight decreases in the p85α binding counts. In fact, we found that virtually, every peak in the count distribution made one step to the left, thus a binding count decreased by exactly one on average. These data, now included as the main Figure 5H-M, seem to indicate that the effector binding largely occurs in a stochastic manner with no specific pattern dictating the order of effector binding, at least, in our in vitro setting.</p></body></sub-article></article>
