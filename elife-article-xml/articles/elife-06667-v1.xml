Because of their role in regulating food intake, these nerves are attractive targets for scientists hoping to develop treatments for obesity.</p><p>There are two types of fat tissue found in mammals: white fat, which is used as an energy store and makes up most of the extra fat seen in obese individuals; and brown fat, which can generate body heat. The vagus nerves monitor fat and cholesterol levels in the body via receptor proteins that respond to messages sent from the fat tissues and the liver. Previous research unexpectedly found that mice genetically engineered to lack these receptor proteins—called LXRα and LXRβ—do not become obese even when fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet that would make normal mice gain excessive weight.</p><p>Mansuy-Aubert et al. have now investigated in more detail why mice without these receptor proteins are resistant to obesity. When fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet, mice that lacked the LXRα and LXRβ receptors in sensory neurons had higher cholesterol levels in their nerve cells than normal mice on the same diet. Mice lacking these receptors also burned more energy and gained less weight than normal mice.</p><p>Next, Mansuy-Aubert et al. examined fat tissue from both types of mice. This revealed that the heat-generating brown fat was more active in mice lacking the LXRα and LXRβ receptors. Some of the white fat in these mice had also become more like brown fat, allowing the mice to burn more energy and so gain less weight.</p><p>In many Western countries, many people also eat a diet that is high in fat and cholesterol. This raises the possibility that drugs that block the LXRα and LXRβ receptors in sensory neurons in humans could help to treat or prevent obesity, although further work will be needed to investigate this.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06667.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06667.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>nuclear receptor</kwd><kwd>sensory neuron</kwd><kwd>energy expenditure</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK088423</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elmquist</surname><given-names>Joel K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37DK053301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elmquist</surname><given-names>Joel K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK55758</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>Philipp E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19DK062434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangelsdorf</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mangelsdorf</surname><given-names>David J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DK099110</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scherer</surname><given-names>Philipp E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In sensory neurons, the receptors LXRα and LXRβ sense dietary-derived molecules to regulate whole body energy expenditure, and present a possible target for new anti-obesity agents.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Vagal afferent neurons innervate the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, pancreas, liver, and portal vein and link peripheral levels of GI nutrients as well as circulating and stored fuels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berthoud, 2008</xref>).

Recently, we identified an enrichment of ‘lipid sensing’ nuclear receptors (NRs), including liver X receptor alpha and beta (LXRα/β) in the nodose ganglia (NG) of the vagus nerve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, these neurons and their processes reside outside the blood–brain barrier, enabling the potential for direct sensing of molecules released by adipose tissue or liver. LXRs are oxysterol-sensitive NRs that direct cholesterol uptake, transport, and excretion in various tissues. LXRα and LXRβ are encoded by the <italic>Nr1h3</italic> and <italic>Nr1h2</italic> genes, respectively (NR subfamily 1, group H, member 3 and 2). LXRs regulate target genes encoding for ATP-binding cassette proteins, and apolipoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21a">Repa et al., 2000a;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Venkateswaran et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chawla et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hong et al., 2012</xref>). Ligand activation of LXRs also stimulates de novo lipogenesis of triglycerides in liver via sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21b">Repa et al., 2000b;</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>).

In the central nervous system, they regulate local inflammation, differentiation, and neuron survival by orchestrating cholesterol uptake and efflux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Wang et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Further studies in LXR null mice revealed the rather surprising finding that these mice were resistant to obesity when challenged with a diet containing both high fat and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalaany et al., 2005</xref>). This study showed that the LXR<sup>−/−</sup> response was due to abnormal energy dissipation resulting in part from ectopic expression of uncoupling proteins in white adipose. Here, we show that Western diet (WD)-fed mice that lack LXRα/β in sensory neurons of the NG have altered neuronal cholesterol content and increased white adipose tissue browning, leading to changes in energy expenditure and body weight. This unexpected function of LXRs in vagal sensory neurons provides a plausible mechanism that may in part explain the role LXRs on metabolism in response to a diet containing fat and cholesterol.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The absence of LXRs in NAV1.8 expressing neurons disrupts <italic>Abca1</italic> regulation and increases NG neuronal cholesterol content</title><p>We first assessed the effects on LXR-target gene expression following pharmacological administration of LXR agonists.

To confirm these findings, we established NG organotypic cultures from mice lacking LXRα and LXRβ in vagal sensory neurons expressing the sodium ion channel NAV1.8 encoded by the <italic>Scn10a</italic> gene. The resulting LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice were generated by breeding double floxed <italic>Nr1h3</italic> and <italic>Nr1h2</italic> mice (LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice) with the Nav1.8::Cre mice, which selectively expresses Cre-recombinase in peripheral sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Stirling et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gautron et al., 2011</xref>). As expected, LXRα/β were deleted in the majority of NG neurons in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice compared to LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). No difference in LXRs expression was observed in liver, white adipose tissue, brown adipose tissues (BATs), and muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> controls, <italic>Abca1</italic> and <italic>Srebp1f</italic> mRNA levels increased significantly after agonist treatment. This stimulation was fully (<italic>Abca1</italic>) or partially (<italic>Srebp1f</italic>) blunted in NG from LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that in the NG, the regulation by LXRs of <italic>Abca1</italic> is restricted to sensory neurons, but that its action on <italic>Srebp1f</italic> likely occurs in multiple cell types.</p><p>Interestingly, cholesterol assays on whole NG taken from WD (42% fat, 0.2% cholesterol)-fed LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> knockout mice showed a 60% increase in total cholesterol compared to littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An increase of intracellular cholesterol level was also observed in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> dispersed neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our results suggest that in a WD setting, LXRs regulate NG sensory neuron cholesterol levels though ABCA1-dependent signaling.

In addition, LXR agonist or ABCA1 over-expression has been shown to alter cholesterol content in degenerating neurons or cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Smith and Land, 2012</xref>). Our results demonstrate that in sensory neurons, NG cholesterol metabolism is also regulated via LXR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Resistance to diet induced obesity in mice lacking <italic>LXRα/β</italic> in <italic>Nav1.8</italic>-expressing neurons</title><p>To measure the physiological impact of LXRs loss in peripheral sensory neurons expressing Nav1.8, LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup>, LXRs<sup>Nav</sup>, Nav1.8::Cre were maintained for 16 weeks on a standard rodent chow diet (normal chow, NC, 4% fat) or WD. All mice had similar body weights at weaning. However, LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice weighed significantly less than controls after 11 weeks of NC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Similarly, LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice fed WD were resistant to diet-induced obesity. NMR analysis revealed that LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice had twofold more body fat after 10 weeks of WD than LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the differences in body fat do not completely reflect the body weight difference, despite no difference in lean mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). WD-fed LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice had higher energy expenditure than littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). However, no differences in food intake were noted in metabolic chambers. Furthermore, no important changes were found in plasma glucose, serum cholesterol, free fatty acids and liver triglycerides or cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-F</xref>). A decrease in adiposity in the setting of nutrient excess is sometimes due to ectopic lipid deposition in liver. However, histological examination using Hematoxylin and Eosin staining (H&amp;E staining) showed that when fed WD, both LXRs<sup>fl</sup> and LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice developed hepatosteatosis and increase in hepatic lipid droplets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Our results suggest that LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice have an exacerbated response to the WD with increased diet-induced thermogenesis. This suggests that LXRs may regulate the whole-body energy expenditure according to the amount of fat or cholesterol present in the diet.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06667.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ablation of LXRs from NAV1.8 expressing neurons exacerbates high-fat diet induced thermogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Body weight of LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice and littermate controls on chow and Western Diet (WD) as followed over time (n = 12 per genotype) * for WD, # for normal chow (NC).

To study the ability of NG to acutely respond to nutrient changes (including triglycerides and fatty acids), we studied the expression of LXR targets in the NG of fed or fasted mice. We asked whether fasting-induced increases in fatty acid availability modified NG gene expression. <italic>Abca1</italic>, <italic>Srepb1f</italic>, and <italic>Syn</italic><italic>g</italic> mRNA levels were significantly changed in LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice fasted 20 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We also exposed NG cultures to serum obtained from mice fed or fasted for 20 hr. These data suggest that NG neurons may sense circulating secreted starvation cues and respond by regulating unique LXR-dependent genes. Despite its well-documented role in regulating the transcription of genes crucial for lipid synthesis and storage upon cholesterol sensing, little is known about how LXRs function in peripheral neurons and further investigation is necessary to completely understand the role of these NRs in the NG neurons.</p><p>Our study suggests that LXRs in vagal sensory neurons potentially regulate vagal synaptic transmission to ultimately affect the gating of information to adipose tissues and muscle. Since WAT, BAT, and muscle receive innervation from sympathetic neurons, we suspect that the increased sympathetic tone (secondary to altered input from the vagal sensory neuron activity) may underlie the increased energy expenditure observed in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice.</p><p>Interestingly, Kalaany et al., also described LXR null mice as resistant to obesity when challenged with a Western-style diet containing high fat and cholesterol. This phenotype was surprisingly independent of SREBP-1c and due to a net increase in the energy utilization in white adipose and muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kalaany et al., 2005</xref>). Our study of LXR function in NG neurons is consistent with this previous report and provides a partial explanation of how LXRs can affect the whole body thermogenesis via sensory neurons.</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Diano et al., (2011)</xref>, previously showed induction of LXRs in the hypothalamus in response to high-fat feeding. This finding suggests that LXRs may also regulate energy homeostasis beyond the nodose nucleus neurons.</p><p>Based on the aforementioned findings, we postulate that the LXR pathway may mediate certain aspects of lipid sensing in peripheral sensory neurons. Our findings also suggest that the ability to metabolize and sense cholesterol and/or fatty acids in peripheral neurons may be an important requirement for physiological adaptations to high-fat/high-cholesterol (Western) diets, such including thermogenesis leading to changes in key metabolic processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All ‘Materials and methods’ were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at UT Southwestern Medical Center.

Is there evidence of increased fatty acid uptake and oxidation</italic>?</p><p>First, as suggested we changed the title to “Loss of the Liver X Receptor LXRα/β in Peripheral Sensory Neurons Modifies Energy Expenditure’’.</p><p>The reviewers suggested that we study the potential contribution of muscle to the energy expenditure phenotype. To establish whether peripheral sensory neuron-specific deletion of LXRs alters skeletal muscle energy expenditure, we examined mitochondrial electron transport chain activity by performing mitochondrial electron-flow and electron-coupling experiments to assess oxygen- consumption rates (OCRs), a previously validated method used to quantify mitochondrial oxidative capacity and integrity (Kusminski CM NatMed 2012; Rogers GW PLoS ONE 2011). Interestingly, during the electron-flow analyses, we observed that skeletal muscle mitochondria derived from knockout (LXRs<sup>Nav</sup>) mice exhibit markedly higher oxygen-consumption rates (OCRs) in response to the substrates pyruvate, malate, succinate and ascorbate (revised version <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F-G</xref>). Furthermore, electron-coupling experiments to gage mitochondrial coupling and integrity revealed no defects in skeletal muscle mitochondrial function in either genotype (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). We thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. The data described in the revised article (Results section) indicate that deletion of LXR specifically in neuronal nodose ganglion enhances skeletal muscle mitochondrial oxidative respiration.</p><p><italic>2) The suggestion that LXRs sense changes in fatty acid levels is provocative, but not currently supported by data. The authors could address whether LXR target gene expression in sensory neurons change during fasting/refeeding. Additional discussion of how this might be accomplished would also be useful</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers also inquired whether LXR target gene expression in sensory neurons change during fasting/refeeding. As suggested, we used a new cohort of littermate mice to study whether fasting-induced increases in fatty acid availability potentially modified nodose ganglia gene expression. We found that <italic>Abca1</italic>, <italic>Srepb1c</italic> and Synuclein mRNA levels were significantly changed in LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice that were fasted for 20 hours (see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Notably, this increase in fasted <italic>Abca1</italic> and Synuclein was blunted in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These in vivo data suggest that nodose ganglia neurons may sense circulated or secreted cues during starvation and respond by regulating unique LXR-dependent genes.</p><p>Despite its well-documented role in regulating the transcription of genes crucial for lipid synthesis and storage upon cholesterol sensing, little is known about how LXRs function in peripheral neurons and further investigations will be necessary to completely understand the role of these NRs in the nodose ganglia neurons. Our study suggests that LXRs in vagal sensory neurons potentially regulate vagal synaptic transmission, ultimately affecting the gating of information to adipose tissues and muscle. Since WAT, BAT and muscle receive innervation from sympathetic neurons, we suspect that the increased sympathetic tone—that is secondary to altered input from the parasympathetic vagal sensory neuron activity—may underlie the increased energy expenditure observed in LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> mice. These results and discussion were added to the revised manuscript (please see the subsection “The loss of LXRα/β in Nav1.8 expressing neurons attenuates lipid accumulation in brown adipose tissue, promotes browning in subcutaneous fat and modifies NG gene expression”). We also added a section detailing the mitochondrial studies to the Methods and made legend modifications.</p><p><italic>Minor comments</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) Please confirm that the knockout mice employed have been appropriately backcrossed to a common genetic background. Genetic background and degree of backcrossing should be indicated clearly in Methods</italic>.</p><p>As asked, we have detailed the genetic background of the mice in the Methods section. LXR<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice (on a mixed C57BL6 and 129SV background) were bred and kept as a mixed background in a closed colony in the UTSW germ-free rodent facility. LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were then backcrossed to C57BL/6J mice for six generations prior to experiments. Transgenic mice (C57/BL6 background) carrying <italic>Cre</italic>-recombinase driven by a Nav1.8 promoter (Nav1.8::Cre) were bred with backcrossed to the LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice. LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> mice were then bred with LXRs<sup>fl/fl</sup> Nav<sup>+/-</sup> mice to generate at least 3 cohorts of littermate LXRs<sup>Nav</sup> and LXRs<sup>fl</sup> mice that were used and compared in each of the respective experiments.</p></body></sub-article></article>
