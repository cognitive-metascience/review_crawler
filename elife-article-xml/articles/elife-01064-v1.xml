key regulator of endosomal maturation in eukaryotic cells. Mutations in <italic>rab7</italic> are thought to cause the dominant neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) by a gain-of-function mechanism. Here we show that loss of <italic>rab7</italic>, but not overexpression of <italic>rab7</italic> CMT2B mutants, causes adult-onset neurodegeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model. All CMT2B mutant proteins retain 10–50% function based on quantitative imaging, electrophysiology, and rescue experiments in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Consequently, expression of CMT2B mutants at levels between 0.5 and 10-fold their endogenous levels fully rescues the neuropathy-like phenotypes of the <italic>rab7</italic> mutant. Live imaging reveals that CMT2B proteins are inefficiently recruited to endosomes, but do not impair endosomal maturation. These findings are not consistent with a gain-of-function mechanism. Instead, they indicate a dosage-dependent sensitivity of neurons to <italic>rab7</italic>-dependent degradation. Our results suggest a therapeutic approach opposite to the currently proposed reduction of mutant protein function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01064.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01064.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01064.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is an inherited disorder of the nervous system with symptoms that typically begin in adolescence or early adulthood. The sensory and motor nerves gradually degenerate, causing muscles to waste away and leading to the loss of touch sensation across the body. One subtype of the disease—Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B—is caused by mutations in a gene called <italic>rab7</italic>, which codes for a protein that helps to regulate the breakdown of waste proteins inside cells.</p><p>Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B is described as a genetically dominant disorder because all patients have one wild type copy and one mutant copy of the <italic>rab7</italic> gene. Overexpression of the mutant gene in cells grown in culture alters many of the signaling pathways inside the cells, but it is unclear whether these alterations cause the pathology seen in the disease.</p><p>Now, Cherry et al. have obtained new insights into the genetics of Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B by creating the first animal model of the disorder. Fruit flies that did not have the <italic>rab7</italic> gene in the light-sensitive sensory neurons in their eyes were used to compare normal and mutant cells. While the two cell types were initially similar, the mutant cells gradually degenerated in the adult animal. By contrast, cells that overexpressed a mutant form of the <italic>rab7</italic> gene continued to function normally throughout adulthood. Moreover, when mutant Rab7 proteins were introduced into the cells that lacked the <italic>rab7</italic> gene, the proteins restored the cells’ sensitivity to light. These results suggest that mutant Rab7 proteins do not cause degeneration; instead, it is the loss of normal Rab7 function that causes problems.</p><p>At present, most research into treatment is aimed at finding ways to reduce the activity of mutant Rab7 proteins. However, the work of Cherry et al. suggests that increasing the activity of normal Rab7 proteins—or increasing the activity of alternative pathways that degrade waste proteins—may help to restore nerve function in this, and possibly other, neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01064.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01064.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>endosome</kwd><kwd>neuropathy</kwd><kwd>genetic</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1EY023333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiesinger</surname><given-names>P Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiesinger</surname><given-names>P Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Muscular Dystrophy Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MDA275948</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hiesinger</surname><given-names>P Robin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1EY03592</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meinertzhagen</surname><given-names>Ian A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Council of Taiwan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NSC 101-2320-B-002-051-MY2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Chih-Chiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Taiwan University College of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NTUMC, 102R39012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chan</surname><given-names>Chih-Chiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 NS069562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Eugene Jennifer</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mutations that reduce the functioning of <italic>rab7</italic> may underlie the degeneration of sensory and motor nerves in Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B disease, which suggests increasing endolysosomal function as a therapy.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Several neuropathies, lysosomal storage diseases and neurodegenerative disorders primarily affect the nervous system, despite underlying defects in cellular processes that occur in all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schultz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B (CMT2B) is a sensory neuropathy that primarily affects some of the longest axon projections in the human body and is caused by mutations in the <italic>rab7</italic> locus. <italic>rab7</italic> encodes a GTPase that regulates endolysosomal degradation in all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elliott et al., 1997</xref>). All known mutations in CMT2B patients alter highly conserved amino acids in Rab7 and cause pathology in heterozygosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kwon et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Verhoeven et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Houlden et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meggouh et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, CMT2B is a genetically dominant disease.</p><p>Several studies have proposed a neuron-specific gain-of-function mechanism of the CMT2B alleles to explain the dominant neuronal phenotype of this ubiquitous gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cogli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). In support of this hypothesis, several dominant functions of CMT2B mutant Rab7 have been described based on overexpression of the mutant proteins in neuronal or non-neuronal cultured cells. For example, CMT2B protein expression leads to altered EGF degradation in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>), decreased upregulation of the growth-associated protein 43 in PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cogli et al., 2010</xref>), increased interaction with the filament protein peripherin in Neura2A cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogli et al., 2013</xref>), modulatory effects on JNK signaling in N1E-115 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamauchi et al., 2010</xref>), accumulation of the NGF receptor TrkA in cultured dorsal root ganglia cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and altered EGF receptor signaling in HeLa, BHK-21 and A431 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basuray et al., 2013</xref>), amongst others. Furthermore, a recent report has suggested that overexpression of CMT2B mutants in HeLa and PC12 cells dominantly reduces <italic>rab7</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basuray et al., 2013</xref>). It is unclear which ones of these effects are causally linked to the neuropathy in aging sensory and motor neurons in humans. Since Rab7 is a key protein required for endolysosomal function in all cells, its loss or gain-of-function is predicted to directly or indirectly affect many signaling pathways over time. In addition, it is currently unclear whether overexpression of the CMT2B mutant proteins actually causes axon terminal degeneration in a sensory or motor neuron. Indeed, overexpression in at least one cell culture system revealed no obvious toxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCray et al., 2010</xref>). Consequently, the mechanism underlying the genetic dominance and the putative gain-of-function underlying the pathology of CMT2B remains unclear.</p><p>Rab7 has a well understood and critical role in converting Rab5-positive early endosomes into late endosomal compartments and thereby represents a key step in endolysosomal maturation in all cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bucci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rink et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Poteryaev et al., 2010</xref>). Rab7 GTPase function is biochemically well defined and GTP-locked ‘constitutively active’ and GDP-locked ‘dominant negative’ mutants have been tested and utilized in a plethora of systems, including human cell lines and <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bucci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, extensive biochemical characterizations of all four CMT2B proteins revealed that the majority of the overexpressed protein is in a GTP-bound form when compared to the GDP-bound form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>). However, the same study showed that the overall binding to both GTP and GDP is drastically reduced for the CMT2B proteins, unlike a constitutively active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, a 2.8 Å crystal structure of one of the CMT2B proteins revealed no intrinsic GTPase defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCray et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, the CMT2B variants can at least partially rescue defects caused by reduced <italic>rab7</italic> levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCray et al., 2010</xref>). In summary, neither overexpression studies in cell culture nor comprehensive biochemical analyses have so far pinpointed a molecular mechanism that directly causes adult-onset loss of synaptic function in sensory and motor neurons. In mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kawamura et al., 2012</xref>) and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kinchen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Skorobogata and Rocheleau, 2012</xref>) <italic>rab7</italic> null mutants cause embryonic lethality, which has so far precluded the analysis of neuronal phenotypes. In this study, we used the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> to analyze the role and mechanism of CMT2B mutant Rab7 proteins in sensory and motor neurons in vivo. Our findings did not uncover a neuron-specific dominant gain- or loss-of-function for the CMT2B alleles. Instead, our findings indicate that the CMT2B alleles are partial loss of function alleles of <italic>rab7</italic> that cause, in a dosage-dependent manner, first synaptic and subsequently neuronal degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of <italic>rab7</italic> causes adult-onset loss of synaptic function and subsequent neurodegeneration in <italic>Drosophila</italic> photoreceptor sensory neurons</title><p>Our recent functional profiling of all <italic>rab</italic> GTPases in <italic>Drosophila</italic> suggested an increased neuronal demand for <italic>rab7</italic> function compared to other cell types based on elevated neuronal expression of <italic>rab7</italic>, but not <italic>rab5</italic> or <italic>rab11</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). To investigate an enhanced or specialized role for <italic>rab7</italic> in the nervous system, we generated a null mutant by replacing the <italic>rab7</italic> open reading frame with a Gal4 knock-in cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); the Gal4 knock-in provides a means to express any gene of interest under the endogenous regulatory elements of <italic>rab7</italic> in either heterozygous or homozygous <italic>rab7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2012</xref>). Loss of <italic>rab7</italic> leads to lethality between 50–80% of pupal development (P+50%–P+80%) with no gross morphological abnormalities. Loss of the maternal contribution causes lethality in fully developed embryos with no obvious developmental defects. Wholemount preparations of the brain in null mutant pupae at P+35% reveal a loss of Rab7 immunolabeling to background levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chinchore et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). By P+50% substantial accumulations of the endosomal marker Hrs become apparent, although the overall brain structure appears normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). In addition, immunolabeling of photoreceptor axons indicates that cell-type specification and axon pathfinding are normal, but the photoreceptor membrane protein Chaoptin (24B10) accumulates in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>).

Photoreceptors are sensory neurons of the peripheral nervous system. Since blind flies are viable under laboratory conditions, photoreceptor neurons provide a model for the in vivo study of mutations that would be lethal if present in other tissues. Eyes mutant for <italic>rab7</italic> look indistinguishable from wild-type, suggesting that <italic>rab7</italic> mutant photoreceptors develop normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Measurements of photoreceptor function using electroretinogram (ERG) recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coombe, 1986</xref>) revealed no defects in the amplitudes of light-evoked responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,L</xref>) and synaptic function (as indicated by the ‘on’ transient; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K,M</xref>) in newly hatched adults. We conclude that <italic>rab7</italic> mutant photoreceptor neurons develop and initially function without obvious defects. In contrast, 5-day-old <italic>rab7</italic> mutants that were raised in constant ambient light (∼600 Lux, see ‘Materials and methods’) exhibit almost complete loss of synaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Under the same conditions, wild-type photoreceptors exhibit no significant reduction in synaptic function. By contrast, the photoreceptor response amplitude does not significantly differ between wild-type and <italic>rab7</italic>, suggesting that synaptic function is more sensitive than cell body function to loss of <italic>rab7</italic>. Furthermore, the age-dependent synaptic defect can be fully rescued by minimizing their stimulation through raising the flies in the dark (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similarly, electron microscopy of <italic>rab7</italic> mutant photoreceptors reveals increased degeneration of cellular structure after 5 days in constant light compared with wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>), while 5-day dark-reared <italic>rab7</italic> mutants and controls exhibit no obvious defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Synaptic terminals of light-exposed <italic>rab7</italic> photoreceptors exhibit large-scale degeneration that is absent in unstimulated <italic>rab7</italic> mutant terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1O,P</xref>). These findings suggest that in the absence of neuronal stimulation <italic>rab7</italic> in photoreceptor neurons is partially dispensable at least in young flies. Overall, our analysis of <italic>rab7</italic>-deficient sensory neurons revealed progressive defects that appear first as a loss of synaptic function but lead ultimately to degeneration of the entire neuron.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2B mutations affect Rab7 protein localization, but have no dominant effect on motor neuron function</title><p>Adult-onset synaptic degeneration is a hallmark of many human sensory neuropathies.

The <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>Gal4-knock-in</italic></sup> -driven UAS-venus-<italic>rab7</italic> expresses all variants in the endogenous spatiotemporal expression pattern of <italic>rab7</italic>. However, potential caveats include (1) that the <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>Gal4-knock-in</italic></sup> may exhibit small differences from the endogenous pattern not detected here, (2) that the UAS transgenes may exhibit small differences in expression levels even though they are inserted in the same landing sitesand in identical genetic background, and (3) that the Gal4/UAS amplification can increase overall protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). Western Blot analysis of total protein extract from fly heads revealed that all Venus-Rab7 proteins are mildly overexpressed at ∼1.8 to 3-fold of the levels of the endogenous Rab7 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We established nine transgenic lines for each of the nine UAS-venus-<italic>rab7</italic> transgenes in flies heterozygous for the <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>Gal4-knock-in</italic></sup> null allele (see “Generation of nine UAS-venus-<italic>rab7</italic> constructs and transgenic lines”). Hence, each line stably expresses one of the nine mutant <italic>rab7</italic> variants under the endogenous regulatory elements of <italic>rab7</italic> with around twofold protein levels of the endogenous protein in a background of 50% of the endogenous protein. Remarkably, all nine lines are viable as adults without obvious behavioral defects or altered lifespan.</p><p>To measure whether loss of <italic>rab7</italic> or expression of the CMT2B variants causes functional defects in motor neurons, we performed electrophysiological recordings at the larval neuromuscular junction of the <italic>rab7</italic> null mutant and for overexpression of three <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human CMT2B variants. If the CMT2B variants exert a dominant effect on synaptic function, these recordings should reveal an overexpression defect even if the null mutant does not. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–D</xref>, both the frequency and amplitudes of spontaneous single vesicle release events are indistinguishable between control, <italic>rab7</italic> null mutant and CMT2B protein overexpression. Similarly, evoked neurotransmission exhibits no defects for any genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). The absence of synaptic defects in the <italic>rab7</italic> null mutant is consistent with the electroretinogram recordings of photoreceptor function in young adults shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–M</xref>). In addition, these findings indicate that mild overexpression of CMT2B mutant proteins in their endogenous expression pattern in an entire animal in vivo does not obviously affect synaptic function in motor neurons.</p><p>To compare the behavior and subcellular distribution of all mutant Rab7 proteins, we investigated the subcellular location of the nine <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human Venus-tagged proteins. Venus-Rab7-WT-positive compartments are present in both presynaptic boutons and the surrounding muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Expressing the constitutively active Rab7-Q67L leads to increased compartment numbers mostly in the surrounding muscle, while Rab7-T22N exhibits only diffuse labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, the CMT2B variants accumulate in the center of synaptic boutons (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Functional Rab7 is characterized by dynamic colocalization first with the early endosomal marker Rab5 and second with the early-to-late endosomal ESCRT protein Hrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lloyd et al., 2002</xref>). Colocalization analysis with these markers therefore provides a means to assess the functional state of the nine Venus-tagged Rab7 variants. Co-labeling with Rab5 and Hrs reveals significant overlap with Venus-Rab7-WT that is further increased for Venus-Rab7-Q67L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In contrast, both Rab5 and Hrs colocalization are almost completely lost for Venus-Rab7-T22N as well as all CMT2B proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). In particular, the synaptic accumulations of CMT2B variants exclude endosomal markers, suggesting that they are not functional. These findings are consistent with the absence of electrophysiological defects of these synapses.</p><p>To further analyze the function of each of the nine Venus-Rab7 proteins, we analyzed their recruitment to distinct compartments vs diffuse localization in the ventral ganglion where the motor neuron cell bodies reside. The GTP-locked Rab7-Q67L has an increased activity that is quantitatively reflected in its localization to late endosomal compartments, whereas the GDP-locked Rab7-T22N is considered inactive, as reflected by a complete failure to be recruited to endosomal compartments. Hence, compartment localization is a quantitative readout for GTP-dependent Rab7 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>, the nine variants exhibit localization to distinct compartments (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) and diffuse labeling in varying ratios. Quantification of the ratio of compartment fluorescence to total fluorescence in 3D datasets of individual cell bodies shows that 38% of Rab7-Q67L, compared to 21% of wild-type Rab7 and less than 4% of Rab7-T22N localize to distinct compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data are consistent with a plethora of previous studies on these widely studied Rab7 variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mukhopadhyay et al., 1997a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">1997b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bucci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). Analysis of the Venus-tagged CMT2B variants reveals mostly a diffuse cytoplasmic location, similar to Rab7-T22N, with 2–11% of the total fluorescent protein localized to distinct compartments. Hence, the reduced compartment localization suggests that the CMT2B proteins retain ∼5–50% of the function of Rab7-WT. A similar difference is observed for the human proteins hRab7-WT and hRab7-K157N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data do not support the hypothesis that the disease variants mimic the gain-of-function of the Q67L mutations. Instead, they suggest that CMT2B variants exhibit reduced function more similar to the T22N mutant, but may retain some wild-type protein function that, based on quantitative analysis of localization to distinct compartments, ranges between 5–50% of Rab7-WT.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Prolonged overexpression of GTP-bound, GDP-bound or CMT2B variants does not cause neuropathy-like phenotypes in sensory neurons in vivo</title><p>Our findings indicate that <italic>rab7</italic> is not acutely required for synaptic function in motor neurons or photoreceptor sensory neurons. However, loss of <italic>rab7</italic> leads to progressive, stimulation-dependent loss of synaptic function, which can be studied in photoreceptor neurons over prolonged time periods. We therefore asked whether overexpression of any of the nine Venus-Rab7 variants causes neuropathy-like phenotypes over time in vivo. Protein localization of the Venus-Rab7 variants in the photoreceptor synaptic layer in the brain revealed that all four CMT2B proteins accumulate under the exclusion of other endosomal markers, very similar to our findings in motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In contrast, both Venus-Rab7-WT and Venus-Rab7-Q67L exhibit significant colocalization with both Rab5 and Hrs at synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also analyzed cell bodies of central nervous system neurons in the same brains. Here, the constitutively active Rab7-Q67L exhibits a typical increase of endosomal compartments positive for Rab7-Q67L, Rab5 and Hrs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–D</xref>). In contrast, the CMT2B variants exhibit strongly reduced Rab5 and Hrs colocalization.

The ratio of genotypes that emerge after four generations is indicative of the fitness of each genotype relative to the others in the population. For instance, if overexpression of any of the nine <italic>rab7</italic> variants has deleterious effects, two copies of the transgene will be less common than one. In the case of wild-type Rab7, three quarters of the population had two copies of the Rab7-WT transgene, indicating little to no toxicity of the overexpressed Rab7-WT. Furthermore, 12% of the flies in the population were rescued homozygous <italic>rab7</italic> null mutants (light and dark green in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We note that this number reflects a remarkably healthy rescue, because a significant part of the population lives without the wild-type <italic>rab7</italic> chromosome, but instead only due to Rab7-<italic>Gal4</italic>-driven UAS-<italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup> in direct competition with wild-type flies over four generations. Indeed, the ratio of rescued to wild-type progeny prior to the competition experiment obeyed Mendelian ratios and homozygous <italic>rab7</italic> null mutant flies rescued with Rab7-WT expression (UAS-<italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>/UAS-<italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>; <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>Gal4-knock-in</italic></sup>/<italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>Gal4-knock-in</italic></sup>) appear indistinguishable from wild type.</p><p>In the case of Rab7-T22N 40% of the population had two copies of this widely used ‘dominant negative’ transgene, but no rescued homozygous <italic>rab7</italic> null mutants were observed. Hence, Rab7-T22N exhibits little or no toxicity but is also not sufficiently functional to efficiently rescue the null mutant. Interestingly, close investigation of the fly stock revealed that the <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>T22N</italic></sup> mutant actually yielded rare adult escapers that died shortly after emergence. In contrast, Rab7-Q67L never occurred in two copies, indicating that high levels of this constitutively active mutant are associated with reduced fitness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, two of the four CMT2B variants lead to populations consisting entirely of individuals expressing two copies of these disease-associated proteins. Remarkably, almost no rescue of the null mutant with a single copy of these CMT2B transgenes was observed, but between 12–35% of individuals were rescued by two copies of the CMT2B mutant transgenes. These findings suggest that higher levels of at least three of the four CMT2B mutant proteins increase the fitness and are indeed required to compensate for the loss of wild-type <italic>rab7</italic>. In summary, all CMT2B disease mutants, including the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and human Rab7-K157N, exhibited significant rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, all UAS-<italic>rab7</italic> variants except Rab7-T22N rescued <italic>rab7</italic> lethality and yielded adult flies with no obvious defects. These findings reveal that the CMT2B proteins do not reduce fitness or neuronal health, but retain sufficient wild-type function to compensate for loss of <italic>rab7</italic> if expressed at 2–6-fold endogenous levels.</p><p>To measure the ability of all <italic>rab7</italic> variants to rescue the progressive and usage-dependent synaptic and neuronal degeneration observed in the null mutant we measured ERGs in photoreceptors after 10 days constant light exposure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–F</xref>, all <italic>rab7</italic> variants rescued the null mutant phenotypes. Only <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>T22N</italic></sup> exhibited an only partial ability to rescue the response amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>), synaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,E</xref>) and rhabdomere morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,F</xref>). However, the observation that <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>T22N</italic></sup> exhibits some rescue of the null mutant further indicates that it retains some wild-type function and does not obviously act as a genetically dominant negative mutant at these levels of overexpression in Drosophila. While both human Rab7 proteins exhibit a reduced ability to rescue synaptic functions under these stress conditions, <italic>hrab7</italic><sup><italic>K157N</italic></sup> does not significantly differ from <italic>hrab7</italic><sup><italic>WT</italic></sup>. The ability of all CMT2B mutant proteins to rescue the null mutant phenotype indicates that replacement of wild-type <italic>rab7</italic> with mild overexpression in the correct spatiotemporal pattern is sufficient to compensate for the partial loss of function of the mutant variants. In summary, we conclude that all CMT2B mutants retain significant levels of wild-type function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Live imaging reveals that CMT2B proteins are inefficiently recruited to endosomes, but do not dominantly impair endosomal maturation</title><p>What causes the reduced wild-type function of the CMT2B mutant proteins? To measure the function of each of the Rab7 variants, we devised a live imaging method to assay the well-characterized role of Rab7 in the maturation of late endosomal compartments. We developed a culture system for high-resolution live imaging of endosomal dynamics in photoreceptor neurons in intact eye-brain complexes and made use of the lysosomal marker spinster/benchwarmer (spin) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sweeney and Davis, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dermaut et al., 2005</xref>). Co-expression of the Venus-tagged Rab7 proteins with spin-RFP reveals the dynamics of endolysosomal conversion both in cell bodies and at synapses (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1 media2 media3 media4 media5 media6 media7 media8 media9 media10">Videos 1–10</xref>). In cell bodies, Venus-Rab7-WT marks on average 15 clearly distinguishable, circular endosomal compartments of 0.5 µm diameter or more per 500 µm² tissue area. In contrast, Rab7-T22N marks no individual compartments and expression of the constitutively active Venus-Rab7-Q67L leads to a doubling of compartment numbers, many of which are significantly larger than those observed for wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). As seen before, all four CMT2B mutant proteins exhibit mostly diffuse labeling similar to Rab7-T22N; however, in contrast to Rab7-T22N and Rab7-K157N, the other three CMT2B variants also reveal clear circular labeling of distinct compartments of 0.5 µm diameter or above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), albeit at significantly reduced numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). 3D time lapse imaging of the dynamics of these compartments reveals conversion of 8–9% of these compartments into spin-RFP positive compartments within a 5 min imaging interval. Conversion of wild type and CMT2B Venus-Rab7 marked compartments typically occurs quickly and within the 30 s between image acquisition time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–F</xref>). Remarkably, the conversion rate of 8–9% per 500 µm² tissue area per 5 min is identical between all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Based on these measurements, the CMT2B proteins exhibit 5–50% of the wild type levels of recruitment to endosomal compartments, but no defects in endosomal conversion.<media content-type="glencoe

For example, mammalian heterologous expression studies revealed that the GTP: GDP ratio is altered, which could suggest a dominant or constitutively active mutant. However, the same study revealed that, in contrast to the constitutively active variant, the total amount of both GTP and GDP bound Rab7 is dramatically decreased for the CMT2B mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Luca et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, our findings are largely consistent with the thorough biochemical characterization of the CMT2B Rab7 proteins by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCray et al. (2010)</xref>. Specifically, McCray et al. found that the CMT2B proteins have no GTPase activity defect, but augmented protein activity, based on increased guanine nucleotide dissociation, hydrolysis-independent inactivation, quantitative changes on effector interactions and decreased membrane cycling. However, McCray et al. also showed that the CMT2B proteins retain sufficient wild-type function to rescue reduced <italic>rab7</italic> activity in HeLa cells without obvious toxic gain-of-function effects. All these findings are consistent with partial loss of function alleles. The key difference to the present study lies in the interpretation that misregulation of the disease proteins’ Rab7 activity may have a dominant effect, as opposed to our simpler interpretation as partial loss-of-function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Limitations of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model</title><p>Our findings do not provide an obvious explanation for recent reports on specific dominant effects of CMT2B protein overexpression in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Spinosa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cogli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCray et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basuray et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). These dominant phenotypes could be a result of overexpression in a heterologous cell line, or a <italic>bona fide</italic> property of the CMT2B proteins. In some cases, high levels of overexpression might at least partially explain the effects. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out the possibility of a dominant interaction with protein complexes or protein functions that are specific to vertebrate cells. However, we note that none of the studies to date has reported progressive neuronal or synaptic deterioration as a consequence of CMT2B protein overexpression in motor or sensory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). While we show here that such putative vertebrate-specific properties are not necessary to cause the neuropathy in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model, they may contribute to specific neuronal changes over time in the different heterologous cell culture systems as well as in patients.</p><p>A second limitation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model is revealed by our effort to precisely mimic the human patient genotypes that lead to identical levels of expression of one wild type copy of Rab7 and one CMT2B mutant variant. In patients, this genotype leads to slow motor- and sensory neuron degeneration with an onset between 12 to more than 40 years. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, heterozygotes with an additional copy of a CMT2B chromosome are healthy and photoreceptor neurons are not sensitized to stimulation-dependent degeneration within the limits of our functional and morphological assays. The observation that this genotype is sufficient for normal human development and function for decades offers a possible explanation for this limitation of the fly model. Indeed, slow, adult-onset degeneration over a period of years is not easily mimicked in any model organism. It will be interesting to see if a <italic>rab7</italic> heterozygous mouse model exhibits stimulation-dependent degeneration of motor- or sensory neurons over time, or if even the lifespan of a mouse is not sufficient to model this aspect of the human neuropathy.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The partial loss-of-function model</title><p>We propose that CMT2B in patients reflects a <italic>rab7</italic> dosage-dependence, as described here in a fly model. Since no patients have been reported with a null mutant allele of <italic>rab7</italic>, we speculate that complete loss of one copy of <italic>rab7</italic> in humans may cause lethality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Adding a second <italic>rab7</italic> allele with 5–50% function may be sufficient to retain normal function in most cells but slowly cause defects over a period of years only in the cells most sensitive to <italic>rab7</italic>-dependent endolysosomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Our model predicts that only mutations that reduce <italic>rab7</italic> function within a certain range will lead to a neuropathy, explaining the rarity of these mutations and the variability of disease onset. We note that the CMT2B mutant with the least function in the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), <italic>rab7</italic><sup><italic>K157N</italic></sup>, is a sporadic new mutation in a patient with the earliest reported childhood onset (12 years) of the four mutant variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Meggouh et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Mild reductions in endolysosomal degradative capacity may be caused by numerous genetic polymorphisms as well as an increased degradative load in various degenerative disorders characterized by intracellular accumulations. Such accumulations and subsequent endomembrane degradative responses are hallmarks of most neurodegenerative disorders. An elevated neuronal demand for endolysosomal degradation is further highlighted by the recent discovery of a neuron-specific branch of the endolysosomal system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Williamson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Haberman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang and Hiesinger, 2012</xref>). In the case of CMT2B our findings suggest an increase of endolysosomal function as a therapeutic approach, which is opposite to the current proposal to reduce the function of the mutant Rab7 proteins. Neuronal sensitivity to <italic>rab7</italic>-dependent degradation may be a common factor contributing to neuronal pathology in numerous disorders with reduced degradation or increased degradative burden. Reduced endolysosomal capacity may thus contribute to pathology and increased endolysosomal function may represent a more general therapeutic opportunity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of the <italic>rab7</italic> knock-out</title><p>The generation of <italic>rab7</italic> targeting vector by recombineering was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">2012</xref>) with some modifications.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, of whom, Mani Ramaswami, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The work provides very interesting and compelling studies based on <italic>rab7</italic> loss of function mutations in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to challenge the current dogma that CMT2B-causative mutations found in human patients represent toxic gain of function mutations.</p><p>Through an in-depth characterization of transgenes carrying mutations in CMT2B causative mutations in <italic>rab7</italic>, the authors show that all 4 CMT2B causative mutations partially inactivate the protein, leading to the idea that the dominant inheritance pattern is due to dosage effects. The work creates a very useful in vivo model for CMT2B that can be used for further genetic and pharmacological analysis. The study is comprehensive, generates new valuable reagents, carries out multiple functional analyses (activity-dependent neurodegeneration, loss of synaptic transmission) and tries to get at the mechanism by which a loss of function in the mutant rab7 protein might result in progressive degeneration in sensory neurons in the eye. The data are generally nicely presented, though proper labels are needed in all of the figures.</p><p>To establish the haploinsufficiency of the human disease mutations the authors use a series of well-designed and very well executed experiments, including an elegant experiment in quantitative genetics to show that: (a) Human <italic>rab7</italic> rescues loss of fly <italic>rab7</italic>; (b) Fly <italic>rab7</italic> is haploinsufficient when it comes to neuroprotection, as loss of one copy causes activity dependent degeneration; and (c) both the fly and human disease variants are not toxic when overexpressed at reasonable levels in vivo. Interestingly, this is in fact consistent with the majority of biochemical analyses of the human CMT2B mutant <italic>rab7</italic>'s.</p><p>Substantive concern: What the paper lacks is clear cut experimental evidence showing that a single copy of a CMT2B <italic>rab7</italic> variant (or protein expression equivalent of it) in a heterozygous mutant background represents a reduction in Rab7 activity and predisposes neurons to degeneration. The authors should attempt this experiment in any way they chose. The simplest would appear to be to use the <italic>rab7</italic>-<italic>gal4</italic> knock-in heterozygotes and homozygotes to express the different CMT2B variants at levels approaching 50% of the endogenous protein: e.g., by exploiting the temperature sensitivity of the Gal4/UAS system, and testing if the resulting flies (which most closely model CMT2B patients) show neurodegeneration, particularly in older flies. The result should be included in this paper, although the reviewers acknowledge that there could be limitations of the fly system that complicate one's ability to model the disease with such extreme precision (that is, a negative result, clearly discussed, will also satisfactorily complete this otherwise comprehensive study).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01064.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>What the paper lacks is clear cut experimental evidence showing that a single copy of a CMT2B</italic> rab7 <italic>variant (or protein expression equivalent of it) in a heterozygous mutant background represents a reduction in Rab7 activity and predisposes neurons to degeneration.

In initial experiments, we only succeeded in reducing the expression levels of the disease mutant proteins to about 2-fold, despite the temperature sensitivity of the Gal4/UAS system. To obtain flies with endogenous levels of disease mutant protein expression, we performed a series of experiments introducing Gal80ts to further reduce Gal4/UAS expression of the CMT2B variants. These experiments were facilitated by the fact that the disease mutant proteins are fluorescently tagged, allowing quantitative comparison with the endogenous protein in Rab7 Western Blot. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, we identified the conditions to generate flies that express the human disease mutant variants at levels comparable to heterozygous endogenous levels, as well as ∼50% below endogenous levels, and up to more than 10-fold endogenous levels.</p><p>Light stimulation causes degeneration in <italic>rab7</italic> heterozygotes, which can be rescued by expression of wild-type Rab7. Our new data reveal that endogenous levels of the CMT2B variants and even 50% below endogenous levels are sufficient to rescue this phenotype (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We conclude that we cannot easily mimic the precise dosage-dependence of the human condition in flies. This is consistent with our previous conclusions, as shown in the model figure (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>): We proposed that putative human heterozygotes, which have never been documented, are likely not viable, whereas the fly heterozygotes clearly are almost completely healthy. Adding 10-50% of a second <italic>rab7</italic> copy, as is the case with the CMT2B variants, permits normal human development and function for years, but is not enough to prevent slow degeneration after 12 or more years as observed in patients. In contrast, in the fly the addition of 10-50% of <italic>rab7</italic> function in the form of a CMT2B allele is sufficient to quantitatively rescue the degeneration phenotype within the limits our functional and morphology read-outs.</p><p>We conclude that the slow, dosage-dependent effect of a mild reduction of Rab7 function in patients that only leads to degeneration after 12-40 years is not easily modeled in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. This is a clear limit of the fly model. However, we would like to note that mimicking slow, adult-onset degeneration as it occurs in patients over many years is a problem in all animal models, including mouse models for numerous neurodegenerative diseases. Even a mouse model for mildly reduced Rab7 function may not precisely mimic the dosage-dependence and slow disease progression observed in human patients, and in cell culture equivalent experiments are impossible. We discuss this and other limits of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model now in the revised Results as well as an extra Discussion section entitled ‘Limitations of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> model’.</p><p>Nonetheless, we still consider the experiment requested by the reviewers very valuable. Not a single one of the numerous previous cell culture overexpression papers on CMT2B provided any information on the level of CMT2B protein overexpression used in these studies. Since we can precisely quantify the level of expression of the CMT2B variants (in the endogenous expression pattern in an entire organism in vivo), we have also repeated the rescue/overexpression experiment with the CMT2B proteins with more than 10-fold overexpression. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, even more than 10-fold overexpression rescues and does not negatively affect neuronal function.</p><p>Taken together, we can make two strong and quantitative statements after these revision experiments. First, Rab7 CMT2B proteins at 50% less than endogenous heterozygous levels (corresponding to 25% of total Rab7 function) retain sufficient wild-type function to rescue rab7-dependent degeneration. Second, Rab7 CMT2B proteins at &gt;10-fold overexpression rescue equally well and exhibit no toxic or other obvious gain-of-function effects. Together with our quantitative colocalization and live imaging experiments that show reduced function at 10-50% wild type levels, these data corroborate our conclusion that CMT2B proteins represent partial loss-of-function alleles with no toxic gain-of-function in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
