Here, we show that the dendrites of PVD neurons in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are patterned by distinct pathways downstream of the DMA-1 leucine-rich transmembrane (LRR-TM) receptor. DMA-1/LRR-TM interacts through a PDZ ligand motif with the guanine nucleotide exchange factor TIAM-1/GEF in a complex with <italic>act-4/Actin</italic> to pattern higher order 4° dendrite branches by localizing F-actin to the distal ends of developing dendrites. Surprisingly, TIAM-1/GEF appears to function independently of Rac1 guanine nucleotide exchange factor activity. A partially redundant pathway, dependent on HPO-30/Claudin, regulates formation of 2° and 3° branches, possibly by regulating membrane localization and trafficking of DMA-1/LRR-TM. Collectively, our experiments suggest that HPO-30/Claudin localizes the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor on PVD dendrites, which in turn can control dendrite patterning by directly modulating F-actin dynamics through TIAM-1/GEF.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dendrites</kwd><kwd>guanine nucleotide exchange factor</kwd><kwd>PVD</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd><kwd>GEF independent</kwd><kwd>claudin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007288</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Balzac</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31HD066967</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz-Balzac</surname><given-names>Carlos A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31NS100370</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rahman</surname><given-names>Maisha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Fulbright-Colciencias</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ramirez-Suarez</surname><given-names>Nelson J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM07491</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lázaro-Peña</surname><given-names>Maria I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Irma T Hirschl/Monique Weill-Caulier</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bülow</surname><given-names>Hannes E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS096672</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bülow</surname><given-names>Hannes E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The DMA-1/LRR-TM cell surface receptor signals through partially redundant pathways to cell-autonomously pattern dendrites, including by directly forming a complex with both the TIAM-1/GEF and ACT-4/Actin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurons are highly polarized cells, which comprise a single axon and often elaborately sculpted dendritic arbors. Dendrites receive input from other neurons or the environment, whereas the single axon transmits information to other neurons. The nervous system is formed by a myriad of specific synaptic connections between neurons and the formation of these connections is influenced by the shape and complexity of dendritic arbors. Both genes that act within the developing neurons and in surrounding tissues are crucial to establish distinct dendritic structures during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dong et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lefebvre et al., 2015</xref>). Of note, defects in dendrite morphology have been found in various neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kaufmann and Moser, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kulkarni and Firestein, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Both dendritic and axonal morphology is driven by the cytoskeleton and regulators of the cytoskeleton have consequently important functions in neuronal development. Major components of the cytoskeleton include actin and tubulin, which form filamentous polymers named F-actin and microtubules, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brouhard, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pollard, 2016</xref>). F-actin exists in unbranched and branched forms, whereas microtubules are generally unbranched. These filament-like polymers are not static, but highly dynamic structures due to the constant association and dissociation of monomers at either end. A plethora of proteins bind to and modulate polymerization and depolymerization of both F-actin and microtubules in neurons (reviewed in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kapitein and Hoogenraad, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Konietzny et al., 2017</xref>). F-actin and microtubules are important for countless aspects of neuronal function and development in both axons and dendrites, including differentiation, migration and the elaboration of axonal and dendritic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jan and Jan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dent et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Regulation of the cytoskeleton is controlled by dedicated signaling pathways, which often originate with cell surface receptors. These receptors utilize regulatory proteins such as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) or GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs), which, in turn, modulate the activity of small GTPases. For example, the RacGEF Tiam-1 regulates activity-dependent dendrite morphogenesis in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tolias et al., 2005</xref>), likely by activating the small GTPase Rac1. Activated GTPases such as Rac1 then bind the WASP family verprolin-homologous protein (WVE-1/WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC) of actin regulators to promote actin polymerization and branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The polymodal somatosensory neuron PVD in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> has emerged as a paradigm to study dendrite development. The dendritic arbor of PVD neurons develops through successive orthogonal branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oren-Suissa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeg et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). During the late larval L2 stage primary (1°) branches first emerge both anteriorly and posteriorly of the cell body along the lateral nerve cord. In subsequent larval stages, secondary (2°) branches emanate orthogonally to bifurcate at the boundary between the lateral epidermis and muscle to form tertiary (3°) branches. These, in turn, form perpendicular quaternary (4°) branches to establish the candelabra-shaped dendritic arbors, which have also been called menorahs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Oren-Suissa et al., 2010</xref>). Previous studies have shown that an adhesion complex consisting of MNR-1/Menorin and SAX-7/L1CAM functions from the skin together with the muscle-derived chemokine LECT-2/Chondromodulin II to pattern PVD dendrites. This adhesion complex binds to and signals through the DMA-1/LRR-TM leucine rich transmembrane receptor expressed in PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu and Shen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Salzberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Díaz-Balzac et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zou et al., 2016</xref>). DMA-1/LRR-TM shows great similarity in domain architecture with the LRRTM family of leucine rich transmembrane receptors in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Laurén et al., 2003</xref>), but limited sequence homology (data not shown). The signaling mechanisms that operate downstream of the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor in PVD dendrites have remained largely elusive.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38949.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The intracellular domain of DMA-1/LRR-TM is required for higher order branching of PVD somatosensory dendrites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescent images of PVD (left panels) and schematics (right panels) of wild-type control animals.

To further investigate this notion, we conducted transgenic rescue experiments with deletions and point mutant variants of TIAM-1/GEF. We found that full length TIAM-1/GEF alone or as a C-terminal fusion with mCherry fully rescued the PVD dendrite patterning defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Surprisingly, a T548F point mutant of full length TIAM-1/GEF still rescued the PVD mutant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The fact that the very same mutation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIAM-1 DH/PH domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demarco et al., 2012</xref>) as well as the analogous point mutation in the UNC-73/Trio GEF abolishes Rac1 GEF activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steven et al., 1998</xref>), lent further support to the idea that TIAM-1/GEF activity may not be required for PVD patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). It was conceivable, however, that mutant TIAM-1(T548F) retained some residual GEF activity that through high level transgenic expression could provide sufficient enzymatic GEF activity to rescue the PVD dendrite defects of <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutants. To exclude this possibility, we used CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to engineer the T548F missense mutation into the endogenous <italic>tiam-1/GEF</italic> locus. Two independently isolated alleles (<italic>dz264</italic> and <italic>dz265</italic>) that harbored the T548F point mutation in the <italic>tiam-1/GEF</italic> locus appeared phenotypically normal in regard to PVD patterning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–D</xref> and data not shown). Thus, a point mutant form of TIAM-1 (T548F) devoid of measurable Rac1 GEF activity in vitro is sufficient for PVD patterning in vivo. In summary, our results suggest that TIAM-1/GEF can function independently of its GEF enzymatic activity although we can not formally exclude that the TIAM-1(T548F) shows enzymatic activity towards small GTPases other than Rac1 that may be involved in PVD patterning.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38949.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>TIAM-1/GEF interacts with DMA-1/LRR-TM through PDZ motif/domain interaction to shape 4° dendrite branches.</title><p>(<bold>A – B</bold>) Fluorescent image with schematics of <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutant animals carrying either a full length or deletion construct (GEF-only) of the <italic>tiam-1</italic> cDNA under control of the PVD-specific <italic>ser-2p3</italic> promoter.

Intriguingly, overexpression of full length TIAM-1 resulted in more 4° branches, suggesting that TIAM-1 function is dosage dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>).

To test this hypothesis, we transfected DMA-1 (tagged with V5, DMA-1.V5) and TIAM-1 (tagged with HA, TIAM-1.HA) in human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T) and conducted co-immunoprecipitation experiments from lysates of transiently transfected cells. We found that DMA-1.V5 efficiently co-immunoprecipitated TIAM-1.HA from lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This interaction was dependent on the DMA-1 intracellular domain (ICD) and, specifically on the PDZ binding site, as the interaction was strongly reduced if either was removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Moreover, the interaction between TIAM-1/GEF and DMA-1/LRR-TM appeared specific, because replacing the DMA-1 PDZ binding site (YFGI) with the heterologous PDZ motif (EFYA) of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan SDN-1/Syndecan reduced the interaction between TIAM-1 and DMA-1 to the same extent as removing the PDZ binding site entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Residual binding activity may be contributed by the EVH1 domain, as removing the EVH1 domain from TIAM-1/GEF also compromised the interaction with DMA-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). On the other hand, removing the PDZ domain from TIAM-1 (ΔPDZ) completely abrogated the interaction between DMA-1/LRR-TM and TIAM-1/GEF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Collectively, our result showed (1) that TIAM-1/GEF interacts with DMA-1/LRR-TM through a PDZ domain-motif interaction with a possible contribution of the EVH1 domain in TIAM-1, and (2) that loss of PDZ domain or motif from either protein functionally result in a specific loss of 4° dendritic branches, suggesting that DMA-1/LRR-TM localizes TIAM-1/GEF to direct 4° dendrite growth.

Having identified a function for <italic>act-4/Actin</italic> in PVD dendrite patterning, we sought to visualize F-actin in PVD neurons of live animals. To this end, we used the calponin homology domain of utrophin (UtrCH) fused to tagRFP (tagRFP::UtrCH), which has been previously shown to faithfully visualize F-actin without effects on actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burkel et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chia et al., 2014</xref>). Transgenic animals expressing tagRFP::UtrCH in PVD neurons showed the reporter localized to defined subcellular compartments during development of the dendritic arbor. During the L2 larval stage tagRFP::UtrCH was primarily localized to the cell body, the 1°, 2°, and budding 3° branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). During the subsequent larval stages, tagRFP::UtrCH remained strongly expressed in the cell body, but otherwise became successively more localized to distal (i.e. developing) branches, rather than proximal branches. For example, at the young adult stage, tagRFP::UtrCH was primarily localized to 4° branches, and less to 3° and 2° branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These results indicate that tagRFP::UtrCH, and by inference F-actin, localizes to extending branches. Conversely, an α-tubulin fusion (tagRFP::TBA-1) fusion that labels microtubules, specifically expressed in PVD neurons is primarily localized to axons and 1° dendrites of PVD neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maniar et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, microtubules and F-actin occupy non-overlapping compartments in dendrites.

Loss of <italic>hpo-30/Claudin</italic> increased, whereas overexpression of <italic>hpo-30/Claudin</italic> decreased membrane surface staining of the DMA-1/LRR-TM reporter, respectively. In addition, loss of <italic>hpo-30/Claudin</italic> also reduced the fraction of mobile vesicles containing the DMA-1::GFP reporter within the dendrite. Together, these findings suggest that HPO-30/Claudin promotes internalization and trafficking of the cell surface receptor DMA-1/LRR-TM. This conclusion is also consistent with a recent study demonstrating that HPO-30/Claudin negatively regulates the level of the synaptic cell adhesion protein NLG-1/Neuroligin at the cholinergic NMJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sharma et al., 2018</xref>). There are several, not mutually exclusive, explanations for the functional significance of DMA-1/LRR-TM regulation by HPO-30/Claudin. First, the surface expression of DMA-1/LRR-TM may have to be tightly regulated, because overexpression of surface DMA-1/LRR-TM could result in too strong or sustained binding to its cognate binding partners, the hypodermally expressed cell adhesion molecules SAX-7/L1CAM and MNR-1/Menorin. Secondly, recycling of DMA-1 may be required for DMA-1 to remain functional. For example, cell adhesion molecules, such as cadherins are constantly recycled and, blocking endocytosis results in dysfunctional cell adhesion phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cadwell et al., 2016</xref>). Alternatively, recycling of DMA-1/LRR-TM may be necessary for transporting DMA-1/LRR-TM to locations of particular demand, such as the tip of growing dendrites. Thirdly, the internalization of DMA-1/LRR-TM maybe part of the signal transduction itself, as internalization of surface receptors can be required to trigger signal transduction pathways occurring at a distance from the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sorkin and von Zastrow, 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>DMA-1/LRR-TM regulates 3° and 4° branch formation through distinct mechanisms</title><p>Several lines of evidence suggest that signaling downstream of the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor diverges into at least two molecularly distinct, partially redundant pathways to establish 2° and 3° branches and 4° branches, respectively. First, removing the PDZ ligand motif of DMA-1/LRR-TM results in a decrease in 4° branches but not 2° or 3° branches. Conversely, a GEF-only construct of TIAM-1/GEF, which lacks the PDZ domain, rescues the 3° branching defects, but not 4° branching defects of <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutant animals. Thus, compromising the PDZ-mediated interaction between TIAM-1/GEF and DMA-1/LRR-TM results in specific loss of 4° branching. Furthermore, immunoprecipitation assays strongly indicate that TIAM-1/GEF and DMA-1/LRR-TM can interact directly through the PDZ motif at the C-terminus of DMA-1 and the PDZ-binding domain of TIAM-1. Since <italic>tiam-1</italic> overexpression resulted in excessive branching, TIAM-1/GEF may promote branching in a dose-dependent manner. We propose that the PDZ interaction with DMA-1 recruits TIAM-1/GEF to specific subcellular locations, where a locally higher concentration of TIAM-1/GEF induces dendrite branching. Indeed, this is supported by the observation that TIAM-1::GFP fails to localize to 4° branches in DMA-1(ΔPDZ) animals. These findings are also consistent with a recent study, which also suggested that a TIAM-1::GFP reporter expressed in PVD is recruited to higher order dendritic branches by DMA-1/LRR-TM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Collectively, these findings suggest that the PDZ-mediated interaction of TIAM-1/GEF and DMA-1/LRR-TM interaction is required for normal 4° dendrite formation.</p><p>An intriguing finding is that transgenic expression of a TIAM-1(GEF-only) construct lacking the PDZ interaction domain can rescue both the formation of 2° and 3° PVD branches. Conversely, DMA-1/LRR-TM lacking the cytoplasmic domain was still capable of rescuing 2° and 3° branching number (but not extension), suggesting that protein interactions of the DMA-1 transmembrane or the extracellular domain, possibly in conjunction with TIAM-1/GEF may mediate an alternative parallel pathway. Indeed, imaging experiments and biochemical assays suggest that (1) DMA-1/LRR-TM colocalizes with the HPO-30/Claudin and that (2) both proteins can form a biochemical complex through an interaction independent of the cytoplasmic domain of DMA-1. Moreover, genetic double mutant analyses show that <italic>hpo-30</italic> double mutants with <italic>tiam-1</italic> or <italic>sax-7/L1CAM</italic> display enhanced phenotypes consistent with functions in parallel pathways. Previous studies have shown that mutating components of the WASP family verprolin-homologous protein (WVE-1/WAVE) regulatory complex (WRC) of actin regulators result in defects in PVD patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, HPO-30 can physically interact with the WRC and, compromising the molecular interactions between both DMA-1 and TIAM-1 and, between HPO-30 and the WRC at the same time result in synergistic defects consistent with the notion of parallel pathways downstream of the DMA-1 receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 2018</xref>). Zou <italic>et al.</italic> proposed that the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor, in conjunction with HPO-30/Claudin and TIAM-1/GEF recruit actin regulators to the membrane to form dendritic branches. Alternatively, and consistent with our observation that HPO-30 negatively regulates the surface localization of the DMA-1/LRR-TM reporter, recruitment of the WRC by HPO-30 may also serve a role in endocytosis of DMA-1::GFP, as the WRC is known to play a role in clathrin-mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mooren et al., 2012</xref>). In possible support of such a function, the <italic>act-4(dz222)</italic> allele results in more distal localization of DMA-1::GFP, including at the tip of growing dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The DMA-1/LRR-TM may shape 4° dendrites by directly regulating F-actin</title><p>F-actin clearly plays an important role in the formation of PVD dendritic branches. First, depolymerizing F-actin in vivo results in severe defects in PVD patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harterink et al., 2017</xref>). Second, F-actin is localized to the distal tips of developing PVD dendrites and appears mutually exclusive with microtubules. Third, we find that F-actin localization to distal dendrites depends on the presence of transmembrane receptors on PVD dendrites and their ligands. Lastly, RNAi-mediated gene knock down of other genes with possible or established roles as regulators of F-actin in developing axons such as <italic>unc-44/Ankyrin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Otsuka et al., 1995</xref>), <italic>unc-115/Ablim</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lundquist et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Struckhoff and Lundquist, 2003</xref>), or <italic>unc-70/β-spectrin</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hammarlund et al., 2000</xref>), display similar defects in PVD dendrite patterning as <italic>act-4/Actin</italic> and <italic>tiam-1/GEF</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguirre-Chen et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our experiments show that the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor is part of a biochemical complex with the TIAM-1/GEF and ACT-4/Actin. How could this complex mediate 4° dendrite growth or patterning? One possibility is that the DMA-1/TIAM-1/ACT-4 complex is part of a molecular clutch mechanism, first proposed as a means to explain actin-dependent cellular movements by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitchison and Kirschner (1988)</xref>. These authors suggested that the force generated by polymerizing F-actin is transmitted through engagement of F-actin filaments with the membrane through transmembrane receptors. For example, transmembrane receptors of the Ig domain superfamily have been shown to couple extracellular interactions to cytoskeletal actin dynamics (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Giannone et al. (2009)</xref>). In analogy, binding of the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor by the extracellular SAX-7/MNR-1/LECT-2 ligand complex could result in recruitment of TIAM-1/GEF, ACT-4/Actin and DMA-1/LRR-TM in a complex, thereby directly linking the receptor to the cytoskeleton. The interaction between TIAM-1/GEF and ACT-4/Actin is likely specific, because animals carrying the <italic>act-4(dz222)</italic> missense allele are viable without other obvious phenotypes. In support of the specificity of the <italic>dz222</italic> allele, it is worth noting that the exact same molecular change was identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al. (2018)</xref> in their screen for genes involved in PVD patterning. The phenotype of <italic>act-4(dz222)</italic> is in stark contrast to the embryonic lethality observed upon continuous RNAi-mediated knockdown of <italic>act-4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gottschalk et al., 2005</xref>, data not shown). Moreover, knock down of ACT-4/Actin by RNAi during larval stages on the one hand and, the G151E missense mutation in ACT-4/Actin encoded by the <italic>act-4(dz222)</italic> allele on the other hand result in similar phenotypes in PVD dendrites. In other words, loss of ACT-4 is as detrimental for dendrite patterning as the stronger biochemical interaction between TIAM-1 and ACT-4(G151E). This suggests that the interaction between TIAM-1 and ACT-4, and possibly DMA-1/LRR-TM has to be transient or dynamic. Alternatively, the strong interaction between ACT-4(G151E) and TIAM-1/GEF could sequester actin from the polymerizing pool. These findings are reminiscent of a point mutation in β-spectrin, which by increasing the affinity of β-spectrin with actin one thousand fold, results in defects in Drosophila dendrite arborization neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avery et al., 2017</xref>). Collectively, our studies and the findings by Zou et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zou et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that at least two partially redundant pathways act downstream of the DMA-1/LRR-TM receptor. In one pathway, DMA-1 interacts via HPO-30/Claudin with the WRC during patterning of lower order branches, whereas the interaction with TIAM-1/GEF may directly link the receptor complex with the actin cytoskeleton during 4° dendrite formation. Further experiments will be required to determine how these two pathways are spatially and temporally regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title><italic>TIAM-1/GEF</italic> functions independently of its Rac1 GEF activity</title><p>Guanine nucleotide exchange factors such as TIAM-1 activate small GTPases by promoting the exchange of GDP for GTP. Tiam1 in vertebrates has been shown to serve important functions during nervous system patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yoo et al., 2012</xref>). Knock down and overexpression experiments further established functions for Tiam1 in axon growth cone formation and, activity-dependent remodeling of dendritic arbors in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kunda et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tolias et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tolias et al., 2007</xref>). Such functions may be conserved, since the drosophila homolog <italic>still life/Tiam1</italic> and <italic>C. elegans TIAM-1/GEF</italic> function during synaptic and, axonal patterning downstream of the netrin receptor UNC-40/DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sone et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demarco et al., 2012</xref>). All known functions of Tiam1 appear dependent on the canonical enzymatic activity of exchanging GDP for GTP in small GTPases of the Rac1 type.</p><p>Unexpectedly, our findings imply that TIAM-1/GEF can function independently of its Rac1 GEF activity in shaping PVD dendrites. This conclusion is supported by three arguments. First, transgenic expression of a TIAM-1 (T548F) fully rescued the <italic>tiam-1</italic> mutant phenotype. Second, engineering the T548F point mutation into the <italic>tiam-1</italic> locus resulted in animals with PVD dendritic arbors that were indistinguishable from wild type animals. The T548F mutation is analogous to the S1216F mutation in UNC-73/Trio, which lacks Rac1 activity, but displays neuronal patterning defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steven et al., 1998</xref>). Moreover, the very mutation in <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIAM-1/GEF also shows no Rac1 GEF activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demarco et al., 2012</xref>). Lastly, single and double mutants of the small GTPases <italic>mig-2/RhoG</italic> and <italic>ced-10/Rac1</italic>, previously established as acting downstream of TIAM-1/GEF during axonal patterning in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demarco et al., 2012</xref>), displayed no defects PVD morphology. Similarly, a third Rac-like gene (<italic>rac-2/3</italic>) encoded in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> genome serves no function individually in PVD patterning. Taken together, these findings suggest that TIAM-1/GEF can function independently of Rac1 activity during PVD patterning. To our knowledge, there is only one other known example of GEF-independent functions of a guanine nucleotide exchange factor. The DOCK 180 family member DOCK7 functions during nuclear migration by antagonizing TACC3, a protein known to coordinate microtubule polymerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, GEF-independent functions that directly modulate the cytoskeleton may be an additional and, previously underappreciated property of guanine nucleotide exchange factors.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>All strains were maintained using standard conditions (unless stated otherwise).

Cells were not validated because they were merely used for heterologous protein expression. The identity of heterologously expressed proteins was verified in western blots via unique immunotags. Transient transfection was performed using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo-fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. For each experimental permutation, 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well were transfected in duplicate in six-well plates with 1 μg of each construct.</p><p>For co-immunoprecipitation assays, the duplicate wells of 10<sup>5</sup> transfected cells were lysed in 500 μl of lysis buffer and combined (25 mM Hepes, 150 NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, protease inhibitor cocktail (Thermo-Fisher)). The lysate was subsequently incubated at 4°C with agitation for an hour before centrifugation at 20,000 rcf for 10 min. The resulting lysate was combined with 20 µl of pre-equilibrated Protein A/G agarose (Thermo-fisher) and 1 µl of the appropriate antibody for pulldown and, incubated at 4°C with agitation overnight. The agarose was then washed 5 x with 500 µl of lysis buffer before SDS loading buffer was added. SDS-PAGE and western blot were then performed using standard protocols. All primary antibodies were used at 1:5000 dilutions and secondary antibodies were used at 1:10,000 dilutions. Supersignal West Femto ECL reagent (Thermo Fisher) was used for detection with X-ray films.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;TIAM-1/GEF can shape somatosensory dendrites independently of its GEF activity by regulating F-actin localization&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Shai Shaham, serving as guest Reviewing Editor, and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Benjamin Podbilewicz (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript by Tang et al. describes new interactions between the cytoplasmic machinery and membrane receptors required for the patterning of complex but stereotypic dendritic trees of the PVD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Previous work by different labs has shown that an adhesion complex between DMA-1/LRR-TM in the PVD, MNR-1/Menorin and SAX-7/LICAM in the hypodermis and LECT-2/chemotaxin II from muscles collectively target and pattern dendritic trees of the PVD in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. The signaling pathways downstream of DMA-1 in the dendrites are studied in the current manuscript. Tang et al. show that HPO-30/claudin-like tetraspan receptor forms a complex with DMA-1/LRR-TM that is necessary for its localization and functions in PVD dendrites. In addition, they show that DMA-1, HPO-30, TIAM-1/GEF and ACT-4/Actin interact forming a complex. The authors suggest that this is a signaling complex and that it is necessary for the exclusion of microtubules from distal endings as well as for the localization of microfilaments in the terminal branches of the PVD. They propose that DMA-1 regulates F-actin localization and dynamics via TIAM-1 and that this function appears to be independent of its RAC-1 GEF activity.</p><p>The paper reports a set of interesting and timely findings.

I am concerned that some of the colocalization is in intracellular transport vesicles and not on the plasma membrane of the dendrites and cell body. Is it possible that any PDZ domain will interact with both actin and DMA-1? It would be important to see that these interactions also occur in worms and that they are specific.

They could be in the same vesicular carriers. In contrast they may interact and colocalize at the plasma membrane of dendrites or cell body. To show direct in vivo interactions careful colocalization can be performed.

These results are impressive and informative. However, the authors also need to re-evaluate these results based on the following considerations.</p><p>1) Results for mutant effects on 2º branches are confusing. Figure 2E shows equal numbers of 2º branches in WT vs. mutants of hpo-30, tiam-1 and act-4. Representative images (Figure 2A-D), however, appear to show fewer, and in the case of hpo-30, much shorter lateral branches than WT. Previous reports have documented fewer 2º branches for hpo-30 (O'Brien et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2013) and act-4 (Zou et al., 2018). What are criteria for scoring 2º branches, any lateral protrusion or must a bona fide 2º branch reach the sublateral nerve cord?</p><p>2) (Regarding 2º branches). &quot;Double mutants between sax-7/L1CAM and hpo-30/Claudin were not more severe than the more severe of the single mutants, indicating that hpo-30/Claudin functions in the menorin pathway.&quot; This statement is confusing and subject to alternative explanations. Why not just say that the double mutant shows the hpo-30 phenotype (i.e., hpo-30 is epistatic) and that this means that sax-7 and hpo-30 both regulate lateral branching. Formally, hpo-30 could function either downstream of sax-7 for dendrite outgrowth or upstream since lateral branching, which hpo-30 promotes in the WT, is certainly necessary for expression of the sax-7 mutant hyperbranching phenotype.</p><p>3) (Subsection “The hpo-30/Claudin, tiam-1/GEF and act-4/Actin genes act in the menorin pathway”, first paragraph). Genetic evidence presented here for parallel roles for hpo-30 and sax-7 in higher order branching is not convincing. This finding is based on a double mutant which, according to authors, shows an enhanced 3º branch phenotype. It's hard to imagine how 3º branches could be scored accurately given the highly disordered appearance of PVD menorahs in sax-7 mutants (Dong et al., 2013; Salzberg et al., 2013). It should be sufficient to cite the finding that the hpo-30 lateral branching phenotype is more severe than that of sax-7 as evidence of an independent role for hpo-30.</p><p>4) (Subsection “The hpo-30/Claudin, tiam-1/GEF and act-4/Actin genes act in the menorin pathway”, first paragraph). Genetic results showing that dma-1 is epistatic to both hpo-30 and tiam-1 do indicate, as noted by the authors, that dma-1 is required for higher order branching. But why are results for tiam-1, act-4 double mutants also reported in this sentence? In fact, Figure 2 shows a much stronger 2º branch defect in tiam-1, act-4 doubles than for either single mutant which points to parallel roles in branching (see comment about null alleles and below). The authors do not comment on this point.</p><p>5) Comment on double mutant analysis (Figure 2). Are these null alleles? If not, then binary combinations of hypomorphic alleles that result in more severe phenotypes cannot distinguish between genes that function in common vs. parallel pathways.</p><p>6) (Subsection “The hpo-30/Claudin, tiam-1/GEF and act-4/Actin genes act in the menorin pathway”, second paragraph). Suppression of baobab tree phenotype is also subject to an alternative interpretation. MNR-1 is ectopically expressed in muscle to produce a PVD hyperbranching effect but this effect requires secondary branches to grow out to the sublateral location (body muscles) of the ectopic MNR-1 cue. This rarely happens in hpo-30 mutants, for example, and thus could account for hpo-30 epistasis in this case.</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>(Subsection “HPO-30/Claudin functions to localize DMA-1/LRR-TM”). (Figure 4A-C) Images of hpo-30 and dma-1 co-localization are not convincing. Higher resolution images are needed particularly of lateral branches where hpo-30 and dma-1 are proposed to function. For example, why not include high mag insets for the boxes shown in Figure 4B? How are puncta defined? Is the more severe branching phenotype for dma-1 than hpo-30 consistent with the observation here that hpo-30 is required for punctate localization of dma-1?</p><p>Comment about biochemical results (Figure 4, 7).

All of these data are now part of a completely revised/new Figure 4.</p><p>3) We have conducted additional binding experiments to determine the specificity of the PDZ ligand motif of DMA-1. Specifically, we have found that replacing the PDZ ligand motif of DMA1 with the PDZ motif of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan SDN-1/Syndecan has the same effect as removing the DMA-1 PDZ ligand motif entirely. These experiments establish that the interaction between the TIAM-1 PDZ domain and the DMA-1 ligand motif are specific, but suggest (as we had previously concluded) that other parts of DMA-1 must also play a role in binding.

In our revised version we have separately quantified vesicular and membrane localization of DMA-1::GFP where applicable and possible. These studies have actually revealed additional insight with regard to the interactions between DMA-1 and HPO30 (see below).</p><p>3) The reviewer raises the question of specificity for the PDZ domain interactions. We addressed this question by (a) testing TIAM-1::GFP localization in a DMA-1(δ PDZ) mutant (see above response to point 1). In addition, we have addressed specificity in vitro. Specifically, we have replaced the PDZ ligand motif in DMA-1 with the PDZ ligand motif of the heparan sulfate proteoglycan SDN-1/Syndecan. We can show that changing the last four amino acids of DMA1 reduces the TIAM-1/DMA-1 interaction in Co-IPs to the same extent as removing the PDZ ligand motif in DMA-1 completely. These findings suggest that the TIAM-1/DMA-1 interaction via the PDZ ligand motif and the PDZ binding domain is specific. These data are now included at Figure 5—figure supplement 2A.</p><p>4) The reviewer suggests live imaging and separation into vesicular and plasma membrane fractions.

Figure 2E shows equal numbers of 2º branches in WT vs. mutants of hpo-30, tiam-1 and act-4.

Previous reports have documented fewer 2º branches for hpo-30 (O'Brien et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2013) and act-4 (Zou et al., 2018). What are criteria for scoring 2º branches, any lateral protrusion or must a bona fide 2º branch reach the sublateral nerve cord?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises important points regarding slight discrepancies between our data and published data, which can also be observed in the published record, both in studies from different labs, but also the same lab. For example, as the reviewer mentions, O’Brien and Smith note less 2º branches in hpo-30 mutants, but with different absolute numbers. Smith et al., 2013 find an average of around 20 2º branches per hpo-30 mutant animal, whereas O’Brien et al., 2017 find 25 (or more) 2º branches on average per hpo-30 mutant animal. In contrast, Zou et al. and we see more (although at least in our case the difference is not significant) 2º branches in hpo-30 animals. There may be at least three reasons for these slight discrepancies between and within labs.</p><p>1) The definition of what constitutes a 2º branch (as the reviewer suggests). O’Brien and Smith et al., 2013 score all 2º along the whole animal. In contrast, we score any protrusion from the 1º in a 100µm segment anterior to the cell body as a 2º branch as does Zou et al., 2018, although it is not clear what constitutes a 2º branch in their case. Interestingly, Zou et al., 2018 also find a slight (but not statistically investigated) increase for 2º dendrites for hpo-30 mutants, just like we do, but in contrast to O’Brien et al. and Smith et al. This is most likely because of the difference in scoring criteria. A possible biological explanation could be a role for of hpo-30 in trafficking that we discovered, which may affect branches more distal from the cell body more than branches closer to the cell body.</p><p>2) Statistics. For example, we find a decrease for 2º branches in act-4 mutants, which is not significant in our case, but is for Zou et al., 2018. A possible explanation is that in our data set we make over 170 statistical comparisons (between the genotypes in Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 2), which requires substantial corrections for multiple comparisons. While our analyses may thus miss smaller differences, we can be fairly confident in any larger differences we observe. All conclusions we make in the paper are based on highly significant differences.</p><p>3) Systematic error. In our experiments we find that between experimenters, there can be slight differences, for example due to slight differences in staging or scoring. This phenomenon is, however, not limited to our lab, but also apparent in the published literature (see for example the slight differences between O’Brien et al., 2017 and Smith et al., 2013 mentioned above). We believe that as long as the same experimenter completes an experiment, the systematic error should be consistent and so should be the conclusions. In our revised version, the complete morphometric data from Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 5 was obtained by different individuals, respectively. While there are slight differences in absolute numbers for different branches the conclusions we draw are unambiguous.</p><p>In conclusion, to address the issues mentioned above as much as possible, we have (1) only data from one experimenter per experiment/figure and (2) describe as precisely as possible in the Materials and methods sections how the animals were staged and scored.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) (Regarding 2º branches). &quot;Double mutants between sax-7/L1CAM and hpo-30/Claudin were not more severe than the more severe of the single mutants, indicating that hpo-30/Claudin functions in the menorin pathway.&quot; This statement is confusing and subject to alternative explanations.

This finding is based on a double mutant which, according to authors, shows an enhanced 3º branch phenotype.

The difference in Figure 2F between a sax-7; hpo-30 double and the sax-7 and hpo-30 single mutants, respectively, is not subtle. In the double mutant there are essentially no 3º branches left.
