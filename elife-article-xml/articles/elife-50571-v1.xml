Despite unique and often contradictory roles played by Src-family-kinases (SFKs) in regulating cell physiology, activity patterns of individual SFKs have remained elusive. Here, we report a biosensor for specifically visualizing active conformation of SFK-Fyn in live cells. We deployed combinatorial library screening to isolate a binding-protein (F29) targeting activated Fyn. Nuclear-magnetic-resonance (NMR) analysis provides the structural basis of F29 specificity for Fyn over homologous SFKs. Using F29, we engineered a sensitive, minimally-perturbing fluorescence-resonance-energy-transfer (FRET) biosensor (<italic>FynSensor</italic>) that reveals cellular Fyn activity to be spatially localized, pulsatile and sensitive to adhesion/integrin signaling. Strikingly, growth factor stimulation further enhanced Fyn activity in pre-activated intracellular zones. However, inhibition of focal-adhesion-kinase activity not only attenuates Fyn activity, but abolishes growth-factor modulation. <italic>FynSensor</italic> imaging uncovers spatially organized, sensitized signaling clusters, direct crosstalk between integrin and growth-factor-signaling, and clarifies how compartmentalized Src-kinase activity may drive cell fate.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells contain networks of signaling proteins that can respond to a variety of cues from the surrounding environment. Often the cell’s response to these cues is not just controlled by the level of protein, but by changing the activity of signaling proteins. For example, a signaling protein in humans and other mammals known as Fyn regulates a number of different processes, including when a cell grows, dies, or develops a specialist role.</p><p>Defects in the activity of Fyn are associated with several diseases in humans including cancer and Alzheimer’s disease. However, it remains unclear how Fyn contributes to these diseases, or how the protein is able to precisely coordinate responses to multiple different cues in healthy individuals. This is largely because there are no readily available tools that are able to specifically detect where and when this protein is active in cells.</p><p>Researchers often use fluorescent proteins called biosensors as tools to detect where specific proteins are located in living cells over time. Now, Mukherjee, Singh et al. have developed a new biosensor named FynSensor to monitor the active form of Fyn in mammalian cells.</p><p>Microscopy imaging of FynSensor in several different cell types showed that although Fyn was present everywhere, it was only active in certain areas. In these areas the protein switched between an active and inactive state, with clear ‘pulses’ of signaling activity lasting a couple of minutes in response to specific cues. These areas of high Fyn activity behaved like signaling hubs in which several different cues integrate together before Fyn triggers an appropriate cell response.</p><p>These results shed light on how Fyn is able to precisely control many different processes in cells. In the future, <italic>FynSensor</italic> could be used to rapidly screen for drug-like molecules to treat cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and other conditions linked with defects in Fyn activity. Furthermore, the <italic>FynSensor</italic> could be adapted to allow researchers to study other signaling proteins in humans and other animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biosensor</kwd><kwd>Fyn kinase</kwd><kwd>FRET</kwd><kwd>src kinases</kwd><kwd>compartmentalized</kwd><kwd>pulsatile</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JRF-SRF Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Ananya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBT-RA Program in Biotechnology and Life Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Singh</surname><given-names>Randhir</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant BT/PR8071/MED/32/290/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gulyani</surname><given-names>Akash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/IN/BMBF/03/AG/2015-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gulyani</surname><given-names>Akash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BT/IN/Denmark/07/RSM/2015-2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gulyani</surname><given-names>Akash</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Unique biosensor design and protein-engineering enables direct visualization of the active form of Fyn kinase with high specificity, minimal perturbation and shows cellular signaling to be compartmentalized and pulsatile.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Regulation of cell fate and behavior is achieved through complex and interconnected signaling networks acting in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Devreotes et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>). For precise signaling, activities of key signaling proteins are tightly compartmentalized in the cell, both spatially and temporally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Depry et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>). Especially important to cellular controls are signaling nodes that function downstream of multiple receptor classes and help in signal integration. Src family kinases (SFKs) are such key signaling nodes; activated by cell adhesion receptors, integrins, receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs, including growth factor receptors) and Gprotein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abram and Courtneidge, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Giannone and Sheetz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Grande-García et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Parsons and Parsons, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Thomas and Brugge, 1997</xref>). Src-kinases critically influence cell fate; regulating cell shape, migration and adhesion, survival and growth, stemness and differentiation making them important therapeutic targets in multiple diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chetty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gujral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lewis-Tuffin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nygaard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Saad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Timpson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Despite their importance, intracellular activity patterns of individual Src family kinases with spatial and temporal precision are still unclear. Visualization of active kinases in cells is essential to understand how Src kinases integrate signals and regulate multiple, and sometimes opposing processes, with fidelity and precision.</p><p>Currently available fluorescent SFK sensors have severe limitations. Most available biosensors, especially genetically encoded ones, do not directly report the intracellular distribution of active kinases since they rely on detecting the phosphorylation of a ‘pseudosubstrate’ peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Liao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ouyang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ouyang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Seong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Wang et al., 2005</xref>). As a result, biosensor readout – extent of phosphorylation of ‘sensor’ peptides – can be affected by the activities of kinases as well as cellular phosphatases. Confounding readouts further, it has been reported that sensors can get trapped in an ‘ON’ state owing to strong intramolecular interactions between phosphorylated substrate peptides and their respective recognition motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Komatsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Regot et al., 2014</xref>); and therefore are unable to report the turning OFF of kinase activity. Another major drawback of current sensors is that multiple kinases, especially closely related ones, can phosphorylate these substrate-based sensors in a promiscuous manner leading to a lack of specificity.</p><p>Study of SFK activity is especially complicated by the presence of multiple closely related Src family members, including three ubiquitously expressed kinases c-Src, c-Yes and Fyn. While there is some functional redundancy, individual SFKs also perform critical, exclusive roles in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lowe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lowell and Soriano, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marchetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Molina et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Palacios-Moreno et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, despite decades of study, it is not always clear which kinase(s) is activated in a given cellular context? In this regard, fluorescent biosensors that report the activation of individual Src kinases in live cells would be extremely valuable in clarifying kinase activity and function. However, such specific biosensors for individual Src kinases are still limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Koudelková et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Paster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stirnweiss et al., 2013</xref>), with current sensors generally giving only a pan-SFK readout with limited spatial and temporal resolution.</p><p>Here, we present a fluorescent biosensor specific for the SFK-Fyn. Fyn, is ubiquitously expressed and regulates cell migration, epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT), cancer metastasis, immune-response, axonal guidance and patterning, and synaptic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gujral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Du et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lewin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Meriane et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Posadas et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Salter and Kalia, 2004</xref>). Interestingly, among several SFKs implicated, recent evidence shows Fyn may specifically control EMT and metastatic progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gujral et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, Fyn is a critical player in multiple cell/tissue types, integrating signaling through multiple receptor classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Palacios-Moreno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Martín-Ávila et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Yadav and Denning, 2011</xref>) and controlling cell fate. However, there is currently no tool, including specific antibodies, to visualize Fyn activity in cells. As a consequence, there is no information on intracellular Fyn dynamics in live cells. A Fyn biosensor would bridge this gap and offer a method to address Fyn functional complexity as a key signaling node.</p><p>Generation of biosensors is often limited by a lack of naturally available binders that can detect active states of proteins in real-time. To address this, we have developed a strategy of using artificially engineered binders that recognize the active form of target proteins in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>). Like other SFKs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boggon and Eck, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kinoshita et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Noble et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sicheri and Kuriyan, 1997</xref>), Fyn is maintained in an inactive or closed form through multiple intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Thomas and Brugge, 1997</xref>). Activation of the kinase involves disruption of these interactions leading to an open conformation, with more exposed surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Young et al., 2001</xref>). Taking advantage of this, we screened a combinatorial protein library to isolate a binding protein (F29) that specifically binds to a region of Fyn (SH3 domain) that is more exposed in the open conformation. For screening, we chose a library generated by mutagenizing the Sso7d protein - a highly stable protein derived from the hyperthermophilic archaeon <italic>Sulfolobus solfataricus</italic>. We have previously shown that Sso7d mutant-libraries can be used to isolate binding proteins for a wide range of targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gera et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gocha et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hussain et al., 2013</xref>). Also, since Sso7d has no known interactions with mammalian intracellular proteins, we reasoned that Sso7d would serve as an ideal ‘inert’ scaffold for generating an intracellular biosensor. Our analysis shows that F29 indeed binds specifically to Fyn, with little to no cross-reactivity with other SFKs. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy analysis of F29 in complex with the target reveals the structural basis of the specificity of F29 binding to Fyn.</p><p>An efficient readout of the molecular recognition of the target by the binding protein is central to constructing an effective biosensor. Here, we used our new binder/F29 to construct a genetically encoded Fyn biosensor (<italic>FynSensor</italic>) based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). <italic>FynSensor</italic> is robust, sensitive and faithfully reports Fyn activation and regulation. We also show how <italic>FynSensor</italic> expression in cells is minimally perturbing, with no measurable changes in either cellular morphodynamics or downstream signaling. Significantly, <italic>FynSensor</italic> enables direct visualization of active Fyn in live cells, revealing Fyn activation to be spatially compartmentalized, polarized and pulsatile. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported visualization of activated Fyn in live cells; notably, unavailability of suitable antibodies currently precludes even routine detection of active Fyn. Strikingly, <italic>FynSensor</italic> imaging shows the presence of spatially localized signaling clusters sensitive to integrin and growth factor signaling; and reveals how growth factor response in cells is influenced by integrin-dependent protein activity. More broadly, <italic>FynSensor</italic> shows how spatially compartmentalized activation of key signaling proteins may lead to efficient signal integration and precise control of cell physiology. Further, our results provide a framework for systematic development of intracellular biosensors for specific Src-family and other kinases in general.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Screening yields binder specific for active Fyn</title><p>Specifically recognizing active Fyn is critical for constructing an intracellular sensor. Activation of SFKs is accompanied by large conformational changes; the active kinase adopts a more open conformation with significantly reduced intramolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Thomas and Brugge, 1997</xref>). Specifically, prior evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Young et al., 2001</xref>) suggests that the SH3 domain in SFKs is more accessible in the active conformation relative to the closed, inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Therefore, a binding protein targeting the SH3 domain of Fyn can be expected to preferentially bind the active form of the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>). Such an active state binder can then be engineered as a fluorescent biosensor for reporting intracellular Fyn activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Accordingly, we sought to generate a binding protein specific for Fyn SH3 domain. To this end, we screened a yeast surface display library of Sso7d mutants (library generated by randomizing ten Sso7d residues), using magnetic screening and fluorescence associated cell sorting (FACS), adapting methods described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gera et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gera et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Stringent negative selection steps were included to eliminate binders that exhibited cross-reactivity to the SH3 domains of seven other SFKs, specifically c-Src, c-Yes, Fgr, Blk, Lck, Lyn, and Hck. The pool of yeast cells obtained after magnetic selection were further subjected to multiple rounds of FACS to enrich Fyn SH3-binding yeast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Single clones were then picked and assessed for specific binding to Fyn-SH3. One such clone (referred to as F29 hereafter) showed specific binding to Fyn-SH3 domain, with little or no cross-reactivity with SH3 domains from the other highly homologous SFKs mentioned above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In this vector, Sso7d variants are flanked by HA tag and c-myc tag. Upon galactose induction, the Sso7d scaffold is expressed on the yeast surface as a fusion complex of Aga1p and Aga2p proteins along with HA and c-myc tags making it accessible for interaction with biotinylated target. The interaction of target and scaffold can be detected using immunofluorescence with Strep–PE (to detect biotinylated target) and a secondary antibody conjugated Alexa-Fluor 633 (for anti-c-myc antibody). The Alexa-Fluor 633 fluorescence corresponds to the full-length scaffold being expressed on the yeast cell surface, while the PE fluorescence intensity corresponds to the target SH3 domain presence.

The buried surface area of F29:Fyn SH3 complex is much larger (800 Å<sup>2</sup>, ∆G = −7 kcal/mol) compared to that of the poly-Pro:Fyn SH3 complex (pdb: 3UA7, 330 Å<sup>2</sup>, ∆G = −5 kcal/mol). The number of contacts is also considerably larger in the F29 (84 contacts) versus the poly-Proline (40 contacts). Moreover, the orientation of the poly-Prolines at the interface differs from the orientation of the F29 interfacial beta-sheet by ~30<sup>o</sup>. Hence, although the F29 interface overlaps with the poly-Proline interface, it is significantly distinct in terms of contacts, surface area and orientation. Residues of Fyn-SH3 that are involved in binding F29 as well as Poly-Pro-1/2 polypeptides are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>.</p><p>We then used site-directed mutagenesis to examine contributions of key interfacial residues to F29-Fyn SH3 binding. A salt bridge between the residue R33 of F29 and D99 of Fyn SH3 appears prominent. Indeed, the introduction of an R33A mutation in F29 resulted in reduced binding to Fyn-SH3 domain, as evidenced by pull-down analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2s3sdata1">Figure 2—figure supplement 3—source data 1</xref>). These results confirm that R33 in F29 and D99 in Fyn-SH3 contribute substantially to the F29-Fyn-SH3 binding interaction. Interestingly, a Pro41Ala mutant of F29 also showed reduced binding to Fyn-SH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Although the NMR analyses do not show Pro41 to form direct interfacial contacts with SH3, the reduced binding of this mutant may be attributed to perturbation of local structure. Proline41 forms a critical hinge preceding β3 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>); mutation of the proline likely disrupts the structure the β-sheet that contains multiple key binding contacts with Fyn-SH3.</p><p>These structural analyses also offer insight into the molecular basis for the specificity of F29 binding to Fyn-SH3 over highly homologous SH3 domains of other SFKs. While the binding interface in the Fyn-SH3-F29 complex reveals multiple interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>), the residue D99 in Fyn-SH3 that forms a salt bridge with R33 of F29 is unique to Fyn among the ubiquitously expressed SFKs as well as Lyn and Fgr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that D99 in Fyn-SH3 may contribute to the binding specificity of F29 for Fyn-SH3 vis-à-vis to at least some of the SFK SH3 domains. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant version of the SH3 domain from Src (Src-SH3) wherein the native threonine was replaced with aspartic acid (T99D). Strikingly, T99D Src-SH3, but not wild-type Src-SH3, showed detectable binding to F29 in pulldown assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These results suggest that D99 in Fyn-SH3 contributes to the binding specificity of F29 for Fyn over other SFKs, notably Src. Nevertheless, specificity of F29 for Fyn-SH3 over Yes-SH3 (containing E99) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>) and Lyn/Fgr (containing D99, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggests that binding specificity results from a unique combination of multiple interactions at the binding interface that may require further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>F29 enables construction of <italic>FynSensor</italic>, a FRET biosensor for active Fyn</title><p>F29 efficiently and specifically binds Fyn SH3 in vitro.

In the cell, F29 binder (FRET-acceptor) would bind the exposed SH3 domain of active Fyn (FRET donor), resulting in an intermolecular FRET between donor and acceptor fluorophores (<italic>bottom panel</italic>). In contrast, F29 would be expected to show significantly lower binding and reduced or no FRET when Fyn is inactive (<italic>upper panel</italic>). (<bold>D</bold>) Sensing active Fyn in cells through binding-dependent FRET. Fluorescence spectral measurements from HEK-293T cells co-transfected with FRET-donor (WT or CA Fyn-mCerulean) alone OR along with a FRET-acceptor (either Fyn binder mVenus-F29 or the non-binding mutant, mVenus-F29P41A). Specifically, the normalized emission spectra of transiently transfected cells when excited at 435 nm (corresponding to donor mCerulean excitation) are shown. Spectra has been normalized relative to emission intensity at 475 nm (corresponding to mCerulean emission). Overall, the spectra show that FRET (‘sensitized’ acceptor emission at 525 nm) is greater for CA Fyn as compared to WT Fyn. No FRET signal is observed (sensitized 525 nm emission) with donor alone or non-binding mutant F29-P41A. <italic>Left inset figure</italic> shows that binding and increase in FRET efficiency is saturable. Using raw fluorescent intensity values the FRET efficiency was calculated as per the equation Fa/(Fa+Fd), where Fa is acceptor and Fd is donor raw fluorescence intensity, respectively. Increasing the amount of labeled binder (mVenus-F29/acceptor) in cells while maintaining constant Fyn (donor) levels causes an increase in FRET till saturation is reached (blue closed squares), indicating binding dependent FRET. From three independent experiments (n=3) , a nonlinear best fit was plotted (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.97) using GraphPad Prism (blue, dotted line). In contrast, acceptor-labeled non-binder control (F29 P41A mutant) shows little or no FRET (orange open symbol) showing FRET response is binding dependent and specific. <italic>Right inset figure</italic> shows a bar plot of FRET efficiency comparing WT and CA Fyn for a 1:2 donor:acceptor molar ratio. From three such independent experiments (n=3) , data was compared using Student’s unpaired one-tailed t-test on GraphPad Prism. Values are mean ± s.e.m. (<bold>E</bold>) Membrane tagging of F29 increases biosensor sensitivity and FRET efficiency (calculated as above). (I) The emission spectra of cells co-transfected with Fyn (WT) and, either mVenus-F29 or myr-mVenus-F29 at a 1:4 donor:acceptor molar ratio on 435 nm excitation are shown. Spectra for corresponding non-binding controls (mVenus-F29P41A with and without myristoyl tags) are also shown. (II) Box-and-Whisker plot showing observed FRET efficiency (calculated as above) in cells when myristoyl-tag is added to the FRET-acceptor (mVenus-F29) or its non-binding control mutant P41A.

The mid-line marks the median. Plus symbol (+) represents the mean FRET efficiency.

This mutagenesis method was performed using Phusion high-fidelity DNA Polymerase (NEB) for mutagenic-primer directed replication of both parental plasmid strands. The primers, each complementary to opposite strands of the vector, were extended during temperature cycling by DNA polymerase, without primer displacement. Extended primers typically generated a mutated plasmid containing staggered nicks.

(<bold>B</bold>) Overlapping PCR - In order to join two genes or DNA fragments X and Y by PCR, the pair of primers FPX-RPX and FPY and RPY were designed. The primers RPX and FPY typically had overlapping regions with each other. The genes X and Y were amplified and gel eluted from given template using these primers. In the next PCR cycle, these eluted PCR X and Y products were taken (equimolar DNA) as template along with FPX and RPY primers and amplification performed. (<bold>C</bold>) Overlap extension PCR- This method was used to clone an insert into a plasmid without restriction endonucleases or T4 DNA ligase treatment. The method was similar to ‘Quick change’ mutagenesis, except here we used PCR amplified inserts of interest as large primers.

Accordingly, we conceptualized a biosensor design based on FRET wherein the binding of F29 to active Fyn would result in an increase in FRET between suitably placed donor and acceptor fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To construct a genetically encoded biosensor, Fyn was labeled with a FRET donor fluorescent protein (mCerulean) while F29 was tagged with a FRET acceptor protein (mVenus). While F29 already shows high specificity to Fyn, our design further ensures that FRET signal can arise only from labeled F29 binding to labeled active Fyn. For generating the fluorescently labeled Fyn, we chose to introduce mCerulean (FRET donor) between the unique (UD) and the SH3 domains of full-length Fyn kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Paster et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Stirnweiss et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The choice of this insertion position is designed to increase the probability of efficient FRET when acceptor-labeled F29 binds the exposed SH3 domain in active Fyn. Another critical design consideration was to minimize any perturbation caused due to mCerulean insertion into Fyn. To this end, we selected a flexible poly-(glycine-serine) peptide linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Trinh et al., 2004</xref>) to insert mCerulean within Fyn (also see Materials and method and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for details on molecular engineering). We then examined the suitability of the designed biosensor constructs for cellular imaging. Immunoblotting analysis on cell lysates showed robust intracellular expression of full-length mCerulean-Fyn fusion proteins (hereby referred to as ‘mCer-Fyn’), confirming that the fusion proteins remain intact and resistant to proteolysis in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–I</xref>). Further, mCer-Fyn fusions expressed in cells showed expected fluorescence; with spectra from cells closely resembling unmodified mCerulean (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Additionally, the mVenus-F29 fusion biosensor protein also expressed well, was resistant to proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>) and showed the expected fluorescent signatures resembling unmodified mVenus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Importantly, we then tested if labeled Fyn kinase retains activity and is regulated appropriately. Src family kinases possess autocatalytic activity; a tyrosine residue (Y420 in h-Fyn) in the activation loop is phosphorylated when the protein gets activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cooper and MacAuley, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barker et al., 1995</xref>). Significantly, immunoblot analysis showed that mCer-Fyn retains autocatalytic activity similar to the wild-type unmodified protein in cells. Further quantification of Fyn Y-420 autophosphorylation levels, show no significant differences between mCer-Fyn and unlabeled wt-Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s2sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). Importantly, these data show that mCerulean insertion is minimally disruptive to kinase activity and that the engineered kinase appears to be regulated similar to unmodified Fyn.</p><p>To further test if our Fyn fusion (mCer-Fyn) is functional and can accurately reflect cellular Fyn dynamics, we examined if mCer-Fyn can modulate downstream signaling and functionally replace endogenous, wild-type Fyn. For this we carefully assayed Fyn effects on downstream signaling, as measured through extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK) phosphorylation and performed Fyn knockdown rescue in cells, comparing both unlabeled as well as Fyn-fusion (mCer-Fyn) constructs. We first established that RNA-i leads to a specific knockdown of cellular Fyn protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4A</xref>) but not the closely related Src and Yes kinases in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s4sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 4—source data 1</xref>). This Fyn knockdown significantly attenuates the levels of ERK phosphorylation in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s5sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 5—source data 1</xref>). This is consistent with earlier reports documenting Fyn’s role in modulating ERK activity and downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wary et al., 1998</xref>). Notably, expressing either mCer-Fyn or wt, unlabeled Fyn in ‘Fyn-knockdown’ cells significantly rescues this reduction in ERK phosphorylation. Further, the extent of increase in this ERK phosphorylation, mediated through ectopic Fyn expression in ‘Fyn-knockdown’ cells, was observed to be the same for wild-type, unlabeled Fyn as well as mCer-Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s2sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 2—source data 1</xref>). These results unequivocally demonstrate that our labeled Fyn (mCer-Fyn) is regulated appropriately, ‘signaling competent’ and can functionally replace native, untagged Fyn; thereby making it suitable for faithfully reporting cellular Fyn dynamics.</p><p>Biosensor variants were then tested for efficacy in reporting intracellular Fyn activity. For this, we expressed biosensor constructs in HEK-293T cells and recorded fluorescence spectra from live cells (<italic>see</italic> Materials and methods). When cells co-expressing FRET donor (mCer-Fyn) and FRET acceptor (mVenus-F29) were excited at 435 nm (mCerulean/donor excitation), emission peaks were seen at ~475 nm (mCerulean) as well as at ~525 nm corresponding to the peak emission wavelength of the acceptor fluorophore (mVenus) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Appearance of acceptor emission (mVenus,~525 nm) on donor excitation (435 nm) clearly shows that FRET occurs between mCer-Fyn and mVenus-F29. This confirms that mVenus-F29 can recognize intracellular Fyn in live cells and this recognition can be reported through a robust FRET signature. We then tested if this FRET signal is sensitive to the relative stoichiometry of the target (Fyn) and the binder F29 as would be expected with a binding-induced FRET. Indeed, increasing the amount of intracellular mVenus-F29 while maintaining constant expression of mCer-Fyn, led to a concomitant increase in FRET signal, followed by saturation of this FRET increase. Here, the saturation in FRET signal suggests that even increasing concentrations of F29 binder in cells does not cause an inadvertent or artefactual activation of Fyn kinase, especially since F29 binder expression in cells does not lead to any measurable changes in autocatalytic activity of Fyn (Y-420 autophosphorylation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s6sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 6—source data 1</xref>). Importantly, the FRET signal in cells is specific and dependent on mVenus-F29 binding to mCer-Fyn, since making a single point mutation in F29 abolishes the FRET response. If the non-binding variant of F29 (mVenus-F29-P41A) is co-expressed with mCer-Fyn in cells, little or no FRET is seen, even at higher concentrations of the non-binding control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> left inset, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). Further, the FRET signal was higher in cells co-expressing mVenus-F29 and constitutively active Fyn, relative to wild-type Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> right inset, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). This shows that F29 binding and biosensor readout (FRET response) is indeed sensitive to the activation status of Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p><p>Fyn kinase has two acylation marks (a myristoyl and a palmitoyl group) that make it preferentially localized to the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">van't Hof and Resh, 1999</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that localization of F29 to the cell membrane would increase its proximity to membrane-bound Fyn, resulting in an increase in FRET signal and consequently greater dynamic range of the biosensor. To test this hypothesis, we added a myristoylation(‘myr’) sequence (MGSSKSKPKDPS) to the F29 binder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Victor and Cafiso, 1998</xref>). Indeed, addition of a myristoylation signal led to a substantial increase in FRET signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata4">Figure 3—source data 4</xref>). To further test the fidelity of this enhanced FRET response observed with myristoylated-F29, we tested the non-binding variant (P41A) of the myr-mVenus-F29 binder. Notably, myristoylated non-binding mVenus-F29 P41A showed little or no FRET signal when co-expressed with mCer-Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Taken together, these results clearly show that the FRET signal observed with the F29-based Fyn biosensor is indeed due to specific binding of F29 to the active form of Fyn, and not just due to non-specific membrane localization and incidental proximity. The biosensor constructs –mCer-Fyn and myr-mVenus-F29 (referred to as binder) – are collectively referred to as <italic>FynSensor</italic> hereafter.</p><p>Src family kinases, including Fyn are known to strongly regulate cell adhesion as well as the cytoskeleton. Several SFK substrates and interacting partners are reported to be actin binding proteins, regulators of Rho family GTPases and other proteins that help remodel and regulate the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Ridley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Etienne-Manneville and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Huveneers and Danen, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Roca-Cusachs et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore reasoned that measuring the cell morphodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Gulyani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hodgson et al., 2016</xref>) would be a sensitive way to examine if moderate-to-low expression of labeled Fyn and the F29 binder significantly and measurably perturb the cell. First, the expression levels of <italic>FynSensor</italic> constructs labeled Fyn (mCer-Fyn) as well as mVenus-F29 were quantified in U2OS cells to ensure that the binder expression causes no artefactual activation of Fyn kinase (levels of pTyr416/total Fyn; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). We then quantitatively examined temporal changes in cell area and perimeter of cells expressing either <italic>FynSensor (mCer-Fyn:myr-mVenus-F29</italic>, DNA ratio 1:2, also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) or the binder alone or a control construct (myr-tagged-mVenus) in the adherent osteosarcoma U2OS cells at the expression levels specified. We find no significant change in cellular morphodynamics as a result of <italic>FynSensor</italic> expression the binder alone as compared to controls cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s7sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 7—source data 1</xref>). We further confirmed that the expression of Fyn-binder does not perturb the overall intracellular localization of labeled Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s8">Figure 3—figure supplements 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s9sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 9—source data 1</xref>). Immunofluorescence data also shows that labelled Fyn (mCer-Fyn) localization is similar to endogenous Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s9">Figure 3—figure supplement 9A</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>FynSensor</italic> and F29 expression had no effect on cell morphodynamics and Fyn localization, we also examined if <italic>FynSensor</italic> expression significantly perturbs downstream signaling. For this, we again used the extent of ERK phosphorylation as a sensitive readout of Fyn signaling. We find that neither expression of <italic>FynSensor</italic> nor binder alone in adherent osteosarcoma U2OS cells under the conditions used has any measurable effect on ERK phosphorylation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s10">Figure 3—figure supplement 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s10sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 10—source data 1</xref>). Similarly, expression of <italic>FynSensor</italic> constructs (labeled Fyn + binder) in C2C12 mouse myoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">Figure 3—figure supplement 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s11sdata1">Figure 3—figure supplement 11—source data 1</xref>) or Fyn-knockdown HEK-293 cells did not significantly change levels of p-ERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). These data collectively show that <italic>FynSensor</italic> expression under these specified conditions does not significantly perturb downstream signaling. In light of these data showing little or no cellular perturbation, we have used the same <italic>FynSensor</italic> expression conditions for all further biosensor imaging studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>FynSensor</italic> reports localized active Fyn in live cells</title><p>Our results show that <italic>FynSensor</italic> produces a FRET signal upon specific binding of F29 to Fyn-SH3, resulting in a sensitive readout of active intracellular Fyn. We further evaluated <italic>FynSensor</italic> for its ability to report spatial patterns of active Fyn in single, living cells. To investigate the spatial FRET response generated by <italic>FynSensor</italic>, we first employed the ‘fluorescence recovery after acceptor photobleaching (APB)’ method. APB analysis is a robust method of confirming and quantifying FRET in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Karpova and McNally, 2006</xref>), where recovery of donor fluorescence on APB is seen as a strong indicator of proximity-induced FRET. Energy transfer from the donor to the acceptor molecules results in quenching of donor fluorescence, and this quenching is relieved when proximal acceptor molecules undergo photobleaching. Indeed, when adherent osteosarcoma U2OS cells expressing <italic>FynSensor</italic> were illuminated with increasing doses of 514 nm laser light (wavelength corresponding to acceptor absorption; mVenus photobleaching), we observed a substantial, dose-dependent recovery of donor (mCerulean) fluorescence. This confirms FRET between mCer-Fyn and mVenus-F29. Significantly, APB-induced recovery of donor fluorescence was greater at cell edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), suggesting spatial variation in Fyn activity. Notably, in control cells expressing a mutant form of labeled-F29 (P41A), acceptor photobleaching showed no such dose-dependent recovery of donor fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>). Since the P41A mutant lacks the ability to bind Fyn-SH3, these data show that APB-induced recovery of donor fluorescence and the FRET response are due to F29 binding to target and not due to incidental proximity or optical artifacts. Finally, when cells were treated with a known pharmacological inhibitor of Src family kinase including Fyn, SU6656 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blake et al., 2000</xref>), we observed a significant reduction in the amount of donor fluorescence being recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4s1sdata1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1—source data 1</xref>). This reduction in FRET (F29 binding to Fyn) on inhibitor treatment is interesting and points to allosteric changes in Fyn conformation on inhibitor binding. While ATP-competitive inhibitors like SU6656 directly bind the catalytic domain, they can also stabilize an inactive conformation of Src family kinases and modulate the accessibility of its key regulatory domains to ligands/binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Krishnamurty et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, our data (reduced <italic>FynSensor</italic> FRET) suggests that indeed Fyn likely adopts a closed conformation in response to inhibitor treatment, thereby reducing SH3 domain accessibility/binding to F29. The sensitivity of <italic>FynSensor</italic> FRET to inhibitor binding in fact suggests that the labeled kinase shows allosteric conformational changes similar to those seen with untagged SFKs, further indicating that the biosensor faithfully reports Fyn conformational dynamics. Taken together, these results further confirm that the <italic>FynSensor</italic> readout is the result of specific binding of F29 binding to Fyn-SH3, and selectively reports the active form of Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The <italic>FynSensor</italic> readout also shows hitherto uncharacterized spatial patterns in intracellular active Fyn in live cells, with greater Fyn activity closer to the cell edge.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title><italic>FynSensor</italic> allows direct visualization of spatially localized active Fyn in cells.</title><p>Acceptor photo-bleaching (APB) experiment for visualizing active Fyn in U2OS cells co-expressing FRET donor (Fyn WT) and acceptor (myr-mVenus-F29) <italic>FynSensor</italic> constructs.

We first examined Fyn activation dynamics in serum-starved cells plated on fibronectin (FN) that show constitutive protrusion retraction cycles.

An automated cell quadrant analysis of intracellular FRET<sub>T</sub> levels provides clear evidence of differential and compartmentalized Fyn activity. Briefly, every cell imaged was divided into quadrants in an automated manner and FRET response for each quadrant was analyzed over time. These analyses show substantial and significant differences in Fyn activation levels (<italic>FynSensor</italic> FRET<sub>T</sub>) between intracellular quadrants (designated as ‘low’ and ‘high’ FRET quadrants for consistency and comparison) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–II</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5sdata1">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>).

This reduction in activity is accompanied by a substantial dampening of the temporal changes seen in levels of active Fyn in cells (see below).

Overall, this is a powerful demonstration of the ability of <italic>FynSensor</italic> to reveal hitherto unexplored aspects of Fyn signaling dynamics.</p><p><italic>FynSensor</italic> shows Fyn activity to be compartmentalized even in serum-starved cells. This is likely due to differential integrin signaling, since Fyn activity is significantly attenuated upon FAK inhibition. This spatially constrained Fyn activity could be further increased through growth factor stimulation, with greater enhancement seen in pre-activated areas despite a global stimulation. These results provide a direct illustration of dynamic and intracellular localized signaling crosstalk between integrins and growth factor receptors; visualized through the activation (conformational change) of a non-receptor tyrosine kinase that get activated by each of these receptor classes. While results so far imply that differential integrin signaling appears to spatially restrict the effect of growth factor, we asked if appropriate integrin signaling is <italic>required</italic> for growth factor mediated modulation of Fyn activity. For this, we inhibited focal adhesion kinase activity and specifically tested if growth factor is still able to modulate Fyn activity levels. Interestingly, when <italic>FynSensor</italic> U2OS expressing cells are treated with PF-562271 (FAK inhibitor), not only are the <italic>FynSensor</italic> FRET levels drastically reduced, the cells become insensitive to growth factor stimulation as measured through Fyn activity.

These data indeed confirm a robust, spatio-temporally modulated and functional crosstalk between integrin and growth factor signaling.</p><p><italic>FynSensor</italic> reveals striking spatio-temporal patterns of Fyn activity. Since Fyn is a key regulator of cell physiology, including cytoskeleton remodeling and adhesion dynamics, we also asked how Fyn activity correlates with membrane motility. For this we acquired images at faster acquisition speeds (~35 s/frame) and performed quantitative image analysis using the Fiji plugin ADAPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barry et al., 2015</xref>) and measured both membrane motility and FRET<sub>T</sub> along the periphery of the cell, over the timecourse of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> I-II, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig9sdata1">Figure 9—source data 1</xref>). Intriguingly, a plot of membrane motility versus FRET<sub>T</sub> levels shows that the two parameters tend to be inversely correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). This is an interesting trend suggesting that intracellular regions showing higher Fyn activity is likely to show reduced overall membrane motility changes. This link between Fyn activity and dampened cell membrane oscillations points to a ‘poised’ cell membrane when/where Fyn is active. Such a notion is consistent with Fyn’s role in regulating cell-matrix adhesions and may need to be probed further (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). It is remarkable that visualizing the conformational dynamics of a membrane-bound, non-receptor kinase reveals pulsatile patterns, which can be modulated through integrin and growth-factor signaling.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Fyn activity couples to cellular morphodynamics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fyn activity correlates with reduced amplitudes of membrane protrusion-retraction as revealed by simultaneous measurement of membrane motility and <italic>FynSensor</italic> FRET<sub>T</sub>.

Despite the critical roles played by Src family kinases (SFKs) in regulating physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chetty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Gujral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lewis-Tuffin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nygaard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Saad, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Timpson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), specific tools/sensors to image activity of individual kinases in live cells and tissues are not available. This is particularly important as individual SFKs can perform overlapping but specific, even seemingly opposing roles, to control cellular output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Kuo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Lowe et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Lowell and Soriano, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Marchetti et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Molina et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Palacios-Moreno et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, understanding the specific activity patterns of individual kinases assumes considerable importance. Our work clearly addresses this issue and establishes a platform for developing new biosensors for visualizing activation of individual Src kinases. Using combinatorial library screening and protein engineering, we develop a biosensor for the critical SFK, Fyn. This specific biosensor reports the activation dynamics of Fyn in live cells, with no interference from other kinases. Fyn kinase is a major regulator of multiple cellular processes and has emerged as a key player in various disease pathologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Nygaard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhaskar et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schenone et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chin et al., 2005</xref>), but this is the first direct visualization of Fyn activity in cells. Interestingly, currently there are no tools for imaging active Fyn, with even specific antibodies not being available.</p><p>Our approach is extremely general and can be used for building sensors for other Src family kinases that are critical players in homeostasis and diseases. In this light, our work on addressing the specificity of biosensor binding using NMR structural analysis is likely to be significant. While our targeted screening and binding analysis yields a new binder (F29) that is highly specific for Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), the NMR structure of F29 bound to Fyn SH3 provides fascinating new insights into the molecular basis of specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). We identify key interactions that mediate binding and further use this insight to switch specificity of binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For instance, our Fyn-specific binder F29 does not or weakly bind Src-SH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,E</xref>). However, based on predictions from structural analyses, making just a single residue change in Src SH3 allows it to now bind F29 better (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>). These findings offer the possibility of generating specific binders targeting various Src family kinases, leading to new biosensors and tools. More broadly, we showcase how targeted screening of combinatorial protein libraries can be deployed to generate genetically encoded biosensors for visualizing active conformations of signaling proteins. This is a generally applicable strategy for biosensor development. With this method, it is possible to develop sensors even for ‘difficult’ targets, where structural information is limited and conventional tools like antibodies do not exist.</p><p>We demonstrate that <italic>FynSensor</italic> is able to report on the activation status of Fyn in cells. Newly engineered binder F29 binds the active form of Fyn and this binding leads to a FRET response that can be measured in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Our sensor design and extensive control experiments ensures high sensitivity while minimizing perturbation. We have shown that the fluorescently labeled Fyn retains kinase activity, is fully functional and behaves like the unmodified kinase in terms of its regulation, localization and ability to modulate downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">11</xref>). Importantly, the fluorescently labeled Fyn is also able to complement the endogenous Fyn in RNAi-knockdown rescue experiments. For instance, in knockdown-rescue experiments, labeled Fyn is able to rescue downstream ERK phosphorylation similar to untagged Fyn, showing that our tagging of Fyn does not perturb its regulation and signaling function. We also demonstrate that under our imaging conditions (low-to-moderate expression of <italic>FynSensor</italic>) in two very distinct cell types, biosensor does not perturb either downstream signaling or cellular morphodynamics, reiterating the efficacy of our design (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplements 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s11">11</xref>). When the non-binding control version of the F29 binder (F29P41A) is used in cells, the FRET response is abolished, showing FRET to be dependent on F29 recognizing activated Fyn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Further, an inhibitor of kinase activity also significantly attenuates FRET response, showing the biosensor readout to reflect kinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Overall, we show that the <italic>FynSensor</italic> response is specific and reflects cellular activity of Fyn.</p><p>A significant advantage of <italic>FynSensor</italic> is that it is highly specific and directly reports on the active conformation of Fyn with high spatial and temporal precision, unlike previously reported kinase sensors. This direct visualization of the active form of a single kinase, within a critically important yet complex family of kinases, has led to new insights into signaling dynamics and regulation. <italic>FynSensor</italic> imaging reveals Fyn activity to be localized and temporally modulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), with greater activity closer to the cell edge. Further, as serum-starved, fibronectin (FN)-plated cells undergo constitutive cycles of protrusion and retraction, we observe intracellular zones of high Fyn activity and even spontaneous cell polarization measured through levels of active Fyn. Critically, we show that this compartmentalized Fyn activity is dependent on integrin signaling. Inhibition of focal adhesion kinase, a key mediator of integrin signaling, abolishes or greatly attenuates Fyn activity. When FN-plated cells with spatially localized Fyn activity are treated with platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), we observe a <italic>greater</italic> increase in Fyn activity in and around the zones that were already pre-activated. This is indeed remarkable. Despite global PDGF treatment, its effect is highly localized and is dependent on intracellular zones that are established through integrin signaling. Our results suggest a model wherein localized/differential integrin activation in cells undergoing constitutive protrusion-retraction cycles not only helps establish signaling zones/compartments with higher Fyn activity, but also sensitizes these zones to be more responsive to growth factor signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). This could be through either preferential localization or pre-sensitization of PDGF-receptors and/or associated signaling components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, compartmentalized integrin signaling is not only maintained but also ‘functionally enhanced’ through growth factor stimulation. We further show that integrin signaling, not only spatially constraints Fyn activity and subsequent growth factor response, but that appropriate integrin signaling is required for growth factor modulation of Fyn activity. Inhibiting focal adhesion kinase activity not only dramatically attenuates Fyn activity in FN-plated, serum-starved cells, it also renders Fyn insensitive to any further stimulation through PDGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model representing how Fyn activity helps mediate spatio-temporally localized signaling crosstalk.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Src kinases have been long known to associate with the integrin receptor and growth factor receptor (RTK) signaling, thereby placing these kinases at nodal spots for signal integration. We provide the first visual proof for Fyn's involvement in integrating signals from these two receptor classes and see that the cell is highly polarized with respect to Fyn kinase activity. <italic>FynSensor</italic> shows that integrin receptor engagement results in formation of ‘zones’ of active Fyn in the cell, causing the cell to become polarized with respect to the activity of the kinase, even in serum-starved, FN-plated cells. PDGF stimulation further increases Fyn activity preferentially in these pre-sensitized regions only, thereby strengthening the spatially localized response. (<bold>B</bold>) Spatio-temporally localized Fyn activity; specifically, set-up through signal integration offers a quantitative picture of how Fyn activity may help regulate cell fate in certain situations. Fyn is known to be crucial for context-dependent cell migration and cell state switching in normal as well malignant cells, therefore, a spatio-temporally polarized response may be important for setting up cell output, especially for processes like that of directional cell migration and adhesion dependent cell switching. Pulsatile Fyn activity further suggests pre-organized signaling clusters with negative and positive feedback loops sensitive to both integrin and growth factor signaling.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50571-fig10-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our results offer a striking demonstration of spatially localized crosstalk between integrin and growth factor signaling and shows that integrin can localize and regulate the effect of even globally applied growth factors in activating downstream signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This illustrates how by visualizing the dynamic activation of a key signaling node (Fyn), it is possible to directly visualize signaling crosstalk between receptors in cells. Prior work has specifically implicated Fyn for its ability to integrate information emanating from different cell-surface receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Colognato et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Colognato et al., 2004</xref>). For instance, Fyn is plays a crucial role in cell survival and myelination of neurons by oligodendrocytes, specifically by integrating integrin signaling with growth factor signaling. Oligodendrocyte precursors are able to survive and subsequently wrap neurons with a myelin sheath, even in low growth factor conditions through the additive effects of integrin and RTK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Laursen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Laursen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Laursen and Ffrench-Constant, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sperber and McMorris, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schäfer et al., 2016</xref>). This signal integration is mediated through Fyn activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Laursen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schäfer et al., 2016</xref>). It is striking and highly significant that our biosensor reveals evidence of such signal integration, in single cell imaging experiments in-vitro. This shows that compartmentalized signaling crosstalk between different receptor classes may be a key feature of signaling systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p><p>Biosensor imaging also shows Fyn activity signals to be pulsatile. Recent work has shown that oscillatory signaling patterns are key hallmarks of several signaling modules, including regulation by transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Imayoshi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Isomura and Kageyama, 2014</xref>) as well as MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Weber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sparta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albeck et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antoine-Bertrand et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Shankaran et al., 2009</xref>). Generally, pulses arise due to the presence of negative feedback loops, which may also be accompanied by additional modulators. Interestingly, there is some evidence that switching temporal activity patterns can alter cellular fate; for instance, pulsatile ERK activity leads to one output while persistent activity leads to another. We observe robust and spontaneous activity pulses of Fyn in very distinct cell types even in serum-starved cells plated on FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and these pulses are further modulated by growth factor stimulation. This behavior strongly suggests the presence of rapidly activated, negative feedback loops that directly modulate Fyn activity.</p><p>Fyn activity pulses may be functionally significant in light of its demonstrated role in regulating cell migration, adhesion and actomyosin remodeling. In migration, there is an intrinsic periodicity in cycles of actin polymerization/remodelling/depolymerisation, periods of membrane remodelling as well adhesion assembly and disassembly. A protein that regulates several of these processes is conceptually much more likely to have pulses of activity versus sustained activity. In this light, it is remarkable that we are able to pick up ‘activity pulses’ at specific locations in the cell. This would need to be explored further in the context of directed migration and control of cell proliferation. Further, its indeed striking that membrane motility is reduced in the regions/zones where Fyn is more active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Spatially-localized pulsatile activation may likely cause transient but limited stabilization of signaling clusters which would be difficult to achieve with sustained activation. These observations taken together suggest that Fyn activity may be correlated with a ‘poised’ membrane state and formation and stabilization of specific integrin-FAK dependent signaling clusters, which can be further tuned by growth factor signaling. Such specific control of adhesion and actomyosin dynamics may be important in Fyn’s ability to mediate directed cell migration, growth control and tissue invasion. Context dependent and spatio-temporally regulated Fyn activity may provide a new perspective on understanding Fyn’s roles in regulating diverse and sometimes opposing cellular functions. Fyn activity profiles also provide a direct readout of highly localized signaling crosstalk between distinct receptor classes. Overall, this work sets the stage for detailed investigations of such functional signaling crosstalk in numerous cellular contexts and offers a new paradigm for direct visualization of signaling dynamics mediated by Fyn and other Src kinases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemical and reagents</title><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p><italic>Sigma-Aldrich</italic>- IPTG, EDTA, Glutathione, BSA, Manganese(II) chloride, KCl, Bromophenol blue, Potassium acetate, D(+)Galatose, CaCl2, D(+)Glucose, <italic>p-</italic>Coumaric acid, Luminol, DMSO, Imidazole, Biotinamidohexanoic acid N-hydroxysuccinimide-ester, Ampicillin Sodium salt, Penicillin-Streptomycin, Yeast Nitrogen base without amino acids, Fibronectin solution, phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, Platelet-derived Growth Factor, Ethidium Bromide, puromycinand Tween-20 and Dialysis tubing.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Fisher Scientific</italic>- Disodium Phosphates, Sodium Dihydrogen Phosphate, Tris-buffer.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>HiMedia Biosciences</italic>-NaCl, SDS, McCoy's 5A media, Luria Broth and Agar, FBS.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Merck-</italic> Anhydrous Glycerol, Glacial Acetic acid, Hydrochloric acid and Isopropanol</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Thermo-Fisher Scientific</italic>- Dynabeads Biotin Binder (#11047), PVDF-membrane, Lipofectamine LTX and plus reagent, Lipofectamine 3000, RIPA Lysis buffer, Pierce Phosphatase Inhibitor tablets, Pierce BCA assay kit, Page-Ruler Plus prestained protein ladder (10 to 250 kDa), Ni-NTA agarose beads, Agarose, DMEM (high glucose), DMEM (high glucose, HEPES, -phenol red), 1X DPBS, GlutaMax.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Bio-RAD</italic>- 30% acrylamide/Bis solution, Stacking and resolving gel buffer, TAE electrophoresis buffer and Econo-chromatography Columns.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>GE healthcare</italic>- Glutathione sepharose 4 Fast Flow and Superdex-75GL Size Exclusion Chromatography Column.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Zymoresearch</italic>- Zymoprep yeast plasmid miniprep II kit.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Promega</italic>- Pure-yield plasmid miniprep and wizard SV gelPCR clean-up system.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Roche</italic>- Protease inhibitor cocktail tablets, APS.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>NEB</italic>-Phusion high-fidelity DNA Polymerase, Q5 high fidelity DNA polymerases, T4 DNA ligase, <italic>Dpn</italic>I, <italic>Nco</italic>I-HF, <italic>Bam</italic>HI-HF, <italic>EcoR</italic>I-HF, alkaline phosphatase (CIP), 1 kb and 100 bp DNA Ladder.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Clontech-</italic>TaKaRa Ex-Taq, LA-Taq r-Taq DNA Polymerase.</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>EMD-Millipore</italic>- SU6656 (572635–1 MG).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Selleckchem-</italic>FAK inhibitor PF-562271 (Catalog No. S2890).</p></list-item><list-item><p><italic>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</italic><bold><italic>-</italic></bold>Polybrene (sc-134220).</p></list-item></list></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Antibodies</title><list list-type="roman-lower"><list-item><p><italic>Invitrogen-c</italic>-Myc chicken IgY antibody; goat anti-chicken IgY (H+L) secondary antibody; Alexa Fluor 633 conjugate; Avidin-Neutravidin FITC conjugate and Streptavidin R-phycoerythrin conjugate (SAPE).

Post-transfection the spent media containing packaged retrovirus were collected at 48 and 72 hr. The collected media (~18 ml) was filtered using 0.45 μm filter and used to infect the HEK-293T cells (10 cm plate,~70–80% confluent, grown in DMEM and 10% FBS) in presence of polybrene (10 μg/ml). The plate was further incubated for 24 hr and replaced with fresh media having 4 μg/ml of puromycin (Sigma). After 48 hr, only ~3 to 4 cells (per 10 cm plate) were found viable in both cases. The media containing puromycin was changed as per requirement until these cells reached ~90% confluency. Finally, the puromycin selected cells were passaged in the media without puromycin and grown. The cells were tested for mycoplasma and found to be negative. The final batches from each case were frozen and stored in liquid N2.

Acceptor bleaching was performed using 514 nm laser at 2X, 5X and 10 X light dosage for 10 s each (X = 0.069 mW) (refer to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B &amp; C</xref>) and Dex-Dem, and Aex-Aem images acquired. For determining the amount and pattern of the increase in donor fluorescence post acceptor photo-bleaching, a customized MATLAB program was used. Dex-Dem (donor channel) images were used for this analysis. All the images were subjected to background subtraction and a thresholding operation before analysis. A user-defined global threshold was first used to generate a binary mask using the donor channel pre-bleach image of each cell. This was then used to determine the boundary of the cell using Canny’s edge detection algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Canny, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mathworks, 2019a</xref>). A centroid of each cellular mask was also determined. A ‘linescan’ algorithm was used to quantify the variation of donor fluorescence recovery with distance from the cell periphery. For this, lines from every point on the periphery of the cell to the centroid were generated. Donor fluorescent intensities (from raw images) along these lines were calculated, and averages of all intensities were obtained as a function of distance from the periphery. For a given cell, the donor intensity values before and after bleaching (Pre-bleach<sub>Donor</sub> and Post-bleach<sub>Donor</sub>) were thus determined and used in the following equation to calculate percentage recovery of donor fluorescence as per established methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Karpova et al., 2003</xref>).<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mspace width="thinmathspace"/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">%</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">I</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">P</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">b</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">a</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">c</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">h</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">D</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mn>100</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where,</p><p>I Pre-bleach<sub>Donor</sub> - donor fluorescence intensity prior to bleaching.</p><p>I Post-bleach<sub>Donor</sub> - donor fluorescence intensity after bleaching.</p><p>For generating the representative ∆Donor image<bold>s,</bold> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> the prebleach donor channel image was subtracted from the postbleach donor channel image of the same cell (∆Donor = Post bleach<sub>Donor</sub>-Pre-bleach<sub>Donor</sub>) using MATLAB.</p><p>Donor Sensitized emission method-The Donor Sensitized Emission (SE) method records the FRET signal by measuring the amount of acceptor emission after excitation of the donor.

The ‘signal’ signifying Fyn activity approximately 1 µm from the membrane and the ‘velocity’ at the membrane along the cell periphery and over time, are obtained using the plugin. The overall ‘membrane motility’ map is obtained by performing a modulus operation on the velocity map. 3D plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) shows changes in ‘signal’ and ‘membrane motility’ over time and position along cell boundary for a single cell.</p><p>To compute a global correlation between FRET intensity (Fyn activity) and ‘membrane motility’ a one-to-one mapping of these two arrays extracted from ADAPT plugin, was performed.

Screening a library generated by mutagenizing the Sso7d protein from the hyperthermophilic archaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus for binders of the Fyn SH3 domain the authors identified a clone and characterized the binding interface using NMR spectroscopy. They further validated key interfacial interactions that mediate the specificity via site-directed mutagenesis. Subsequently, the authors show that this SH3 binder preferentially binds to open, active Fyn vs. wt Fyn. The authors then develop the FRET sensor as a combination of WT Fyn (donor) and myristoylated sensor (acceptor) and observed polarized activity in multiple cell types, with active Fyn concentrated to local cellular zones and also fluctuating over time (~20 min) in serum-starved cells. They demonstrate that this FRET signal can be globally inhibited using a Fak inhibitor, and increased locally at regions that already have high FRET intensity using PDGF stimulation. Pre-treatment of starved cells with the FAK inhibitor reduces FRET signal and blocks stimulation by subsequent addition of PDGF. Overall, this study integrates an impressive combination of innovative technology development and provocative new insights into cell signaling.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Fyn-specific biosensor reveals localized, pulsatile kinase activity and spatially regulated signaling crosstalk&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors screened for binders of the Fyn SH3 domain and validated the F29 clone binding through pulldown experiments, then further characterized the binding interface using NMR and suggest key interfacial interactions that mediate the specificity via site-directed mutagenesis of F29. Subsequently, the authors develop the FRET sensor as a combination of WT Fyn (donor) and myristoylated F29 (acceptor) and observe polarized activity in multiple cell types, with active Fyn concentrated to local cellular zones and also fluctuating over time (~20 min) in serum-starved cells plated on fibronectin. They demonstrate that this FRET signal can be globally inhibited using a Fak inhibitor, and increased locally at regions that already have high FRET intensity using PDGF stimulation. Pre-treatment of starved cells with the FAK inhibitor reduces FRET signal and blocks stimulation by subsequent addition of PDGF. Finally, the authors note a spatial trend that cell quadrants with higher Fyn FRET signal tend to have smaller changes in area.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The functional characterization of the biosensor is well supported by the provided data. However, in all images showing activity in different cell types, cells always appear to show higher activity in the right-hand side of the image. Such unlikely coincidence may potentially indicate an imaging artifact. The authors should analyze the distribution of activity in different cells and provide images of activation accruing at different sites in the cells.</p><p>2) The authors should show a better representative blot in Figure 2—figure supplement 3C (similar to what they show in Figure 1E).</p><p>3) At the end of the section entitled &quot;Molecular basis of specific Fyn recognition by F29&quot;, the authors discuss the importance of the D99 residue in the SH3 domain of Fyn. However, their analysis shows that SH3 domains of Yes, Lyn and Fgr have D/E at the same position and yet they show no binding to F29. How would the authors explain this discrepancy?</p><p>4) Subsection “F29 enables construction of <italic>FynSensor</italic>, a FRET biosensor for active Fyn”. Authors demonstrate that &quot;…increasing the amount of intracellular mVenus-F29 while maintaining constant expression of mCer-Fyn, led to a concomitant increase in FRET signal, followed by saturation of this FRET increase.&quot; Then they stated that &quot;Here, the saturation in FRET signal clearly indicates that even increasing concentrations of F29 binder in cells do not simply cause an inadvertent or artefactual activation of the kinase.&quot; It is not clear how saturation of FRET with increasing concentration of F29 would suggest that F29 cannot cause activation of the kinase. Saturation could also occur due to full activation of the kinase.</p><p>5) The anti-GFP blot in the Figure 3—figure supplement 10Cshows that myr-mVenus-F29 is expressed in all samples. The authors acknowledge that this is due to nonspecific recognition by the antibody. How could the authors be sure that myr-mVenus-F29 is expressed and at what level?</p><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 9. In the figure legend, the authors stated &quot;For <italic>FynSensor</italic> imaging, we have ectopically expressed labeled Fyn in HEK-293T cells where endogenous Fyn has been knocked down. This ensures that labeled Fyn levels are comparable to endogenous Fyn levels.&quot; However, their images and quantification show that labeled Fyn levels are significantly higher than endogenous Fyn. Furthermore, localization of endogenous Fyn appears to be different from ectopically expressed labeled Fyn. This discrepancy should be addressed. Also, images of phospho-Erk show very weak signal that looks like nonspecific background staining. Is this typical for phospho-Erk localization to be in sparse puncta? How does total Erk staining look for these cells? Is this assessment of phospho-Erk localization necessary?</p><p>7) It is surprising that the quadrant analysis gives such stark results, despite the fact they are averaging over large portions of the cell. Often it seems that polarized regions are much smaller than a quarter of the cell. Some sort of more granular analysis could strengthen some of the relationships. Especially for Figure 10, the authors must show a cleaner spatio-temporal relationship to make claims about relationships to membrane behavior. Using a FIJI plugin such as ADAPT (Barry et al. (2015) JCB) could answer these questions much more cleanly.</p><p>8) It is also important that they make sure to not under-sample temporally when trying to relate the edge dynamics with the biosensor. Imaging faster than every minute might be necessary to properly relate protrusion/retraction behavior with Fyn activity. Currently the relationship seems too noisy at the single trace level to make significant claims.</p><p>9) The authors suggest that Fyn activity is regulated by PDGF and integrates signaling from both PDGF and FAK. These claims would be supported by additional work showing the time-traces of FRETT signal of individual cells before and after PDGF addition (e.g., as they did in Figure 8 (ii)).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50571.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The functional characterization of the biosensor is well supported by the provided data.

How would the authors explain this discrepancy?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right in suggesting that our sequence comparisons/analyses as well as our current results suggest that while D99 may contribute to binding specificity of F29 towards Fyn vis-à-vis other SFKs, this residue is unlikely to be the sole determinant of specificity (for the reasons listed above). While we had indicated this in our original manuscript, we have significantly reworded this section to clarify this point. For instance; we clearly state: “Therefore, we hypothesized that D99 in Fyn-SH3 may contribute to the binding specificity of F29 for Fyn-SH3 vis-à-vis to at least some of the SFK SH3 domains. To test this hypothesis, we generated a mutant version of the SH3 domain from Src (Src-SH3) wherein the native threonine was replaced with aspartic acid (T99D). Strikingly, T99D Src-SH3, but not wild-type Src-SH3, showed detectable binding to F29 in pulldown assays (Figure 2—figure supplement 3C). These results suggest that D99 in Fyn-SH3 contributes to the binding specificity of F29 for Fyn over other SFKs, notably Src. Nevertheless, specificity of F29 for Fyn-SH3 over Yes-SH3 (containing E99) (Figure 1C, E) and Lyn/Fgr (containing D99, Figure 1—figure supplement 2), suggests that binding specificity results from a unique combination of multiple interactions at the binding interface that may require further investigation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “F29 enables construction of FynSensor, a FRET biosensor for active Fyn”. Authors demonstrate that &quot;…increasing the amount of intracellular mVenus-F29 while maintaining constant expression of mCer-Fyn, led to a concomitant increase in FRET signal, followed by saturation of this FRET increase.&quot; Then they stated that &quot;Here, the saturation in FRET signal clearly indicates that even increasing concentrations of F29 binder in cells do not simply cause an inadvertent or artefactual activation of the kinase.&quot; It is not clear how saturation of FRET with increasing concentration of F29 would suggest that F29 cannot cause activation of the kinase. Saturation could also occur due to full activation of the kinase.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a mere saturating FRET signal does not show that F29 binder does not cause artefactual activation of kinase in cells. To clarify this point, we have performed new immunoblot experiments to show that expression of F29 does not cause artefactual activation of kinase as measured through the ratio of active Fyn (pTyr416) to total Fyn. These results are now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 6 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, immunoblot experiments show that the expression levels of F29 does not cause any change in the levels of activated ERK (a sensitive downstream signaling readout of Fyn activity) in multiple cell-types (as seen by pERK/total ERK levels) (Figure 3—figure supplement 5,10,11). Further, we also show that F29 expression has no effect on Fyn kinase localization (Figure 3—figure supplement 8,9) and cellular morphodynamics (Figure 3—figure supplement 7).</p><p>All these results taken together strongly suggest that binder does not cause activation of kinase.</p><p>To ensure clarity on this issue, we have reworded the relevant sentences which now read:</p><p>“Here, the saturation in FRET signal suggests that even increasing concentrations of F29 binder in cells does not cause an inadvertent or artefactual activation of Fyn kinase, especially since F29 binder expression in cells does not lead to any measurable changes in autocatalytic activity of Fyn (Y-420 autophosphorylation) (Figure 3—figure supplement 6).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The anti-GFP blot in the Figure 3—figure supplement 10C shows that myr-mVenus-F29 is expressed in all samples. The authors acknowledge that this is due to nonspecific recognition by the antibody. How could the authors be sure that myr-mVenus-F29 is expressed and at what level?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this issue in the revised manuscript by providing new data using a different, more specific anti-GFP antibody (see Materials and methods of the revised manuscript). The relevant immunoblot experiments have been repeated with this specific anti-GFP antibody. Figure 3—figure supplement 10C of the revised manuscript confirms that there are no non-specific bands in U2OS cell lysate. Specific bands corresponding to ~33kDa are only observed in lysates of cells expressing either myr-Venus or myr-Venus-F29 or <italic>FynSensor</italic> constructs but not in vector control cells.</p><p>Additionally, we have also quantified fluorescence images of cells expressing either myr-Venus or myr-Venus-F29 or <italic>FynSensor</italic> constructs. The quantification of mVenus fluorescence shows that all the constructs are expressed at similar levels in the cells. These new data have been added to the revised Figure 3—figure supplement 10C of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 3—figure supplement 9.

How does total Erk staining look for these cells? Is this assessment of phospho-Erk localization necessary?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their valuable suggestions and agree that the assessment of phospho-ERK localization may not be necessary. This portion has therefore been removed from the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, we have performed extensive new imaging experiments in Fyn-knockdown HEK-293 cells ectopically expressing either unlabelled-WT Fyn or mCer-Fyn. Data from these cells has then been compared to cells expressing endogenous Fyn for estimating total Fyn protein levels as well as its localization.</p><p>Estimation of protein levels from immunoblot analysis as well as fluorescence micrographs shows that ectopic Fyn kinase in Fyn-KD cells is moderately overexpressed as compared to the endogenous kinase. Manuscript has been revised to indicate this.</p><p>Importantly though, this moderately overexpressed Fyn localizes similar to the endogenous kinase as seen in the immunofluorescence confocal micrographs. These new data have now been included in the revised manuscript (Figure 3—figure supplement 9).</p><p>The reviewers may also note that we have systematically examined the Fyn activity patterns as revealed by <italic>FynSensor</italic> across cells expressing different levels of labelled Fyn. We find that the conserved patterns of Fyn activity are not impacted by changes in <italic>FynSensor</italic> expression levels. In all three cell types examined (including knockdown rescue), the spatial patterns remain conserved independent of the precise levels of labeled Fyn (mCer-Fyn) as well as the binder (mVenus-F29) (Figure 6C and Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is surprising that the quadrant analysis gives such stark results, despite the fact they are averaging over large portions of the cell.

As the reviewers note that even a course-grained image analysis is able to pick up localized kinase activity patterns, thus showcasing the efficacy of the sensor as well as the clear compartmentalization of active Fyn. However, as part of this review we have performed extensive new imaging experiments at faster speeds and carried out detailed new image analysis to clarify this issue. Indeed, using the ADAPT plugin for a more granular analysis we are able to better correlate the membrane motility speed to the observed FRET<sub>T</sub> signal. The new data are included as part of Figure 9 in the revised manuscript. The data generated through faster imaging (35 sec vs 1 min per frame) and the use of ADAPT plugin allows us to see a more robust relationship between membrane motility and FRET signal at the level of both individual cells (e.g Figure 9A) as well trends observed across multiple cells (Figure 9B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is also important that they make sure to not under-sample temporally when trying to relate the edge dynamics with the biosensor. Imaging faster than every minute might be necessary to properly relate protrusion/retraction behavior with Fyn activity. Currently the relationship seems too noisy at the single trace level to make significant claims.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers we have performed new <italic>FynSensor</italic> imaging experiments at faster acquisition speeds. This faster imaging combined with a <italic>more granular</italic> image analysis regime (using ADAPT) has indeed helped us in establishing a stronger inverse correlation between the edge dynamics and observed FRET<sub>T</sub> signal.

In the revised manuscript we provide individual time traces of cells both prior to and after treatment with the inhibitor as well as PDGF. The individual FRET index images and time traces have been included in Figure 8—figure supplement 1 of the revised manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
