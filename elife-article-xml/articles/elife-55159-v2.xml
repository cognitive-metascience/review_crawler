Here we report a role for the condensin I subunit Cap-G in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons. We show that, despite not requiring condensin for mitotic chromosome compaction, post-mitotic neurons express Cap-G. Knockdown of Cap-G specifically in neurons (from their birth onwards) results in developmental arrest, behavioural defects, and dramatic gene expression changes, including reduced expression of a subset of neuronal genes and aberrant expression of genes that are not normally expressed in the developing brain. Knockdown of Cap-G in mature neurons results in similar phenotypes but to a lesser degree. Furthermore, we see dynamic binding of Cap-G at distinct loci in progenitor cells and differentiated neurons. Therefore, Cap-G is essential for proper gene expression in neurons and plays an important role during the early stages of neuronal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>condensin</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>development</kwd><kwd>post-mitotic</kwd><kwd>DamID</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104567/Z/14/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Southall</surname><given-names>Tony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P017924/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aughey</surname><given-names>Gabriel N</given-names></name><name><surname>Southall</surname><given-names>Tony D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M011178/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hassan</surname><given-names>Amira</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HE2354/23-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heidmann</surname><given-names>Stefan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HE2354/4-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Heidmann</surname><given-names>Stefan K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The condensin I subunit Cap-G is expressed in post-mitotic neurons and its removal, especially from less mature neurons, results in gene expression changes, reduced survival and behavioural defects in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Differentiated neurons are post-mitotic cells – they lack the ability to further divide to produce daughter cells. However, newly born neurons are not immediately ready to synapse with other neurons, nor generate action potentials. These immature cells undergo morphological changes, generating dendrites and axons, which will eventually form synapses with target cell(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cajal, 1890</xref>). Furthermore, newly born neurons display a level of developmental plasticity that is not apparent in terminally differentiated neurons, having been shown to have the potential to dedifferentiate under conditions that do not affect more mature cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Southall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zacharioudaki et al., 2019</xref>). However, underlying changes at the chromatin level are only just starting to be investigated. Changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility and the 3D genome organisation all occur as neurons differentiate from progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuen and Gerton, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kschonsak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>). Currently, little is known about the mechanisms underlying this transition and the molecular factors that coordinate it.</p><p>During mitosis eukaryotic DNA is packaged into condensed chromosomes for efficient segregation between daughter cells. The formation of these highly organised chromosome structures is achieved largely by the actions of the condensin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuen and Gerton, 2018</xref>). Components of the condensin complex form a loop through which DNA is constrained under the regulation of ATP-dependent SMC subunits in a similar manner to the related cohesin complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuen and Gerton, 2018</xref>). Most eukaryotes are thought to have two condensin complexes - condensin I and II. Both condensin complexes share a heterodimer of SMC subunits (SMC2/4) and differ based on inclusion of paralogous kleisin subunits (Cap-H/H2), and two HEAT-repeat subunits (CAP-G/G2 and CAP-D2/D3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hirano, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each condensin subunit plays a crucial role in packaging long strands of DNA into chromosomes via asymmetric loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kschonsak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Terakawa et al., 2017</xref>) and ensuring proper individualisation of the chromosomes during cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Oliveira et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cap-G expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> condensin I complex.

In yeast, chromatin compaction, driven by condensin, represses transcription in quiescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>). This is supported by observations in mouse T-cells, where condensin II depletion causes chromatin decompaction and an increase in gene expression, disrupting cellular quiescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, condensin I is implicated in regulation of position effect variegation (PEV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dej et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Savvidou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cobbe et al., 2006</xref>). Heterozygous <italic>Cap-G</italic> mutants show wing notches and rough eye phenotypes in flies, which is attributed to a regulatory role of Cap-G in heterochromatin gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dej et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cap-H orthologue, Barren, interacts with the chromatin-repressing Polycomb complex to silence homeotic genes. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the dosage compensation complex (DCC), closely related to condensin I, binds to DNA inducing transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2010</xref>). Moreover, depletion of condensin II shows an upregulation in gene expression due to disrupted gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>). In murine cells, Cap-G2 has a potential role in erythroid cell differentiation by repressing transcription via chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Xu et al., 2006</xref>). However, some experiments in yeast argue that condensin does not directly regulate gene expression. For example, a recent study demonstrated that condensin depletion results in genome decompaction but has no effect on overall gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>These studies observe the roles of condensin in mitotically proliferating cells, but there is limited knowledge of cell-specific, post-mitotic roles for condensin. Condensin mutations in mitotic and interphase cells ultimately disrupt post-mitotic daughter cells, leading to severe phenotypes. For example, in mouse neuronal stem cells (NSCs), condensin II mutations disrupted nuclear architecture and resulted in apoptosis of NSCs and post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishide and Hirano, 2014</xref>). One recent study showed that RNA-levels in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> are disrupted upon condensin inactivation due to the well-known phenotype of chromosomal mis-segregation during anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hocquet et al., 2018</xref>). This study points towards condensin having no direct role on transcription and raises the possibility that previous studies implicating condensin in gene expression may be suffering from artefacts resulting from aberrant chromosome segregation. Furthermore, condensin inactivation in differentiated mouse hepatocytes showed no changes in chromatin folding or gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdennur, 2018</xref>). Conversely, a post-mitotic role for condensin II has been demonstrated in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, in which Cap-D3 regulates transcriptional activation of anti-microbial gene clusters in fat body cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the wealth of knowledge on condensin complexes, their role in post-mitotic cells remains unclear. In this study we reveal a novel role for the condensin I subunit Cap-G in <italic>Drosophila</italic> post-mitotic neurons. We observed Cap-G expression and localisation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> central nervous system (CNS) in vivo. Cell-specific knockdown of Cap-G in neurons resulted in severe developmental arrest, behavioural defects, and an overall disruption of gene expression in the CNS. Knockdown animals exhibit a downregulation of neuron-specific genes and an ectopic upregulation of non-CNS-specific genes. Finally, Cap-G DNA binding profiles dynamically change between neuronal stem cells (NSCs) and post-mitotic neurons. The discovery of a neuronal role for Cap-G highlights the importance of studying condensin proteins in a post-mitotic context, to better understand their role in the regulation of gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cap-G is present in post-mitotic neurons</title><p>Upon conducting a yeast-2-hybrid screen to look for proteins interacting with the neuron-specific transcription factor Lola-N, we were surprised to identify the condensin complex component Cap-G as a potential interacting partner. Cap-G is a HEAT-repeat containing subunit exclusive to condensin I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herzog et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Whilst condensin activity has been characterised in neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishide and Hirano, 2014</xref>), the role of condensin complexes in post-mitotic neurons has not yet been studied in any species. Published RNA-seq data indicates significant levels of condensin subunit transcripts in neurons, including <italic>Cap-G</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leader et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berger et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we decided to investigate whether Cap-G was indeed present in <italic>Drosophila</italic> post-mitotic neurons. To characterise <italic>Cap-G</italic> expression in the central nervous system (CNS), we carried out fluorescent in-situ hybridisation for <italic>Cap-G</italic> mRNA on <italic>w<sup>1118</sup></italic> embryos (stage 15). We observed ubiquitous expression of <italic>Cap-G</italic> in all cells of the Ventral Nerve Cord (VNC) of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). <italic>Cap-G</italic> mRNA was clearly detectable in neurons marked by the pan-neuronal marker Elav, indicating post-mitotic expression of <italic>Cap-G</italic> in the CNS. We also observe broad expression of <italic>Cap-G</italic> in the larval central nervous system in which <italic>Cap-G</italic> mRNA was detectable at similar levels in the neural stem cells (NSCs) and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the distribution of Cap-G protein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CNS we utilised a <italic>Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> CRISPR knock-in line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kleinschnitz, 2020</xref>). This line expresses C-terminally EGFP-tagged Cap-G from its endogenous locus, and therefore recapitulates native Cap-G expression. These flies are homozygous viable and fertile and display no apparent ill effects as a result of the EGFP tag. In stage 14 embryos we observed strong Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> signal in NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) and we were also able to detect nuclear EGFP in post-mitotic neurons, which colocalised with the neuronal transcription factor Lola-N (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Southall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, strong GFP signal was observed in mitotic cells in the larval CNS, particularly in NSCs and the optical proliferation centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Cap-G not only co-localised with NSC-marker Deadpan (Dpn), but also with neuronal marker Elav in the larval central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Interestingly, EGFP signal was strongest in Elav-positive neurons in closest proximity to ganglion mother cells (GMCs) and NSCs in both embryos and larvae, indicating that Cap-G may play a more prominent role in newly born neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cap-G knockdown in neurons results in premature developmental arrest and severe mobility defects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effective knockdown of Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> in neurons.

Barren<sup>EGFP</sup> was clearly detected in all cells of the embryonic VNC as we saw with Cap-G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that Barren appeared to be predominantly in the cytoplasm of neurons, with much lower signal apparent in the nucleus. This result is in agreement with previous reports which have shown that Barren is primarily localised in the cytoplasm of interphase cells (in which Cap-G appears largely nuclear) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herzog et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Oliveira et al., 2007</xref>). Since Cap-G showed the most distinct nuclear localisation, we decided to focus on the neuronal role of Cap-G for the rest of this study. Overall, these data confirm that condensin expression is prevalent in the post-mitotic cells of the fly CNS and is maintained throughout development, from embryonic to larval stages, indicating that condensin I may have a previously unappreciated role in post-mitotic neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The deGradFP system produces robust neuron specific knockdown of Cap-G</title><p>The presence of Cap-G in neurons suggests a post-mitotic function for condensin in the CNS. To investigate this putative neuronal role, we used the deGradFP system to create neuron-specific Cap-G knockdown (KD) animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caussinus et al., 2012</xref>). When combined with <italic>GAL4/UAS</italic>, this system allows for highly specific knockdown of target proteins in a cell-type of interest. By combining deGradFP with <italic>Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> flies, we were able to successfully induce degradation of Cap-G. As expected, ubiquitous degradation of Cap-G-EGFP with <italic>tubulin-GAL4</italic> resulted in 100% embryonic lethality. This is consistent with the essential role of condensin proteins during mitosis as well as previous reports of <italic>Cap-G</italic> mutant embryonic lethality in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dej et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jäger et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>We induced Cap-G knockdown in neurons, using two post-mitotic drivers, <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> and <italic>nSyb-GAL4. elav-GAL4</italic> is expressed in all neurons, from newly born to mature, whilst <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> drives expression solely in more mature neurons in which synapse formation has begun. We performed knockdown experiments using both <italic>GAL4</italic> lines to better characterise the role of Cap-G during neuronal maturation since we observed higher levels of Cap-G in newly differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). Cap-G knockdown experiments with these two drivers are referred to as <italic>elav-KD</italic> and <italic>nSyb-KD</italic> respectively hereafter. Immunostaining of <italic>elav-KD</italic> embryos showed a reduction in GFP signal in neurons but not in NSCs, indicating that a robust neuronal knockdown was achieved using the deGradFP method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Previous reports have indicated that <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> can drive low level expression in embryonic NSCs (but not post-embryonic NSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2007</xref>). Since a recent study raised concerns that condensin knockdown phenotypes seen in interphase may in fact be due to defects in mitotic chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hocquet et al., 2018</xref>) we undertook a careful characterisation of the <italic>elav-KD</italic> on NSCs.</p><p>To determine whether we could see any reduction in Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> levels in NSCs or GMCs, we quantified fluorescence levels in live mitotic cells of the VNC in <italic>elav-KD</italic> and <italic>Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> control embryos. We observed no difference in Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> fluorescence in mitotic cells between the control and <italic>elav-KD</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We further analysed Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> signal intensity in fixed tissue using the NSC marker Deadpan (Dpn) as a counterstain. Quantification of Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> in Dpn positive cells revealed no significant difference in signal intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). Therefore we conclude that any low-level expression of deGradFP in NSCs is not sufficient to reduce Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup> levels by a detectable amount. Due to the well characterised function of condensin during mitosis, we reasoned that degradation of Cap-G in NSCs would affect their ability to divide. Therefore, we quantified the total number of NSCs (marked by Dpn), the total number of dividing cells (marked by the M-phase marker pH3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Giet and Glover, 2001</xref>) and finally the number of actively dividing NSCs (Dpn and pH3-positive cells). We saw no differences in the overall number of NSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), dividing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>), or number of mitotic NSCs between control and <italic>elav-KD</italic> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>).</p><p>Depletion of condensin in the mouse cortex resulted in NSC and neuronal apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishide and Hirano, 2014</xref>). Similarly, significant apoptosis was seen in the proliferating cells of zebrafish retinas in Cap-G mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seipold et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we sought to determine whether an increased amount of cell death was observable in <italic>elav-KD</italic> NSCs, which could be a result of premature Cap-G depletion. TUNEL staining of embryonic VNCs showed no significant difference in the number of apoptotic cells between <italic>Cap-G<sup>EGFP</sup></italic> controls and <italic>elav-KD</italic> in non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>).

Therefore, we conclude that the <italic>elav-KD</italic> has no effect on NSCs and dividing cells at the embryonic stage, suggesting that with this method we are able to achieve a neuron specific, post-mitotic Cap-G knockdown. Although we did not see increased levels of apoptosis in progenitor cells, we did observe a small but statistically significant increase in the number of Elav positive apoptotic neurons, suggesting that degradation of Cap-G may result in decreased cell survival in post-mitotic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Neuron-specific knockdown of Cap-G leads to behavioural phenotypes and reduced survival across development</title><p>To determine the impact of neuronal depletion of Cap-G on animal survival, we assayed the numbers of <italic>elav-KD</italic> and <italic>nSyb-KD</italic> flies pupating or eclosing as adult flies.

We asked whether Cap-G binding similarly occurs at known regulatory sequences in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> To address this we analysed Cap-G binding at all experimentally verified cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) from the REDfly database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rivera, 2018</xref>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu/index.php">http://redfly.ccr.buffalo.edu/index.php</ext-link>) and observed a strong depletion of Cap-G binding at those sites, suggesting that Cap-G is not broadly associated with CRMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Since many CRMs from this dataset may not be accessible in a given cell type, it was desirable to analyse Cap-G binding with respect to chromatin accessibility in the relevant cell-type of interest. To accomplish this we utilised the recently described Chromatin Accessibility TaDa method (CATaDa) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aughey et al., 2018</xref>). This method takes advantage of the fact that the untethered Dam used to normalise our TaDa data preferentially methylates accessible chromatin, meaning that reanalysis of our control data can be used to determine open chromatin regions in the specific cell-types used. Furthermore, since these data are acquired from animals using the same drivers and treated under the same conditions as the experimental dam-fusions, it provides an ideal dataset for comparing open chromatin with Cap-G binding. Overall, open chromatin regions determined by CATaDa display a general depletion of Cap-G binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Whilst the majority of accessible sites were depleted for Cap-G binding, a subset of sites showed some enrichment for Cap-G. We also observed a negative correlation between chromatin accessibility and Cap-G binding across all cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>It has been demonstrated that chromatin can be divided into several discrete states depending on the occupancy of various key proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Filion et al., 2010</xref>). These states include repressive and permissive chromatin environments. Recently published data allowed us to compare Cap-G binding to chromatin states in NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marshall and Brand, 2017</xref>). We find that Cap-G binding is most strongly enriched in repressive chromatin states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Cap-G was particularly strongly associated with ‘black’ chromatin – a prevalent repressive state that does not incorporate traditional heterochromatin markers. In contrast, Cap-G binding was relatively depleted at permissive chromatin states, particularly the ‘red’ TrxG state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that accessible chromatin is depleted at Cap-G binding sites indicating that condensin I does not bind to known enhancer and regulatory regions in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs and neurons.

Despite this, recent studies have provided evidence of condensin proteins contributing to gene regulation and chromatin organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lau and Csankovszki, 2014</xref>). Whilst it seems certain that condensin complexes play a role in gene regulation, some of these studies may suffer from technical artefacts relating to premature condensin knockdown in dividing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hocquet et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, studies examining condensin function outside of mitosis have drawn conflicting conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdennur, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>). In this manuscript we aimed to characterise the role of a condensin I protein (Cap-G) in a previously unstudied post-mitotic cell type. We found that Cap-G plays a significant part in regulating gene expression in neurons which is necessary for normal nervous system function.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>A post-mitotic role for Cap-G/condensin I in neurons</title><p>We observed nuclear localisation of Cap-G in <italic>Drosophila</italic> NSCs and neurons during development. The presence of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Cap-G in the nuclei of post-mitotic neurons mirrors the reported nuclear localisation of Cap-G in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herzog et al., 2013</xref>). Previous analyses of condensins in the central nervous system showed that condensin I and II are both involved in murine NSC division, but ‘largely absent’ from neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nishide and Hirano, 2014</xref>). It is possible that the relative intensity of signal observed from dividing and post-mitotic cells masked the presence of condensin subunits in this instance. However, both our in situ hybridisation and fluorescently tagged protein imaging, as well as previously published RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leader et al., 2018</xref>), strongly suggest that Cap-G is prevalent in <italic>Drosophila</italic> post-mitotic neurons. Further studies will be required to determine whether this property is conserved in other species.</p><p>Our results show that Cap-G depletion leads to alterations in gene expression in both early and mature neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. We observed that neuron-specific genes are downregulated, whilst non-CNS genes are ectopically upregulated in neurons depleted of Cap-G, suggesting that Cap-G activity contributes to maintenance of the neuronal transcriptome. These observations are supported by previous studies in interphase and mitotic cells which show that Condensin I and II regulate cell-specific gene expression in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yuen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). However, only a single study reports a post-mitotic role for condensin, specifically condensin II subunit Cap-D3, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>). The authors describe Cap-D3 regulating cell-specific gene expression in fat body cells, where it binds to and transcriptionally activates innate-immunity genes, including antimicrobial peptides. Interestingly, adult flies depleted of Cap-D3 have impaired immune response and fail to effectively clear bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Longworth et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, condensin I and II subunits may have different roles according to developmental stages, cell types, and complex incorporation.</p><p>Our data suggest that DNA damage is significantly increased in Cap-G depleted neurons. Previous studies in yeast have implicated the condensin complex in the regulation of the DNA damage response during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, <italic>Drosophila</italic> condensin II has been implicated in inhibiting double stranded break (DSB) formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuster et al., 2013</xref>). In human cells condensin I was shown to have a function in single stranded break (SSB) specific DNA damage repair but was not involved in DSB repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heale et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, the antibody used in our DNA damage experiments specifically recognises the response to DSBs. So far, Condensin I has not been shown to function in DNA damage pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, therefore it is possible that condensin I is involved in DSB repair in flies, in contrast to mammalian cells. However, Cap-G/condensin I may be required to maintain genomic stability in neurons independently of the DNA damage response. It is unclear whether the DNA damage we observe is responsible for the changes in gene expression. Given that we see similar levels of DNA damage in neurons of both <italic>elav</italic> and <italic>nSyb</italic> mediated knockdown, which have significantly different levels of aberrant gene expression, it is likely that increased DNA damage is not directly responsible for the changes we see in gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cap-G mediated regulation of gene expression</title><p>To date, the role of condensin in transcription regulation has only been speculated for interphase and dividing cells. For example, condensin involvement in transcriptional repression has been suggested in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>), mouse T-cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rawlings et al., 2011</xref>), and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Swygert et al., 2019</xref>). However, there is conflicting evidence in the literature on the role of condensin in gene expression. A recent study in fission and budding yeast suggests that condensin has no direct effect on gene expression and that changes to RNA levels occur as an indirect effect of chromosome mis-segregation in condensin-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hocquet et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, recent studies in yeast and mouse hepatocytes showed no significant changes in gene expression upon condensin depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Paul et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdennur, 2018</xref>). Our data is exclusively post-mitotic therefore there is no effect on chromosome stability, emphasising that the effects we see on neuronal gene expression are a direct result of Cap-G depletion. Furthermore, a large proportion of the affected loci appear to be associated with Cap-G, suggesting that Cap-G could have a direct transcriptional regulatory effect on its binding regions. This is also observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where the dosage compensation complex binds to specific DNA regions and promotes transcriptional repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meyer, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McDonel et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrated that Cap-G binds dynamically to DNA in NSCs and post-mitotic neurons. Each cell type displayed unique genes bound by Cap-G. Interestingly, Cap-G peaks are enriched mid-gene rather than at promoter regions as reported in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and chicken DT40 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, we did not observe any overlap between Cap-G binding and TFIIIC targets, as previously described in multiple species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Ambrosio et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kranz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yuen et al., 2017</xref>). Condensin binding data reported to date has been collected from mitotic or interphase cells. Therefore, condensin binding patterns in terminally differentiated cells are unknown, and the binding patterns we observe may be unique to this cell type. Similarly, we saw that Cap-G binding was depleted at accessible chromatin and known enhancer and regulatory element regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Leader et al., 2018</xref>). This is contrary to a study in which Cap-G was shown to localise to active enhancers in human cancerous cells, promoting estrogen-dependent gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2015b</xref>). However, conflicting evidence for condensin I binding at enhancer regions has been presented. For example, Barren has been shown to overlap with few known enhancers in mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Van Bortle et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We observed that the majority of Cap-G binding in NSCs was depleted at accessible loci. This indicates that condensin may be involved in initiating or maintaining repressive chromatin states, and is supported by the observation that we see Cap-G most strongly associated with repressive chromatin states in NSCs. However, we also saw Cap-G association with some open chromatin regions, indicating that its role in regulation of gene expression may not be so clear. This is consistent the fact that we see de-repression of silenced genes in our RNA-seq data, as well as down-regulation of genes that are usually expressed. These data indicate that Cap-G does not have an exclusive repressive role. However, given that a large proportion of mis-expressed genes are not directly bound by Cap-G, we conclude that many of these changes are caused by indirect effects. Loss of Cap-D3 (condensin II) in cultured mitotic <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells results in spreading of repressive histone marks, affecting transcription of neighbouring genes, indicating that this complex may be required for maintaining boundaries between different chromatin environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schuster et al., 2013</xref>). It is conceivable that Cap-G has a similar function in post-mitotic neurons, which could help to explain the repression and de-repression of gene expression observed in our RNA-seq data.</p><p>The canonical role of condensin is as a molecular motor that extrudes DNA loops thereby organising chromosome architecture during mitotic chromosome compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Paul et al., 2019</xref>). Given that condensin has this ability to rearrange chromosome topologies, it is feasible that the action of Cap-G in neurons could be to remodel 3D chromatin structure for optimal gene expression. Since we see more severe consequences of Cap-G depletion in younger neurons, this may suggest that condensin is required to establish a mature post-mitotic chromosome conformation in fully differentiated neurons before synaptogenesis. Another SMC complex, cohesin, is well known to be required for the formation of topologically associated domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yuen and Gerton, 2018</xref>). Perturbation of cohesin in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurons resulted in behavioural phenotypes and defects in axon pruning, also indicating that remodelling of chromatin architecture is likely to be important in neuronal maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pauli et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differential requirement for Cap-G in newly born and mature neurons</title><p>We depleted Cap-G levels in two overlapping populations of cells, fully differentiated neurons (expressing <italic>nSyb</italic>), as well as immature to fully differentiated neurons (expressing <italic>elav</italic>). <italic>elav-GAL4</italic>-driven knockdowns consistently displayed more severe phenotypes than with <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic> and had equally drastic changes in gene expression. This difference in phenotype can be attributed to the cells being targeted by the different drivers. e<italic>lav-GAL4</italic> encompasses all neuronal cells, including newly born neurons that are in a more transient and plastic state, when compared to more mature, synapse forming-neurons targeted with <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic>. This hints that Cap-G may serve a role in terminal differentiation of newly born neurons, but also maintenance of neuronal cell-state once matured. Consistent with this we saw much higher levels of Cap-G in newly born neurons than in more fully differentiated neurons, suggesting that Cap-G may play a more prominent role in the early life of the neuron.</p><p>Previous reports have stated that <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> may drive expression prematurely in embryonic NSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berger et al., 2007</xref>). We made extensive efforts to determine whether <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> caused a reduction in Cap-G levels in NSCs or any defects in NSC division. Since we could not see any changes in Cap-G levels in NSCs and did not observe any phenotypes that we would expect to see from mitotic Cap-G knockdown, we concluded that the phenotypes we observed were a result of post-mitotic Cap-G depletion in neurons. However, the possibility remains that Cap-G knockdown may occur in an undetected subset of progenitor cells, or at levels too low to detect, that give rise to chromosome segregation related phenotypes. That phenotypes were observed with two independent neuronal GAL4 lines (<italic>elav-GAL4</italic> and <italic>nSyb-GAL4</italic>) provides further confidence in a <italic>bona fide</italic> role for Cap-G in neurons. In future, the development of GAL4 lines with even more precise spatial and temporal control will allow us to carefully interrogate the differences between condensin function in the different stages of neuronal maturation.</p><p>We initially decided to investigate Cap-G function in neurons based on a potential interaction with the neuronal transcription factor Lola-N. Lola-N is required in the early stages of neuronal differentiation to maintain the differentiated cell state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Southall et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, we observed increased levels of Cap-G and more severe consequences from knockdown of Cap-G in the early stages of neuronal maturation. Therefore, it is intriguing to speculate that Cap-G/condensin I act together with Lola-N to maintain the neuronal transcriptome in differentiating neurons. Further studies will be necessary to verify whether there is in fact a functional relationship between these two proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In conclusion, we have shown that neuronal Cap-G is required for normal development and survival in <italic>Drosophila.</italic> This implicates the condensin I complex in a previously uncharacterised role in gene expression in post-mitotic cells.

Icy plugin Spot Detector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Olivo-Marin, 2002</xref>) was used to analyse the total number of cells when quantifying dividing NSCs, pH3 staining, DNA damage (ɣ-H2Av) as well as TUNEL staining, filters were adjusted per experiment and kept constant across control and experimental images. For nuclear area analysis the Ilastik software was used for bulk image segmentation, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Berg et al., 2019</xref>) to recognise each nucleus as an individual ROI. Subsequently, the segmented image was analysed in Fiji using Analyze Particles and extracting the mean nuclei area (&gt;1000 cells / replicate) in a total of 7 embryonic replicates. To quantify live GFP levels we took a z-stack (four slices minimum of the VNC) per embryo. Actively dividing cells displayed highest GFP levels, therefore binary images were created by using a threshold (Outsu’s thresholding) to select dividing cells as regions of interest (ROI). Mean pixel intensity per ROI (dividing cell) was calculated using Analyze Particles plugin in Fiji (&gt;30 cells/ embryo). Average pixel intensity of ROI was calculated across z-stack slices, for a total of 10 biological replicates. To quantify the GFP levels in NSCs, images were analysed from three biological replicates per condition. The Dpn positive cells were selected as individual ROIs as described above. The average pixel intensity detected for GFP and for Dpn were extracted using the Analyze Particles plugin in Fiji (&gt;70 cells / embryo). The GFP/Dpn ratio of pixel intensity was calculated per cell. Statistical significance was analysed using a Nested t-test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioural and phenotypic assays</title><p>All animals were kept at 25°C unless otherwise stated. For the developmental survival assay three biological replicates per genotype were used. Flies were allowed to lay for 5 hr and then 100 embryos per replicate were collected. After 24 hr, L1 larvae were transferred to a food vial and allowed to develop. The number of pupae (5 days post- lay) and eclosed adults (10 days post-laying) were recorded. Adult survival assays were performed on three replicates, with 20 flies per replicate. Male and female animals were separated upon eclosion. Death was scored daily until total number of flies deceased.</p><p>Behavioural assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Nichols et al., 2012</xref>). Locomotion assay was performed on 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae using 10 biological replicates and three technical replicates. Individual larvae were setup in clear agar plates against a 0.5 cm<sup>2</sup> grid. Larvae were left to acclimatise for 1 min and locomotion was recorded as distance covered per minute. Negative geotaxis assays were performed on 10 male flies and 10 technical replicates per genotype. Flies were set up in climbing vials against a grid and a camera. Video recording was started before sharply tapping flies to the bottom of vials. Videos were analysed using Icy, the frame in which the first fly reached the top of the vial was extracted. The coordinates of each fly were used to calculate the average distance climbed per replicate. Statistical tests and plots were performed using the software GraphPad Prism version eight for Windows.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Targeted DamID</title><p>We generated a <italic>UAS-Cap-G-Dam</italic> line to use in Targeted DamID experiments.

Condensin is well known to play a role in chromosome condensation and loop extrusion in recently divided cells. However its functions in postmitotic cells have been less clear. The authors became interested in CapG in neurons when they found it binding a neuronal transcription factor by yeast two-hybrid. Here they show CapG is expressed in postmitotic neurons and then studied phenotypes in flies where CapG was knocked out in neurons and used the TaDa DamID method to study CapG binding in neurons.</p><p>All three reviewers found the idea that nuclear architectural proteins might be repurposed in non-dividing cells for transcriptional regulatory purposes to be compelling, and they felt that this manuscript provides a solid set of data for establishing that there are non-mitotic function of CapG in neurons. However there were several significant technical concerns raised, some of which may be addressed with text revisions, but in particular the interpretation of TaDa data require additional validation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Essential revisions fall into three areas relating to 1) the TaDa peak calling, 2) the relationship of CapG binding to chromatin and gene expression, 3) the interpretation of the elav and <italic>nsyb</italic> phenotypes.</p><p>1) Although the reviewers agreed that the TaDa approach was a good one for mapping CapG binding in neurons, all expressed some concerns about the details of the TaDa data. The reviewers noted that peak calling using the TaDa approach is challenging since the signal to noise is very modest compared to high quality ChIP-seq signals. Furthermore for CapG the signals appear to be very broad, which makes them poorly amenable to traditional peak calling. The reviewers agreed that the authors should either systematically validate their peak calling of TaDa datasets with replicates as they have done in a separate <italic>ELife</italic> paper published recently, or adapt their computational analyses to reflect the broader binding patterns of CapG compared to transcription factors. This was a topic of substantial discussion among the reviewers during the commentary period. Specific comments from the reviewers on this point are below. We include this information so the authors can see the kinds of concerns that were raised and we encourage them to offer what they feel is the strongest response either with the addition of more data or with a revised analysis approach.</p><p>• Figure 4A: What fraction of TaDa peaks are statistically detected in all replicates for each condition? Reproducibility between replicates is important for understanding how much of the differences between conditions is due to biological or technical variability. Could the author please show the individual replicates for all examples in 4A? Rigorous analyses using multiple replicates (as the authors performed in Sen et al. e<italic>Life</italic> 2019) would be necessary.</p><p>• Alternatively, using &quot;aggregate&quot; computational analyses such as in Figure 4D-F would be acceptable, if the peak analyses proved to be not reproducible across replicates for individual genomic loci. I would leave the biological replicate experiments up to the authors, who may find it useful for statistical analyses comparing the genetic lines and possibly to strengthen/convince us that their peak calling is the accurate way to characterize CapG binding.</p><p>• Condensin may not bind in the same manner to chromatin as transcription factors or histone modifications, which often show sharp peaks. Based on the examples presented in Figure 4A, the observed negative-going &quot;valleys&quot; may be also meaningful signal. Using the aggregate Cap-G TaDa signal across the entire gene body might be yet another alternative statistical method for comparing between conditions and across replicates (this is a common strategy for RNA-Seq statistical analyses).</p><p>• Looking at their few examples, it appears CapG binds more like chromatin regulators that have broad gene-body distributions (i.e. elongation regulators, MECP2). Peak callers like MACS2 used in this study would not be appropriate in this scenario and alternative computational methods are more appropriate. If the authors wish to use peak calling, they must use replicates with statistical measures to validate peak calling reproducibility.</p><p>• In the examples in 4A, it is unclear how to interpret the results. For example, for the dacapo gene, the peaks upstream of the gene appear preserved in all experiments (even if peak calling may be different between conditions due to statistical thresholds). However, there is no mention of these upstream peaks. Another example are the peaks identified in the genebody of unc-89, which are somewhat randomly distributed across the various conditions. Are the differences between conditions biological or due to technical variability? Finally, for the bruchpilot gene, the authors state that Cap-G binding is stronger in NSCs than mature neurons. However, there are several positive signals along the gene body of bruchpilot that are conserved in both the elav-GAL4 and <italic>nsyb</italic>-GAL4 neurons and, although distinct, appear to have equal amplitude as the &quot;statistically-significant&quot; peaks in the wor-GAL4 condition. Together, if these examples represent the typical peak calling, this reviewer is concerned about interpretability of subsequent analyses that rely on peak calling (4B, 4C).</p><p>Finally, one reviewer also raised an independent point about these data, saying: &quot;The DamID data suggest there are different binding patterns of CapG in NSCs, immature neurons and mature neurons. Might there be differences in expression in the different lines that could make apparent differences in binding? Also are the DamID lines functional overexpressors of CapG? If so, how do the authors know the binding of the transgene is representative of the endogenous gene?&quot;</p><p>2) A second major concern raised by the reviewers regards the comparison of CapG binding to open chromatin and gene expression.</p><p>For Figure 4D-E, the methods for how the authors identified putative enhancers or open chromatin is missing (authors only indicate from REDFly). Are these putative enhancers and open chromatin curated from all cells or matched to the specific cell types and developmental stages they are studying? If the vast majority of enhancers and &quot;open&quot; chromatin regions are largely inactive in bulk populations of cells, then the observed results would reflect Cap-G preferentially binding to open chromatin, but only in cell type-specific manners. The authors should perform the same analyses using active enhancers and bonafide open chromatin regions specifically from their tested cell stages. If they have done so, they should clearly state how they did this.</p><p>With respect to how this relates to gene expression, the reviewers were not convinced by the arguments in the text. How do the authors propose that CapG bind only to repressive chromatin, but upon knockdown of CapG, then downregulated genes are localized to active chromatin? The authors need to comment on this, particularly since they are arguing CapG is directly regulating both the upregulated and downregulated genes via its binding to both groups of genes. As another reviewer stated, It is unclear from their data why equal numbers of genes are up and down regulated. If Cap-G preferentially binds to repressive chromatin, as the authors argue in Figure 4, how does loss of Cap-G leads to the downregulation of neuronal genes, which should be regulated by active chromatin in neurons? I think that the authors should comment on: a) the low number of overlapping genes up- and down-regulated in <italic>nsyb</italic>- and elav-driven CapG knockouts and b) on the huge difference between the up- and down-regulated genes between the 2, which could be very interesting.</p><p>3) The reviewers raised concerns that elav can be expressed in progenitors and thus felt that the authors cannot use the elav line as definitive evidence for postmitotic functions of CapG.</p><p>They indicated that addition of a dividing cell marker (such as Dpn) in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A would be needed to validate that CapG is not reduced in dividing cells. Given that the authors show convincing behavioral data using the <italic>nsyb</italic>-KD line that indicates a function for Condensin in neurons, the conclusions based on the elav line could be toned down to admit possible expression in progenitors without undermining the story that the authors with to tell here.</p><p>With respect to the behavioral phenotypes in the <italic>nsyb</italic> line, although the reviewers were convinced that there were phenotypes (confirming functions of CapG in neurons) they did not think that detailed description of these phenotypes was highly meaningful given the survival deficits. Thus the commentary on CapG functions in behavior could also be written back.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55159.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Essential revisions fall into three areas relating to 1) the TaDa peak calling, 2) the relationship of CapG binding to chromatin and gene expression, 3) the interpretation of the elav and nsyb phenotypes.</p><p>1) Although the reviewers agreed that the TaDa approach was a good one for mapping CapG binding in neurons, all expressed some concerns about the details of the TaDa data.

In our original submission we neglected to provide a full explanation of our peak calling process. Furthermore the annotations of peaks on Figure 4A were incorrect due to an error in processing these figures. Therefore, some aspects of these figures were misleading.</p><p>The peak calling programme that we have used is specifically designed to be able to detect the broad peaks produced by DamID data, in which the resolution is limited by the occurrence of GATC fragments. Using this programme a peak is only called if it was deemed to be significant in all biological replicates. Therefore the peaks called should indicate regions that have good agreement between replicates.</p><p>Overall, we find that reproducibility between replicates is very good. To illustrate this we have provided some further analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 1) highlighting the good correlations between replicates. We have also updated Figure 4A to highlight the reproducibility. These updated figures now also include the correct peak annotations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Alternatively, using &quot;aggregate&quot; computational analyses such as in Figure 4D-F would be acceptable, if the peak analyses proved to be not reproducible across replicates for individual genomic loci.

These occur as a result of the normalisation against the Dam only control. Since the Y-axes display the ratio of Cap-G-Dam / Dam-only, negative values are expected. At loci which display high levels of background methylation but no association with the dam-fusion, a negative peak will be produced. Therefore, the negative peaks may not meaningfully be interpreted as representing bona-fide troughs in Cap-G binding relative to zero. However, they do give some indication of the chromatin accessibility at these loci, which is the basis for our CATaDa technique which we talk about in more detail in response to another of the reviewers’ points. We have added a note in the legend of Figure 4 highlighting this detail.</p><p>We have conducted the analysis that the reviewers suggest regarding the aggregated signal across gene bodies. In agreement with our peak annotation presented in figure 4C, we find that Cap-G signal is most strongly enriched across gene bodies whilst being depleted from TSS and TES. These new data are provided in Figure 4—figure supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Looking at their few examples, it appears CapG binds more like chromatin regulators that have broad gene-body distributions (i.e. elongation regulators, MECP2). Peak callers like MACS2 used in this study would not be appropriate in this scenario and alternative computational methods are more appropriate. If the authors wish to use peak calling, they must use replicates with statistical measures to validate peak calling reproducibility.</p></disp-quote><p>As previously stated, we believe this misconception has arisen from a failure on our part to adequately explain the computational methods employed to analyse Cap-G peaks. Since our pipeline is suitable for analysis of broad peaks by only considering multiple adjacent enriched peaks, we believe that it is suitable for the analysis of this dataset. As we mentioned in response to a previous comment, our peak calling only considers peaks present between replicates, and statistical measures are employed to ensure the fidelity of this analysis. The text has been updated to ensure that these details are more carefully highlighted.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In the examples in 4A, it is unclear how to interpret the results. For example, for the dacapo gene, the peaks upstream of the gene appear preserved in all experiments (even if peak calling may be different between conditions due to statistical thresholds). However, there is no mention of these upstream peaks. Another example are the peaks identified in the genebody of unc-89, which are somewhat randomly distributed across the various conditions. Are the differences between conditions biological or due to technical variability? Finally, for the bruchpilot gene, the authors state that Cap-G binding is stronger in NSCs than mature neurons. However, there are several positive signals along the gene body of bruchpilot that are conserved in both the elav-GAL4 and nsyb-GAL4 neurons and, although distinct, appear to have equal amplitude as the &quot;statistically-significant&quot; peaks in the wor-GAL4 condition. Together, if these examples represent the typical peak calling, this reviewer is concerned about interpretability of subsequent analyses that rely on peak calling (4B, 4C).</p></disp-quote><p>In our original submission the presentation of these data and previously described problems with peak annotation on Figure 4A made these data difficult to interpret. We have updated this figure to include better illustrative examples of the points we are trying to convey (with correctly positioned peaks indicated). In the new version we have included genes that more unambiguously display changes in binding between conditions. We have also altered the way called peaks are highlighted on the figure which should make the figure easier to interpret. We have also altered the text to reflect these changes and expand on the interpretation of this figure. Furthermore, we have added a supplementary figure with further illustrative examples (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, one reviewer also raised an independent point about these data, saying: &quot;The DamID data suggest there are different binding patterns of CapG in NSCs, immature neurons and mature neurons. Might there be differences in expression in the different lines that could make apparent differences in binding? Also are the DamID lines functional overexpressors of CapG? If so, how do the authors know the binding of the transgene is representative of the endogenous gene?&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>There are several reasons to suspect that the relative expression levels of the drivers do not have a significant effect on the binding observed. Firstly, the Dam-only controls were expressed using the same drivers as the Cap-G Dam fusion. Since the Cap-G-Dam data are normalised against the dam-only data, this controls for differences in expression levels.</p><p>The primary open reading frame used to attenuate Dam translation is highly effective. It has previously been shown that the levels of Dam protein produced are so low as to be completely undetectable by western blot when expressed from a tubulin promoter (Southall et al., 2013). This is a requirement for DamID to avoid saturating methylation and toxic effects. Therefore, it is unlikely that expression of the Cap-G-Dam fusion will result in overexpression phenotypes since the levels produced are so low.</p><p>We are confident that the binding profiles produced are representative of the binding of the endogenous protein since Cap-G is tagged on the same terminus as in the Cap-G-EGFP line used in this study. This line is homozygous viable indicating that Cap-G is able to tolerate a fusion protein at this position and continue to fulfil its usual function. Since Dam is a small protein (comparable in size to GFP), it is very unlikely that it interferes with Cap-G localisation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A second major concern raised by the reviewers regards the comparison of CapG binding to open chromatin and gene expression.</p><p>For Figure 4D-E, the methods for how the authors identified putative enhancers or open chromatin is missing (authors only indicate from REDFly). Are these putative enhancers and open chromatin curated from all cells or matched to the specific cell types and developmental stages they are studying? If the vast majority of enhancers and &quot;open&quot; chromatin regions are largely inactive in bulk populations of cells, then the observed results would reflect Cap-G preferentially binding to open chromatin, but only in cell type-specific manners. The authors should perform the same analyses using active enhancers and bonafide open chromatin regions specifically from their tested cell stages. If they have done so, they should clearly state how they did this.</p></disp-quote><p>The data indicated in Figure 4E are experimentally validated cis-regulatory modules (CRMs) downloaded from the REDfly database. This dataset includes all CRMs without filtering for specific cell-types or stages. We chose to use this broad dataset initially to provide an overview of Cap-G binding at functional elements in the genome. These data indicate that Cap-G binding is depleted at these loci, however, the reviewer is correct in their claim that binding at open chromatin may be masked by lack of cell-specificity. Previously we showed that by re-analysing the Dam-only data against which the Dam-fusion protein is normalised, we are able to obtain data reflecting the chromatin accessibility of individual cell-types since the untethered dam is able to freely methylate all accessible regions (Aughey et al., 2018). We referred to this technique as CATaDa. In Figure 4E we have utilised these control Dam-only data from our TaDa experiments to compare binding to areas of accessible chromatin in the relevant cell-type – indicating that Cap-G binding is indeed depleted at cell-specific accessible loci. We realise now that we did not describe this approach in the text in much detail and neglected to outline the analysis of these data in our Materials and methods. In the revised version we have expanded on these details in the Results and Materials and methods section to make clear the data-types used and the analyses undertaken.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to how this relates to gene expression, the reviewers were not convinced by the arguments in the text. How do the authors propose that CapG bind only to repressive chromatin, but upon knockdown of CapG, then downregulated genes are localized to active chromatin? The authors need to comment on this, particularly since they are arguing CapG is directly regulating both the upregulated and downregulated genes via its binding to both groups of genes. As another reviewer stated, It is unclear from their data why equal numbers of genes are up and down regulated. If Cap-G preferentially binds to repressive chromatin, as the authors argue in Figure 4, how does loss of Cap-G leads to the downregulation of neuronal genes, which should be regulated by active chromatin in neurons? I think that the authors should comment on: a) the low number of overlapping genes up- and down-regulated in nsyb- and elav-driven CapG knockouts and b) on the huge difference between the up- and down-regulated genes between the 2, which could be very interesting.</p></disp-quote><p>Whilst we see a strong enrichment of Cap-G at repressive chromatin types, and depletion at open chromatin, these data are not sufficient to conclude that the function of Cap-G results solely in gene repression. Furthermore, whilst binding of Cap-G is mostly depleted at sites of open chromatin, there appears to be a subset of accessible loci which Cap-G does associate with. This can be observed in the heatmaps of Figure 4E (dark blue at tops of heatmaps indicating strong signal in minority of regions). Therefore, since we see Cap-G associating mostly with repressive and inaccessible chromatin, we conclude that it may be involved mostly with gene repression, however this may be context dependant. For example, we see a modest enrichment for Cap-G binding at HP1 enriched chromatin, however, although thought to be a primarily repressive chromatin marker, some studies (e.g. Wit, Greil and van Steensel, 2007) show that HP1 is also associated with activate chromatin states. We would also like to point out that some of the gene expression changes may be the result of indirect effects, indeed since a large proportion of differentially expressed genes do not coincide with Cap-G binding sites, we presume that this is the case. Therefore, from these data we do not think it is that surprising that we do not see only de-repression of genes in our data.</p><p>It is possible that Cap-G acts in concert with the condensin complex to organise 3D chromatin structure in a manner similar to that reported for other SMC proteins in interphase. For example, cohesin is known to be involved in organising TAD boundaries. If acting in this kind of role, the consequences of Cap-G loss may be more difficult to predict than straightforward loss of gene repression.</p><p>With regards to the low numbers of overlapping differentially expressed genes between the elav and <italic>nsyb</italic> conditions we think that this is not entirely unsurprising when taking the binding data into consideration. We see that there is as around as much difference in binding of Cap-G between the two neuronal stages as we observe between either of the neurons and their progenitor cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C and Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Therefore it is not unexpected to see that the loss of Cap-G in these cells has a different impact on transcriptomes. Also, this is consistent with the difference in phenotypes observed and the altered abundance of Cap-G seen in immunofluorescence experiments (Figure 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers raised concerns that elav can be expressed in progenitors and thus felt that the authors cannot use the elav line as definitive evidence for postmitotic functions of CapG.</p><p>They indicated that addition of a dividing cell marker (such as Dpn) in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A would be needed to validate that CapG is not reduced in dividing cells. Given that the authors show convincing behavioral data using the nsyb-KD line that indicates a function for Condensin in neurons, the conclusions based on the elav line could be toned down to admit possible expression in progenitors without undermining the story that the authors with to tell here.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are right to be concerned about the possibility of premature knockdown of Cap-G in progenitor cells. We have provided multiple lines of evidence to show that this is unlikely to be a major contributing factor to the phenotypes observed in this case. To address the reviewers’ point, we have analysed further data to compare Cap-G levels between conditions in cells that are positively marked with the neuroblast marker Dpn. We see no significant difference in GFP levels between control and knockdown animals. These data along with representative images have been added to Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C. Taking these data together, we believe it is unlikely that the phenotypes we have reported in elav-mediated knockdown animals are as a result of premature expression. However, we agree that premature degradation remains a possibility and are happy to change the text to reflect this fact. We have added a caveat to this effect in our Discussion (subsection “Differential requirement for Cap-G in newly born and mature neurons”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>With respect to the behavioral phenotypes in the nsyb line, although the reviewers were convinced that there were phenotypes (confirming functions of CapG in neurons) they did not think that detailed description of these phenotypes was highly meaningful given the survival deficits. Thus the commentary on CapG functions in behavior could also be written back.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these behavioural phenotypes should not be overinterpreted. We include these data only to provide a full characterisation of the neuronal dysfunction of these animals. It is important to note that since such a large proportion of flies do not make it to adulthood, these flies may have escaped the most severe consequences of Cap-G depletion. We have changed the final part of this section to reflect this in the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
