We now demonstrate that hypomorphic <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice have granule and Purkinje cell abnormalities causing subsequent disruptions in postnatal cerebellar foliation and lamination. Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobule which echoes the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging studies. Lineage tracing experiments in <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mouse cerebella indicate that aberrant migration of granule cell progenitors destined to form the posterior-most lobule causes this unique phenotype.

We previously reported that rare heterozygous deletions (del) of the forkhead box C1 (<italic>FOXC1)</italic> gene on human chromosome (chr) 6p25 are associated with DWM (2). We have also conducted an extensive phenotypic analysis of the <italic>Foxc1</italic> homozygous null <italic>(Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup>)</italic> mice where we have shown that both zones of neurogenesis, the ventricular zone and rhombic lip, are disrupted in <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>). This analysis provided some key insights regarding the developmental disruptions underlying this important brain malformation, yet many questions remain.</p><p>Here, we present a developmental analysis of the foliation defects in <italic>Foxc1</italic> hypomorphic mutant (<italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>) mice. These mice are viable as adults and display a unique posterior foliation defect that is strikingly similar to the DWM ‘tail sign’ which has been recently proposed to represent a pathognomonic feature of DWM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardo et al., 2015</xref>). We present mouse genetic lineage mapping data that identifies premature and abnormal migration of posterior vermis-fated rhombic lip (RL) derived cells as the cause for this striking phenotype. We also present the analyses of 3 rare human fetal del chr 6p25 DWM cases which show extensive phenotypic overlap with <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mouse cerebellar defects, including ectopic granule cell progenitors (GCPs) and Purkinje cells, dysmorphic Bergmann glial fibers, and posterior vermis disorganization.</p><p>Since <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutations in mice recapitulate multiple aspects of the developing and mature human del chr 6p25 DWM cerebellar pathology, these data validate <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice as models for human DWM. Further, our analyses clearly demonstrate that competent meningeal signaling is required for multiple aspects of prenatal and postnatal cerebellar development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Postnatal human del chr 6p25 (<italic>FOXC1 +/-</italic>) Dandy-Walker patients and <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mice share similar deficits in posterior vermis foliation</title><p>One hallmark of human DWM is posterior vermis hypoplasia. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>, the normal human cerebellar vermis has a trilobar appearance, with primary and secondary fissures readily distinguishable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, white arrowheads). The posterior vermis lobules, below the secondary fissure, are well formed and a distinct choroid plexus is evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, yellow arrowhead). In contrast, the cerebellar vermis in our del chr 6p25 DWM patient cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>) ranges from very hypoplastic and dysplastic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>), to less severely affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Regardless of the extent of dysplasia, these individuals with del chr 6p25 share a common extended and dysplastic posterior vermis with an indistinct choroid plexus. This feature has recently been designated the DWM ‘tail sign’ and may be pathognomonic for DWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,F</xref>, red arrowhead) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardo et al., 2015</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20898.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Similarities of human DWM and mouse <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> posterior folial abnormalities.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) T1-weighted midsagittal magnetic resonance images in the postnatal control subject (<bold>A,B</bold>) and two subjects with del chr 6p25.3 CNVs that include <italic>FOXC1</italic> or intragenic mutations of <italic>FOXC1</italic> diagnosed with Dandy Walker Malformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>) (<bold>C–F</bold>).

During embryogenesis, <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice have dramatic VZ proliferative deficits and GABAergic neuronal migration defects in addition to RL abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>). Neonatal lethality precludes evaluation of cerebellar foliation, which is a postnatal process in mice. Furthermore, mouse <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>phenotypes are more severe than those seen in del chr 6p25 patients who retain one functional <italic>FOXC1</italic> allele. We previously reported that mice homozygous for a <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>hypomorphic allele are viable as adults and have abnormal cerebellar foliation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>). These mice retain 5% Foxc1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Zarbalis et al., 2007</xref>). Here, we add to our previous report, showing that <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>mice have a highly unusual, partially formed posterior lobule (lobule X), which aberrantly exposes the internal granule layer to the fourth ventricle. This phenotype is reminiscent of the human DWM tail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I,J</xref>). To our knowledge, <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mice are the only mouse model to consistently show this foliation phenotype. Thus, an analysis of the developmental events resulting in this highly specific and disease-relevant foliation defect are likely to inform the developmental pathology of the posterior vermis defects in human del chr 6p25 DWM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>posterior defects are primarily caused by aberrant migration of the posterior-fated rhombic lip descendants</title><p>Cerebellar foliation normally follows a stereotypic pattern and sequence. Four cardinal vermis fissures, including the primary and secondary fissures, are anchored late in embryonic mouse development, then additional fissure formation and folia lengthening progress postnatally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Sudarov and Joyner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Legué et al., 2015</xref>). Although the primary and secondary fissures were readily evident at P15 (Postnatal day 15) in both wild-type and <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mice, a delay in posterior fissure formation was evident at P1 in <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mice, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M,N</xref>; asterisks) and the <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> posterior vermis was clearly disorganized at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1N</xref>).

As expected, by P0, the RL had fully regressed in wild-type animals and the RL-derived <italic>Lmx1a</italic>-labeled lineages were clearly limited to lobule X and the posterior half of lobule IX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20898.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Null and Hypomorphic <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutations caused posterior cerebellar foliation defects due to mismigration of cells destined to form the posterior vermis.</title><p>(<bold>A–J</bold>) Lineage analysis of the <italic>Lmx1a-cre+</italic> cells in the wild-type mice showed tdTomato expression limited to the RL, EGL and presumptive IGL. Postnatally, fate-mapped cells populated the posterior vermis but did not abut the 2<sup>o</sup> fissure (<bold>C</bold>, white arrows). In the wild-type embryonic cerebellum, these cells were present underneath the EGL directly underneath the pial surface (<bold>A, E, G, I</bold>; white arrow). In <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup> Lmx1a-cre</italic> tdTomato mice, cells migrated out of the RL in multiple ectopic streams (<bold>B</bold>, yellow arrows). Postnatally, in the <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mutant cerebellum, ectopic tdTomato+ cells were present along the ventricular surface and the inner cerebellar core (<bold>D</bold>, yellow arrows). In <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice (<bold>F,H,J</bold>), aberrantly migrating <italic>Lmx1a-cre</italic> tdTomato+ cells were evident by e14.5 in the core (<bold>F</bold>) and found in the VZ by e15.5 (<bold>H</bold>, yellow arrow), with an extensive VZ surface presence by e17.5 (<bold>J</bold>; yellow arrow). Additionally, at e17.5, a large number of fate-mapped mutant cells were abnormally retained in an enlarged RL (<bold>J</bold>).

In <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mutants, however, dramatic mismigration of the posterior-fated RL lineage was evident as early as e14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

We also expect that at least some of these centrally-located ectopic Purkinje cells were the result of aborted outward radial migration of Purkinje cells out of the VZ due to the disruption of the radial scaffold in <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants, a phenotype that we previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We observed less severe Purkinje cell alignment defects in postnatal <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> cerebella.

Importantly, a recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delahaye et al.

No posterior fossa anomalies were detected either by prenatal ultrasound or autopsy in these control cases. Low magnification images of the H and E stained cerebellar vermis from the control cases indicated normal development of the folia. All histogenic layers of the developing cerebellum appeared normal. The EGL was of uniform thickness across the cerebella and the Purkinje cells formed a continuous multilayer Purkinje cell plate under the EGL from the anterior to posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>). In all del chr 6p25 cases, striking foliation defects of varying severity were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–F</xref>). In the cerebellum with the least severe DWM phenotype, DW1, the posterior-most lobule, lobule X, was only partially formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,G</xref>). However, the anterior lobules appeared relatively normal. The defects in cerebellar foliation were far more severe in the other two del chr 6p25 cases, DW2 and DW3. In both cases, the vermis was hypoplastic with the most severe hypoplasia and dysplasia readily evident in the posterior vermis, despite obvious artefactual tissue damage. Yet, even the lobules in the anterior vermis were not readily distinguishable, with rudimentary fissures defining several lobules of variably indistinct identity. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E,F</xref>).

For example, at the base of the fissure between lobules IV and V, an ectopic calbindin+ Purkinje cell cluster was evident. Just above this, numerous proliferating Ki67+ Pax6+ GCPs were also apparent. Similar ectopic clusters of Purkinje cells and GCPs were also observed in the other two DW cases (data not shown). A closer analysis of lamination and cellular morphology using calbindin immunohistochemistry to mark Purkinje cells revealed extensive disruptions in all 3 DW cases. In the control cases, the Purkinje cell layer was well-defined, consisting of a distinct multilayer band of cells beneath the molecular layer, above the internal granule layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). In all three del chr 6p25 cases, Purkinje cells were located in a highly disorganized diffuse layer beneath the EGL.

Higher magnification of calbindin-stained sections revealed that in all 3 DW cases, Purkinje cells also lacked their characteristic dendritic arborization, indicating at least a delay in Purkinje cell development. This was consistent with delayed fissure formation in DW2 and DW3. This may indicate a more fundamental abnormality, since Purkinje cell development was abnormal even in DW1 where global developmental delays in foliation were less apparent (Compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–C</xref> with D-F).

Of these, <italic>FOXC1</italic> is the best studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>), with mutant mouse data demonstrating several important roles for <italic>Foxc1</italic> in early mouse cerebellar anlage development. Notably, <italic>Foxc1</italic> expression is largely limited to the posterior fossa mesenchyme rather than the developing cerebellum itself. Complete loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic> in mice (homozygous null animals) leads to loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic>-dependent expression of SDF1α, a secreted factor in the posterior mesenchyme. We previously showed that SDF1α acts via its receptor, Cxcr4, which is expressed in cerebellar radial glial cells and is required for both proliferation of these VZ progenitors in addition to maintenance of their radial fibers, which are the migration scaffold for cerebellar GABAergic neurons to reach the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>).

Finally, we directly compared the developing mouse <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant phenotypes with very rare human del chr 6p25 fetal cases, the first reported in-depth analysis of fetal DWM samples. Strikingly, the human fetal DWM cases and our mouse models share very similar developmental pathogenesis, validating our mouse models and demonstrating that many of the key developmental mechanisms are conserved between the two species.</p><p>Although cerebellar vermis dysplasia is highly variable in MRI of postnatal human del chr 6p25 DWM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delahaye et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), all three fetal cases presented here have a prominent elongation of a dysplastic posterior vermis ‘tail’. This ‘tail sign’ has recently been proposed to be a pathognomonic feature for all DWM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bernardo et al., 2015</xref>), irrespective of those with a known genetic cause, such as del chr 6p25. Strikingly, the human DWM tail is highly reminiscent of the partially formed, unpaired posterior lobule we observed in the postnatal <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mutant mouse cerebellar vermis. This phenotype appears to be unique as we are unaware of any other mouse mutant with this foliation defect. Through lineage tracing experiments, we showed extensive ectopic migration of posterior-fated cerebellar RL descendants in both <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> and <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. These ectopic paths included the mutant VZ. Cerebellar progenitor fate switches have been implicated in human cerebellar agenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pascual et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Millen et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore tested if the mutant ectopic RL derived cells in the VZ or anlage showed evidence of a RL to VZ fate switch. However, all <italic>Lmx1a-cre</italic> lineage labeled cells maintained Pax6 expression indicative of a RL lineage identity. We conclude that the <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant posterior vermis phenotype is mostly due to misguided migration of RL-derived cells.</p><p>SDF1α expressed in the head mesenchyme is a direct transcriptional target of Foxc1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Zarbalis et al., 2012</xref>). We have demonstrated that loss of SDF1α can rescue <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> cerebellar phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>). At e12.5, when Foxc1 expression is initiated in the posterior fossa mesenchyme overlying the cerebellum, SDF1α expression is significantly downregulated in both <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> embryos at e12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aldinger et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Since SDF1α is expressed in the mouse posterior fossa mesenchyme prior to e12.5 ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Lein et al., 2007</xref>], Website: © 2015 Allen Institute for Brain Science. Allen Mouse Brain Atlas [Internet]. Available from: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://mouse.brain-map.org.">http://mouse.brain-map.org.</ext-link>), we conclude that <italic>Foxc1</italic> is required to maintain, but not initiate, SDF1α. This maintenance role is key to understanding the increased vulnerability of the posterior vermis in <italic>Foxc1</italic> mouse mutants and human del chr 6p25 DWM. Previous studies have shown that SDF1α secreted by embryonic meningeal cells embryonically acts as a chemoattractant, regulating the tangential migration of Cxcr4+ GCPs away from the RL to form the EGL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Haldipur et al., 2014</xref>). The cerebellar RL generates assorted glutamatergic brain stem nuclei and cerebellar nuclei in the mouse at e10.5 and anteriorly fated GCPs just before e12.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Machold and Fishell, 2005</xref>). By e12.5, only posterior vermis-fated GCPs and unipolar brush cells remain in the RL to emerge over the remaining days of mouse embryogenesis. Our new data clearly demonstrates that these late derivatives are absolutely dependent on continued SDF1α expression which itself is dependent on <italic>Foxc1</italic>. Our data also confirm previous studies showing a role for SDF1α as a chemoattractant in the developing pia to maintain GCPs within the proliferating outer zone of the developing EGL adjacent to the pial surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hartmann et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Wiegand et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Zou et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Reiss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Vilz et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Tiveron and Cremer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yu et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutants, SDF1α is not maintained at appropriate levels, leading to an additional phenotype of ectopic proliferating EGL cells within the cerebellar anlage in both the anterior and posterior vermis. Our results add to the growing body of evidence that the posterior fossa mesenchyme, through SDF1α expression, preserves the structure of both the RL and the nascent EGL. By ensuring that cells correctly exit the RL and remain within the GCP niche of the EGL, the mesenchyme regulates the proper formation and lamination of cerebellar folia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20898.010</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Summary of Foxc1-dependent molecular and cellular mechanisms contributing to del chr 6p25 cerebellar phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of a paramedial sagittal section of the embryonic mouse cerebellum. In the wild-type cerebellum, mesenchymal Foxc1 controls the expression of chemokine SDF1α which binds to its receptor Cxcr4 which is strongly expressed in the RL, EGL, and VZ. SDF1α functions as a chemoattractant to Lmx1a+ (red) and Lmx1a- (blue) GCPs exiting the RL to form the EGL, ensuring that these progenitors exit the RL and remain confined to the EGL underneath the pial surface. SDF1α also controls the migration of cells out of the VZ, acting as a chemoattractant. It is also required for the maintenance of radial glial fibers, which act as scaffolds for this migration. (<bold>B</bold>) In the <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Foxc1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic> mice, deletion of <italic>Foxc1</italic> leads to a significant downregulation of mesenchymal SDF1α by e12.5. This reduction results in excessive retention of posterior-fated cells in the RL and ectopic migration of cells out of the RL (red arrows) and precocious migration of GCPs from the EGL into the cerebellar anlage (blue arrows). Proliferation, migration, and VZ-derived neurons and radial glia are also negatively affected.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20898.010">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20898.010</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20898-fig5-v2"/></fig></p><p>To our knowledge, this report represents the first in-depth analysis of human fetal DWM. Additionally, since the cases of human del chr 6p25 we analyzed are specifically modeled by our <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice, a direct phenotypic comparison between the two species with correlated genotypes was possible. Direct comparisons between developing human fetal tissue with known genetic lesions and mouse developmental models of comparable genotypes are extremely rare in literature. All three human del chr 6p25 fetal DWM fetal cases we assessed here exhibited a striking dysplasia of the posterior vermis and also had ectopically located GCPs and Purkinje cells and dysmorphic and sparse Bergmann glial fibers. The phenotypes observed in the del chr 6p25 cerebella are similar to those observed in the <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mouse, providing ample evidence of the validity of our <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic> DWM models.</p><p>It is necessary to state the difficulties and drawbacks of this study whilst highlighting the legitimacy and need for such analyses. First, it is clear that some of the mechanisms we have attributed to posterior vermis hypoplasia in human DWM based on our <italic>Foxc1</italic> mouse models have not been directly validated in the human cerebellum. The human fetal DWM cases presented here are snapshots of three separate dysmorphic cerebella at specific stages of development (18–21 gw). Given the clinical constraints of human fetal tissue research and the rarity of genetically defined malformation cases, a thorough study of multiple stages of abnormal prenatal cerebellar development will be nearly impossible. We cannot define the developmental progression of these specific cases with their respective phenotypes, nor can we predict their phenotypic outcomes if the pregnancies had continued. Further, since DWM is not currently readily diagnosed by imaging until 18 gw, it is likely impossible to obtain earlier cases. However, human fetal analysis, as we have presented here, is essential because it is the only analysis that is possible. Animal models are required to investigate potential mechanisms and our current work clearly validates our <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mouse models. Since our mouse models indicate that human del chr 6p25 DWM is largely due to a disruption of early mesenchymal signaling and aberrant rhombic lip development, a long term goal is to develop human fetal imaging technology and protocols targeted to these phenotypes to facilitate earlier detection and perhaps provide therapeutic intervention.</p><p>In conclusion, this study presents an analysis of the changes that take place during mouse and human cerebellar development following the loss of <italic>Foxc1</italic> and subsequent disruptions in mesenchymal signaling. We show that early disruption in mesenchymal signaling has immediate effects, including mismigration of Purkinje cells and GCPs from both the RL and EGL. There are both direct and indirect repercussions on later developmental events that lead to abnormal foliation, posterior vermis hypoplasia, developmental delays, and abnormal layering of Purkinje cells. Together our human and mouse analyses provide compelling evidence to support our model of Foxc1 control of cerebellar development and developmental pathogenesis of <italic>FOXC1</italic>-dependent DWM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Notably, however, human del chr 6p25 DWM cases are rare. An essential question remains as to whether the key features and mechanisms we have elucidated for <italic>Foxc1</italic>-dependent DWM are generalizable to all forms of DWM, regardless of the underlying genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>All human studies were approved by Institutional Review Boards at all participating institutions.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Robb Krumlauf as a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary and essential revisions:</p><p>This manuscript details phenotypic overlaps in the developing cerebellum of <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice and human fetus with del chr 6p25 supporting the idea that <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice are an excellent model for Dandy-Walker malformation (DWM). The authors have identified a previously uncharacterized migration defect of granule cell progenitors in <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant mice suggesting that <italic>Foxc1</italic> regulates expansion and foliation of the posterior lobe via signals originated from the posterior fossa mesenchyme in mice and humans. This study is novel by providing in-depth and direct comparisons between the human fetal brain and mouse models for disease DWM and is also valuable for insight on the degree of conservation in mechanisms controlling cerebellar development between humans and mice. Therefore, it is worthy of consideration for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are a number of specific concerns shared by the reviewers primarily related problems in the depth of the characterization of mouse <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebella that must be addressed before publication can be considered.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) The authors show that many tdTomato-labeled descendants of the Lmx1a lineage are abnormally present in the cerebellar ventricular zone (VZ). The data provided are insufficient to determine if <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutation causes a cell-fate change in the cerebellar VZ. It is also unclear whether the mutation affects the expression of Lmx1a or abnormal migration of the Lmx1 lineage. The authors claim that Pax6 is present in most tdTomato+ cells, and argue against abnormal cell fate specification. However, the quality of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref> is too poor to support this conclusion. The authors need to provide improved Pax6/tdTomato double labeling and examine additional markers, for example, Zic1 for granule cells and Sox9 or Sox2 for VZ radial glia. In addition, short-term fate mapping or examination of Lmx1a expression should be provided to show whether <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutation affects Lmx1a expression.</p><p>2) It is unclear how abnormal migration of the Lmx1a-lineage causes the unusual foliation defect in the <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebellar vermis. Do the misrouted granule cell progenitors fail to proliferate? Is the VZ in the posterior cerebellar anlage compromised in the mutants?</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, a conspicuous phenotype of <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebella seems to be the increased contribution of tdTomoto+ cells to the choroid plexus (which appears larger than the control). Is this phenotype real? As the rhombic lip (also known as the germinal trillion) links to the VZ, external granule layer, and choroid plexus, the authors may examine if the rhombic lip increases contribution to the choroid plexus at the expense of the VZ and EGL in <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebella.</p><p>4) Why are only the late RL derivatives affected? I am not entirely sure an explanation is given for this, and this is critically important because, apparently, the same population is affected in mouse and human. Is this a timing issue, or a gene expression/function issue? Either way, it appears that a highly conserved feature of cerebellum development is affected in both species.</p><p>5) This study primarily focuses on the posterior lobe (lobule X) defects and needs to be expanded to discuss other defects. The mouse <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (panel I) and human <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (panels D and E) indicates the anterior lobule is also severely affected. Based on the limited histological data on the DWM cerebella (including the previously published ones), the claim that the partially formed posterior lobe in the <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutant cerebella echoes the posterior vermis DW &quot;tail sign&quot; seems to be an overstatement. The Bernardo et al. paper (2015) does not explicitly claim a link between the &quot;tail sign&quot; and defects specific to the posterior lobe of DW cerebellar vermis. The authors do not make a clear connection between the &quot;tail sign&quot; defined by MRI imaging and the histological defect specific to the posterior lobe. However, they state in the Abstract that &quot;Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobe echoing the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging studies.&quot; Other defects, such as abnormal arrangement of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial fibers and abnormal folding of the cerebellar cortex, are quite generic phenotypes.</p><p>6) Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> it looks to me that there may be more Cre marked cells in the mutant posterior cerebellum compared to control. Is this true? And, it also looks like equal numbers of cells adjacent to the &quot;green&quot; VZ line in mutant and control. Apologies if I have missed it, but is there a quantification for these data? It is hard to appreciate that there are ectopic RL derived cells near the VZ.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20898.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Specific comments:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors show that many tdTomato-labeled descendants of the Lmx1a lineage are abnormally present in the cerebellar ventricular zone (VZ).

This strengthens our conclusion that the phenotype we observe in the <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutants is a result of abnormal distribution of the <italic>Lmx1a</italic> RL lineage.</p><p>We replaced the panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref> with better images at earlier stages to show a stream of abnormally migrating cells. The new images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K–R</xref>) clearly indicate that none of the Lmx1a-Cre td Tomato+ cells migrating away from the RL stain for markers of VZ progenitors (Sox9) or VZ derivatives (Pax2, Skor2). The mismigrating tdTomato+ cells continue to express Pax6 indicating that they retain their RL and granule cell identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O–P</xref>). A subset of these Pax6 positive cells continues to divide but some begin to differentiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q–R</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear how abnormal migration of the Lmx1a-lineage causes the unusual foliation defect in the Foxc1 mutant cerebellar vermis. Do the misrouted granule cell progenitors fail to proliferate? Is the VZ in the posterior cerebellar anlage compromised in the mutants?</italic> </p><p>The direct link between abnormal posterior foliation and RL abnormalities is not entirely clear, however, as we showed in Chizhikov et al., 2010, PNAS, PMID#20498066, the posterior vermis is a derivative of the late RL. The late RL is compromised in both <italic>Foxc1<sup>-/-</sup></italic>and <italic>FoxC1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>mutants.</p><p>A large subset of the misrouted GCPs continues to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C–D</xref>). However, we observe that many of the <italic>Lmx1aCre</italic> td-Tomato+ cells that fail to migrate out of the RL eventually differentiate precociously within the RL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2R</xref>). A combination of mismigration and precocious differentiation depletes the progenitors that are required to form the posterior vermis, thus leading to the formation of severely hypoplastic posterior lobules.</p><p>We have now included data demonstrating that the VZ is not compromised in <italic>FoxC1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, we have previously published that the VZ is affected in the null mutants (Haldipur et al., 2014, eLife, PMID#25513817).</p><p><italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, a conspicuous phenotype of Foxc1 mutant cerebella seems to be the increased contribution of tdTomoto+ cells to the choroid plexus (which appears larger than the control). Is this phenotype real? As the rhombic lip (also known as the germinal trillion) links to the VZ, external granule layer, and choroid plexus, the authors may examine if the rhombic lip increases contribution to the choroid plexus at the expense of the VZ and EGL in Foxc1 mutant cerebella.</italic> </p><p>The phenotype described by the reviewer is indeed real. We do find a much larger choroid plexus in the mutants (Aldinger et al., 2009, Nature Genetics, PMID#19668217). We are unable to directly test this hypothesis due to the lack of RL-specific Cre mouse models or gene enhancer elements with RL expression not also accompanied by choroid plexus expression.</p><p><italic>4) Why are only the late RL derivatives affected? I am not entirely sure an explanation is given for this, and this is critically important because, apparently, the same population is affected in mouse and human. Is this a timing issue, or a gene expression/function issue? Either way, it appears that a highly conserved feature of cerebellum development is affected in both species.</italic> </p><p>In the Discussion, we described our hypothesis for why we think late RL derivatives are more susceptible to decreased <italic>Foxc1</italic> expression (third paragraph). Anterior-fated lineages migrate out of the RL prior to e13.5 and are hence less susceptible to the effects of <italic>Foxc1</italic> deletion. We have clarified this in the text.</p><p><italic>5) This study primarily focuses on the posterior lobe (lobule X) defects and needs to be expanded to discuss other defects. The mouse <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (panel I) and human <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (panels D and E) indicates the anterior lobule is also severely affected. Based on the limited histological data on the DWM cerebella (including the previously published ones), the claim that the partially formed posterior lobe in the Foxc1 mutant cerebella echoes the posterior vermis DW &quot;tail sign&quot; seems to be an overstatement. The Bernardo et al. paper (2015) does not explicitly claim a link between the &quot;tail sign&quot; and defects specific to the posterior lobe of DW cerebellar vermis. The authors do not make a clear connection between the &quot;tail sign&quot; defined by MRI imaging and the histological defect specific to the posterior lobe. However, they state in the Abstract that &quot;Particularly striking is the presence of a partially formed posterior lobe echoing the posterior vermis DW 'tail sign' observed in human imaging studies.&quot; Other defects, such as abnormal arrangement of Purkinje cells and Bergmann glial fibers and abnormal folding of the cerebellar cortex, are quite generic phenotypes.</italic> </p><p>Indeed, we observe anterior defects. However, the anterior lobe is relatively normal in terms of histogenesis compared to the posterior vermis, which is far more hypoplastic and dysplastic. We chose to focus on the posterior vermis since, to our knowledge, the posterior <italic>FoxC1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>foliation is unique and unusual, and the hypoplastic posterior vermis with a partially formed unpaired posterior lobule seems to be a common link between our mouse model, the human samples presented in our study, as well as the limited number of Dandy-Walker pathology based studies (Bernardo et al., 2015, Prenat Diagn, PMID#26448595; Russo and Fallet-Bianco, 2007, J Child Neurol, PMID#17621537, Kapur et al., 2009, Birth Defects Res A Clin Mol Teratol, PMID# 19441098). The reviewer is correct in pointing out that the tail sign described by Bernardo et al. is not linked to posterior vermis hypoplasia in their study. However, based on the limited H&amp;E images presented in Bernardo et al., it is clear that the tail sign they are referring to is the posterior lobule, which is clearly unpaired and partially formed. This is very much like what we observe in <italic>FoxC1<sup>hith/hith</sup></italic>mutants and is readily seen in the human DW1 control presented here. Our mouse functional studies also show that this specific disruption of patterning and foliation in the posterior vermis is due to RL abnormalities.</p><p><italic>6) Based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> it looks to me that there may be more Cre marked cells in the mutant posterior cerebellum compared to control. Is this true? And, it also looks like equal numbers of cells adjacent to the &quot;green&quot; VZ line in mutant and control. Apologies if I have missed it, but is there a quantification for these data? It is hard to appreciate that there are ectopic RL derived cells near the VZ.</italic> </p><p>We have replaced the image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> with a better image that is a more accurate indicator of the distribution of Cre+ cells in the mutant. We do think that there are more tdTomato+ cells along the VZ of the mutant cerebellum when compared to WT, although to better appreciate the extent of mismigration of RL derivatives in the mutant, we now quantified the number of tdTomato+ cells that are found outside the RL and EGL area from e14.5-e17.5 in midsagittal sections. The numbers in the WT are representative of the unipolar brush cell population as well as some GNs that have differentiated and migrated into the IGL. However, we do see a striking increase in the number of tdTomato+ cells outside the RL and EGL in <italic>Foxc1</italic> mutants; many of which are ectopic in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
