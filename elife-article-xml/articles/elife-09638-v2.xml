Despite their importance, these components are not absolutely conserved between parts of the tree of life, suggesting that cells can evolve to perform the same biological functions with different proteins. We evolved <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> for 1000 generations without the important polarity gene <italic>BEM1</italic>. Initially the <italic>bem1∆</italic> lineages rapidly increase in fitness and then slowly reach &gt;90% of the fitness of their <italic>BEM1</italic> ancestors at the end of the evolution. Sequencing their genomes and monitoring polarization reveals a common evolutionary trajectory, with a fixed sequence of adaptive mutations, each improving cell polarization by inactivating proteins. Our results show that organisms can be evolutionarily robust to physiologically destructive perturbations and suggest that recovery by gene inactivation can lead to rapid divergence in the parts list for cell biologically important functions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09638.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09638.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09638.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells use the genetic instructions provided by genes in particular combinations called ‘modules’ to perform particular jobs. Very different organisms can share many of the same modules because certain abilities are fundamental to the survival of all cells and so they have been retained over the course of evolution. That said, these modules may not necessarily involve the same genes because it is often possible to achieve the same result using different components.</p><p>One way to study how those modules can diversify is to deliberately disrupt one of the genes in a module, and observe how the organism and its descendants respond over many generations. Other genes in these organisms may acquire genetic mutations that enable the genes to take on the role of the missing protein. However, the removal of a single component can be detrimental to the survival of the organisms or may affect many different processes. This can make it difficult to understand what is going on.</p><p>A gene called <italic>BEM1</italic> is crucial for yeast cells to establish polarity, that is, to allow the different sides of a cell to become distinct from one another. This activity is essential for the yeast to replicate itself. Previous studies have shown that the <italic>BEM1</italic> gene had a different role in other species of fungi, which suggests that yeast may have other genes that previously assumed the role that <italic>BEM1</italic> does now. In this study, Laan et al. removed <italic>BEM1</italic> from yeast and allowed the population of mutant cells to evolve for a thousand generations. The approach differs from previous studies because Laan et al. deliberately selected for yeast that had acquired multiple genetic mutations that can together almost fully compensate for the loss of <italic>BEM1</italic>.</p><p>Initially, the mutant cells grew very slowly, were abnormal in shape and likely to burst open. However, by the end of the experiment, the cells were able to grow almost as well as the original yeast cells had before the gene deletion. Genetic analysis revealed that the deletion of <italic>BEM1</italic> triggers the inactivation of other genes that are also involved in the regulation of polarity, which largely restored the ability of the disrupted polarity module to work. This restoration follows a ‘reproducible trajectory’, as the same genes were switched off in the same order in different populations of yeast that were studied at the same time.</p><p>The work is an example of reproducible evolution, whereby a specific order of changes to gene activity repeatedly enables cells with severe defects in important processes to adapt and restore a gene module, using whatever components they have left. The next challenge will be to understand how the particular roles of important modules affect their adaptability.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09638.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09638.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>experimental evolution</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>cell polarity</kwd><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>multi step evolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek (NWO)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laan</surname><given-names>Liedewij</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LT000739-2010-C</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Laan</surname><given-names>Liedewij</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM06783</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Murray</surname><given-names>Andrew W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deletion of one gene can lead to inactivation of other genes which restore a perturbed cellular function but change the epistatic interactions and the dynamics of the responsible module.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Advances in cell biology, genetics, and systems biology have led to substantial understanding of how cells perform complex tasks precisely. In cell polarization and movement, a biochemical and biophysical picture is emerging of how those complex functional modules self-organize to accomplish their functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Howard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goehring and Grill, 2013</xref>). Surprisingly, components that are essential for a module in well-studied model organisms can be absent in evolutionarily distant organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmiller et al., 2012</xref>), even though the modules must perform the same tasks. This observation suggests that complex modules reorganize during evolution, either to accommodate changing requirements or to respond to the chance loss of components during population bottlenecks, when selection against deleterious mutations is greatly diminished.</p><p>One approach to understanding the evolution of functional modules is to compare them between different species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carvalho-Santos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azimzadeh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vleugel et al., 2012</xref>). In closely related, inter-fertile species, genetic analysis can reveal the mutations that account for functional differences, but not their temporal order, and even this level of detail cannot be achieved in more distantly related species. Experimental microbial evolution circumvents these problems: sequencing and genetic analysis identifies the mutations responsible for the selected phenotype and storing and analyzing intermediate steps reveals the order in which mutations occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lenski and Travisano, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lang et al., 2013</xref>). In principle, these tools should lead to mechanistic understanding of evolutionary trajectories, but selections for faster growth or novel functions typically produce adaptive mutations in multiple functional modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kvitek and Sherlock, 2013</xref>), whose relationship to each other is hard to explain. Are there multiple solutions to the selection, resulting in independent additive solutions in different cellular modules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Khan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koschwanez et al., 2013</xref>), or are those mutations (and the modules they lay in) coupled in an unknown way (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wildenberg and Murray, 2014</xref>)?</p><p>We focused selective pressure by allowing populations to evolve after deleting an important gene in a well-described module. This approach differs from traditional suppressor screens, which isolate single compensatory mutations, by selecting for combinations of mutations, which together significantly increase fitness. The module we perturbed was polarization in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slaughter et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Klunder et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu and Lew, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuo et al., 2014</xref>). Polarization involves selection of an axis of polarity, followed by the asymmetric organization of cytoskeletal elements and membranous organelles and cell wall growth along this axis. Yeast cells polarize and bud by localizing and activating the small GTPase, Cdc42, at a single site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Slaughter et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wu and Lew, 2013</xref>). In haploid cells, polarization is directed by a historical mark deposited in the previous cell cycle, but even when the mark is absent, yeast cells still polarize efficiently, albeit at a random location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chant and Herskowitz, 1991</xref>). Under these conditions, symmetry breaking depends on at least two pathways: (1) an actin-based mechanism based on the positive feedback between actin-mediated delivery of Cdc42 to the plasma membrane and actin polymerization stimulated by membrane-bound Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wedlich-Soldner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marco et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Slaughter et al., 2013</xref>), and (2) an actin independent, Turing type mechanism that depends on interactions amongst proteins that regulate the activity and localization of Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Howell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Freisinger et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smith et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We strongly perturbed yeast polarization by removing Bem1, a regulator of Cdc42, which recruits the guanine exchange factor (GEF) Cdc24 as well as Cdc42 to the membrane where Cdc24 activates membrane-bound Cdc42. We decided to delete Bem1 because previous research suggests that this protein is a relatively young component in polarity establishment that had a different role in ancestral fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Semighini and Harris, 2008</xref>). Deleting this component of polarity could thus reveal other alternative, more evolutionarily ancient polarization modules.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09638.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>BEM1</italic> is an important polarity gene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon showing the components of the machinery for cell polarization relevant for this work.

We imaged <italic>bem1∆</italic> and wild-type spores as they germinated and followed several subsequent cell divisions (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), where we measured the time of budding as a proxy for polarization: cells cannot bud without a successful polarization event. The majority of <italic>bem1∆</italic> cells (28/35 vs 0/41 for wild-type cells) did not polarize within 500 min but grew isotropically resulting in very large cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) that often lysed (16/35) (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). The <italic>bem1∆</italic> cells that did polarize, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>polarize</italic></sub><italic>_</italic><sub><italic>bem1∆</italic></sub> = 0.23, <italic>N</italic> = 35), polarize fast, in contrast to wild-type cells, which show a wider distribution of polarization times, but always eventually polarize successfully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <italic>P</italic><sub><italic>polarize_wt</italic></sub> = 1, <italic>N</italic> = 41). We used a single <italic>bem1∆</italic> colony, as well as a control, wild-type colony, as the starting point for our evolution experiments. From both colonies, we started with 10 wild-type and 10 <italic>bem1∆</italic> cultures, which we evolved for one thousand generations by serial dilutions, regularly freezing down a sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and see Materials and methods), resulting (due to contamination) in nine surviving <italic>bem1∆</italic> lineages and seven wild-type lineages. We characterized their phenotypic trajectories by measuring the population growth rate at different time points. The initial growth rate of the <italic>bem1∆</italic> lineages was approximately 12 times lower than the wild-type growth rate. By the end of the experiment, however, the <italic>bem1∆</italic> cells grew at almost the rate of their wild-type ancestors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Two <italic>bem1∆</italic> lines, A1 and A2, are plotted individually because they are discussed in more detail later in the article, and one line, A8, became diploid and was excluded from further analysis. We examined how the cell size distribution, which is an approximation for polarization dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>), changed during the experiment: cells that take longer to polarize are on average larger than cells that polarize fast because yeast cells continue to grow during polarity establishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goranov et al., 2009</xref>). We measured cell size distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, see Materials and methods) and fitted them to a log normal distribution to determine the mode, as a measure of the dominant cell size, and standard deviation, which we take as an approximation for noisiness in polarization dynamics.

The growth rate of line A2 is indistinguishable from the reconstructed strain, which carries gene deletions in the genes that were mutated in our experiments, suggesting that we found the mutations that confer fitness to this lineage, but line A1 grows slightly faster than the quadruple mutant, suggesting that it may contain additional adaptive mutations.</p><p>What does the successful reconstruction tell us? First, it reveals epistasis, in particular, sign epistasis (a mutation switching from being beneficial to deleterious) for some combinations of mutations. If mutations are added in the order they occurred in during the evolution, each successive mutation increases the fitness of the resulting strain, but adding mutations in different orders can reduce fitness. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>): adding the <italic>bem2∆</italic> mutation increases the growth rate of <italic>bem1∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆</italic> cells, but the same mutation reduces or has no effect on the fitness of all other tested genotypes. Another example of epistasis is the changing dependence of the cells on <italic>BEM1</italic>: the polarization module evolves from requiring Bem1, in wild-type strains, to being slightly impaired by the presence of functional Bem1 in a <italic>bem2∆ bem3∆ nrp1∆</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adaptive mutations alter the dynamics of cell polarization</title><p>Reconstruction allowed us to examine how different combinations of mutations alter the dynamics of the polarization module.

Under strong selective pressure, the larger target size for mutations that inactivate proteins favors evolutionary trajectories that remove components from modules over those that quantitatively alter their properties. As long as modules contain components, like Bem2 and Bem3, which alter the quantitative behavior of other proteins, like Cdc42 and other small GTPases, removing the regulators is the equivalent of rarer mutations that would change the biochemical parameters of central components of the pathway.

Adaptation by loss-of-function mutations has also been observed in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maurelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliven and Maurelli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Souza et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">2015</xref>).</p><p>In our work, the selected mutations do not alter the structure of an existing protein to allow it to play Bem1's role of physically linking Cdc42 to Cdc24. Instead, other mutations that increase the half-life of Cdc42-GTP (and possibly other small G proteins) remove the need to hold Cdc24 and Cdc42 close to each other. We suspect that the differing effects of removing genes and altering gene dosage may control the type of mutations that allow cells to adapt to large genetic perturbations. If increasing the dosage of genes can reverse the effects of the perturbation, cells may recover by becoming aneuploid, as observed when duplicating chromosome XVI increases the dosage of two genes (<italic>MKK2</italic> and <italic>RLM1</italic>) that help compensate for the absence of type II myosin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rancati et al., 2008</xref>). In contrast, if removing inhibitors will increase fitness, point mutations that inactivate the inhibitors will be selected, as we observed. Investigating how cells recover from other perturbations in these and different pathways will test the validity of this speculation, reveal the mechanistic details underlying evolutionary change, and improve our understanding of how the self-organizing properties of modules affect the course of evolution.</p><p>Our results may help to explain the surprising observation that certain eukaryotic lineages lack extremely well-conserved pathways, such as the absence of the anaphase promoting complex from <italic>Giardia</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourguechon et al., 2013</xref>) or conserved kinetochore proteins from kinetoplasids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akiyoshi and Gull, 2014</xref>). Although less in known about the evolutionary history of polarity proteins, recent studies suggest that the components of this pathway also vary substantially. In filamentous fungi, Cdc42 is not essential because its function is shared with Rac1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). However, the deployment of the Cdc42 module and the Rac1 module for critical morphogenetic functions is surprisingly different between closely related species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Harris, 2011</xref>). Our study shows that removing one component of a conserved pathway selects for the inactivation of others. If this process was accompanied by the recruitment of novel proteins, it could ultimately lead to an evolutionary shift that replaced one module with another unrelated one that performed the same function.</p><p>One objection to this hypothesis is that it would be very hard to fix a mutation as deleterious as <italic>bem1∆</italic>. There are ways of countering the objection: severely defective mutations could be fixed in population bottlenecks that accompany speciation; secondly, and maybe more likely, mutations that removed important components could be pleiotropic, offering advantages in novel environments that were similar in magnitude to the costs they impose on strongly conserved core functions; and thirdly, previously selected mutations in the same or related pathways could make the defects associated with the removal of a component less severe.</p><p>Because of the difficulty of inferring events as ancient as the ones that rearranged the kinetochore of kinetoplastids or made the anaphase promoting complex dispensable in <italic>Giardia</italic>, it is impossible to say whether it was the loss of genes that inactivated existing pathways, or some other event that triggered the sequence of changes that led particular lineages to use different proteins to perform functions that appeared early in eukaryotic evolution. Despite our inability to reconstruct these processes, there is evidence for individual steps in the process of functional reorganization. These include the loss of widely conserved genes in individual evolutionary lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bergmiller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gourguechon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drinnenberg et al., 2014</xref>), the loss of genes present in ancestral species during evolutionary diversification (e.g., the loss of 88 genes in the descent of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> from an ancestor that existed 100 Mya ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2009</xref>]), and the recruitment of new functions by adaptations that alter the function of existing genes and create genes de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neme and Tautz, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2014</xref>).</p><p>Our evolution experiment created a related set of rapid polarizing mechanisms. Deciphering the physical mechanisms of polarity establishment in all the different combinations of mutants will teach us about evolution of functional modules. However, it will also reveal more about cell biology of polarization. First, it can help to identify the role of new genes in polarity establishment; previous work has implicated Nrp1 in RNA binding, ribosome biogenesis, and the formation of stress granules, whereas our experiments demonstrate that it regulates cell polarization, directly or indirectly. High-throughput studies, at least as indicated on the yeast genome website SGD (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.yeastgenome.org/">www.yeastgenome.org</ext-link>) have not shown physical or genetic interactions between <italic>NRP1</italic> and any of the currently known polarity genes. <italic>BEM1</italic>, <italic>BEM2</italic>, and <italic>BEM3</italic> as well as their genetic interactions have been measured and implicated in polarity establishment before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koh et al., 2010</xref>). However, the lack of information about <italic>NRP1</italic> made it impossible to predict the positive effect of the <italic>BEM2</italic> deletion on polarity establishment in the absence of <italic>BEM1</italic> and <italic>BEM3</italic>.</p><p>Second, by biophysically investigating how cells recover from the deletion of <italic>BEM</italic>1 as well as other perturbations in the polarity pathway, we will be able to distill which parts of polarization mechanisms, rather than molecules, are essential for proper function. Cell polarization is a complicated, dynamical process, thus it may be more important to alter quantitative parameters of the overall process, regardless of the gene whose mutation produces the change, than it is to alter the behavior of a particular protein.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains/media</title><p>The W303 strain background was used for all experiments. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref> provides a detailed list of each strain used.

This approach allowed us to select and monitor barely viable mutants from the moment they were created, and allowed us to observe the occurrence of the first and subsequent suppressor mutations. Diploid strains were sporulated in liquid culture by growing them to saturation in YPD at 30°C. Afterwards they were diluted into YEP (2% peptone and 1% yeast-extract) with 2% potassium acetate for 12 hr at 30°C, washed with water, resuspended in 2% potassium acetate and grown at 25°C for 3–5 days. The sporulation efficiency was checked under the microscope. If the sporulation efficiency was high enough (&gt;95%) 1.5 ml of spores were spun down, resuspended in 500 µl Zymolyase solution (10 μg/ml Zymolyase in TE (10 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, pH 7.5)) and incubated at 36°C for 60 min, to digest the ascus. Afterwards, the spores were spun down, resuspended in 500 µl 0.1% SDS +0.1% Triton in TE and incubated at 36°C for 30 min, to disrupt the membranes of remnant diploid cells. Subsequently, the spores were vigorously vortexed and the spore concentration was measured with a Coulter Counter (Z2 analyser; Beckman Coulter, Inc., Danvers, MA). 10<sup>1</sup>, 10<sup>2</sup>, and 10<sup>3</sup> spores were plated on YPD plates (3× per condition), to get an estimate of the total number of viable spores.

The phenotype was determined by replica plating colonies that grew from single spores to all the different plates necessary to detect the different markers (figure supplement 3BC). Single spore colonies were generated by spotting individual spores with a FACS cell sorter (MoFlo Legacy, Dako Cytomation/Beckman Coulter) on YPD plates. 81 spores were spotted per plate on a total of 10 plates. After 2 days, the plates were imaged to measure the colony size. Calibration experiments showed that in this period the colony size is a good approximation for the growth rate of the cells in the colony. Subsequently, the colonies were replica plated to various drop-out and drug plates to determine their genotype. Home written software in Matlab was used to determine the colony size of every colony and to combine it with its genotype. From this data, the average colony size per genotype and the standard deviation between the colony sizes was calculated. In addition, the percentage of surviving colonies was calculated by dividing the number of observed colonies by the number of expected colonies*100%. The error bar is the statistical error (% surviving colonies/√N, N is number of observed colonies).

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior editor), Yitzhak Pilpel (guest Reviewing editor), and two reviewers. While there is a consensus that the work is intriguing, and done and written properly, some revision is requested. In particular, as you will see below, the reviewers would like you to better explain the relevance of your study to natural evolutionary scenarios.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All referees and the editors agree that the work is exciting. The reproducibility of the evolutionary adaptations, the identity of the mutated genes, and more strikingly, the order of their appearance, are certainly very interesting, especially since a sound epistatic basis for such order is provided.</p><p>Yet, both referees questioned the relevance to natural evolution. As clearly put by referee #1: “And it is not even clear whether a Bem1 deletion strain would ever get the chance to evolve in a natural setting as it might be immediately out competed by neighboring wild type cells” and referee #2: “does this starting point, appearance of crippling mutation, reflect the starting point of natural evolutionary scenarios as we understand them?”</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Especially as suggested by referee #2 a much improved discussion should ground the work in natural evolution. Even when passing through very narrow bottlenecks, how likely it is that mutants that experience gene inactivation would be isolated from competition for 1000 generations in a way that would allow them to reveal evolutionary dynamics of the type found here?</p><p>Points 1-3 in referee #2's report are highly essential and the authors are thus asked to address them each in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Laan et al. present a study of what happens to yeast cells after BEM1, a gene that is critical for maintaining cell polarity, is deleted. The authors grow the cells for 1000 generations and find that, in several independent lines, the cells evolve to compensate for the loss of BEM1. The striking result is that in several independent lines the same three genes are mutated in the same order during the course of the growth. Through the creation of the double and triple mutants the authors show that the order in which the mutations are acquired is likely due to a complex set of epistatic interactions among the three genes (BEM2, BEM3, and NRD1). The authors conclude that cells can overcome inactivating mutations in critical genes and that gene inactivation may be a mechanism that leads to rapid divergence in the component genes required for particular cellular functions.</p><p>Overall all the experiments are well performed, the results are interesting, and the data generally support the conclusions. Similar to other evolutionary studies these experiments represent a specific case and it is important not to generalize the results too much. Yeast may not respond to other deletions in the same way. And it is not even clear whether a Bem1 deletion strain would ever get the chance to evolve in a natural setting as it might be immediately out competed by neighboring wild type cells. Nevertheless, this study represents an interesting case study. I only have a few minor comments:</p><p>1) Evolution by gene loss has been written about extensively and the authors should cite some of the previous literature in this area.</p><p>2) It was not easy to follow exactly how many independent lines were studied. The text says nine mutant lines were evolved, but then ten lines were sequenced. The authors should clarify exactly how many independent lines there were, where they came from, and discuss in more detail which mutations arose independently and which are shared because of common ancestry.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The paper is well written and clear. It compellingly outlines the adaptation dynamics of a multi-step evolutionary process after the deletion of a major component of the yeast polarization module. The authors used various complementary approaches, ranging from classical genetics to microscopy and whole genome sequencing, to interpret their findings and support their main conclusions. However, my main concern is that the experimental system the authors have devised, the recovery of a lineage from deletion of a crucial component, is highly contrived and does not shed new light on the evolutionary process in natural habitats. Thus I think that one of the main questions the authors wish to address – how do functional modules reorganize during evolution, is not adequately answered.</p><p>1) While most experimental evolution works focus on adaptation of lineages to new environments or selective challenges, this study sets off by crippling a strain through mutation of an almost essential gene. The authors rightfully state that this mutation will necessitate reorganization of the functional module or take-over of a new module. Yet does this starting point, appearance of crippling mutation, reflect the starting point of natural evolutionary scenarios as we understand them? The authors only state that such module reorganization may occur to accommodate changing environments or when population bottlenecks result in fixation of deleterious mutations (Introduction, first paragraph). Yet even under a narrow population bottleneck, fixation of such highly deleterious mutations is unlikely. I think considerable more discussion and references are required to convincingly ground this work in the current understanding of evolution dynamics. Alternatively the authors can put more emphasis on their other, albeit less exciting, conclusions (as the observations that cells are robust to destructive genetic perturbations or new finding in cell biology of polarization).</p><p>2) Two fields of research that are highly relevant to this publication receive very little attention in the manuscript and warrant more discussion:</p><p>The research of multi-step evolutionary trajectories has been the focus of many previous studies using experimental evolution or directed evolution either in a single protein or in multiple components (e.g., Weinreich et al. Science 2006 and many other papers that followed).</p><p>The evolutionary dynamics leading to module reorganization or module take-over. In the Discussion, the authors suggest that module takeover could be a consequence of inactivation of one module (in line with their work) and recruitment of novel proteins that lead to a new module taking over. Are there any references that are compatible with such an adaptation scenario (the existing references only show that is some species, core cellular functions are done by unconventional modules)?</p><p>3) The authors state that their study reveals more about the biology of yeast cell polarization (identifying new genes involved). This indeed seems like a valid complementary approach to study this pathway and distill new components. I think this discussion can be further expanded – how do the results compare to previous epistasis maps (SGD website allows to interrogate high throughput E-maps)? What is the potential advantage of identifying relevant genes by monitoring evolutionary change relative to more standard approaches as double deletion screens?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09638.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>All referees and the editors agree that the work is exciting.

There are ways of countering the objection: severely defective mutations could be fixed in population bottlenecks that accompany speciation; secondly, and maybe more likely, mutations that removed important components could be pleiotropic, offering advantages in novel environments that were similar in magnitude to the costs they impose on strongly conserved core functions; and thirdly, previously selected mutations in the same or related pathways could make the defects associated with the removal of a component less severe.</p><p><italic>1) Evolution by gene loss has been written about extensively and the authors should cite some of the previous literature in this area.</italic></p><p>Our findings are consistent with previous experimental evolution work which showed that loss of function mutations allow bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hottes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zinser et al., 2003</xref>) and yeast (Koschwanez, Foster and Murray, 2013) to adapt to their environments and produce novel phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wildenberg and Murray 2014</xref>). Adaptation by loss of function mutations has also been observed in natural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bliven and Maurelli, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">D'Souza et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D'Souza et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maurelli et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Smith et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) It was not easy to follow exactly how many independent lines were studied.

From the seven wild-type lines that were left at the end of the evolution experiment, we sequenced five lines. We sequenced a total of ten bem1∆ lines: The eight bem1∆ A-lines that arose from the same starting colony and remained haploid, as described above. In addition, we sequenced two bem1∆ lines that were evolved from two independent different starting colonies in a trial experiment (T2 and T3).</p><p>The A-lines shared the same early stop mutation in BEM3, but lines T2 and T3 independently acquired a different early stop mutations in BEM3. The BEM3 mutation in the A-lines (Q61*) was acquired after germination of the spore that acted as their ancestor: cells from the original colony showed the same severe growth defects as freshly germinated bem1∆ spores, whereas engineered bem1∆ bem3∆ cells had a much less severe defect. All five mutations in NRP1 (all in A-lines) were independently acquired early stop mutations, whereas in BEM2 we found a promoter mutation (line T2) and two amino acid substitutions (line A1 and A2), which are radical substitutions at conserved positions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Two fields of research that are highly relevant to this publication receive very little attention in the manuscript and warrant more discussion: The research of multi-step evolutionary trajectories has been the focus of many previous studies using experimental evolution or directed evolution either in a single protein or in multiple components (e.g., Weinreich et al. Science 2006 and many other papers that followed).</italic></p><p>We added the following discussion:</p><p>How repeatable is evolution? Experimental evolution has produced a range of answers to this question, from replicate populations that share a small fraction of causal mutations(Koschwanez, Foster and Murray, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kvitek and Sherlock 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chou and Marx, 2012</xref>) to those where mutations occur in the same genes in the same order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blount et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herron and Doebeli, 2013</xref>) or repeatedly affect the same amino acids in a protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>). For multiple substitutions in the same protein, strong epistasis can render most trajectories impossible or unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bridgham and Thornton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hinkley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>). Examining the mutations that gave rise to a particular phenotype in the bacterium, Pseudomonas fluorescens, revealed a hierarchy of pathways: loss of function mutations are most frequent and other pathways, including promoter mutations, gene fusions, and gain of function mutations can only be found when the dominant pathway is blocked (Lind, Farr and Rainey, 2015).</p><p>Our work adds to the list of examples of reproducible trajectories and our reconstruction of all possible paths, an exercise that has previously been performed for multiple mutation in a single gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>), demonstrates why our mutations occurred in a particular order. As far as we know, this is the first example of reproducible trajectories to adaptation to mutations that severely compromise a cellular function, and it will be interesting to see if evolving strains, adapting to severe perturbations in other pathways will also lead to reproducible trajectories.</p><p><italic>The evolutionary dynamics leading to module reorganization or module take-over. In the Discussion, the authors suggest that module takeover could be a consequence of inactivation of one module (in line with their work) and recruitment of novel proteins that lead to a new module taking over. Are there any references that are compatible with such an adaptation scenario (the existing references only show that is some species, core cellular functions are done by unconventional modules)?</italic></p><p>To address this issue we added the following discussion:</p><p>Because of the difficulty of inferring events as ancient as the ones that rearranged the kinetochore of kinetoplastids or made the anaphase promoting complex dispensable in Giardia, it is impossible to say whether it was the loss of genes that inactivated existing pathways, or some other event that triggered the sequence of changes that led particular lineages to use different proteins to perform functions that appeared early in eukaryotic evolution. Despite our inability to reconstruct these processes, there is evidence for individual steps in the process of functional reorganization. These include the loss of widely conserved genes in individual evolutionary lineages (Bergmiller, Ackerman and Silander, 2012; Gourguechon, Holt and Cande, 2013; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drinnenberg et al., 2014</xref>), the loss of genes present in ancestral species during evolutionary diversification (e.g. the loss of 88 genes in the descent of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> from an ancestor that existed 100 Mya ago (Gordon, Byrne and Wolfe, 2009)), and the recruitment of new functions by adaptations that alter the function of existing genes and create genes de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Neme and Tautz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Neme and Tautz, 2014</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The authors state that their study reveals more about the biology of yeast cell polarization (identifying new genes involved).

What is the potential advantage of identifying relevant genes by monitoring evolutionary change relative to more standard approaches as double deletion screens?</italic></p><p>We changed to text to discuss those points:</p><p>High throughput studies, at least as indicated on the yeast genome website SGD (SGD) have not shown physical or genetic interactions between NRP1 and any of the currently known polarity genes (SGD). BEM1, BEM2 and BEM3 as well as their genetic interactions have been measured and implicated in polarity establishment before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koh et al., 2010</xref>). However, the lack of information about NRP1 made it impossible to predict the positive effect of the BEM2 deletion on polarity establishment in the absence of BEM1 and BEM3.</p></body></sub-article></article>
