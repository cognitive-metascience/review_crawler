Cell polarity governs various processes, such as cell migration, asymmetric cell division and morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bryant and Mostov, 2008</xref>). Most of these processes are regulated by extracellular signals, which are received and transduced by specific receptors on the plasma membrane. The intracellular trafficking and subcellular localization of these receptors in polarized epithelial cells profoundly affects their ligand-binding capabilities and the activation of the downstream signaling pathways. In particular, the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases, which are activated by a multitude of ligands, play essential roles during the development of most epithelial organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Citri and Yarden, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sorkin and Goh, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to mammals, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> expresses only one EGFR homolog, LET-23, and a single EGF family ligand, LIN-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sundaram, 2006</xref>). Thanks to this lack of redundancy, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> EGF/EGFR signaling system is well suited for systematic genetic analysis. LET-23 EGFR signaling controls a variety of developmental processes, including the development of the vulva, the egg-laying organ of the hermaphrodite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sternberg, 2005</xref>). During vulval development, the six vulval precursor cells (VPCs) P3.p to P8.p are induced by an LIN-3 EGF signal from the anchor cell (AC) to differentiate into vulval cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The polarized distribution of LET-23 is crucial for the efficient activation of the downstream RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and the induction of the vulval cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaech et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitfield et al., 1999</xref>). P6.p, the VPC closest to the AC, receives the highest dose of LIN-3 and adopts the primary (1°) cell fate. At the same time, P6.p activates via a lateral Delta signal the LIN-12 Notch signaling pathway in its neighbors P5.p and P7.p, which inhibits the 1° and induces the secondary (2°) fate in these VPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sternberg, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berset et al., 2001</xref>). The remaining VPCs P3.p, P4.p and P8.p that receive neither the inductive LIN-3 nor the lateral LIN-12 signal adopt the tertiary (3°) cell fate. The 3° VPCs divide once before fusing to the hypodermis hyp7. Hyperactivation of the EGFR/RAS/MAPK pathway causes more than three VPCs to adopt a vulval cell fate and a multivulva (Muv) phenotype, whereas reduced EGFR/RAS/MAPK signaling results in the induction of fewer than three VPCs and a vulvaless (Vul) phenotype.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>chp-1</italic> is required for the plasma membrane localization of LET-23::GFP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of the EGFR and NOTCH signaling pathways controlling VPC fate determination.

Before vulval induction, LET-23 is equally expressed in all VPCs. During induction, a positive MAP kinase MPK-1 feedback signal upregulates LET-23 expression in P6.p, which allows this cell to sequester most of the inductive LIN-3 EGF signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stetak et al., 2006</xref>). By contrast, LIN-12 NOTCH signaling in P5.p and P7.p results in the down-regulation of LET-23 and the inhibition of RAS/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitfield et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Several factors that regulate RAS/MAPK activity by controlling the sub-cellular localization and trafficking of the LET-23 EGFR in the VPCs have been identified. The basolateral localization of LET-23 by the tripartite LIN-2/CASK, LIN-10/MINT and LIN-7/VELIS protein complex is necessary for efficient receptor activation, because LIN-3 is secreted by the AC in the somatic gonad facing the basolateral compartment of the VPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaech et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hoskins et al., 1996</xref>). On the other hand, the ARF GTPase exchange factor AGEF-1 antagonizes via the ARF GTPase and the AP-1 adaptor complex the basolateral localization of LET-23 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Skorobogata et al., 2014</xref>). A systematic in vivo screen in live <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae has identified multiple additional regulators of LET-23 localization and signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haag et al., 2014</xref>). One candidate identified in this screen was <italic>chp-1</italic>, which encodes a Cysteine and Histidine Rich Domain (CHORD) containing protein homologous to human CHORDC1 (also named Morgana) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brancaccio et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2011</xref>). CHORDC1 has been proposed to function as co-chaperone with HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gano and Simon, 2010</xref>), although CHORDC1 may also act independently of HPS90 in regulating microtubule dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Palumbo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that a loss of <italic>chp-1</italic> function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> leads to the accumulation of LET-23 EGFR in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of the VPCs, resulting in a strongly reduced activity of the RAS/MAPK pathway. CHP-1 is specifically required for LET-23 localization, as the secretion of other transmembrane receptors to the VPC plasma membrane is unchanged in the absence of <italic>chp-1</italic>. Furthermore, we shown that deletion of CHORDC1 in human A431 cells leads to the ER mislocalization of the EGFR and to a loss of EGF-induced filopodia formation. Analogous to <italic>C. elegans chp-1</italic>, deletion of human CHORDC1 does not eliminate but rather attenuates the activation of the MAPK pathway in response to EGF stimulation. We propose that CHP-1 CHORDC1 plays a conserved and specific function during the maturation and membrane secretion of the EGFR.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>chp-1</italic> is required for basolateral localization of the EGFR LET-23</title><p>The basolateral localization of the LET-23 EGFR in the VPCs of <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae is necessary for the efficient binding of the LIN-3 EGF ligand secreted by the AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaech et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitfield et al., 1999</xref>). After ligand-induced receptor endocytosis from the basolateral plasma membrane, LET-23 accumulates on the apical cortex of the VPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haag et al., 2014</xref>). In late L2/early L3 larvae before the VPCs have started dividing, a translational LET-23::GFP reporter was up-regulated in the 1° VPC P6.p, while expression faded in the other, more distal VPCs. Most of the LET-23::GFP protein in P6.p was detected, approximately at equal levels, on the basolateral and apical plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Only a faint and diffuse intracellular LET-23::GFP signal could be observed in the VPCs of wild-type animals. After the first round of VPC divisions, LET-23::GFP continued to be strongly expressed on the plasma membrane of the 1° P6.p descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B’</xref>). A systematic RNA interference screen for genes controlling LET-23 trafficking had previously identified the <italic>chp-1</italic> gene as a regulator of LET-23 localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haag et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>chp-1</italic> encodes a conserved CHORD-containing protein homologous to human CHORDC1/Morgana (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2011</xref>). RNAi against <italic>chp-1</italic> leads to a strong reduction in plasma membrane localization and to the intracellular accumulation of the LET-23::GFP reporter in P6.p and its descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,C’</xref>). To confirm the RNAi-induced phenotype, we examined LET-23 localization in <italic>chp-1(tm2277)</italic> deletion mutants (<italic>chp-1(lf)</italic>). Since homozygous <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants are sterile as adults, we analyzed LET-23 EGFR localization in the homozygous offspring of heterozygous <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic>/hT2 balanced mothers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). In the following experiments, we compared <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> homozygous larvae to balanced <italic>chp-1(lf)/hT2</italic> heterozygous control siblings, since LET-23::GFP localization in <italic>chp-1(lf)/+</italic> heterozygotes was indistinguishable from wild-type animals (for example, compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> with Figure 3A). Homozygous <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> L2 and L3 larvae exhibited a completely penetrant intracellular mislocalization of LET-23 EGFR in the VPCs and their descendants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,D’</xref>).

We therefore tested if a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>C. elegans hsp-90</italic> gene affects LET-23 EGFR localization in as similar manner as <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic>. The <italic>hsp-90(ok1333)</italic> allele contains a 1258 bp deletion resulting in the insertion of a Ser followed by a stop codon after amino acid 208, thereby truncating the remaining 494 residues of the protein (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>). The <italic>ok1333</italic> allele was previously reported to eliminate <italic>hsp-90</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lissemore et al., 2018</xref>).

We thus examined LET-23::GFP expression in the VPCs of homozygous <italic>hsp-90(ok1333)</italic> larvae shortly before they arrested, at the late L2 to early L3 stage (Pn.p to Pn.px stage). While the overall intensity of the LET-23::GFP signal in the VPCs of homozygous <italic>hsp-90(ok1333)</italic> mutants was reduced compared with their heterozygous siblings, the LET-23::GFP signal remained localized at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F’</xref>). Especially, we did not observe the intracellular LET-23::GFP accumulation seen in <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

Since mammalian HSP90B1 controls the trafficking of Toll-like receptors through the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Randow and Seed, 2001</xref>), we tested whether ENPL-1 instead of HSP-90 might act together with CHP-1 to regulate LET-23 localization.

Since misfolded proteins are usually more susceptible to trypsin degradation, this assay can detect changes in protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ninagawa et al., 2015</xref>). Total protein extracts of A431 control and KO cells were incubated with varying concentrations of trypsin, and the amount of full-length EGFR was quantified by western blotting.

We have used vulval development in <italic>C. elegans</italic> as an in vivo model to study the the secretion and localization of the EGFR homolog LET-23. The basolateral localization and retention of LET-23 is essential for the efficient activation of the downstream RAS/MAPK pathway and correct VPC differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whitfield et al., 1999</xref>). Perturbations in LET-23 secretion or localization invariably cause defects in VPC fate specification and abnormal vulval morphogenesis.</p><p>In a screen for genes regulating LET-23 localization, we have previously identified the CHORD-containing protein CHP-1 as a regulator of LET-23 EGFR trafficking in the VPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haag et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we show that the loss of <italic>chp-1</italic> function in <italic>C. elegans</italic> leads to the accumulation of LET-23 in the ER and a strong reduction -but not a complete inactivation- of RAS/MAPK signaling in the VPCs. Even in the absence of CHP-1, a small fraction of LET-23 reaches the plasma membrane, where it can bind to and be activated by the limiting amounts of LIN-3 EGF. Our genetic analysis confirms the notion that vulval induction in <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants depends to a large extent on <italic>lin-3</italic> activity. However, the ER accumulation of LET-23 in <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants is independent of <italic>lin-3</italic> or the basolateral <italic>lin-2/lin-7/lin-10</italic> receptor localization complex. This indicates that CHP-1 controls LET-23 secretion in the VPCs at an earlier step, before the receptor interacts with LIN-7 at the plasma membrane and undergoes LIN-3-mediated endocytosis.</p><p>Several observations have indicated that the role of <italic>C. elegans</italic> CHP-1 in LET-23 EGFR trafficking is specific. First, if CHP-1 was required for the ER trafficking of a large number of proteins, this would result in ER stress and activate the UPR pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>). Yet, <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants did not exhibit an increased activity of the UPR pathway, unless additional ER stress was induced by globally inhibiting protein glycosylation. Second, the membrane localization of three other type I trans-membrane receptors, we examined (LIN-12 NOTCH, PAT-3 ß-integrin and LIN-18 RYK) did not change in <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants. Third, inhibition of other known HSP90 co-chaperones, such as <italic>cdc-37</italic>, <italic>daf-41</italic> and <italic>sgt-1</italic>, did not affect LET-23 localization in the VPCs.</p><p>In order to test if the function of CHP-1 in the EGFR signaling pathway is conserved in mammals, we inactivated the CHP-1 homolog CHORDC1 in human A431 epidermoid carcinoma cells, which express high levels of the wild-type EGFR and undergo a phenotypic switch in response to EGF stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferretti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Van de Vijver et al., 1991</xref>). The phenotype of the CHORDC1 knock-out in A431 cells is remarkably similar to the <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> phenotype in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> VPCs; the EGFR accumulates in the ER and the activation of the RAS/MAPK pathway in response to EGF stimulation is strongly reduced. Even though the total levels of the EGFR are only slightly reduced in CHORDC1 mutant A431 cells, the EGFR is less stable as it exhibits an increased sensitivity to trypsin digestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ninagawa et al., 2015</xref>). The extracellular domain of the EGFR is N-glycosylated at multiple sites after entry into the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azimzadeh Irani et al., 2017</xref>). Since we did not observe a shift in the electrophoretic mobility of the EGFR in A431 KO cells, which would indicate a loss of glycosylation, it appears that the EGFR does enter the ER without CHORDC1. Possibly, CHORDC1 is required for the correct folding of the EGFR once it has entered the ER, and the partially unfolded EGFR molecules cannot pass through the ER.</p><p>It has been proposed that CHORDC1 acts as a co-chaperone that assists HSP90 in the folding of its numerous client proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gano and Simon, 2010</xref>). According to this model, CHORDC1 would confer the specificity of HSP90 toward a subset of its clients, among them the EGFR. Surprisingly, our data in <italic>C. elegans</italic> point to an HSP90-independent function of CHP-1 in regulating EGFR trafficking. A loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> HSP90 ortholog did not perturb LET-23 membrane localization, even though the total expression levels of LET-23 in the VPCs were reduced. By contrast, the VPCs in <italic>chp-1(lf)</italic> mutants did not exhibit an obvious reduction in LET-23 expression levels. Thus, HSP-90 likely stabilizes the LET-23 EGFR only after it has reached the VPC plasma membrane. We further tested if the HSP-90 paralog ENPL-1 might act together with CHP-1 instead of HSP-90, as the mammalian ENPL-1 homolog HSP90B1/GRP94 is required for the trafficking of certain trans-membrane proteins though the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Randow and Seed, 2001</xref>). However, using an <italic>enpl-1</italic> deletion allele, we have excluded a possible involvement of ENPL-1 in LET-23 EGFR trafficking.</p><p>Even though our data on human cells cannot rule out the possibility that HSP90 and CHORDC1 might also act together, they are consistent with the HSP90-independent function of CHP-1 we observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Geldanamycin inhibition of HSP90 in CHORDC1-deficient cells caused a significantly stronger reduction in EGFR levels than Geldanamycin treatment of wild-type cells, suggesting that HSP90 and CHRODC1 functions overlap only partially. One possible scenario is that a CDC37 co-chaperone/HSP90 chaperone complex stabilizes the EGFR at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Verba and Agard, 2017</xref>), whereas CHORDC1 promotes the maturation and trafficking of EGFR through the ER. Along these lines, several co-chaperones were found to act independently of a core chaperone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Echtenkamp and Freeman, 2012</xref>). For example, p23, which contains the same ACD (alpha-crystallin-Hsps-p23-like) domain as CHORDC1, regulates various cellular processes that are distinct from those controlled by HSP90 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Echtenkamp et al., 2011</xref>). It is therefore possible that CHORDC1 acts by itself or in a complex with another, yet to be identified chaperone.</p><p>In summary, the identification of CHP-1/CHORDC1 as a specific regulator of EGFR trafficking extends an already complex network of different chaperones and co-chaperones that control receptor trafficking at different steps.

Double-stranded oligos were generated and cloned into the lentiCRISPRv2 vector (Addgene), which was then transfected in combination with pVSV-G, pMDL and pREV into HEK293T cells to produce lentiviral particles (vMW6_CHORDC1 sg#1, vMW7_CHORDC1 sg#2, vMW9_scramble). Four days following transfection, the media from cells was collected, clarified by centrifugation, and filtered through a 0.45 μM filter to collect lentiviral particles. Subsequently, the particles were concentrated in Amicon Ultra tubes (Ultracel 100 k, Millipore). The titer of viral particles was determined before vMW6_CHORDC1 sg#1 and vMW7_CHORDC1 sg#2 were used to transduce 180’000 A431 cells in a 12-well plate at a combined MOI of 10. A431 cells were supplemented with DMEM media containing the lentiviral mix and 10 μg/ml polybrene and cultured under normal conditions. In parallel, cells were transduced with vMW9_scramble at a MOI of 10. Three days after transduction, cells were grown in the presence of 1.2 μg/ml puromycin. One week after puromycin selection, the puromycin-resistant populations were frozen and kept as stocks used in the subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Western blotting</title><p>For western blot analysis, cells were lysed in lysis buffer on ice (100 mM Tris/HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, 10 ml lysis buffer + 1 tablet protease inhibitor), scraped with a cell scraper and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. 100 µl of this mix was sonicated in a Bioruptor sonicator device (Diagenode), before 100 µl of 2x SDS loading dye were added. About 10 μg of protein extract were resolved by SDS-PAGE and transferred to nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was blocked in 5% dried milk in 1x PBS plus 0.2% Tween 20 and then incubated with the diluted primary antibodies overnight at 4°C. Secondary anti-rabbit or anti-mouse IgG antibodies conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (HRP) were used as the secondary antibodies. The HRP was detected by incubating the membrane with the SuperSignal West Pico or Dura Chemiluminescent Substrate (Thermo Scientific) for 4 min, before the signals were measured on a digital western blot imaging system. The antibodies used for Western blot analysis were: anti-CHORDC1 (HPA041040 Atlas Antibodies), anti-Tubulin (ab18251 abcam), anti-EGFR (HPA018530 Atlas Antibodies), anti-ERK1/2 (M5670 Sigma Aldrich), anti-ERK1/2 activated (M8159, Sigma Aldrich), HRP anti-Rabbit (111-035-144 Jackson Immuno Research) and HRP anti-Rabbit (115-035-146 Jackson Immuno Research).

After washing with PBS, cells were permeabilized with PBS containing 0.2% Triton X-100% and 0.5% BSA for 5 min, and then blocked for 1 hr in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 0.2% gelatine. Primary antibodies were added in blocking solution for 1 hr at room temperature in a humid chamber. The cells were rinsed in PBS three times before being incubated for 40 min in the dark with secondary antibodies and Phalloidin 568 (B3475 Thermo Scientific). After three washes with PBS, cells were stained for 5 min with PBS containing 0.1 µg/ml DAPI, followed by three washes with PBS. Glass slides were mounted with ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant (Thermo Scientific). The antibodies used for immunocytochemistry were: anti-CHORDC1 (HPA041040 Atlas Antibodies), anti-Tubulin (ab18251 abcam), anti-EGFR (MA5-13269 Thermo Scientific), anti-PDI (MA3-019 Thermo Scientific), Alexa Fluor 488 (A11034 Thermo Scientific), and Alexa Fluor 647 (A21236 Thermo Scientific).

Fluorescent and Nomarski mages were acquired with the Openlab 4.0 or VisiView 2.1 software. To observe the localization of GFP reporters, around 40 worms at the L3 stage were mounted on 4% agarose pads and anesthetized with 20 mM tetramisole in M9 buffer.

Images were acquired by using the LSM710 ZEN 2012 software (Zeiss). GFP was excited with a 488 laser excitation and emission was detected in a range of 493–566 nm. mCherry was excited with a 594 nm laser excitation and emission was detected in a range of 599–696 nm. Images were captured with a variable frame size, a pinhole equivalent to 1 Airy and a pixel size of 0.08 μm. Identical camera gain settings were used for all live animal imaging (AMAN-2::mCherry: GFP 600, mCherry 500/mCherry::SP12: GFP 600, mCherry 600 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref> were deconvolved using the Huygens deconvolution software (Scientific Volume imaging). To quantify co-localization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>, raw images (before deconvolution) were processed in Fiji using the Subtract Background command (default settings, rolling ball radius = 0.3). To quantify co-localization, z-stacks were analyzed with the ImarisColoc module in Imaris 8.3. (Bitplane). The GFP channel of each image was thresholded to define a ROI using the mask channel function. An automatic threshold implemented in Imaris was set for both channels based on a statistical significance algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Costes et al., 2004</xref>). With this approach, the extent of co-localization of two fluorescent-labeled proteins in an image is automatically quantified, without the bias of visual interpretation. Based on an automatically identified threshold calculated by the Coste’s approach, a Manders Colocalization Coefficient (MCC) indicating the fraction of total probe fluorescence that co-localizes with the fluorescence of a second probe was calculated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Manders et al., 1993</xref>). The calculated MCC values were averaged, and statistical analysis was performed using a a two-tailed Student’s t-test for independent samples.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We wish to thank the members of the Hajnal laboratory for critical discussion and comments on the manuscript.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>All reviewers found the identification of CHP-1 as a regulator of the trafficking and polarised expression of the EGF receptor has significant implications for the control of signalling. The apparent conservation of this function in mammalian cells also broadens the interest and appeal of this story. At a mechanistic level, there is much still to be understood, but the data imply that, unexpectedly, CHP-1 is acting independent of HSP90. This is significant because the mammalian homologue of CHP-1, CHORDC1, has been shown to be an HSP90 co-chaperone. This paper suggests that it may also have other molecular functions.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled “The CHORD protein CHP-1 regulates EGF receptor trafficking and signaling in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and human cells” for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>All three reviewers found the paper to be interesting and the subject matter potentially appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>. There was also consensus that the authors have implicated CHP-1 in the biosynthetic pathway of the EGFR in worms. There were, however, significant concerns that preclude its publication in its current form.</p><p>The central concern was the conclusion that CHP-1 acts in an HSP90-independent manner. Neither of the two main strands of evidence for this were persuasive. The daf-21 allele is not a null, in fact being a weak gain of function, so the lack of EGFR accumulation in the ER does not address the HSP90 independence. A null allele would be needed to make this point. Similarly, as pointed out by two reviewers, the geldanamycin sensitivity of a population of CHORDC1 KO cells does not make a compelling case for HSP90 independence.</p><p>The reviewers do not believe that the paper can be published in <italic>eLife</italic> unless this issue were to be resolved rigorously. Moreover, if it turns out that CHP-1 is in fact HSP90-dependent, ie it is acting as expected, as a co-chaperone, the paper would then lack a degree of novelty to make a strong case for <italic>eLife</italic>. On those grounds – the substantial additional work needed to prove the relationship with HSP90 and the possibility that the result will undermine the novelty – the consensus decision was to decline the paper.</p><p>There were also other serious concerns, as well as a list of more minor issues. These are captured in the individual reviews below but the most significant include the following.</p><p>1) The lack of response of KO cells to serum does not provide strong evidence for an EGFR signalling defect.</p><p>2) The rab-5 knockdown experiments need positive controls to be convincing.</p><p>3) The genetic interactions between CHP-1 and other mutants in the let-23 pathway were inconclusive and not well explained.</p><p>4) The claims of medical significance were overstated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper describes the role of the co-chaperone CHP-1 in regulating the trafficking of the EGF receptor, both in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in mammalian cells. The authors conclude that CHP-1 is required for the trafficking of the EGFR, although they do not provide a clear view of molecular mechanism. There is some evidence that EGFR is partially misfolded in CHP-1 mutants, supporting the idea that it's acting as an HSP90 co-chaperone; conversely, other evidence suggests it could be acting in an HSP90 independent manner.</p><p>Overall, this is a careful and interesting piece of work, introducing a new player in the biosynthetic/maturation pathway of the EGFR, a very important receptor in development, physiology and pathology. That argues for it being appropriate in principle for <italic>eLife</italic>. On the other hand, the story is not very extensive. The simple, solid conclusion is that CHP-1 is required in some rather poorly understood way to promote EGFR export from the ER.</p><p>The editorial decision in this case is therefore more about whether this represents a substantial enough advance for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, than about major problems with the experiments. The specific concerns I have are all fairly easily addressable and don't, in my view, undermine the message substantially.</p><p>Specific issues</p><p>The mammalian cell data is interesting but there are a couple of weak elements.

The additional effect of geldanamycin on EGFR stability in CHORDC1 knockout cells does not prove HSP90 independence; HSP90 could act with another co-chaperone at an early step in EGFR folding, and with CHORDC1 at a later step that is required for ER export but not stability.</p><p>2) Showing that LET-23 mislocalization is independent of endocytosis relies on the lack of effect of rab-5 knockdown.

Also, CHP-1 homologues have been shown to regulate other proteins such as Rho kinases. These observations weaken the authors' argument that CHORDC1 inhibitors would effectively and specifically inhibit EGFR signaling. They would need to more comprehensively assess which proteins are affected by loss of CHORDC1 in order to make the argument about its specificity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50986.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

The simple, solid conclusion is that CHP-1 is required in some rather poorly understood way to promote EGFR export from the ER.</p><p>The editorial decision in this case is therefore more about whether this represents a substantial enough advance for publication in eLife, than about major problems with the experiments.
