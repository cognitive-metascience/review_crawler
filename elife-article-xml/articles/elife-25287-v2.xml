PM association of the main structural protein Gag depends on its myristoylated MA domain and PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Using a novel chemical biology tool that allows rapidly tunable manipulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in living cells, we show that depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> completely prevents Gag PM targeting and assembly site formation. Unexpectedly, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion also caused loss of pre-assembled Gag lattices from the PM. Subsequent restoration of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reinduced assembly site formation even in the absence of new protein synthesis, indicating that the dissociated Gag molecules remained assembly competent. These results reveal an important role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for HIV-1 morphogenesis beyond Gag recruitment to the PM and suggest a dynamic equilibrium of Gag-lipid interactions. Furthermore, they establish an experimental system that permits synchronized induction of HIV-1 assembly leading to induced production of infectious virions by targeted modulation of Gag PM targeting.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25287.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25287.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25287.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses are parasites that must infect the living cell of a host in order to grow and replicate. To do so, the virus attaches to the host’s cell and transfers its genetic material to the inside. The virus then hijacks the cell and forces it to build proteins and more genetic material that will assemble into new copies of the virus, and the completed virus particles are released to infect new cells.</p><p>The HIV-1 virus encodes a protein called Gag that coordinates the assembly of new copies of this virus. Thousands of Gag proteins accumulate into a lattice at the inside of the host cell membrane by an unknown mechanism, where they gather all essential components to form a new infectious virus. Once completed, the virus particle detaches itself from the host cell and Gag gives the virus its structure.</p><p>Previous research by several groups has shown that a lipid molecule found in cell membranes called PIP<sub>2</sub> can bind to Gag and helps the virus to assemble. However, until now, it was unclear if PIP<sub>2</sub> anchors Gag to the cell membrane of living cells and if it plays any other roles in the later stages of assembly.</p><p>Now, Mücksch et al. have developed a new approach to study this question by rapidly manipulating the levels of PIP<sub>2</sub> in living cells and monitoring Gag assembly through a fluorescent marker. The experiments showed that PIP<sub>2</sub> was needed to initiate the assembly process, but also to maintain the partially assembled Gag lattice at the membrane. When PIP<sub>2</sub> was removed, Gag proteins could not gather at the cell membrane and the already assembled Gag lattices broke down. When PIP<sub>2</sub> levels were increased again, the Gag proteins that had disappeared from the membrane formed new lattices. This suggests that PIP<sub>2</sub> has a much broader role in HIV-1 particle formation than previously assumed.</p><p>A next step will be to use this new experimental approach to study how particles of HIV are assembled and released. This knowledge may help scientists to develop antiviral drugs that interfere with the assembly step of the virus that could be used to prevent or treat HIV infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25287.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25287.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Human Immunodeficiency Virus</kwd><kwd>PI(4,5)P2</kwd><kwd>assembly</kwd><kwd>chemical dimerizer</kwd><kwd>Gag</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 83 project 14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TRR 83 project 2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schultz</surname><given-names>Carsten</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1129 project 5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 1129 project 6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Excellence Cluster CellNetworks Exc81</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Müller</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009139</institution-id><institution>Deutsches Zentrum für Infektionsforschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project 7.5 TTU HIV</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kräusslich</surname><given-names>Hans-Georg</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PI(4,5)P2 plays a much broader role during the HIV-1 particle assembly process than assumed; it is indispensable not only for recruitment of Gag to the plasma membrane but also for the maintenance of Gag assemblies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) particles assemble and bud at the plasma membrane (PM) of infected cells. This requires trafficking of the main structural component Gag from its site of synthesis at cytosolic polysomes to the inner leaflet of the PM. Here, Gag assembles into a multimeric lattice comprising ~2500 Gag molecules. Gag also recruits the other constituents of the infectious virion as well as components of the cellular endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) to nascent budding sites (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sundquist and Kräusslich, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Gag consists of the individually folded MA (matrix), CA (capsid), NC (nucleocapsid) and p6 domains, which separate upon proteolytic maturation to the infectious virion. CA and NC mediate protein and RNA interactions during virion morphogenesis, while p6 recruits ESCRT components. PM targeting of Gag depends on the N-terminal MA domain. Mutational analyses revealed that the N-terminal myristoyl moiety and a surface exposed patch of basic residues in MA (the highly basic region, HBR) are important for Gag targeting, membrane association and virus formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lorizate and Kräusslich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Freed, 2015</xref>). However, these two features would not be sufficient to explain specific PM targeting. The phosphoinositide phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>) is known to act as a cue for specific recruitment of many peripheral PM proteins and was also shown to be important for Gag PM targeting. Depleting PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> abolished PM targeting of Gag, while increasing PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at intracellular membranes redirected Gag to those sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ono et al., 2004</xref>). Consistently, several studies reported that presence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> enhances binding of Gag-derived proteins to synthetic liposomes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chukkapalli et al., 2008</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dick et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Olety and Ono, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mercredi et al., 2016</xref>), and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> appeared to be enriched in the HIV-1 lipidome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Gag seems to dominate in a monomeric form or in small oligomers in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kutluay and Bieniasz, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrix et al., 2015</xref>), and its N-terminal myristate group is proposed to be buried within the globular domain of MA at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Spearman et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2004</xref>). Gag interaction with PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> has been suggested to trigger exposure of the myristate moiety followed by its insertion into the inner leaflet of the PM, thereby anchoring Gag. Recent models propose a regulatory role of RNA for this myristoyl switch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chukkapalli et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfadhli et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chukkapalli et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kutluay et al., 2014</xref>). In the cytosol, specific cellular tRNAs are bound to the basic region of MA in the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, thus preventing premature Gag association with intracellular membranes. This MA-tRNA interaction may be outcompeted by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the PM, thereby triggering the myristoyl switch.</p><p>The NMR structure of HIV-1 MA bound to a PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecule carrying truncated acyl chains revealed the 2´ acyl chain to be buried in the myristoyl-binding pocket of MA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saad et al., 2006</xref>). This observation suggested a model for Gag membrane anchoring, which was subsequently challenged by a recent report from the same group, however (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mercredi et al., 2016</xref>). Upon arrival of Gag at the PM, the 2´ acyl chain of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> may be flipped outward and displace myristate from the acyl binding pocket of MA. Myristate in turn would insert into the PM. The consequent exchange of the unsaturated 2´ acyl chain of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> by the saturated myristic acid would increase local lipid saturation and membrane order. If occurring in all or a majority of the ~2500 tightly packed Gag molecules, this mechanism could also explain the observed liquid-ordered state of the HIV envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lorizate et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brügger et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). This model would further suggest that Gag clusters are stably anchored to the PM <italic>via</italic> their myristoyl moiety and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> would then be expected to be dispensable once anchoring has occurred.</p><p>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is clearly important for Gag PM targeting, but the dynamics of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> Gag interaction and the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in later stages of HIV assembly have not been examined so far. To do this, we need to monitor Gag localization in real time while manipulating PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in living cells. Here, we made use of a recently developed reversible chemical dimerizer system (abbreviated rCDS) allowing rapid and controlled depletion and reconstitution of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in living, virus-producing cells by a small molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schifferer et al., 2015</xref>). Using this system, we showed that the nascent HIV-1 Gag assembly site is highly dependent on PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> during the entire assembly process, and membrane association of apparently complete assembly sites remained PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependent. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> removal from the PM not only abolished Gag PM targeting, but also caused dissociation of pre-assembled Gag clusters from the membrane. Reconstitution of <italic>bona fide</italic> Gag assembly sites at the PM was observed upon re-establishment of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels. Our findings are inconsistent with stable anchoring of large Gag clusters at the PM through myristoyl moieties alone and suggest a highly dynamic mode of Gag PM binding. Furthermore, this approach allows synchronization of assembly and release of infectious HIV-1. These processes are usually highly asynchronous, both within a cell population and on the level of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ivanchenko et al., 2009</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The key parts of the reversible chemical dimerizer system (rCDS; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) used in this study are a PM anchor (LCK-ECFP-SNAP, here referred to as ‘Anchor’), and a cytosolic enzyme-bearing construct (FKBP-mRFP-5Ptase, here referred to as ‘Enzyme’), which catalyzes the conversion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> to PI(4)P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schifferer et al., 2015</xref>). Turnover of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is induced by addition of a cell-permeant small chemical dimerizer (rCD1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2014</xref>), which binds to both the SNAP and FKBP moieties of the respective fusion proteins and thereby links Anchor and Enzyme. Accordingly, rCD1 addition leads to rapid PM recruitment of the Enzyme and consequent depletion of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> from the PM, while PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels at the PM remain unchanged in the absence of this compound. Under our conditions, PM recruitment of the phosphatase was complete within 5 min after rCD1 addition. PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion can be monitored through dissociation from the PM of an EGFP-tagged pleckstrin homology (PH) domain of PLCδ; its dissociation was observed as early as 2 min after rCD1 addition in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). PM recruitment of the Enzyme can be reversed by adding the rCD1 competitor FK506 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). FK506 outcompetes the binding of rCD1 to the FKBP domain causing removal of the Enzyme from the PM within seconds and replenishment of normal PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels by endogenous PI(4)P<sub>5</sub> kinases. Full re-localization of the PH-domain reporter to the PM was detected 2 min after addition of FK506, indicating rapid and efficient recovery of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25287.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required for Gag assembly in living cells in an MA-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Principle of the reversible chemical dimerizer system (rCDS).

To this end, we established a stable HeLa<sub>rCDS</sub> cell line constitutively expressing Anchor and Enzyme tagged with autofluorescent proteins. The presence of both components of the rCDS in all cells prior to transfection with the HIV-1 expressing plasmid prevents constitutive production of infectious virus from cells only transfected with the HIV-1 plasmid, but lacking one or both components of the rCDS, while an uneven distribution of components between cells is expected to occur when the three plasmids are cotransfected. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, HeLa<sub>rCDS</sub> cells constitutively express both fusion proteins, with the Enzyme detected in the cytoplasm and the Anchor at the PM. Next, we assessed functionality of the rCDS in these cells by expressing EGFP-PLCδ-PH, whose PM localization serves as indicator for PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>.

Upon rCD1 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, middle panel), the Enzyme translocated to the PM (see insert), resulting in relocalization of the indicator protein to the cytoplasm as a consequence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion from the PM.

Comparing virus production from rCD1 and control cells at 22 hr after transfection showed a strong inhibition by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion (80–85% reduction compared to control cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> for non-normalized data). Virus assembly was then induced in rCD1-treated cells by addition of 1 µM FK506 at 22 hr after transfection. Extracellular virus was collected 2 hr after addition of FK506 since a short harvest time limits the analysis mainly to virions formed by induced assembly. Virus production was restored after FK506 addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Most importantly, relative infectivity of virions produced under inducing conditions was only mildly reduced (~65% compared to virions produced under native conditions from DMSO treated HeLa<sub>rCDS</sub> cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref> for non-normalized data).

To determine whether PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is also required to retain multimeric Gag assemblies at the PM, we performed reversible depletion of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in cells displaying pre-formed HIV-1 assembly sites. Assuming insertion of the N-terminally attached myristic acid into the inner membrane leaflet for most or all Gag molecules in nascent assembly sites, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> would not be expected to play a role at this stage. Rapid and reversible PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion in living cells offers a unique opportunity to address this issue.</p><p>HIV-1 expressing HeLa cells carrying the rCDS were incubated without compound addition until a large number of Gag assemblies had accumulated at the PM. Gag assemblies at the ventral PM (towards the coverslip) comprise nascent assembly sites as well as extracellular particles trapped between the cell and the substrate. These extracellular particles can obviously not be affected by rCD1 mediated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> PM depletion, and microscopy of the ventral PM is therefore not suitable for such an experiment. Instead, a central cell section was imaged in the subsequent experiments to focus on nascent assembly sites still connected to the cytosol.</p><p>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion was induced in cells with numerous Gag assembly sites by addition of rCD1. Unexpectedly, the vast majority of cells (52 of 59) lost most pre-formed Gag assemblies from the lateral PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).

To assess the contribution of virus release to the observed reduction of PM assemblies following PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion, we performed the depletion experiment with a Vpu-defective HIV-1 derivative. Vpu counteracts the host restriction factor tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). In the absence of Vpu, tetherin retains fully budded HIV-1 particles at the PM and thereby inhibits virus release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Neil et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Van Damme et al., 2008</xref>). High amounts of PM tetherin in cells producing Vpu(-) particles should therefore largely prevent virus release, while removal of assembly sites from the PM to the cytosol would be unaffected. Control experiments confirmed that neither the presence of the rCDS nor its activation affected the localization of tetherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Importantly, the loss of Gag clusters from the PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion was unaffected by lack of Vpu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2E and F</xref>), supporting the conclusion that Gag from nascent assembly sites re-localizes to the cytosol upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion.</p><p>The observed reduction of Gag clusters at the PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion could also be caused by constitutive loss of Gag from the PM, which is normally overcome by PM binding of newly synthesized Gag molecules. In this case, one would expect a reduction of preformed assembly sites when blocking synthesis of new proteins by addition of cycloheximide (CHX). Adding CHX to cells with established Gag clusters did not affect the appearance or number of Gag assemblies over up to 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>), suggesting that loss of Gag assemblies from the cell membrane is caused by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> dependence of their PM association.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>HIV-1 Gag assembly sites can be reconstituted by rescue of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub></title><p>We next asked whether Gag molecules that had been dissociated from PM assembly sites by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion could form new assembly sites upon restoration of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. For this experiment, we treated cells displaying pre-formed assembly sites with rCD1 for 90 min as described above, followed by addition of FK506 to allow PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reconstitution. FK506 treatment yielded a rapid increase in the number of Gag assembly sites at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). The number of Gag clusters reached the initial level (prior to rCD1 mediated PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion) at 30–40 min after addition of FK506 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>). No effect on the number of Gag clusters was observed in control cells treated with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>) or when the PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> independent MA variant Δ8–126 SR was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B, C and E</xref>).

To analyze whether reinduced Gag assembly sites at the PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> reconstitution comprised only newly synthesized Gag molecules or whether ‘recycled’ molecules previously depleted from the membrane contribute, we blocked protein translation by cycloheximide (CHX) treatment 60 min prior to rCD1 addition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and C</xref>, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion resulted in loss of clusters from the PM that was fully reverted by restoring PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels in the presence of CHX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B and D</xref>).

This variant cannot assemble at the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bryant and Ratner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Göttlinger et al., 1989</xref>), but can be rescued by a low amount of co-expressed wild-type Gag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Park and Morrow, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Morikawa et al., 1996</xref>). Accordingly, co-expression of Gag-EGFP(G2A) and wild-type Gag (in 2:1 molar ratio) led to formation of fluorescent assembly sites at the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A</xref>) of cells expressing the Anchor and Enzyme, while Gag-EGFP(G2A) alone failed to assemble. As expected, addition of rCD1 resulted in a loss of Gag-EGFP(G2A) clusters from the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3A and C</xref>). However, only few Gag-EGFP(G2A) clusters reformed at the PM and the quantitative analysis revealed, that Gag-EGFP(G2A) was not efficiently re-recruited to the PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B and D</xref>), while wild-type Gag readily formed new assembly sites under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This result is consistent with complete dissociation of Gag clusters following PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion. Quantitative analysis revealed that neither the size nor the fluorescence intensity of residual clusters increased following PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3E–H</xref>), arguing against recruitment of Gag(G2A) molecules to residual assembly sites.</p><p>To compare the dynamics of assembly site formation for induced and reinduced assembly, we analyzed assembly rates following PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion and reconstitution.

The mean assembly rate constant of k = 5.8 ± 0.6*10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup> for reinduced assembly, which was derived from averaging all individual k values, was slightly, but significantly, increased compared to native assembly (native: k = 4.5 ± 0.5*10<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C</xref>). The assembly constant for reinduced assembly translates into a half-time of ~120 s (native: t<sub>1/2</sub> ~150 s). Native and induced assembly kinetics were both determined at the ventral membrane, while reinduced assembly had to be measured at the lateral membrane, and this difference could influence the observed assembly rates. We therefore determined assembly kinetics of native Gag assembly site formation at the lateral membrane as well. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4B</xref> shows normalized and averaged traces of 169 individual native assembly sites at the lateral PM of six cells.

The half-time of native assembly at the lateral PM was changed accordingly (t<sub>1/2</sub> ~115 s). The observed difference may reflect effects of the adjacent glass substrate on the kinetics of HIV-1 Gag assembly at the ventral membrane, but clearly shows that reinduced and native assembly site formation occur with very similar kinetics.

Here, we made use of a recently established chemical biology tool allowing rapid and reversible manipulation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels at the PM in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schifferer et al., 2015</xref>) to study the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> for HIV-1 assembly site formation and maintenance. This rCDS has several advantages compared to alternative strategies. First, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion is strictly dependent on rCD1 addition and can be rapidly achieved within minutes. This allows maintaining normal cell metabolism prior to compound addition despite the presence of all rCDS components in the cell, and should thus prevent induction of escape pathways. Second, the system is completely and rapidly reversible, allowing restoration of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> levels within minutes of FK506 addition. Here, we show that long-term depletion of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is compatible with cell viability and viral protein expression, while completely preventing Gag membrane targeting and assembly site formation. Furthermore, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion also caused loss of pre-assembled Gag lattices from the PM and large clusters removed from the membrane appeared to dissociate into monomers or small oligomers in the cytosol. Restoration of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in these cells reinduced assembly site formation even in the absence of new protein synthesis indicating that the dissociated Gag molecules remained assembly competent. These results reveal an important role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> beyond Gag recruitment to the PM and suggest that Gag interactions with PM lipids may be more dynamic than previously thought.</p><p>PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and MA-dependent PM targeting of Gag and assembly site formation is consistent with previous studies showing that continuous overexpression of 5Ptase causes loss of Gag targeting in Gag-producing cells, that Gag-derived proteins preferentially interact with PI(4,5)P<sub>2 </sub>in vitro in an MA-dependent manner and that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> was found to be enriched in virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ono et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chukkapalli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2008</xref>). Applying an inducible system in the current study allowed us to investigate the kinetics of assembly site formation. Our results show that rate constants for native and induced assembly, and even for reinduced assembly following depletion and subsequent restoration of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, are virtually identical. Given that a large pool of myristoylated and assembly competent Gag is present in the cells prior to induction (or reinduction), one may have expected assembly to occur faster than under native conditions, but this was not the case. This observation is consistent with the assumption that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is important to retain Gag once it reaches the PM, but does not affect its PM trafficking, which may be rate-limiting under these conditions. Interestingly, Gag assembly site formation was not faster, but more synchronous under induced or reinduced assembly conditions compared to native assembly. This finding most likely reflects the presence of a large pool of assembly competent Gag in PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depleted cells, which can only be retained at the PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> restoration. Gag molecules may transiently associate with all cellular membranes including the PM in the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, but are stably retained only in the presence of this phosphoinositide. Assembly site formation therefore is synchronized by the rCDS, which provides a promising tool to study the role of host components during HIV-1 assembly and the induction of virus maturation. Analysis of these processes is so far limited by the inherently asynchronous nature of virus production – between cells and within an individual cell – and synchronizing this process <italic>via</italic> the described approach can overcome this limitation. The observation that virions released under those conditions are infectious and the opportunity to use stable HeLa<sub>rCDS</sub> cells for bulk assays broadens the range of applications for this system.</p><p>The finding that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is also required to retain partially or completely assembled Gag lattices at the PM was unexpected, since a triggered myristoyl switch in conjunction with ionic interactions between the HBR and negatively charged lipids of the inner leaflet would be expected to retain Gag at the PM, especially considering the high avidity of the multimeric Gag lattice (ca. 2,500 Gag molecules per assembly site). Large PM Gag clusters resembling fully assembled HIV-1 budding structures were rapidly and completely lost from the PM upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion, however. Thus, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is clearly required throughout assembly and budding of HIV-1 particles and not only for Gag membrane targeting. In vitro, MA binding to liposomes is significantly weaker for PI(4)P compared to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mercredi et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that Gag dissociation from the PM may be directly caused by dephosphorylation of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> and consequent loss of Gag interaction. It is not entirely clear, however, whether Gag-associated phosphoinositides are good substrates for the phosphatase since the enzyme would have to enter the tight protein lattice of the assembling virion. Accordingly, effects of general depletion of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> with lipid exchange of Gag molecules must also be considered.</p><p>Our results are not easily reconciled with the suggested lipid flip, where the 2´acyl chain of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> would be pulled from the membrane and exchanged for the myristic acid once the myristate switch is triggered. As discussed by Summers and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mercredi et al., 2016</xref>), extrusion of the 20-carbon 2´-acyl chain of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> would require ~24 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanford, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Israelachvili et al., 1977</xref>), while inserting 10 carbons of myristate into the lipid bilayer would gain only 8 kcal/mol. More importantly, our results appear inconsistent with the continuous insertion of the myristate moiety of all or the majority of Gag molecules into the inner leaflet. While the binding energy of the myristate anchor is not sufficient to retain individual Gag molecules at the PM, the avidity effects of up to 2500 Gag molecules with all or the majority of their N-terminal myristate groups inserted into the inner leaflet should make membrane association of the Gag lattice almost irreversible, independent of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>. Given that the binding energy of myristate interaction with MA is the same as for extrusion of myristate from the PM (8 kcal/mol) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Charlier et al., 2014</xref>), we suggest a dynamic equilibrium between fully membrane-inserted and MA-bound PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> molecules at the assembly site. Accordingly, myristate may readily flip between the inner leaflet of the PM and the lipid binding pocket of MA. Once Gag reaches the PM, PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> association triggers the myristate switch, and this effect is enhanced by the presence of acidic phospholipids. The combination of specific PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> binding and myristate insertion into the PM then anchors the Gag molecule and makes it available for virus assembly. Subsequently, a dynamic exchange of lipid interactions may occur, where depletion of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> causes loss of Gag molecules once their myristate moieties flip out from the membrane.</p><p>Finally, our results also shed some light on the question whether Gag assembly is directed to pre-existing assembly-prone membrane microdomains or whether Gag creates its own microdomain. Comparison of the membrane localization of Gag assembly sites prior to PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion with assembly sites in the same region of the cell after PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> restoration indicated that they occur in different positions. The conclusion that there are no stable assembly-prone membrane microdomains is consistent with earlier observations showing that Gag initially binds to non-raft regions of the PM and subsequently either laterally associates with raft like domains or induces their formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ono and Freed, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mercredi et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, our study shows that PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> at the PM is crucial throughout the entire HIV-1 assembly process and suggests a dynamic equilibrium of Gag-lipid interactions. Furthermore, it establishes an experimental system that permits synchronized induction of HIV-1 assembly by targeted modulation of Gag PM targeting.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals, reagents, plasmids</title><p>All chemicals and reagents were purchased from commercial sources unless otherwise noted. rCD1 was synthesized according to previously described procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2014</xref>).

Super resolution STED images were deconvolved with a Lorentzian function (full width half maximum = 60 nm) using the software Imspector (Abberior Instruments GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). For all images shown, the camera offset value was subtracted and the contrast and brightness were adapted for optimal display of the image. To eliminate background noise, a 0.5 px median filter was applied to all SDC and TIRF images. Images are shown in greyscale or pseudo colors. In the latter case, the Fire and Green Fire Blue lookup tables (LUTs) were used for SDC and TIRF images, respectively, while different channels of super resolution STED images are shown with the LUTs Red Hot (referred to as ‘red’) and Green Fire Blue (referred to as ‘cyan’).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Image analyses</title><sec id="s4-8-1"><title>Particle analysis of SDC microscopy data</title><p>Out of all cells imaged, those which showed the respective Enzyme translocation and maintained a healthy phenotype throughout the whole imaging process were selected for further analysis.

All parameters for image processing were kept constant when comparing different data sets. First the camera offset value was subtracted from all images. To remove the image background and prepare the images for automatic thresholding, single images - or image sequences in case of time lapse imaging - were converted to 8-bit images and background was subtracted using a rolling ball (radius = 2 px). The objects of interest were automatically thresholded using the Niblack local thresholding method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Niblack, 1986</xref>) with the following parameters: radius = 10, parameter 1 = 0 and parameter 2=-25.

Spot detection and tracking was performed using Imaris’ Spot detection module. Within this process the background was subtracted and the estimated diameter for spot detection was set to 500 nm (TIRF) or 700 nm (SDC). The quality parameter for spot detection was in the range of 35–250 (TIRF) or 75–200 (SDC), depending on the dataset. Tracking was performed using the Autoregressive Motion algorithm, assuming a maximum distance between frames of 500 nm (TIRF) or 700–1000 nm (SDC), allowing for a maximum gap size of 1 (TIRF) or 4 (SDC) and a track duration above 300 s. Filling gaps was disabled. Out of the detected spots, those which increased in mean intensity and reached a plateau phase were selected for further analysis. The mean intensity values over time were exported to Excel, temporally aligned (the beginning of each track was set to t = 0) and normalized (smallest value = 0, highest value = 100). The average normalized fluorescent values (a.u.) including standard deviation over time were plotted. In order to calculate assembly rate constants and half-times, single exponential fits to the data were performed using GraphPad Prism software (GraphPad Software, Inc., La Jolla, USA; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link>).

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Synchronized HIV assembly by tunable PIP2 changes reveals PIP2 requirement for stable Gag anchoring&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wenhui Li (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Wesley I Sundquist (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. Eric Freed (Reviewer #3) has agreed to reveal his identity.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors use a chemical biology system that can induce rapid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion, followed by rapid PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> restoration, to examine the PIP2-dependence of HIV-1 Gag protein. They make three major claims:</p><p>1) PIP2 is required for HIV Gag membrane association/assembly (previously known, but nicely demonstrated).</p><p>2) PIP2 is also required to maintain preassembled Gag clusters at the plasma membrane (unexpected, and implying that Gag-lipid interactions are apparently more dynamic than had previously been appreciated).</p><p>3) The system permits synchronization of particle release (because the rates of Gag molecule addition at each assembly site are the same under native vs. PIP2 restoration conditions, but the overall frequency of assembly events per unit time is higher when PI(2)P is restored).</p><p>Overall, the system provides a strong experimental support for the role of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in Gag PM binding without a concern of indirect effects of long-term PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion. The application is clever, the different assembly reactions are generally well characterized, and the unexpected requirement for PIP2 in maintaining the preassembled Gag lattice is a nice advance, but there are several issues that should be addressed before the manuscript is acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors show that reassembly is similar to native assembly by a number of criteria (size, morphology, composition). However, the ultimate test of similarity is viral infectivity, and the generation of infectious virus is also required to realize the full potential of the synchronization reaction. It is therefore important that the authors test whether synchronized assembly upon PIP2 depletion/restoration produces virions that are natively infectious. Along the same lines, the authors present the surprising result that when Gag clusters are lost from the plasma membrane and then induced to re-assemble, the spatial distribution of Env is unaffected; i.e., the spatial distribution of Gag and Env at &quot;native&quot; vs. &quot;induced&quot; assembly sites does not appear to differ. If correct, this result would have implications for how we think about Env recruitment to Gag assembly sites. It is therefore important to corroborate this result by measuring Env incorporation into virions produced in the native vs. induced setting.</p><p>2) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> are presented to demonstrate that PIP2 depletion results in loss of preassembled Gag clusters. Appropriate controls are included (DMSO addition and delta8-126SR – although the graphs in 5A and 5B should also show the quantified data for the delta8-126SR constructs). Importantly, however, steady-state changes in Gag cluster numbers under each condition could reflect changes in: A) The rate of new Gag cluster formation, B) The rate of preformed Gag cluster dissociation into the cytoplasm (and through dispersion along the membrane – can this be ruled out?, If not, could dispersal of Gag clusters in the membrane rather than loss from the membrane explain the more rapid accumulation of Gag clusters upon dissociation and reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)?), and C) The rate of Gag cluster loss through extracellular budding. Can the authors account for possible changes in the rates of each of these different processes, and thereby convincingly say that most of the loss in cluster numbers for wt Gag upon treatment with rCD1 results primarily from dissociation of preformed Gag clusters (and not from changes in rates of cluster initiation or particle budding?).

However, the ultimate test of similarity is viral infectivity, and the generation of infectious virus is also required to realize the full potential of the synchronization reaction. It is therefore important that the authors test whether synchronized assembly upon PIP2 depletion/restoration produces virions that are natively infectious. Along the same lines, the authors present the surprising result that when Gag clusters are lost from the plasma membrane and then induced to re-assemble, the spatial distribution of Env is unaffected; i.e., the spatial distribution of Gag and Env at &quot;native&quot; vs. &quot;induced&quot; assembly sites does not appear to differ. If correct, this result would have implications for how we think about Env recruitment to Gag assembly sites. It is therefore important to corroborate this result by measuring Env incorporation into virions produced in the native vs. induced setting.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer that demonstrating virus infectivity after induction, which also depends on Env and RNA recruitment to the induced assembly site, is an important experiment providing validation for this approach. We had already attempted to demonstrate this using the co-transfection approach employed for the other experiments. However, low levels of virus obtained in short time periods after induction, combined with background resulting from cells expressing HIV in the absence of the complete rCDS hampered reliable interpretation of results, which we therefore decided not to include in the original manuscript.</p><p>We have now established and characterized a stable HeLa based cell line expressing both rCDS components. Employing this novel tool for native and induced virus production, we could indeed confirm that induced Gag targeting leads to the production of viruses with a relative infectivity of ca. 65% compared to control particles. These data are included as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> with supplements and are discussed in the revised manuscript text. We believe that these results also confirm that sufficient Env molecules are incorporated into particles obtained by induced assembly. Furthermore, our super-resolution microscopy analyses show similar distributions of Gag and Env at induced and native assembly sites, indicating that induced assembly leads to similar Env recruitment as native assembly.</p><p><italic>2) The data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> are presented to demonstrate that PIP2 depletion results in loss of preassembled Gag clusters. Appropriate controls are included (DMSO addition and delta8-126SR – although the graphs in 5A and 5B should also show the quantified data for the delta8-126SR constructs).</italic> </p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have quantified the data for the delta8-126SR mutant. In order to avoid overcrowding of the main figure, we have added the data as new panels D and E to the revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>Importantly, however, steady-state changes in Gag cluster numbers under each condition could reflect changes in: A) The rate of new Gag cluster formation, B) The rate of preformed Gag cluster dissociation into the cytoplasm (and through dispersion along the membrane – can this be ruled out?, If not, could dispersal of Gag clusters in the membrane rather than loss from the membrane explain the more rapid accumulation of Gag clusters upon dissociation and reinduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)?), and C) The rate of Gag cluster loss through extracellular budding.

We have addressed the reviewers’ comments as follows:</p><p>A) The rate of new cluster formation – in response to this comment, we have performed experiments in which new protein synthesis was blocked by the addition of CHX as suggested by the reviewers. We have then monitored changes in the number of Gag clusters over time, where continuous depletion and repletion of assembly site even under native conditions should lead to loss of PM Gag clusters. This was not the case, however. As shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2G and H</xref>, blocking protein expression did not change the number of Gag clusters at the PM indicating their stable PM association in the absence of PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion.</p><p>B) The dispersal of Gag clusters in the PM – dispersal of a significant fraction of Gag clusters within the PM should lead to a significant increase in the PM staining of Gag. This was not observed, however (see e.g. <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). We do not consider membrane flotation experiments to be conclusive in this regard as our main conclusion is that Gag is lost from the PM, but not necessarily from any cellular membrane. Thus, Gag removed from the PM may at least partly remain associated with cytoplasmic membranes. One would predict that Gag clusters removed from the membrane may not dissociate completely, but remain in an oligomeric state, but this is difficult to detect over the large background of cytoplasmic Gag molecules.</p><p>C) Rate of Gag cluster loss through extracellular budding – to address this question, we performed the same experiment under conditions that impair particle release from the cell surface. For this, we used a <italic>vpu</italic> deletion mutant of pCHIV. Vpu downregulates plasma membrane levels of the host cell restriction factor tetherin, which retains fully budded HIV-1 particles at the cell surface. In the absence of Vpu HIV-1 release is thus inhibited. Control experiments confirmed that tetherin was depleted from the PM in the presence of Vpu under our conditions, and depletion was not observed with the Vpu(-) virus (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). Further controls showed that the localization of tetherin was not affected by PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2C and D</xref>). Live cell imaging of Gag assemblies in the absence of Vpu following PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion revealed that Gag clusters were lost from the PM with similar efficiency compared to experiments performed using the Vpu-expressing construct (Figure 5—figure supplement 2E and F). These observations indicate that the loss of Gag clusters upon PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> depletion is not reflecting a change in the rate of Gag cluster loss through extracellular buding.</p><p>Results from all these additional experiments are discussed in the subsections “PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> is required to retain the partially assembled Gag lattice at the PM” and “HIV-1 Gag assembly sites can be reconstituted by rescue of PM PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
