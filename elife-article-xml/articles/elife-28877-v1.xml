However, the extent to which the mode of action of peptide signaling is conserved in different animals is largely unknown, because many peptides and receptors remain orphan and many undiscovered peptides still exist. Here, we identify two novel <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> neuropeptides, LURY-1-1 and LURY-1-2, as endogenous ligands for the neuropeptide receptor-22 (NPR-22). Both peptides derive from the same precursor that is orthologous to invertebrate luqin/arginine-tyrosine-NH<sub>2</sub> (RYamide) proneuropeptides. LURY-1 peptides are secreted from two classes of pharyngeal neurons and control food-related processes: feeding, lifespan, egg-laying, and locomotory behavior. We propose that LURY-1 peptides transmit food signals to NPR-22 expressed in feeding pacemaker neurons and a serotonergic neuron. Our results identified a critical role for luqin-like RYamides in feeding-related processes and suggested that peptide-mediated negative feedback is important for satiety regulation in <italic>C.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Deciphering the mechanisms of appetite control and the physiological effects of feeding is of great significance in modern societies, in which eating disorders and obesity are major health issues. The regulation of feeding requires interactions between distant organs and flexible fine-tuning of neural circuitries; therefore, it is no wonder that many neuromodulators including peptide hormones have been reported to control feeding in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sobrino Crespo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder, 2012</xref>). Previous studies in mammals have suggested the importance of negative feedback mediated by peptide hormones in satiety signaling. For example, feeding induces the secretion of anorexigenic (feeding-inhibitory) hormones such as peptide YY (PYY), pancreatic polypeptide (PP), cholecystokinin (CCK), and glucagon like peptide-1 (GLP-1) from the digestive organs, which in turn prevent excessive feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perry and Wang, 2012</xref>). These peptides counteract or negatively regulate neuropeptide Y (NPY), which is orexigenic (feeding-stimulatory). Although a wealth of knowledge has been obtained in mammalian models for food-related function of these peptides, understanding the roles of each peptide is not straightforward because of the multitude of cells and tissues involved and the multiplicate regulations acting on the peptides. Extensive studies have also been conducted on feeding and gastric motor circuits in invertebrates. For example, in <italic>Aplysia</italic>, the buccal ganglion feeding circuit is known to be regulated by neuropeptides such as <italic>Aplysia</italic> NPY, allatotropin-related peptide (ATRP), and myomodulin gene 2-derived peptide (MMG2-DP), while the feeding-related circuits in the stomatogastric ganglion in crustaceans are also regulated by known neuropeptides, as well as classical neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marder, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taghert and Nitabach, 2012</xref>). It is however still unclear to what extent these regulatory logics are universal and commonly inherited in the animal kingdom.</p><p>The nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> exhibits a variety of food-related behavioral and physiological plasticity despite its simple body structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashrafi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avery and You, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hart, 2006</xref>). <italic>C. elegans</italic> feeds on bacteria and ingests them by a pumping and peristaltic movements of the pharynx (or foregut) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avery and You, 2012</xref>). The pumping rate of the pharynx is finely regulated by food availability and other environmental conditions, while food availability also affects other behaviors such as egg-laying and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avery and You, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">You et al., 2008</xref>). For example, when starved <italic>C. elegans</italic> worms abruptly encounter food, pharyngeal pumping and egg-laying become highly active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">You et al., 2008</xref>). Such enhanced food intake during the refeeding period then induces a cessation of feeding and locomotion, which is thought to result from satiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">You et al., 2008</xref>). This detailed knowledge of food-related behaviors, along with the small number of cells and the simplicity of body structure, makes <italic>C. elegans</italic> a useful model system to investigate the evolutionarily conserved regulatory mechanisms of feeding and satiety. Monoamine neurotransmitters and some of the arginine-phenylalanine-NH<sub>2</sub> (RFamide) neuropeptides are known to be involved in food-related regulations and in some cases the exact cells in which these signaling molecules act have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li and Kim, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Papaioannou et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>). Previous studies suggest that peptidergic signaling often acts as a component of a feedback loop and fine-tunes food-related neuronal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalasani et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cohen et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Understanding the mechanisms of feeding control in nematodes such as <italic>C. elegans</italic> is also industrially important, because feeding is vital and can be a promising target process for pest control. For example, ivermectin, which is one of the most successful drugs both in human and livestock medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Omura and Crump, 2004</xref>), has been considered to exert its nematocidal effects on <italic>C. elegans</italic> through the constitutive opening of AVR-14/AVR-15-containing glutamate-gated chloride channels, and thus prevents feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Keane and Avery, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Our current understanding of feeding control by peptide signaling in animals is still largely limited, because (1) many peptides and peptide receptors are still orphan (i.e. for which a binding partner(s) has yet to be identified), (2) feeding is a very complicated process that involves most organs in the body, (3) the relative genetic intractability of the mammalian system makes it difficult to determine the in vivo functions of peptides and their receptors, and (4) the search for novel peptides and comparative analyses of peptides across classes or species have been hindered by their small size and low sequence conservation.</p><p>The mammalian NPY peptide family, which is composed of NPY, PYY, and PP, is characterized by sequence features such as the C-terminal arginine-tyrosine-NH<sub>2</sub> (RYamide) motif and their involvement in appetite control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tatemoto, 1982</xref>). Five receptors for the NPY peptide family have been cloned from mammals (Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5, and Y6). These receptors belong to the superfamily of seven-transmembrane G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR). NPY family peptides perform a variety of physiological functions by activating different subtype receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In invertebrates, peptides containing the C-terminal RYamide structure were first discovered in the brachyuran crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2003</xref>) and are also found in diverse classes, such as crustaceans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Christie, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dircksen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ma et al., 2010</xref>), mollusks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Proekt et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Veenstra, 2010</xref>), and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hauser et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roller et al., 2016</xref>). Some RYamide-containing peptides have been previously implied to have a role in feeding; the abundance of FVGGSRYamide and SGFYANRYamide increases after food intake in <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2010</xref>), QPPLPRYamide (MMG2-DPb) modulates contractions of a feeding-related muscle in <italic>Aplysia californica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Proekt et al., 2005</xref>), and the gene encoding EERTDMSPVPFVMGSRYamide and SPARLITPRNDRFFMGSRYamide is expressed in the enteroendocrine cells of the midgut in <italic>Bombyx mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Roller et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Luqins, a family of peptides originally isolated from left upper quadrant (LUQ) neurons in <italic>Aplysia</italic>, are peptides with around 10 amino acids with C-terminal RFamide, RYamide, or RWamide, and also characterized by a motif containing two cysteines located in the C-terminal portion of their precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Semmens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zatylny-Gaudin and Favrel, 2014</xref>). Some members of precursors that encode a RYamide-containing peptide(s) in ecdysozoa are considered to be closely orthologous to lophotrochozoan luqin precursors, and this family of ecdysozoan peptides has been historically called RYamides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Orthologs of luqin/RYamides precursors have been also found in deuterostomes (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>S. kowalevskii</italic>), but not in chordates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Using nucleic acid-based homology screening approaches, a <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> GPCR, CG5811 (also known as NepYR), was identified and found to be activated by mammalian NPY and PYY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 1992</xref>). Endogenous ligands for CG5811 had long been unknown. Recently, we identified two RYamide-containing peptides in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, named dRYamide-1 and -2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ida et al., 2011</xref>), as potent endogenous ligands for CG5811 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ida et al., 2011</xref>) (Figure 2C). dRYamides modulate feeding behavior in the blowfly <italic>Phormia regina</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ida et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2015</xref>). However, little is known about the precise physiological roles for dRYamides and CG5811 in regulation of feeding and other behaviors. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, FMRFamide-like peptide-7 (FLP-7) derived peptides were reported to be ligands for neuropeptide receptor-22 (NPR-22), which is phylogenetically similar to CG5811 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.wormbase.org">www.wormbase.org</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mertens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palamiuc et al., 2017</xref>). This phylogenic analysis shows that NPR-22 and CG5811 belong to the luqin/RYamide receptor family and may be distantly related to tachykinin, NPY, and leucokinin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), although the evolutionary relationship between the luqin/RYamide receptor group and other receptor groups has not so far been clear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jékely, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). FLP-7 precursor does not have characteristics of luqins, such as a canonical pair of cysteines in the C-terminal portion, and all of the peptides generated contain C-terminal RFamide structures, but not RYamide structures. Therefore, it is still largely elusive how the repertoire and the mode of action of luqins and RYamides are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Here, we report the identification of two luqin-like RYamide peptides in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, named LURY-1-1 and -2, as endogenous ligands for NPR-22. Importantly, LURY-1 peptides are secreted from two classes of pharyngeal neurons in a food-dependent manner and regulate multiple food-related processes including feeding and egg-laying through NPR-22. LURY-1 peptides act on the feeding pacemaker neurons MC and the serotonergic RIH neuron to exert their functions. Our results propose that luqin-like RYamide peptides are important for satiety transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification and structural determination of LURY-1-1 and LURY-1-2</title><p>To identify novel peptide ligands in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we constructed a stable CHO cell line expressing NPR-22a (CHO-NPR-22a) and measured changes in intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) induced by gel filtration samples from worm extracts. However, we could not detect any agonist activity from each fraction in this Ca<sup>2+</sup> assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast to the NPR-22a-expressing cells, our previous study showed that CG5811-expressing cells have a distinctive feature to detect both RYamide- and RFamide-containing peptides with high potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ida et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, we utilized a stable CHO cell line expressing CG5811 (CHO-CG5811) to search for agonist peptides from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts. The agonist activity for CHO-CG5811 cells was revealed at molecular mass (<italic>Mr</italic>) of about 1000 by gel filtration chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This activity could not be detected on CHO-NPR-22a cells even by the use of ten times the amount of samples used on CHO-CG5811 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). When the active fractions were separated by carboxymethyl ion-exchange high-performance liquid chromatography (CM-HPLC) at pH 6.5, four distinct agonist activities were revealed (fractions A–D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Each activity was purified as a single peak by successive reverse-phase HPLC (RP-HPLC). Of these, two peaks, P1 and P2, were isolated from fraction A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Amino acid sequences of the purified peptides were determined by a protein sequencer and mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). These two peptides were encoded by the same gene, <italic>Y75B8A.11</italic>, which was predicted as an ortholog of luqin/RYamide precursors in a bioinformatic study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mirabeau and Joly, 2013</xref>). Combined with the sequence of the <italic>Y75B8A.11</italic> cDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), we deduced the primary structures of the peptides as AVLPRY-NH<sub>2</sub> (P1) and PALLSRY-NH<sub>2</sub> (P2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Mass spectrometric analysis revealed that the observed monoisotopic <italic>m/z</italic> values of the purified peptides (P1, 717.25 and P2, 818.34) were almost identical to the theoretically predicted values (717.42 and 818.46, respectively) for peptides that are C-terminally amidated. Moreover, the synthetic AVLPRY-NH<sub>2</sub> and PALLSRY-NH<sub>2</sub> had identical retention times to natural peptides on RP-HPLC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). These data also suggest that both of the natural peptides have the deduced primary structures.

The proneuropeptide has a characteristic of luqins with canonical pair of cysteines in the C-terminal portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

LURY-1 peptides are secreted from the pharyngeal neurons M1 and M2 and control feeding, egg-laying, lifespan, and roaming behavior through NPR-22. Our cell-specific rescue experiments and genetic analyses suggest that NPR-22 acts in the feeding pacemaker MC neurons to control feeding and lifespan, whereas it acts upstream of serotonergic signals derived from the serotonin-uptaking RIH neuron to control egg-laying. Based on these results, together with the observation that the <italic>lury-1(gk961835</italic>) and <italic>npr-22(ok1598)</italic> deletion mutants reduced egg-laying and elevated feeding during the refeeding period after starvation, we propose a model in which LURY-1 peptides convey information about the food-evoked activation of pharynx to control multiple processes through the broadly expressed NPR-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). The distance and the lack of synaptic connection between the LURY-1 peptides-secreting neurons and RIH suggest that LURY-1 peptides can function in a hormone-like manner.</p><p>Several FMRFamide-related peptides, such as FLP-7–3, have previously been reported to be ligands of NPR-22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mertens et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palamiuc et al., 2017</xref>). However, in our hands, FLP-7–3 elicited a much weaker calcium response in CHO-NPR-22 cells than LURY-1 peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>) and did not affect egg laying nor pharyngeal pumping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), both of which are shown to be regulated by NPR-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Together with the finding that the <italic>lury-1(gk961835)</italic> and <italic>npr-22(ok1598)</italic> deletion mutants showed similar egg-laying and feeding phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), we conclude that LURY-1 peptides act as endogenous ligands of NPR-22. The findings in our study and a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Palamiuc et al., 2017</xref>) suggest that the two classes of NPR-22 ligands, LURY-1 peptides and FLP-7-derived peptides, mediate, at least in part, distinct functions.</p><p>Intriguingly, all the phenotypes caused by the multicopy expression of <italic>lury-1(+)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) are strongly related to feeding. Suppression of feeding, facilitation of egg-laying, and attenuation of locomotory behavior are all induced by the presence of abundant food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waggoner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">You et al., 2008</xref>). Lifespan extension has also been closely associated with feeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lakowski and Hekimi, 1998</xref>). Our results that both the lifespan and feeding phenotypes of the <italic>npr-22</italic> mutants were rescued by the <italic>npr-22</italic> expression under the <italic>ceh-19</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,E</xref>) imply that the <italic>lury-1(+)</italic>-mediated lifespan extension was caused by reduced feeding. Moreover, the secretion of LURY-1 peptides apparently depends on the presence of food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). Taken together, these observations raise the possibility that LURY-1 peptides transmit food-related signals from pharynx, which plays critical roles in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> digestive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>). Such a hypothesis is reminiscent of the mode of action of mammalian PYY and PP, which are also anorexigenic peptides derived from digestive organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loh et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, feeding suppressive effects of RYamide-containing peptides have also been observed in blowflies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maeda et al., 2015</xref>) and kuruma shrimps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mekata et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Although serotonin signaling in RIH is highly likely to mediate the effects of LURY-1 peptides on egg laying, the fact that serotonin signaling functions in HSN to facilitate egg-laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chase and Koelle, 2007</xref>) may complicate the interpretation of our results. The partial suppression of the LURY-1 peptide-mediated Egl-c phenotype by the <italic>mod-5</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) may imply the involvement of a cell(s) other than RIH and/or the parallel actions of LURY-1 peptides and serotonin. It is also unclear how NPR-22 controls the cell functions. Our results imply that NPR-22 suppresses the activity of the feeding pacemaker neurons MC and elevates serotonin signaling in RIH. NPR-22 may couple to different types of G-protein in different cells. Future studies will be needed to identify the downstream factors of NPR-22 and the functions of NPR-22-expressing cells other than MC and RIH.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the <italic>lury-1</italic>-expressing M1 and M2 neurons may have opposite functions in feeding. The M1 neuron responds to short wavelength light and stimulates spitting behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhatla et al., 2015</xref>), whereas the M2 neurons possess gap junction with the MC neurons and are stimulatory for pharyngeal pumping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albertson and Thomson, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trojanowski et al., 2014</xref>).

We suppose that the <italic>lury-1</italic> promoter, which induces the highly specific transgene expression in M1 and M2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), will be useful for examining the physiological functions of these neurons. Especially, manipulation of the neural activities or other cellular functions of these neurons will be important to precisely describe the roles of LURY-1 peptides in future studies, because we cannot exclude the possibility from our results that the multi-copy expression and/or the deletion of <italic>lury-1</italic> do not mimic the natural changes in the functions of LURY-1 peptides, and because the roles of the co-transmitters expressed in M1 and M2 remain unclear.</p><p>Biochemical identification and characterization of bioactive peptides have been relatively less reported in genetically-tractable small organisms such as <italic>C. elegans</italic>, making it difficult to conduct comparative analyses of peptides across classes or species. Our description of pharyngeal LURY-1 peptides in this study might lead to the discovery of relevant peptides and receptors in other organismal classes and re-evaluation of the functions of swallowing-related organs including pharynx, which have not received much attention in mammalian endocrinology, despite their direct involvement in feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and culture</title><p>Bristol N2 was used as the wild-type <italic>C. elegans</italic>.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Gáspár Jékely (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you can see below, the two main issues raised by the reviewers:</p><p>1) Putting your work in broader context, particularly in relation to previous work in other invertebrate and vertebrate systems (reviewer #2). This includes a toning down of the novelty of your observations.</p><p>2) As detailed by reviewer #3, the phylogenetic analysis of the ligand/receptor system needs to be fundamentally revised and the system should be referred to as suggested by this reviewer.</p><p>We are including the full sets of initial reviews so that you see the context for 1) and 2) above.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>This manuscript reports the biochemical discovery of two <italic>C. elegans</italic> neuropeptides related to the RY-amide peptides of mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> whose release is regulated by feeding and that in turn regulate behaviors that respond to feeding. The authors identify the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NPR-22 protein as the receptor for the worm peptides using both cell-based activation assays and <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetic experiments. They show the peptides are expressed in and functionally released from a pair of neurons in the pharynx, the feeding organ of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. They show that transgenic overexpression or injection of the peptides into <italic>C. elegans</italic> affects four different behaviors that are normally regulated by feeding. They identify the specific neurons that expression NPR-22 and show which of these neurons appear to mediate each behavioral effect of the overexpressed peptides. Knocking out the peptide gene or the receptor gene has no effects on behavior under well fed conditions, but the authors show that two of the behavioral effects of re-feeding starved animals depend, albeit subtly, on both the peptide and receptor gene. Their results support a model in which re-feeding leads to high activity of the pharyngeal neurons, release of the peptides, and their subsequent control of specific behaviors.</p><p>This paper will be of interest to: 1) those studying neuropeptide signaling in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> system; 2) those studying NPY-like peptide signaling in mammals and fruit flies, and those interested in general in signaling control of feeding and control of other behaviors by feeding.</p><p>The paper has several strong points. The biochemical identification of active peptides from <italic>C. elegans</italic> extracts is very impressive. This has been rarely done in the past, and there is a huge problem in the field of trying to match orphan neuropeptide receptor homologs with ligands. It is impressive to see this biochemical approach used so successfully. Also, the experimental work in this paper is almost without exception meticulous and impressive. The supplemental figures, for example, show really impressive use of cell specific markers to identify cells expressing the peptide and receptor genes, and the quality of the work in these experiments typifies the rest of the work in the paper.</p><p>The identification of loss of function phenotypes for the peptide and receptor genes is a key issue in evaluating this paper. It is a general problem that loss of function mutant phenotypes for neuropeptides and their receptors are very difficult to identify. It appears that a typical neuropeptide is released and has effects only under very particular conditions and then has very specific effects, so finding these is like hunting for a needle in a haystack. The authors use a clever and potentially generalizable approach to solve this problem. They first identify the specific cells that express the peptide and receptor, and use the detailed existing knowledge of worm neural functions to be able to guess possible functions to test. They next find phenotypic effects of overexpressing or injecting the peptides. They then try varying the conditions in which they culture the worms (feeding and starving) to eventually find related phenotypic defects in the loss of function mutants. The paper could be criticized in that the loss of function effects seen are quite subtle, and certainly it would be nice if they were stronger. However, the current state of the field is such that it is impressive to see any loss of function effects for neuropeptide or neuropeptide receptor loss of function mutants.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This is an interesting, detailed study which identifies, localizes and determines the feeding-related functions of a pair of RYamide neuropeptides in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. In addition to its contributions towards understanding the neuronal basis of behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, this work establishes that this peptide family shares with family members in several other animals (molluscs, arthropods, mammals) a functional influence on feeding-related behaviors. Enthusiasm is a bit tempered by (a) some discomfort regarding the extent to which the conclusions are touted as establishing the universality of RYamides for feeding, and (b) confusion regarding the identity of FLP-7 and its receptor, NPR-22. These issues are discussed below. This work should be of interest to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Impact statement/Elsewhere - &quot;unexpected parallels between the feeding regulatory mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, arthropods, and mammals mediated by neuropeptides with common C-terminal RYamide motifs.&quot; At various locations in the manuscript (e.g. Abstract, Impact Statement, end of Introduction, Discussion), of which the partial quote from the Impact Statement is one example, the impact of the results are used to establish the generality of this peptide family with respect to feeding-related behaviors across animal classes. However, this &quot;generality&quot; was already evident. As indicated in the text (e.g. Introdusction and elsewhere), what this paper does (and does very nicely!) is to extend to <italic>C. elegans</italic> the results of many previous studies in a number of other, disparate animal groups (e.g. molluscs, insects, crustaceans, mammals). It seems more appropriate to indicate that these new data extend said generality to nematodes, rather than staking a claim that these new data establish that generality and that this outcome was unexpected.</p><p>2. FLP-7/NPR-22: I am confused regarding the identity and function(s) of the peptide FLP-7 and its receptor NPR-22. I had no such confusion upon reading the manuscript, but then out of curiosity I downloaded and read one of the references cited (Palamiuc et al., 2017). Please clarify whether the apparent peptide and receptor discrepancies between your manuscript and those cited below from Palamiuc et al., (2017) are my misunderstanding, or whether they are something that requires additional control experiments.</p><p>In Palamiuc et al., (2017), which is also a <italic>C. elegans</italic> study:</p><p>A. FLP-7 is stated unequivocally to be a tachykinin peptide, related to mammalian Substance P and sharing the same C-terminal amino acid sequence, and not a N-terminally extended RFamide peptide as is indicated in this manuscript. Its identification in Palamiuc et al., (2017) as a tachykinin instead of a RFamide peptide is troubling insofar as controls were performed with RFamide peptides, not tachykinins.</p><p>B. NPR-22 is stated unequivocally to be related to a mammalian tachykinin receptor (NKR). This discrepancy calls into question whether the NPR-22 deletion experiments represent exclusively complementary results to the CeRYamide manipulations or whether they also represent elimination of <italic>C. elegans</italic> tachykinin actions.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this paper Ohno and colleagues identify and characterise a new <italic>C. elegans</italic> RYamide neuropeptide. First, they perform biochemical purification and isolate <italic>C. elegans</italic> ligands for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> RYamide receptor, CG5811. Following fractionation and MS analysis, the authors identified RYamide peptides that derive from a hitherto undescribed <italic>C. elegans</italic> proneuropeptide. These RYamide peptides activated the <italic>C. elegans</italic> NPR-22 receptor, a homolog of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CG5811. The RYamide ligands were more potent agonists of NPR-22 than the previously identified FLP-7-3, an RFamide peptide.</p><p>Using available mutants and an impressive set of transgenic strains the authors then analysed in detail the function of CeRYa and NPR-22. They found that CeRYamide-1 and CeRYamide-2 act through NPR-22 to control multiple processes, including egg laying, pharyngeal pumping, and longevity.</p><p>The authors used transgenic rescue constructs restricted to individual neurons to reconstruct neuron-level RYamide signaling pathways.</p><p>They found that</p><p>1) CeRYamide signals through NPR-22</p><p>2) NPR-22 likely acts in the MC neuron to suppress food pumping</p><p>3) NPR-22 acts in RIH to facilitate egg-laying</p><p>4) CeRYamides facilitate egg-laying through serotonin in RIH</p><p>These are interesting results and demonstrate the power of <italic>C. elegans</italic> to reconstruct neuropeptide action at a single cell resolution.</p><p>I have some criticism regarding the phylogenetic analysis and the evolutionary interpretation of the results. First, the phylogenetic tree presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> is of insufficient quality. The taxon sampling and number of sequences is very low. The Neighbor Joining method used is not suitable to satisfactorily resolve GPCR phylogeny. Instead, the authors should use ML or Bayesian analysis with a larger number of sequences.</p><p>I performed a more extended analysis of these receptors. I could confirm that NPR-22 is orthologous to <italic>Drosophila</italic> CG5811, the RYamide receptor. However, this family is not orthologous to NPY receptors in vertebrates. The RYamide receptor family was previously shown to be related to luqin receptors from annelids and mollusks (PMID: 23637342, 26190115). These constitute a distinct family from NPY receptors, more closely related to leucokinin receptors.</p><p>Furthermore, analysis of the peptide precursor sequence also identifies Y75B8A.11 as a clear ortholog of luqin (also called abdominal ganglion neuropeptides L5-67) propeptides. These all have one or two RY/RFamide peptides directly after the signal peptide and a C-term domain with two conserved Cys residues. These are also present in Y75B8A.11.</p><p>Overall, the combined proneuropeptide and receptor evidence clearly shows that the authors studied the <italic>C. elegans</italic> luqin-luqin receptor system.</p><p>Luqin is an ancient bilaterian family and homologs can also be found in non-vertebrate deuterostomes (e.g. starfish PMID: 26865025, hemichordates), however, this family has been lost from vertebrates. An overview of luqin function in mollusks can be found in PMID: 25386166.</p><p>The authors should consider renaming the peptide to luqin, representing the more widely used name for this conserved family. The authors also need to rewrite the discussion and parts of the introduction. Especially, references to NPY signaling are less relevant, and the authors should compare their results to what is known about luqin signaling (not much). e.g., &quot;Our results indicate that RYamide-containing peptides-NPY-like receptor axis is more widely&quot; this is not true, since RYamides in insects are not orthologous to NPY.</p><p>In the introduction, the authors state that the comparative analyses of peptides across species have been hindered by their small size and low sequence conservation. This is not entirely true, there have been major developments in recent years in the comparative genomics of neuropeptides and their receptors, see: PMID: 23671109, 23637342, 25904544, 28444138, 26865025.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;CeRYamides regulate food-evoked responses in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been much improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. These are only editorial issues, but they are important. In particular, there was general agreement that the issue of homology assignment was not sufficiently addressed (point #1 including all the subpoints).</p><p>1) NPY peptides vs. Luqin peptides: It is essential that the author provide a proper description of evolutionary relationships.</p><p>a) The C-terminal identity is not a sufficient indicator of a family relationship, but the authors imply that it is. This has to be changed. A C-term RYamide motif can occur in several different, unrelated neuropeptides, including NPY, RYamide/luqin, repetitive FMRFamide, and occasionally in sulfakinine. Furthermore, not all NPY/NPF or luqin peptides end with an RYamide. Deuterostome luqins end with RWamide, and protostome NPFs are RFamides. see Figure S1D. in www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/1221833110 for more details. Thus, the presence of an RYamide motif alone is not sufficient to establish the orthology of the precursors. It is therefore misleading to refer to a group of unrelated peptides as RYamides, since it does not necessarily mean a close relationship.</p><p>b) Abstract: &quot;Both peptides are like luqin in invertebrates and contain C-terminal arginine-tyrosine-NH2 (RYamide) structures identical to those of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family in vertebrates.&quot;</p><p>This needs to be changed. First, it would be good to state that both peptides derive from the same precursor. I suggest the following wording &quot;Both peptides derive from the same precursor that is orthologous to invertebrate luqin/RYamide proneuropeptides.&quot; The second part of the sentence should be deleted, since the final two residues cannot be used as an evidence of orthology, but the wording implies a close relationship.</p><p>c) Last sentence of abstract: &quot;Our results suggest that the roles of some RYamide-containing peptides and peptide-mediated negative feedback are widely conserved in feeding regulation among many animal classes.&quot; This needs to be changed. Since the exact relationship of NPY and luqin/RYamide is not clear and would require more extensive phylogenetic analysis, the authors also cannot argue about conservation. There are very few studies on luqins/RYamides, the only one I found is from the same group and shows that &quot;When administered to blowflies, dRYamide-1 suppressed feeding motivation.&quot; Finding a function for an unstudied bilaterian neuropeptide family is interesting enough. The closing sentence should best just state what the authors found without overselling &quot;Our results identified a critical role for luqin in feeding regulation...&quot;</p><p>d) Impact statement: &quot;feeding regulatory mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and those in arthropods and mammals mediated by neuropeptides with common C-terminal RYamide motifs.&quot; This needs to be changed, mammals have no orthologs to luqin/RYamide</p><p>e) Introduction: &quot;RYamides, peptides containing the C-terminal RYamide structure first discovered in the brachyuran crab Cancer borealis (Li et al., 2003), form a subgroup of luqins, and are also found in diverse invertebrates, such as crustaceans (Christie, 2014; Dircksen et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2010), mollusks (Proekt et al., 2005; Veenstra, 2010), and insects (Hauser et al., 2010; Ida et al., 2011; Roller et al., 2016).&quot; This is not precise. RYamides do not form a subgroup of luqins, but are luqins that are named RYamides for historical reasons. The orthology of mollusk/annelid luqins and insect RYamides has only recently been recognised. These propeptides form one orthologous group, meaning that they trace back to one ancestral luqin peptide that was present in the common ancestor of all bilaterians. This peptide has been retained in ambulacrarians on the deuterostome side of the bilaterian tree, and lost from chordates. They have been retained in most protostomes. The history of the luqin/RYamide receptors exactly parallels this distribution, showing (as 30 other bilaterian peptide-receptor pairs) the long-term stability of peptide-receptor pairs in evolution. Members of this family should best be called luqin, to avoid confusion. The name RYamide is preferred by the authors, probably because they want to emphasise its similarity to vertebrate NPY, however, this is now known, that luqin/NPY systems are not orthologous. In the text, the authors should also mention that luqin has been identified in <italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>S. kowalevskii</italic> (two deuterosomes), but has been lost from chordates.</p><p>f) The tree in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) luqin and RYamide receptors are highlighted in two colours. This is unfortunate, since it is one orthologous family, and that part of the tree only represents the species tree. The two sides of the orthology group (with lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans on the two sides) should be highlighted in the same colour and referred to as luqin/RYamide receptors.</p><p>g) There is insufficient relationship information between NPY-family receptors and luqin receptors. The exact paralogy relationships of luqin receptors and the other families (tachykinin, NPY, leucokinin) are not resolved by the tree shown, so this tree cannot be used to suggest a more direct paralogy relationship between luqin and NPY receptors. However, the authors could discuss that luqin, NPY, leucokinin, and tachykinin families are distantly related, but their relationships have not yet been clearly resolved, as described in these papers:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219956110 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1221833110</p><p>h) Nomenclature: To use Ce in the peptide name is not very fortunate, because the same peptide would then be called CbRY in <italic><underline>C. briggsae</underline></italic> and so on. This propeptide is a <italic>C. elegans</italic> luqin, and the receptor is a <italic>C. elegans</italic> luqin receptor. Furthermore, the propeptide that the authors identified has already been predicted as a <italic>C. elegans</italic> luqin in the very elegant bioinformatic study of Oliver Mirabeau in 2013 (www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219956110). This also shows that the identity of CeRY as a luqin is very clear. See Mirabeau &amp; Joly Dataset S1, alignment #30 www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219956110 a quote from their paper: &quot;We give predictions for <italic>C. elegans</italic> peptides that had not been characterized to date, which include TK, DH31/Calc, SIFa, LK, luqin, and AstA,B,and C (Dataset S1).&quot;</p><p>i) Results section: &quot;We designated these PALLSRY-NH2 and AVLPRY-NH2 peptides as CeRYamide-1 and CeRYamide-2, respectively. The proneuropeptide has a characteristic of luqins with canonical pair of cysteines in the C-terminal portion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).&quot; The peptides should be referred to as luqin-1 and luqin-2 (or, to accommodate the 4 letter restriction of gene names in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, luq or luqi).</p><p>2. Co-transmitters: In the Authors’ Reply to Reviewer Comments, they indicate that there are identified co-transmitters (including other neuropeptides) in the CeRYamide-containing M1 and M2 neurons but, given the data in this manuscript, the CeRYamide peptides are clearly the most important with respect to the studied behaviors. This may be true, but in fact that conclusion is premature. While we do agree that this conclusion may be correct, unless one actually performs experiments to understand the role(s) of the co-transmitters, it is simply not possible to know whether (a) the CeRYamides are indeed predominant in these behaviors, or (b) the imbalance between the actions of CeRyamides vs. its co-transmitters created by the manipulations in this manuscript provides heightened or diminished actions of one or more co-transmitter that are pivotal to the behavioral changes observed. Without a doubt, the CeRYamides play an important role in the studied behaviors, but considering that role to be pre-eminent seems premature. This point is also further addressed in the next comment (Major Comment #3).</p><p>A) Insofar as it is suggested in the Discussion section that the two CeRyamide-containing neurons (M1, M2) may have distinct functions, it seems relevant to include in that discussion the identity of the co-transmitters in those neurons since they may well contribute to the distinct functions.</p><p>3. Whole animal manipulations vs. individual neuron functions (Discussion section): The fact that the two CeRYamide-containing neurons (M1, M2) &quot;may have opposite functions in feeding&quot; gives one pause with respect to how reliably the experiments performed in this paper mimic the natural functions of neuronally-released CeRYamides. By way of example from a different model system, physiological studies in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion have shown that directly applying an identified peptide (proctolin) to this ganglion does not mimic the actions of 2 of the 3 types of proctolin-containing neurons that innervate this ganglion (reviewed in: Nusbaum et al., 2001; 2017). Whole system manipulations of a neuropeptide, as performed in the current manuscript, provide considerable valuable information regarding the action(s) of the manipulated peptide (as do the results in this paper), but those actions should never be considered to be identical to those of the peptide when they are neuronally released, unless this relationship is established by experiments. There are numerous reasons for the likelihood of discrepancies between these two approaches (e.g. see Nusbaum et al., 2017), one of which is the aforementioned (comment #3) presence of co-transmitters. Therefore, it is prudent to provide in the Discussion section an explicit indication that future studies will determine the extent to which the behavioral consequences established in this paper reflect the actions of neuronally-released CeRYamide.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28877.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…] The identification of loss of function phenotypes for the peptide and receptor genes is a key issue in evaluating this paper. It is a general problem that loss of function mutant phenotypes for neuropeptides and their receptors are very difficult to identify. It appears that a typical neuropeptide is released and has effects only under very particular conditions and then has very specific effects, so finding these is like hunting for a needle in a haystack. The authors use a clever and potentially generalizable approach to solve this problem. They first identify the specific cells that express the peptide and receptor, and use the detailed existing knowledge of worm neural functions to be able to guess possible functions to test. They next find phenotypic effects of overexpressing or injecting the peptides. They then try varying the conditions in which they culture the worms (feeding and starving) to eventually find related phenotypic defects in the loss of function mutants. The paper could be criticized in that the loss of function effects seen are quite subtle, and certainly it would be nice if they were stronger. However, the current state of the field is such that it is impressive to see any loss of function effects for neuropeptide or neuropeptide receptor loss of function mutants.</italic> </p><p>We sincerely appreciate the thoughtful comments and evaluation by the reviewer. As the reviewer pointed out, we wished that the loss-of-function phenotypes were stronger, but the defect was towards the direction opposite to the overexpression phenotype, and manifested under particular conditions. This is exactly how we reasoned and found the phenotype.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>This is an interesting, detailed study which identifies, localizes and determines the feeding-related functions of a pair of RYamide neuropeptides in C. elegans. In addition to its contributions towards understanding the neuronal basis of behavior in C. elegans, this work establishes that this peptide family shares with family members in several other animals (molluscs, arthropods, mammals) a functional influence on feeding-related behaviors. Enthusiasm is a bit tempered by (a) some discomfort regarding the extent to which the conclusions are touted as establishing the universality of RYamides for feeding, and (b) confusion regarding the identity of FLP-7 and its receptor, NPR-22. These issues are discussed below. This work should be of interest to the broad readership of eLife.</italic> </p><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for evaluating the overall significance of the work.</p><p> <italic>1) Impact statement/Elsewhere - &quot;unexpected parallels between the feeding regulatory mechanisms in C. elegans, arthropods, and mammals mediated by neuropeptides with common C-terminal RYamide motifs.&quot; At various locations in the manuscript (e.g. Abstract, Impact Statement, end of Introduction, Discussion), of which the partial quote from the Impact Statement is one example, the impact of the results are used to establish the generality of this peptide family with respect to feeding-related behaviors across animal classes. However, this &quot;generality&quot; was already evident. As indicated in the text (e.g. Introduction and elsewhere), what this paper does (and does very nicely!) is to extend to C. elegans the results of many previous studies in a number of other, disparate animal groups (e.g. molluscs, insects, crustaceans, mammals). It seems more appropriate to indicate that these new data extend said generality to nematodes, rather than staking a claim that these new data establish that generality and that this outcome was unexpected.</italic> </p><p>We are sorry about our ignorance of the previous understanding in literature, and thank the reviewer for pointing this out. As suggested, we changed the statements as follows:</p><p>In Impact Statement, we deleted &quot;unexpected&quot;, leaving the following statement: &quot;CeRYamide peptides reveal parallels between the feeding regulatory mechanisms in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and those in arthropods and mammals&quot;.</p><p>In Introduction, we deleted &quot;unexpected&quot; and rephrased the sentence, leaving the following statement: &quot;Here, we demonstrate that the RYamide-containing peptides are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic> […]&quot;.</p><p> <italic>2. FLP-7/NPR-22: I am confused regarding the identity and function(s) of the peptide FLP-7 and its receptor NPR-22. I had no such confusion upon reading the manuscript, but then out of curiosity I downloaded and read one of the references cited (Palamiuc et al., 2017). Please clarify whether the apparent peptide and receptor discrepancies between your manuscript and those cited below from Palamiuc et al., (2017) are my misunderstanding, or whether they are something that requires additional control experiments.</italic> </p><p> <italic>In Palamiuc et al., (2017), which is also a C. elegans study:</italic> </p><p> <italic>A. FLP-7 is stated unequivocally to be a tachykinin peptide, related to mammalian Substance P and sharing the same C-terminal amino acid sequence, and not a N-terminally extended RFamide peptide as is indicated in this manuscript. Its identification in Palamiuc et al., (2017) as a tachykinin instead of a RFamide peptide is troubling insofar as controls were performed with RFamide peptides, not tachykinins.</italic> </p><p> <italic>B. NPR-22 is stated unequivocally to be related to a mammalian tachykinin receptor (NKR). This discrepancy calls into question whether the NPR-22 deletion experiments represent exclusively complementary results to the CeRYamide manipulations or whether they also represent elimination of C. elegans tachykinin actions.</italic> </p><p>As pointed out by the reviewer, Palamiuc et al., claimed that FLP-7 is a ligand of NPR-22 based on the previous cell-line assay (Mertens et al., 2006, <italic>Peptides</italic>). This is consistent with our assay and our results show that CeRYamides are more potent agonists of NPR-22 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E and 2F</xref>). Palamiuc et al., also showed that loss-of-function mutants of <italic>flp-7</italic> and <italic>npr-22</italic> show a similar defect in fat reduction in the presence of serotonin, consistent with the possibility that FLP-7 acts on NPR-22 in vivo. This is not inconsistent with our result that CeRYamides are ligands for NPR-22, and it is possible that both of these different peptides act on NPR-22. We added discussion on this possibility in the text.</p><p>As discussed by Reviewer #3, their assignment of FLP-7 to tachykinin and NPR-22 to tachykinin receptor is not based on strong evidence. In Palamiuc et al., (2017), the sequences of FLP-7-1 and Substance P were shown as SPMQRSSMVRFGKR and RPKPQQFFGLMGKR, respectively (Supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, the last two basic amino acid residues (KR) are the putative cleavage site in the precursors and the third residue from the last (Glycine) serves as the putative amide donor for C-terminal amidation. Thus, the last three residues (GKR) are a fairly common motif in peptide precursors and FLP-7 peptides are highly likely to be RFamides. Considering this, in our opinion, the similarity in the sequences of mature FLP-7-1 and substance P, SPMQRSSMVRFamide and RPKPQQFFGLMamide, are quite limited.</p><p> <italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p> <italic>[…] I have some criticism regarding the phylogenetic analysis and the evolutionary interpretation of the results. First, the phylogenetic tree presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> is of insufficient quality. The taxon sampling and number of sequences is very low. The Neighbor Joining method used is not suitable to satisfactorily resolve GPCR phylogeny. Instead, the authors should use ML or Bayesian analysis with a larger number of sequences.</italic> </p><p><italic>I performed a more extended analysis of these receptors. I could confirm that NPR-22 is orthologous to Drosophila CG5811, the RYamide receptor. However, this family is not orthologous to NPY receptors in vertebrates. The RYamide receptor family was previously shown to be related to luqin receptors from annelids and mollusks (PMID: 23637342, 26190115). These constitute a distinct family from NPY receptors, more closely related to leucokinin receptors.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important issue. As suggested, we also performed phylogenetic analysis of the receptor with increased number of receptors from various organisms. As already shown by the reviewer, NPR-22 belongs to the Luqin receptor/RYamide receptor group, which is distantly related to NPY receptor family and tachykinin receptor family. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> was replaced with this revised version. Also, throughout the text we indicated that NPR-22 belongs to the luqin/RYamide receptor family.</p><p> <italic>Furthermore, analysis of the peptide precursor sequence also identifies Y75B8A.11 as a clear ortholog of luqin (also called abdominal ganglion neuropeptides L5-67) propeptides. These all have one or two RY/RFamide peptides directly after the signal peptide and a C-term domain with two conserved Cys residues. These are also present in Y75B8A.11.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Overall, the combined proneuropeptide and receptor evidence clearly shows that the authors studied the C. elegans luqin-luqin receptor system.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Luqin is an ancient bilaterian family and homologs can also be found in non-vertebrate deuterostomes (e.g. starfish PMID: 26865025, hemichordates), however, this family has been lost from vertebrates. An overview of luqin function in mollusks can be found in PMID: 25386166.</italic> </p><p> <italic>The authors should consider renaming the peptide to luqin, representing the more widely used name for this conserved family. The authors also need to rewrite the discussion and parts of the introduction. Especially, references to NPY signaling are less relevant, and the authors should compare their results to what is known about luqin signaling (not much).</italic></p><p>We thank also for leading us to these literature. Based on the alignments made in previous studies, RYamides form a subgroup of the luqin family, so we keep the nomenclature CeRYamide but clearly indicated in the revised manuscript that the precursor is like members of the luqin family.</p><p><italic>E.g., &quot;Our results indicate that RYamide-containing peptides-NPY-like receptor axis is more widely&quot; this is not true, since RYamides in insects are not orthologous to NPY.</italic> </p><p>We corrected such sentences because of the distant relationship of CeRYamide and its receptor to NPY. The &quot;NPY-like&quot; was omitted from the title. &quot;axis of RYamide-containing peptides and NPY-like receptor is unexpectedly conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot; was changed to &quot;RYamide-containing peptides are conserved in <italic>C. elegans</italic>&quot;. &quot;Our results indicate that RYamide-containing peptides–NPY-like receptor axis is more widely conserved among animal classes than previously thought&quot; was deleted.</p><p>Although with the distant relationship, we consider introduction of NPY family is beneficial because peptidergic control of feeding-related functions is a general scheme. So the introduction now refers to all relevant information including NPY and luqin.</p><p> <italic>In the introduction, the authors state that the comparative analyses of peptides across species have been hindered by their small size and low sequence conservation. This is not entirely true, there have been major developments in recent years in the comparative genomics of neuropeptides and their receptors, see: PMID: 23671109, 23637342, 25904544, 28444138, 26865025.</italic></p><p>Thank you again for the guidance. We cited these references.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) NPY peptides vs. Luqin peptides: It is essential that the author provide a proper description of evolutionary relationships.</italic> </p><p> <italic>a) The C-terminal identity is not a sufficient indicator of a family relationship, but the authors imply that it is. This has to be changed. A C-term RYamide motif can occur in several different, unrelated neuropeptides, including NPY, RYamide/luqin, repetitive FMRFamide, and occasionally in sulfakinine. Furthermore, not all NPY/NPF or luqin peptides end with an RYamide. Deuterostome luqins end with RWamide, and protostome NPFs are RFamides. see Figure S1D. in www.pnas.org/cgi/content/short/1221833110 for more details.</italic> </p><p> <italic>Thus, the presence of an RYamide motif alone is not sufficient to establish the orthology of the precursors. It is therefore misleading to refer to a group of unrelated peptides as RYamides, since it does not necessarily mean a close relationship</italic> </p><p>As the reviewer suggested, we revised Introduction and Discussion, and removed indeliberate reference to all RYamide-containing peptides as “RYamides”. For example, we changed the phrase “RYamides, peptides containing the C-terminal RYamide structure first discovered in the brachyuran crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> (Li et al., 2003),” to “In invertebrates, peptides containing the C-terminal RYamide structure were first discovered in the brachyuran crab <italic>Cancer borealis</italic> (Li et al., 2003)”. The term &quot;RYamides&quot; is only used for putative luqin orthologues based on the related structures of the propeptides in the revised manuscript, as described further below.</p><p> <italic>b) Abstract: &quot;Both peptides are like luqin in invertebrates and contain C-terminal arginine-tyrosine-NH2 (RYamide) structures identical to those of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) family in vertebrates.&quot; This needs to be changed. First, it would be good to state that both peptides derive from the same precursor. I suggest the following wording &quot;Both peptides derive from the same precursor that is orthologous to invertebrate luqin/RYamide proneuropeptides.&quot; The second part of the sentence should be deleted, since the final two residues cannot be used as an evidence of orthology, but the wording implies a close relationship.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we changed the sentence to “Both peptides derive from the same precursor that is orthologous to invertebrate luqin/arginine-tyrosine-NH<sub>2</sub> (RYamide) proneuropeptides.”</p><p> <italic>c) Last sentence of abstract: &quot;Our results suggest that the roles of some RYamide-containing peptides and peptide-mediated negative feedback are widely conserved in feeding regulation among many animal classes.&quot; This needs to be changed. Since the exact relationship of NPY and luqin/RYamide is not clear and would require more extensive phylogenetic analysis, the authors also cannot argue about conservation. There are very few studies on luqins/RYamides, the only one I found is from the same group and shows that &quot;When administered to blowflies, dRYamide-1 suppressed feeding motivation.&quot; Finding a function for an unstudied bilaterian neuropeptide family is interesting enough. The closing sentence should best just state what the authors found without overselling &quot;Our results identified a critical role for luqin in feeding regulation&quot;</italic> </p><p>We omitted reference to NPY and changed the sentence to “Our results identified a critical role for luqin-like RYamides in feeding-related processes and suggested that peptide-mediated negative feedback is important for satiety regulation in <italic>C. elegans</italic>”, to avoid any mention about conservation among species.</p><p> <italic>d) Impact statement: &quot;feeding regulatory mechanisms in C. elegans and those in arthropods and mammals mediated by neuropeptides with common C-terminal RYamide motifs.&quot; This needs to be changed, mammals have no orthologs to luqin/RYamide</italic> </p><p>We changed the sentence to “Identification and functional characterization of <italic>C. elegans</italic> luqin-like arginine-tyrosine-NH<sub>2</sub> (RYamide) peptides reveal their critical role in feeding-related processes.”</p><p> <italic>e) Introduction: &quot;RYamides, peptides containing the C-terminal RYamide structure first discovered in the brachyuran crab Cancer borealis (Li et al., 2003), form a subgroup of luqins, and are also found in diverse invertebrates, such as crustaceans (Christie, 2014; Dircksen et al., 2011; Ma et al., 2010), mollusks (Proekt et al., 2005; Veenstra, 2010), and insects (Hauser et al., 2010; Ida et al., 2011; Roller et al., 2016).&quot; This is not precise. RYamides do not form a subgroup of luqins, but are luqins that are named RYamides for historical reasons. The orthology of mollusk/annelid luqins and insect RYamides has only recently been recognised. These propeptides form one orthologous group, meaning that they trace back to one ancestral luqin peptide that was present in the common ancestor of all bilaterians. This peptide has been retained in ambulacrarians on the deuterostome side of the bilaterian tree, and lost from chordates. They have been retained in most protostomes. The history of the luqin/RYamide receptors exactly parallels this distribution, showing (as 30 other bilaterian peptide-receptor pairs) the long-term stability of peptide-receptor pairs in evolution. Members of this family should best be called luqin, to avoid confusion. The name RYamide is preferred by the authors, probably because they want to emphasise its similarity to vertebrate NPY, however, this is now known, that luqin/NPY systems are not orthologous. In the text, the authors should also mention that luqin has been identified in S. purpuratus and S. kowalevskii (two deuterosomes), but has been lost from chordates.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we deleted the phrase “(RYamides) form a subgroup of luqins”. We also added in introduction the following: “Orthologs of luqin/RYamides precursors have been also found in deuterostomes (<italic>S. purpuratus</italic> and <italic>S. kowalevskii</italic>), but not in chordates (Jékely, 2013; Mirabeau and Joly, 2013).”</p><p>In the revised manuscript we called the two <italic>C. elegans</italic> peptides “luqin-like RYamide peptides”, but not “luqins”, because of the following reasons:</p><p>Many ecdysozoan peptides have been called “RYamide” in previous studies. Mirabeau and Joly (2013) also used the expression “alignment of lophotrochozoan luqin and arthropod RYamide peptides” (Dataset S1, #30).</p><p>The presence of the paired-cysteine motif is apparently not a perfect hallmark of the luqin/RYamide family. The original dataset of Mirabeau and Joly (2013) includes 13 members of the luqin/RYamide (http://neuroevo.org), but out of them three members (<italic>jgi_213930_Ctel, gi_18866372_Agam</italic>, and <italic>Ensembl_FBtr0310523_NepY_Dmel</italic>) were not presented in the alignment in their paper (Dataset S1, #30). Of these, <italic>jgi_213930_Ctel</italic> and <italic>Ensembl_FBtr0310523_NepY_Dmel</italic> do not have the paired-cysteine motif in the C-terminal portion. (And <italic>gi_18866372_Agam</italic> has a long signal peptide.) In addition, the conserved amino acids (S/T)-G and (V/I/L)-(P/Y) between two cysteines are not present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><p>Although there are exceptions, lophotrochozoan luqins and ecdysozoan RYamides have their own characteristics: (a) One peptide is produced from a lophotrochozoan luqin precursor, but two peptides are produced from an ecdysozoan RYamide precursor and (b) The C-terminal structure of most ecdysozoan RYamide peptides is RYamide. We surely think that lophotrochozoan luqins and ecdysozoan RYamides evolved from a common ancestor as the reviewers pointed out, but the <italic>C. elegans</italic> peptides apparently have RYamide-like features.</p><p>it is currently unclear whether lophotrochozoan luqins and ecdysozoan RYamides are functionally relevant, because the physiological functions of these peptides, especially of luqins, have been largely unexplored.</p><p> <italic>f) The tree in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) luqin and RYamide receptors are highlighted in two colours. This is unfortunate, since it is one orthologous family, and that part of the tree only represents the species tree. The two sides of the orthology group (with lophotrochozoans and ecdysozoans on the two sides) should be highlighted in the same colour and referred to as luqin/RYamide receptors.</italic> </p><p>We refined the phylogenetic tree (<italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref></italic>) as suggested.</p><p> <italic>g) There is insufficient relationship information between NPY-family receptors and luqin receptors. The exact paralogy relationships of luqin receptors and the other families (tachykinin, NPY, leucokinin) are not resolved by the tree shown, so this tree cannot be used to suggest a more direct paralogy relationship between luqin and NPY receptors. However, the authors could discuss that luqin, NPY, leucokinin, and tachykinin families are distantly related, but there relationships have not yet been clearly resolved, as described in these papers:</italic> </p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> in www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219956110 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1221833110</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we added in Introduction the following: “This phylogenic analysis shows that NPR-22 and CG5811 belong to the luqin/RYamide receptor family and may be distantly related to tachykinin, NPY, and leucokinin receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), although the evolutionary relationship between the luqin/RYamide receptor group and other receptor groups has not so far been clear (Jékely, 2013; Mirabeau and Joly, 2013)</p><p> <italic>h) Nomenclature: To use Ce in the peptide name is not very fortunate, because the same peptide would then be called CbRY in C. briggsae and so on. This propeptide is a C. elegans luqin, and the receptor is a C. elegans luqin receptor. Furthermore, the propeptide that the authors identified has already been predicted as a C. elegans luqin in the very elegant bioinformatic study of Oliver Mirabeau in 2013 (www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1219956110). This also shows that the identity of CeRY as a luqin is very clear.

This may be true, but in fact that conclusion is premature. While we do agree that this conclusion may be correct, unless one actually performs experiments to understand the role(s) of the co-transmitters, it is simply not possible to know whether (a) the CeRYamides are indeed predominant in these behaviors, or (b) the imbalance between the actions of CeRyamides vs. its co-transmitters created by the manipulations in this manuscript provides heightened or diminished actions of one or more co-transmitter that are pivotal to the behavioral changes observed. Without a doubt, the CeRYamides play an important role in the studied behaviors, but considering that role to be pre-eminent seems premature. This point is also further addressed in the next comment (Major Comment #3).</italic> </p><p>It is surely possible that the multi-copy expression and/or the deletion of the peptides affect the functions of the co-transmitters, although we do not think that the synthetic peptides administered into the worm body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) act specifically on a co-transmitter(s) expressed in M1 and M2. We added statements about the co-transmitters in Discussion (see below).</p><p><italic>(A) Insofar as it is suggested in the Discussion section that the two CeRyamide-containing neurons (M1, M2) may have distinct functions, it seems relevant to include in that discussion the identity of the co-transmitters in those neurons since they may well contribute to the distinct functions.</italic> </p><p>As suggested, we added the following explanation in Discussion: “The significance of the expression of <italic>lury-1</italic> in these distinct neurons and the roles of the co-transmitters expressed in these neurons, such as acetylcholine and NLP/FLP neuropeptides (Nathoo et al., 2001; Pereira et al., 2015; Rogers et al., 2003), are important topics for future studies,” and “the roles of the co-transmitters expressed in M1 and M2 remain unclear</p><p> <italic>3. Whole animal manipulations vs. individual neuron functions (Discussion section): The fact that the two CeRYamide-containing neurons (M1, M2) &quot;may have opposite functions in feeding&quot; gives one pause with respect to how reliably the experiments performed in this paper mimic the natural functions of neuronally-released CeRYamides. By way of example from a different model system, physiological studies in the crustacean stomatogastric ganglion have shown that directly applying an identified peptide (proctolin) to this ganglion does not mimic the actions of 2 of the 3 types of proctolin-containing neurons that innervate this ganglion (reviewed in: Nusbaum et al., 2001; 2017). Whole system manipulations of a neuropeptide, as performed in the current manuscript, provide considerable valuable information regarding the action(s) of the manipulated peptide (as do the results in this paper), but those actions should never be considered to be identical to those of the peptide when they are neuronally released, unless this relationship is established by experiments. There are numerous reasons for the likelihood of discrepancies between these two approaches (e.g. see Nusbaum et al., 2017), one of which is the aforementioned (comment #3) presence of co-transmitters. Therefore, it is prudent to provide in the Discussion section an explicit indication that future studies will determine the extent to which the behavioral consequences established in this paper reflect the actions of neuronally-released CeRYamide.</italic></p><p>We added the following sentence in Discussion section: “Especially, manipulation of the neural activities or other cellular functions of these neurons will be important to precisely describe the roles of LURY-1 peptides in future studies, because we cannot exclude the possibility from our results that the multi-copy expression and/or the deletion of <italic>lury-1</italic> do not mimic the natural changes in the functions of LURY-1 peptides, and because the roles of the co-transmitters expressed in M1 and M2 remain unclear.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
