unraveling the function of neuronal circuits but is challenging due to the limited performance of existing tools. In particular, while genetically encoded voltage indicators have shown promise for optical detection of voltage transients, many indicators exhibit low sensitivity when imaged under two-photon illumination. Previous studies thus fell short of visualizing voltage dynamics in individual neurons in single trials. Here, we report ASAP2s, a novel voltage indicator with improved sensitivity. By imaging ASAP2s using random-access multi-photon microscopy, we demonstrate robust single-trial detection of action potentials in organotypic slice cultures. We also show that ASAP2s enables two-photon imaging of graded potentials in organotypic slice cultures and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These results demonstrate that the combination of ASAP2s and fast two-photon imaging methods enables detection of neural electrical activity with subcellular spatial resolution and millisecond-timescale precision.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

propagate information by controlling the potential across their plasma membrane. Methods to measure electrical activity are thus central to efforts to understand computations in the brain. While electrophysiological approaches have been used for decades, the need to track genetically defined neuronal subpopulations has motivated the development and application of protein-based fluorescent reporters of neural activity. In contrast to electrode-based methods, these optophysiological indicators also allow monitoring without placement of physical probes near or in the neurons of interest. Thus, they can enable easier and less invasive measurement of activity from individual neurons and from their subcellular compartments such as axons and dendrites.</p><p>Genetically encoded calcium indicators are commonly used to detect the forms of neuronal activity that trigger calcium flux into neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tian et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin and Schnitzer, 2016</xref>). For example, recent calcium indicators such as GCaMP6f can detect single action potentials (APs) in cell bodies and synaptic responses in spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). However, calcium concentration is not directly related to membrane potential, and therefore cannot be used to follow voltage changes that do not result in substantial calcium fluxes. Calcium indicators thus cannot effectively report hyperpolarizations and somatic subthreshold depolarizations in many neuronal cell types. The slow kinetics of calcium indicators and of calcium transients also limit the ability of calcium indicators to report voltage changes with high temporal precision and to track fast trains of action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Koester and Sakmann, 2000</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Helmchen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Theis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To follow membrane potential dynamics more accurately, fluorescent indicators that monitor transmembrane voltage rather than calcium concentration have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin and Schnitzer, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Knöpfel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yang and St-Pierre, 2016</xref>). These genetically encoded voltage indicators (GEVIs) have been used to image activity of neuronal populations in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Akemann et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scott et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carandini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mutoh et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shimaoka et al., 2017</xref>) and of single neurons within intact brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flytzanis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2014</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storace et al., 2015</xref>) using widefield one-photon illumination. However, two-photon microscopy is the preferred modality for in vivo studies as it allows imaging with deeper tissue penetration and with lower background fluorescence and phototoxicity outside of the focal point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Svoboda and Yasuda, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prevedel et al., 2016</xref>). GEVI-based voltage imaging in intact tissue with two-photon excitation has only been demonstrated for monitoring neural activity with either low temporal resolution (less than 100 Hz), low spatial resolution (averaging over ensembles of cells), or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahrens et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Akemann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Storace et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). Robust single-trial two-photon GEVI imaging with millisecond-timescale and cellular or subcellular resolution in intact neuronal tissue has not yet been reported.</p><p>Here, we demonstrate GEVI-based two-photon voltage imaging with millisecond-timescale precision, subcellular resolution, and the ability to simultaneously monitor spatially segregated locations. We first describe the development and characterization of ASAP2s, a higher-sensitivity variant of the GFP-based indicator ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>). We next compare ASAP2s with other GEVIs for two-photon imaging of light-evoked subcellular voltage dynamics in living flies. Having evaluated ASAP2s in vitro and in vivo, we deploy this new indicator to image voltage dynamics using random-access multi-photon microscopy in organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, where we demonstrate the ability of ASAP2s to detect action potentials, subthreshold depolarizations, and hyperpolarizations in individual cells in single trials. Finally, we show that ASAP2s can report action potential backpropagation in dendritic arbors and that this new GEVI enables single-trial, single-voxel spike detection at the soma.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development and characterization of ASAP2s</title><p>We aimed to improve and characterize the performance of GEVIs for reporting rapid neuronal electrical activity using two-photon microscopy in brain tissue. A previous study demonstrated that the two-photon properties of GEVIs can differ from their one-photon characteristics, with several indicators exhibiting response amplitudes that were more than 75% smaller with two-photon than with one-photon excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, the ASAP1 indicator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>) was unique in maintaining similar response amplitudes under one- and two-photon illumination. We therefore considered ASAP1 as a promising template for two-photon imaging.</p><p>The probability of correctly identifying spikes from optical noise is higher for sensors with larger response amplitudes, greater brightness, and longer signal decay (slower off-rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilt et al., 2013</xref>). We therefore sought to develop sensors with improvements in one or more of these characteristics. We performed rational mutagenesis in the transmembrane four-helix voltage-sensing domain (VSD) of ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), focusing on residues important for sensing or responding to changes in the electric field. We tested the resulting mutants by patch-clamp electrophysiology in HEK293A cells. We first mutated a conserved site in the first helix (S1) that is thought to be part of a hydrophobic plug that focuses the electric field in homologous proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lacroix and Bezanilla, 2012</xref>). However, none of the mutants exhibited improved response amplitudes to rapid, millisecond-timescale changes in electrical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–H</xref>). We then targeted positively charged residues in the fourth helix (S4) responsible for sensing the transmembrane electrical field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bezanilla, 2008</xref>). ASAP1 with an R415Q mutation, which neutralizes one of these sensing charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) met two of our key design criteria: improved voltage responsiveness in HEK293A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>) and a slower off-rate than ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

In response to a 1 s, 100 mV depolarization from –70 mV in HEK293A cells, ASAP2s exhibited a steady-state fluorescence change of –38.7 ± 1.1%, versus –23.3 ± 1.1% for ASAP1 (mean ± standard error of the mean, p&lt;0.001, t-test), a 66% improvement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). The steady-state response of ASAP2s to voltage steps has the largest amplitude among GEVIs based on fluorescent proteins, surpassing ArcLight Q239 (−32 to −35%, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zou et al., 2014</xref>]), MacQ-mCitrine (~−20%, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2014</xref>]), and Ace2N-mNeon (&lt;-5% steady-state, ~−19% peak, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2015</xref>]). We next evaluated the kinetics of ASAP2s and ASAP1 by fitting the optical responses to 100 mV step depolarizations in HEK293A cells. We also evaluated ArcLight Q239 (hereby designated as ArcLight), an indicator previously used to benchmark new GEVIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>). Fluorescence responses of all GEVIs were best fit by a weighted sum of two time constants (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). We focus here on the faster time constants given their greater importance for tracking rapid neuronal activity. The fast depolarization time constants (on-rates) were 5.2 ms for ASAP2s and 2.9 ms for ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), much faster than the 20 ms for ArcLight. Critically, ASAP2s’ fast response to repolarization (fast off-rate) was 24 ms or ~10 fold slower than ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>), a useful change for improving spike detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilt et al., 2013</xref>), while being still sufficiently rapid to track fast trains of AP waveforms at 100 Hz in single trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>We next confirmed that the R415Q mutation in ASAP1 did not affect its brightness under both one- and two-photon excitation. As brightness depends on the membrane potential, we evaluated indicator brightness in HEK293-Kir2.1, a cell line with plasma membrane potential around –77 mV, close to the resting membrane potential of many neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>). When expressed in these cells, ASAP2s matched the brightness of ASAP1 under both one- and two-photon illumination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Two-photon microscopy experiments were performed by exciting GEVIs at ~920 nm, the wavelength at which ASAP1 and ASAP2s are maximally excited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The commonly-used fluorescent protein EGFP, which we evaluated as a standard, also produced maximal brightness when excited at 920 nm, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drobizhev et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We next compared the photostability of ASAP1 and ASAP2s in HEK293-Kir2.1 cells. We also sought to compare the photobleaching kinetics of the ASAP indicators to those of ArcLight and EGFP. Because of fundamental differences in apparent photobleaching between membrane and cytoplasmic probes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>), it is most appropriate to compare photostability under conditions where EGFP is membrane localized. We therefore created a standard by replacing the circularly permuted GFP in ASAP1 with EGFP; we designated the resulting probe ASAP1::EGFP. Under one-photon widefield microscopy at identical illumination power, ASAP1 and ASAP2s photobleached similarly to each other and to ArcLight and more slowly than ASAP1::EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Consistent with the photobleaching behavior of superfolder GFP, the fluorescent protein from which the GFP in ASAP indicators was derived, photobleaching kinetics were best fit by a two-term exponential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, ArcLight and ASAP1::EGFP photobleached with monoexponential kinetics. We observed a partial recovery in ASAP1 and ASAP2s fluorescence following incubation in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C–F</xref>), possibly due to dark reversion of bleached to unbleached molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sinnecker et al., 2005</xref>), diffusion of unbleached probes to the illuminated area, or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pincet et al., 2016</xref>). Longer dark incubation resulted in greater fluorescence recovery, yielding 8.9 ± 0.6% recovery of the original fluorescence for a 0.5 min incubation, and 22.4 ± 0.7% for a 5-min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). The magnitude of fluorescence recovery in dark-incubated ASAP1- and ASAP2s-expressing cells was similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3E,F</xref>).</p><p>Under two-photon laser scanning excitation, ASAP1 and ASAP2s rapidly lost ~30% of their initial brightness but then bleached at slower or similar rates compared with ArcLight and ASAP1::EGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A,B</xref>). The photobleaching kinetics of all probes was best fit using exponentials with an additional term compared with their one-photon photobleaching curves. We do not have a mechanistic explanation for this difference in photobleaching kinetics. Increasing the power per pixel increased the rate of photobleaching, but the relationship between photobleaching kinetics and laser power was complex and nonlinear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C,D</xref>). Photobleaching rates are expected to vary based on the power at each pixel, which depend not only on laser power but also on the pixel duty cycle, defined as the percentage of time the laser is exciting each location corresponding to the image pixels. The pixel duty cycle is calculated as the product of the frame acquisition rate and the length of time the laser resides at each location in each sweep (the dwell time). As anticipated, two conditions with identical power per pixel gave similar photobleaching rates, despite differing in laser power, frame rate, and dwell time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Incubation in the dark resulted in fluorescence recovery, as observed under one-photon illumination: 20–25% of original fluorescence was recovered following a 5-min dark incubation for both ASAP1 and ASAP2s and across two conditions with distinct laser power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4F,G</xref>). If this reversible photobleaching could be repeatedly obtained over multiple cycles, it would provide a strategy for mitigating photobleaching, for example in longitudinal studies where the same group of cells are repeatedly imaged over multiple days or months.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Benchmarking GEVIs for imaging voltage dynamics in cardiomyocytes and neurons</title><p>We next sought to compare the ability of ASAP2s and other indicators to report voltage dynamics in excitable cells.

Consistent with our results in HEK293A cells, the response amplitude of ASAP2s to cardiac potentials was greater than that of the other indicators, reaching –45.1 ± 1.5% compared with –24.0 ± 1.8% for ASAP1 and –32.9 ± 1.8% for ArcLight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).

Proper plasma membrane localization is crucial for detecting voltage events, as GEVIs trapped in internal membrane structures or aggregates do not respond to neuronal activity but can be brightly fluorescent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2007</xref>). Such bright yet inactive GEVI molecules would thus reduce the overall cellular fluorescence response. Moreover, the response amplitude would show large variation between subcellular locations depending on the proportion of properly folded and localized GEVI molecules, complicating the study of how voltage transients propagate in single neurons. We observed that ASAP2s localized efficiently to the plasma membrane in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), as previously reported with ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">St-Pierre et al., 2014</xref>).

We predicted that the larger response amplitude of ASAP2s, coupled with its slower inactivation rate, would result in larger and longer responses to single APs. Indeed, in neuronal cultures, ASAP2s reported APs with a –12.2 ± 0.5% fluorescence change, compared with –8.6 ± 0.3% for ASAP1, a 42% improvement in response amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). ASAP2s’ responses were also longer in duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>), consistent with its slower kinetics of repolarization. The combination of higher response amplitude and longer response duration resulted in a 90% greater integrated fluorescence change with ASAP2s than with ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>).

In line with our in vitro observations, ASAP2s produced significantly larger mean responses than ASAP1 (a 37% increase in amplitude for depolarizations and a 39% increase in amplitude for hyperpolarizations) but was slightly slower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Similarly, these performance metrics show that ASAP2s produces larger but slower responses than ASAP2f, a recent voltage indicator primarily characterized for applications in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). For both ASAP1 and ASAP2s, we could also observe single-cell and single-trial responses, although there was trial-to-trial variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Because ArcLight has been previously used in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sitaraman et al., 2015</xref>), we also characterized this sensor under identical imaging conditions. We found that ArcLight produced fluorescence responses with amplitudes similar to ASAP1 but smaller than ASAP2s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref>). The kinetics of ArcLight fluorescence changes were significantly slower than those of both ASAP2s and ASAP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), in agreement with their respective response kinetics in cultured cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C,E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This result is also consistent with previous findings using ArcLight in the fly with one-photon microscopy in which its fluorescence traces had peaks wider than the underlying voltage signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2013</xref>). Some GEVIs based on the same voltage-sensing domain as ArcLight exhibit faster kinetics. However, they exhibit smaller response amplitudes; they have not yet been tested in flies; and the vast majority have not been evaluated under two-photon illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akemann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Barnett et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mishina et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tsutsui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mishina et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piao et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Treger et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Over 30 min of continuous illumination, the photostability of ASAP1, ASAP2s, and ArcLight was comparable, with all three indicators bleaching to ~30% of their initial brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). ASAP1 and ASAP2s both rapidly bleached by ~25% within 2 s, consistent with the photobleaching characteristics of a close variant of the GFP used in those two indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pédelacq et al., 2006</xref>). ArcLight did not exhibit this rapid bleaching, but its brightness decreased more rapidly than ASAP indicators after these initial 2 s. All three indicators enabled imaging of L2 voltage dynamics with a high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for over 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To extend our comparisons to GEVIs that use opsin domains for voltage sensing, we also evaluated Ace2N-2AA-mNeon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2015</xref>), an indicator previously used in flies under one-photon illumination. We also tested MacQ-mCitrine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2014</xref>) as a second example of an opsin-based indicator. Both indicators fluoresced brightly with two-photon excitation in L2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), but produced minimal (Ace2N-2AA-mNeon) or undetectable (MacQ-mCitrine) responses to visual stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Unexpectedly, the response polarity of Ace2N-2AA-mNeon was inverted compared to its response under one-photon illumination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gong et al., 2015</xref>), an observation robust to excitation wavelength between 920 and 1010 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Overall, the poor responses of both indicators in this in vivo benchmark are consistent with published observations that voltage responses of opsin-based GEVIs can be greatly diminished under two-photon excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Finally, to determine whether calcium imaging could provide the same information as voltage imaging in L2 neurons, we also imaged calcium dynamics using a genetically encoded calcium indicator. We chose GCaMP6f given that it features dramatically improved kinetics over previous calcium indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2013</xref>) and is therefore better suited for monitoring the 300-ms light flashes used here. The peak response amplitude of GCaMP6f was substantially larger than that of any of the voltage sensors, and its single-cell and single-trial responses had correspondingly higher SNR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). However, the GCaMP6f response was not transient, continuing to rise or fall during the entire duration of the flash. This result is consistent with previous studies of L2 using the calcium indicator TN-XXL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reiff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the observed calcium indicator traces do not correlate with GEVI traces in a simple manner, illustrating the difficulty of using calcium imaging to infer voltage dynamics. Overall, our results demonstrate the suitability of the ASAP sensors for two-photon imaging of voltage dynamics in vivo, with ASAP2s providing the best balance of large response amplitude and sufficiently fast kinetics.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Random-access, single-trial two-photon imaging of action potentials in organotypic slice cultures</title><p>Having benchmarked ASAP indicators in vitro and in vivo, we next sought to determine whether ASAP-family sensors could enable single-trial detection of rapid voltage transients in single cells in organotypic slice cultures under two-photon illumination.

ASAP2s signal amplitudes remained relatively constant across all frequencies tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), consistent with the longer durations of its optical transients. Noise decreased at lower sampling frequencies, as expected from the collection of more photons per time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Because of its higher response amplitude, ASAP2s showed higher SNR than ASAP1 at all frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).

In contrast, ASAP1's SNR remained relatively constant at ~5 across all frequencies; given the short durations of ASAP1 transients in response to APs, lower frequencies reduce noise but also reduce response amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

Ultrafast sampling allowed us to resolve the kinetics of AP-evoked optical signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). For instance, in the example presented, the AP peak was delayed by 1.1 ms in a dendrite at a distance of ~150 μm from the soma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>). We calculated the mean conduction velocity as 0.16 ± 0.03 m/s (n = 7 neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1C</xref>), similar to a reported velocity of 0.24 m/s for backpropagating APs in hippocampal neurons using electrophysiological methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Spruston et al., 1995</xref>).

Our findings have important implications for voltage imaging in intact neuronal preparations. In particular, they establish the suitability of two-photon microscopy and ASAP-family GEVIs, with their fast kinetics and large response amplitudes, for investigations of spontaneous cellular and subcellular voltage changes. Moreover, FEVIR, which combines RAMP imaging and ASAP-family indicators, permits near-simultaneous voltage recording at multiple points subcellular locations. These capabilities are particularly significant given the long-standing quest by neurophysiologists to understand how up to several thousands of synaptic inputs cooperate to trigger an action potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Megías et al., 2001</xref>) and to understand the occurrence and functions of dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). In general, the ability to record voltage with subcellular precision in single trials should facilitate future interrogation of neuronal physiology by providing easier access to compartments that are either difficult or impossible to access using electrodes, such as small-caliber dendrites, spines, and boutons. FEVIR could also be used to monitor multiple neurons rather than several locations within the same neuron, enabling studies of circuit function.</p><p>Our results demonstrate that the choice of indicator is crucial for high-fidelity monitoring of electrical activity. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> L2 axon terminals, ASAP2s tracked transient voltage responses to changes to visual stimuli with faster kinetics and larger response amplitude than the GEVI ArcLight. In brain slices with FEVIR imaging, the larger response amplitude and slower inactivation kinetics of ASAP2s compared with ASAP1 and ASAP2f enabled improved AP detection, especially at scanning frequencies below 1000 Hz. In particular, ASAP2s allowed AP detection in single voxels in single trials with voxel dwell times of only 50 μs. These parameters enable voltage imaging at ~20 two-photon-addressable points per millisecond, which can be distributed among multiple neurons if desired. Overall, in experimental settings where sensitive detection of spikes is desirable, ASAP2s would generally be preferable to ASAP1 and ASAP2f. However, in specific situations where it is important to track the shape of spikes or other fast voltage transients more accurately, ASAP1 and ASAP2f retain an advantage over ASAP2s due to their faster kinetics.</p><p>Opsin-based GEVIs have been used to report transmembrane voltage changes under one-photon illumination, but appear less suitable for two-photon applications. Some single-domain opsins can produce larger responses to APs than ASAP2s in one-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hochbaum et al., 2014</xref>), but their responses are greatly attenuated under two-photon microscopy to levels far below that of the ASAP indicators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>). Fusions of fluorescent protein domains and voltage-sensitive opsins have led to a new class of GEVIs called FRET-opsin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2014</xref>) or electrochromic FRET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zou et al., 2014</xref>) indicators. These GEVIs exhibit voltage-induced changes in fluorescence output due to changes in the efficiency of fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the fluorescent protein to the rhodopsin under one-photon microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zou et al., 2014</xref>). However, these indicators have also shown large reductions in their fluorescence responses under two-photon illumination, with one indicator of this class showing small responses in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brinks et al., 2015</xref>) and two others showing small or undetectable responses in our experiments.</p><p>The comprehensive benchmarking of the ASAP indicators across multiple performance metrics and contexts should help biologists determine whether these indicators can enable their experiments. However, we also want to emphasize that experimental preparation, temperature, and illumination condition can impact indicator performance. Indicator expression levels and host cell properties can also alter the impact of GEVIs on plasma membrane capacitance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akemann et al., 2009</xref>). Re-evaluation of critical performance metrics and membrane electrical properties is therefore recommended when deploying any indicator in a new experimental context.</p><p>While our results illustrate the abilities of fast two-photon imaging of ASAP-family voltage indicators, additional improvements in sensor performance and imaging technology would be useful. For example, further improvements in the brightness or response amplitude of the ASAP indicators would enhance the SNR of responses, improving the reliability of voltage imaging in the brain, especially in challenging imaging situations such as single-trial, single-voxel imaging. Moreover, increasing photostability is paramount for long-term imaging, requiring the development of more photostable probes or methodologies to rapidly shift illumination to non-bleached voxels. In cases where subcellular resolution is not needed, the point spread function of the illumination beam can be expanded to match the size of an entire neuronal cell body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Prevedel et al., 2016</xref>). This approach would require lower light power to produce identical fluorescence, thereby reducing photobleaching kinetics. Finally, improvements in imaging modalities could increase the number of neurons that can be simultaneously monitored with millisecond-level time resolution.</p><p>In summary, we have demonstrated that the combination of two-photon microscopy and ASAP-family voltage indicators can be used to track voltage dynamics with subcellular resolution and millisecond-level temporal precision in brain tissue. Using RAMP microscopy, we have provided the first demonstration that GEVIs can report APs, subthreshold depolarizations, and hyperpolarizations in organotypic slice culture in single trials under two-photon illumination. In addition, we have shown that FEVIR can enable tracking of voltage dynamics across multiple locations of a single neuron. We anticipate that the combination of rapid-scanning two-photon microscopy and ASAP indicators described here will facilitate current and future efforts to understand how neural circuits represent, integrate, and transform information.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagent distribution</title><p>Expression plasmids and complete sequences for ASAP1 and ASAP2s can be obtained via Addgene (addgene.org). pcDNA3.1/Puro-CAG-ASAP1 is Addgene plasmid #52519 and pcDNA3.1/Puro-CAG-ASAP2s is Addgene plasmid #101274.

For experiments comparing two-photon excitation spectra, we expressed EGFP using the ubiquitous EF-1α promoter cloned in a pLenti (also called pLECYT) plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boyden et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title><p>ASAP1, ASAP2s, and MacQ-Citrine indicators were cloned downstream of the Upstream Activating Sequence (UAS) of the pJFRC7-20XUAS vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Experiments in organotypic slice cultures</title><p>Ace2N-4AA-mNeon was amplified from a template generously provided by M.

Unless otherwise indicated, step voltage depolarizations were applied to change the membrane potential from a holding voltage of −70 mV to voltages ranging from −120 mV to 50 mV for 1.0 s. For these voltage step experiments, we captured images at 200 Hz without binning. While fluorescence responses were measured from pixels at the perimeter of the cell (the plasma membrane), values obtained over the entire cell are nearly identical given the excellent membrane localization of ASAP1 and ASAP2s. For experiments with individual or trains of artificial AP waveforms, we captured images at 1 kHz with 4 × 4 binning. The AP waveform, derived from a recording of a hippocampal neuron AP, has a full width at half maximum of 4.0 ms and peak amplitude of 100 mV. The fluorescence response was measured as described above. For experiments to determine sensor response kinetics, we increased the sampling frame rate to 2.5 kHz by cropping the imaged area down to 64 × 64 pixels and increasing binning to 8 × 8 pixels. The resulting image thus contained 64 pixels (8 × 8); fluorescence was calculated by summing all 64 pixels.

The laser was tuned between 700 nm and 1040 nm, keeping the laser power at 10 mW across the spectrum. However, this system did not pre-compensate laser pulses for dispersion in the microscope optical path. Pulse width is therefore expected to vary with wavelength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Müller et al., 1998</xref>), thereby impacting two-photon excitation absorption efficiency and distorting excitation spectra over those acquired by a pre-compensated system. Laser scanning was performed using galvanometric mirrors. Each image pixel was sampled with a dwell time of 12.1 µs. To evaluate the impact of photobleaching, we acquired images at 900 nm both before and after each wavelength scan. We also compared spectra obtained by scanning from 700 nm to 1040 nm to those produced in the reverse direction (1040 nm to 700 nm). Both methods demonstrated that photobleaching was negligible, and we therefore did not correct for photobleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>HEK293 — quantifying GEVI brightness</title><p>For quantifying the brightness of ASAP variants, we used a HEK293 cell line expressing the inwardly rectifying Kir2.1 channel (HEK293-Kir2.1, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>]).

The laser pulses were pre-compensated for dispersion in the microscope optical path. Unless otherwise indicated, the excitation wavelength was 920 nm and 5 to 15 mW of power was applied at the sample. Emitted photons were filtered with a 525/50 nm filter, except for jRGECO1b, for which emitted photons were filtered with a 585/40 nm filter.</p><p>Visual stimuli were generated with custom-written scripts using C ++ and OpenGL and presented using a digital light projector as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). The visual stimulus was projected onto a coherent fiber optic bundle that then re-projected onto a rear-projection screen positioned approximately 4 cm anterior to the fly that spanned 80° of the fly’s visual field horizontally and 50° vertically. Immediately prior to being projected onto the screen, the stimulus was filtered with a 447/60 nm or a 482/18 nm bandpass filter to prevent its detection by the microscope PMTs. The stimulus was updated at 120 Hz and had a radiance of approximately 30 mW sr<sup>−1</sup> m<sup>2</sup>. The imaging and the visual stimulus presentation were synchronized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Freifeld et al., 2013</xref>). Following this procedure, the time of stimulus onset relative to the start of imaging varied by up to one stimulus frame (8.33 ms). To compensate for this, the average delay was measured (6.25 ms), and all imaging data was shifted in time by this delay. All data were acquired at a constant frame rate of 38.9 Hz using a frame size of 200 × 20 pixels, a line scan rate of 1400 Hz, and bidirectional scanning. Imaging time per fly never exceeded 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> – image analysis</title><p>Raw images in each time series were aligned in x-y to correct for motion artifacts using a macro based on the plug-in Turboreg in ImageJ (National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD); if motion artifacts were too severe to be corrected, the entire time series was not analyzed further. The remaining analysis was performed with MATLAB (Mathworks). Regions of interest (ROIs) around individual L2 medulla terminals were manually selected in the time-series-averaged image. Intensity values for the pixels within each ROI were averaged and the mean background value was subtracted. To correct for bleaching, the time series for each ROI was fit with the sum of two exponentials, and in the calculation of ΔF/F = (F(t) – F<sub>0</sub>)/ F<sub>0</sub>, the fitted value at each time t was used as F<sub>0</sub>. The stimulus-locked average was computed for each ROI by reassigning the timing of each imaging frame to be relative to the stimulus transitions (dark to light or light to dark) and then computing a simple moving average with a 25 ms averaging window and a shift of 8.33 ms (120 Hz). As the screen on which the stimulus was presented did not span the fly’s entire visual field, some imaged ROIs corresponded to cells with receptive fields outside of the area covered by the stimulus (empirically,~30% of the ROIs imaged per fly); the ~70% of responding ROIs were identified as those whose responses at time-matched points during the dark flash and during the light flash were significantly different (t-test, p&lt;0.01) for at least three consecutive time points. For MacQ-mCitrine, none of the ROIs met this criterion; as such, all imaged ROIs were presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. For flies expressing each of the other indicators, there were approximately the same fraction of responding ROIs in each fly imaged. Because of the low amplitude of the Ace2N-2AA-mNeon responses, the responses of the co-expressed jRGECO1b calcium indicator were used to identify responding ROIs. For the upper traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, we first determined the mean response of each ROI across all trials and then calculated the mean response across all responding ROIs. The lower traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> are the moving-average response of single example ROIs (that are approximately in the 75th percentile for response amplitude for all ROIs of that indicator; colored traces), and 0.6 s single-trial excerpts of the ΔF/F trace for the same ROIs presented in the single cell examples (plotted at the imaging frame rate of 38.9 Hz; gray traces). Quantification metrics were calculated on each ROI’s mean response. The peak response (A<sub>max</sub>) during each phase (depolarization and hyperpolarization) was the largest value of |ΔF/F|. The time to peak (t<sub>peak</sub>) was the time at which this peak response occurred, relative to the start of the stimulus. The decay of the response from the peak was fit with a single exponential and the time constant of this fit was τ<sub>decay</sub>. All responding cells (ROIs) were included in the comparisons in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, except for τ<sub>decay</sub>, for which we only included cells whose exponential decay could be fit with r-squared values greater than 0.5, as ROIs with values smaller than this were those that were too noisy to be fit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures – preparation and electroporation</title><p>Organotypic hippocampal slices were prepared using 400-μm thick transverse hippocampal slices cut from 6- to 8-day-old male Wistar rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stoppini et al., 1991</xref>). Animals were anesthetized, the brain was quickly removed, and the resected hippocampus was transferred into cutting solution and cut using a McIlwain tissue chopper (Ted Pella, Redding, CA). Following dissection, three slices were plated on Millicell culture plates (EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). Slices were kept at a liquid/gas interface in a controlled atmosphere (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) chamber at 37°C for 7 to 14 days before use. Fresh medium was provided twice a week. On days 2 to 4 following slice preparation, expression plasmids were bulk electroporated with an Grass Technologies electrical stimulator (Natus, Pleasanton, CA). 10 pulses (50 V) were delivered at 10 Hz. Slices were incubated for 7 days following transfection before starting experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures – electrophysiology</title><p>During recordings, slices were continuously perfused with artificial cerebrospinal fluid containing 124 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 1.2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 mM glucose, equilibrated with 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> (pH = 7.4, 300 mOsm). Experiments were performed at room temperature (22°C). Whole-cell current-clamp recordings were obtained with an intracellular solution containing 120 mM K-gluconate, 20 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM Mg<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 mM NaGTP, 7 mM phosphocreatine, 0.6 mM EGTA, and 0.04 mM AlexaFluor594 (pH = 7.2, 295 mOsm; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Targeted cells were located at a depth of 20 to 70 µm from the surface of the slice. Neurons targeted for recordings had ovoid shapes, recognizable neuronal features such as dendrites and axons, and were not excessively bright. Glia could usually be discerned based on their more diffuse shapes and very bright somata, likely due to their more hyperpolarized membrane potential. Some glia were recorded by mistake but were easily recognizable by their very hyperpolarized membrane potential, low membrane resistance, and absence of action potential firing upon depolarization. No other criteria were used to exclude cells from characterization or analysis. Electrophysiological signals were acquired with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Data were shortpass filtered at 2 kHz and digitized at 10 kHz with a Digidata 1440A (Molecular Devices). Recordings were performed with the Clampex 11.0 software (Molecular Devices). Resting membrane potential, capacitance, and input resistance were measured in whole cell mode using pClamp software (Molecular Devices). Resting membrane potential was measured under the condition of no imposed current. Input resistance and capacitance were calculated by repetitively imposing a square 5 mV step in voltage-clamp configuration. Input resistance was measured in the steady-state phase of the current measurement. Membrane capacitance was measured by exponential fitting of the decay phase of the current trace in response to the voltage step. APs were evoked with 2- to 4 ms current pulses of 1.0 to 1.5 nA. EPSP and IPSP waveforms of 5, 10, 15, and 20 mV peak amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D</xref>) were applied in voltage-clamp mode.

Briefly, the beam from a titanium:sapphire Chameleon Ultra laser (80 MHz repetition rate, pulse width of 140 fs, wavelength set at 900 nm, Coherent) was directed to a pair of acousto-optic deflectors (AODs, A-A Opto Electronics, France). This configuration permits the ultrafast redirection of the laser beam in two dimensions over the whole field of view. Due to equipment limitation, we imaged at 900 nm, a wavelength at which the two-photon brightness of ASAP1 and ASAP2s is ~18% lower than at 920 nm, the peak excitation wavelength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The laser beam was attenuated to the desired power using an acousto-optic modulator, and then focused on the sample using a 25 × 0.95 NA water-immersion objective mounted on an upright microscope (Leica). Transmitted photons were collected and shortpass filtered at 720 nm. Emitted photons were separated into two channels by a 580 nm dichroic mirror (Semrock, Rochester, NY) and passed through a 530/60 nm bandpass filter for the green channel (ASAP1, ASAP2s, ASAP2f or Ace2N-4AA-mNeon) and 730/70 nm bandpass filter for the red channel (AlexaFluor594). Non-descanned photon counting was done with two GaAsP photomultiplier tubes (H7422P-40, Hamamatsu). Optical data were acquired with homemade software written in LabVIEW (National Instruments, Austin, TX). Dwell time was set to 50 μs per pixel in all experiments. The time to move the laser beam from one point to another in the field of view was approximately 6.5 μs, regardless of the distance between the points. Therefore, the number of points recorded dictated the scanning speed. For each cell, recorded voxels were manually distributed in an even pattern across the somatic plasma membrane. All experiments were performed at room temperature (22°C).</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Organotypic hippocampal slice cultures – data analysis</title><p>Images shown were globally adjusted for brightness and contrast, but individual portions of images were not modified in any way. Optical signals were exported using a custom-made routine in LabVIEW (National Instruments) and analyzed in Igor Pro (WaveMetrics). Distance measurements of the recording sites from the cell body were performed using ImageJ 1.47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>). Traces longer than 1 s were corrected for photobleaching. The decay phase of optical signals was fitted in Igor Pro with a monoexponential function. The fractional fluorescence change (ΔF/F) corresponds to (F – F<sub>0</sub>)/ F<sub>0</sub>, where F<sub>0</sub> corresponds to the baseline (resting) fluorescence. The SNR was measured by dividing the peak ΔF/F by the standard deviation of the noise. For these measurements, F<sub>0</sub> was measured as the average fluorescence over the 110 to 10 ms preceding the action potential trigger. The standard deviation of the noise was measured 200 ms before the stimulus onset.</p><sec id="s4-20-1"><title>Detectability (d’) analysis</title><p>All d’ analyses were performed on traces acquired at 925 Hz, corresponding to 20 voxels per cell and 50 μs dwell time per pixel. These traces were generated by imaging the response to a single spike followed by a 20 Hz train of 5 action potentials, or to a 10, 30, 100, and 200 Hz spike train without an isolated spike. Fluorescence was acquired by a photomultiplier tube in photon-counting mode. Single-cell optical traces were obtained by summing all 20 voxels from each cell. Single-voxel traces used the brightest of the 20 voxels recorded for each neuron.</p><p>To calculate spike detectability (d’), we first corrected traces for photobleaching. Sections of optical traces corresponding to resting fluorescence (when spikes were not occurring) were identified and fitted with a single exponential using the exp2fit function in MATLAB (Mathworks), which creates the fit using nonlinear least squares. The resulting exponential curve was used to generate a photobleaching correction function. First, the value in the exponential curve corresponding to the start of the first spike was subtracted from all points in the curve. The resulting vector was then multiplied by −1 and added to the actual fluorescence trace. This procedure corrects for photobleaching in a way that keeps the average photon count of the resting state constant across the trace and equivalent to the value immediately before the start of the first spike. This was necessary because the discriminability index assumes optical traces with constant baselines and require an actual photon count rather than a relative fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilt et al., 2013</xref>).

To measure the fractional fluorescence response (ΔF/F) to single, isolated spikes, the difference between the peak of the action potential and the resting fluorescence (F<sub>0</sub>, measured as above) was taken and divided by F<sub>0</sub>. Tau (τ) was calculated by fitting the trace from the peak to baseline as described above.</p><p>Since the framework in Wilt and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilt et al., 2013</xref>) was designed for single spikes, we extended its use for spike trains by recalculating tau and F<sub>0</sub> for each for each spike in the spike train. For spike trains of 10, 20 and 30 Hz, we calculated F<sub>0</sub> by averaging the maximal fluorescence between each spike; all spikes in a train therefore shared the same F<sub>0</sub>. For 100-Hz spike trains, the baseline fluorescence changed more significantly during the course of a train, so F<sub>0</sub> was calculated for each spike individually as the maximal fluorescence over the following inter-spike interval. 100-Hz spike trains sometimes produced peaks that could not be accurately located or fitted. As these peaks were eliminated from analysis, the calculated d' overestimates detectability over the entire sample. 72% of spikes from 100-Hz trains were included for ASAP1 (18 out of 25), and 60% were included for ASAP2s. The decay phase of optical signals was estimated in MATLAB (Mathworks) as described above.</p><p>False-positive and true-positive rates were calculated as follows. First, we defined a Gaussian noise distribution with a mean of 1 and a standard deviation of 1. We also defined a Gaussian signal distribution with a mean of 1 + d’ and a standard deviation of 1. A simulated vector of data points was generated by randomly sampling from these distributions. This vector was 1 million samples long, and every tenth sample was drawn from the signal distribution, while all other samples were drawn from the noise distribution. The distributions were reset after being drawn upon. For this simulated data set, spikes were assumed to be composed of only a single data point. Equation (6) in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wilt et al. (2013</xref>) was used to build the spike log-likelihood distribution.

L(i) was computed for ‘i’ up to 1 million. Each point in L corresponds to the log likelihood of a spike having occurred at its corresponding point in the simulated data. An iterative algorithm was then implemented to increment a threshold in this log likelihood vector such that values above this threshold indicate the presence of a spike, and values below indicate that a spike has not occurred. False-positive and true-positive rates calculated for each threshold. The ideal threshold was chosen to be the one that maximized ‘true positives - false positives’ across all positions of the simulated data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Results presented in the form x ± y represent the mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise.

Prior to performing such statistical comparisons, the Shapiro-Wilk method was used to test the null hypothesis that the data followed a Gaussian (normal) distribution. When this normality hypothesis could not be rejected, Student’s t-tests were performed; otherwise, the Mann-Whitney U nonparametric test was used.

responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Fast two-photon imaging of subcellular voltage dynamics in neuronal tissue with genetically encoded indicators&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Eve Marder as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents a novel GEVI, ASAP2s and its application in a variety of contexts: cultured neurons, human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes, <italic>Drosophila</italic> visual system, and organotypic slice culture. The authors apply random-access point-scanning 2P microscopy to achieve high time resolution and decent SNR in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> and organotypic slice culture systems. The technical quality of the work and the presentation are high. Overall, this is a well-executed study, showing the utility of ASAP2s in a variety of systems. Importantly, they show modest, but real improvements to enable 2P functional imaging.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One main concern is that it is not at all clear what the relationship is between this report, featuring ASAP2s, and the 2016 study by a similar group of authors (Cell, 2016, 166, p245) that discloses ASAP2f. Clearly the mutations are different, but there is no comparison between 2s and 2f. Since this is largely the same group of authors, they should have access to the appropriate DNA constructs and even the required genetically-modified organisms. At the very least, some discussion of the relative benefits of 2s vs. 2f should be discussed. One does not need to be the clear &quot;winner&quot; – it's good to have a variety of methodologies to employ, but this paper does not clear up the confusion over which plasmid a prospective user would request. These considerations should be addressed: ideally with experiments and at the very least with a discussion. There should also be comparisons to the other &quot;state of the art&quot; indicator, mAce-Neon, out of the Schnitzer efforts. Since there is a shared co-author on these studies, this should be feasible.</p><p>2) The new GEVI is somewhat more sensitive and somewhat slower than ASAP1. This tradeoff leads to improved spike detection abilities under the conditions tested, though at the expense of spike waveform fidelity. What is the upper limit on spiking rate that can be detected by this new, slower ASAP2? For a long time the problem in genetically encoded voltage indicators (aside from poor membrane trafficking) was prohibitively slow kinetics. Now it appears to have shifted the other direction. The slower off rate of ASAP2s makes for brighter signals, but is it still fast enough for fast spikes? What is the upper limit (i.e. when should one turn to ASAP1 orASAP2f?) Selling the decrease in GEVI speed as a positive attribute of the new GEVI is rather misleading.</p><p>3) Does ASAP2s work better in 2P purely because of the change in time constant + improved sensitivity, or has there been a change to the photophysics of the FP itself? (i.e. is the FP brighter, either in quantum yield or 2P absorption?)</p><p>How was the membrane capacitance and other items in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-C</xref> calculated? The capacitance would be the value I would expect to rise, upon insertion of voltage-sensing domains in a plasma membrane. It looks like the numerical value of ASAP2s's capacitance is higher than that of untransfected cells (spread of data on untransfected bar is larger).</p><p>4) A more nuanced discussion of the photobleaching under 2P illumination would be helpful. For a given illumination intensity, NA, pulse duration, and wavelength, one would expect the photobleaching rate to be proportional to the duty cycle of illumination at each pixel, i.e. the fraction of the time the laser resides on the pixel. For the photobleaching measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, the duty cycle is ~10^-6 (0.4 us per pixel x 2.23 Hz). For the applications in slice culture, the duty cycle is ~0.04 (50 us per voxel x 925 Hz). This is a 40,000-fold difference in illumination dose per voxel. The authors should discuss the importance of illumination duty cycle in determining the photobleaching rate.</p><p>Surprisingly, the fast photobleaching time-constants only differed by a factor of ~100 (5 s in the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref> vs. 0.04 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2J</xref>). This discrepancy deserves comment.</p><p>The presence of multiple time-scales in the photobleaching deserves some comment and analysis. One suspects the fast timescale represents photobleaching of the molecules directly under the laser focus, while the slower timescale represent depletion of surrounding molecules as they diffuse into the focus. If this guess is correct, then the authors could partially 'restore' the higher fluorescence of the cell either by briefly shutting the laser (so that GEVI concentration gradients can disperse), or by shifting the illumination spots to new locations. A demonstration that one can partially counteract photobleaching by these approaches would help allay some of the concerns about 2P voltage imaging.</p><p>It is not a foregone conclusion that 2P imaging is the best approach to voltage imaging in tissue. The number of points that can be multiplexed at high time resolution is limited, and photobleaching is a serious concern. A more detailed discussion of the photobleaching issues could help advance this discussion substantively.</p><p>5) The paper should also be more specific in the Abstract and throughout that the rodent &quot;brain tissue&quot; experiments are in organotypic slice cultures. Don't bury this fact. In many places the manuscript simply refers to &quot;brain slice&quot; or &quot;intact brain tissue&quot;. The authors should exclusively refer to &quot;organotypic slice culture.&quot; From the perspective of neuroscience applications, there is a world of difference between an acute slice and a cultured slice. These are also different from an optics perspective: cultured slices are thinner and sparser, offering much better imaging quality than acute slices. The impact of the work would have been greater had the authors looked in acute slice and e.g. characterized how deep they could image.</p><p>There have been many applications of GEVIs in organotypic slice culture with 1P imaging. It is not obvious that 2P imaging in organotypic slice cultures enables applications that could not have been achieved with more widely available 1P techniques.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25690.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) One main concern is that it is not at all clear what the relationship is between this report, featuring ASAP2s, and the 2016 study by a similar group of authors (Cell, 2016, 166, p245) that discloses ASAP2f.

For context, these sensors were not well characterized (the “fly-optimized” ASAP2f sensor) or published (the FRET-opsin indicator Ace2N-mNeon) when we started this work, hence our initial choice of other voltage indicators as reference GEVIs. Minor clarification: there are actually no shared co-authors with the Ace2N-mNeon Science paper from the Schnitzer lab.</p><p>To address the reviewers’ concerns, we performed multiple new experiments to compare ASAP2s to ASAP2f and Ace2N-mNeon. First, we evaluated the response of Ace2N-mNeon in <italic>Drosophila</italic> L2 axon terminals. We observed a minimal (but detectable) response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), consistent with a previous study showing reduced sensitivity of other opsin-based indicators under two-photon illumination (Brinks D, Klein AJ, Cohen AE (2015). Biophys J 109:914–921). We also expressed this indicator in organotypic slice cultures and found that a significant fraction of the fluorescence appeared cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), as we also observed in dissociated neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We next quantified its fluorescence responses to step depolarizations under random-access multiphoton microscopy. Consistent with our results in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Ace2N-mNeon performed poorly, only producing a ~2% fractional fluorescence change to 100-mV step depolarizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4CD</xref>).</p><p>We next compared ASAP2f with ASAP1 and ASAP2s. We first confirmed that all ASAP indicators are well localized at the plasma membrane in dissociated neuronal cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Second, given that its performance in <italic>Drosophila</italic> L2 axon terminals has already been reported (Yang HH, et al. (2016) Cell 166:245–257), we did not duplicate the results here but instead mentioned those results in the main text.</p><p>We next sought to comprehensively benchmark ASAP2f in our random-access multiphoton microscopy experiments with organotypic slice cultures. Under identical conditions, we observed that ASAP2f performed similarly to ASAP1 across all metrics, including brightness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>), peak response amplitude to evoked APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>), kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), signal-to-noise ratio when reporting single APs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), and peak response amplitude to individual spikes within AP trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) The new GEVI is somewhat more sensitive and somewhat slower than ASAP1. This tradeoff leads to improved spike detection abilities under the conditions tested, though at the expense of spike waveform fidelity. What is the upper limit on spiking rate that can be detected by this new, slower ASAP2? For a long time the problem in genetically encoded voltage indicators (aside from poor membrane trafficking) was prohibitively slow kinetics. Now it appears to have shifted the other direction. The slower off rate of ASAP2s makes for brighter signals, but is it still fast enough for fast spikes? What is the upper limit (i.e. when should one turn to ASAP1 orASAP2f?) Selling the decrease in GEVI speed as a positive attribute of the new GEVI is rather misleading.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that an analysis of spike rate detection would be helpful for users choosing between different members of the ASAP family of GEVIs for imaging faster-spiking neurons. To address this question, we first evoked action potentials in organotypic hippocampal slices at 10, 30, and 100 Hz. We then measured the optical response to each action potential (AP) in the train. To quantify the results, we expanded a previous analytical framework for spike detection (Wilt BA, Fitzgerald JE, Schnitzer MJ (2013). Biophys J 104:51–62) to analyze spike trains rather than individual spikes. Results are described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">2</xref>. As expected, detectability of spikes within trains decreased with increasing train frequency. ASAP2s performed better than ASAP1 at frequencies of 30Hz or below, but their performance was nearly matched (but low) at 100 Hz. This is largely because ASAP2s’ improved sensitivity balanced its slower kinetics at this spike train frequency.</p><p><italic>3) Does ASAP2s work better in 2P purely because of the change in time constant + improved sensitivity, or has there been a change to the photophysics of the FP itself? (i.e. is the FP brighter, either in quantum yield or 2P absorption?).</italic> </p><p>For spike detection, the improvements of ASAP2s are largely due to improvements in sensitivity, and slower off-kinetics. Using the d’ metrics as our measure of detectability (Wilt BA, Fitzgerald JE, Schnitzer MJ (2013)), we quantified the contribution of the parameters leading to ASAPs’ better detectability. d’ is proportional to the sensitivity (ΔF/F), to the square root of the off-kinetics time constant, and to the square root of the brightness. Compared to ASAP1, the improvement to d’ for spike detection with ASAP2s is therefore predicted to be, on average, just under two-fold from gains in sensitivity and over two-fold due to larger off-kinetics time constants. We did not detect a statistically significant change in the molecular brightness of ASAP2s over ASAP1 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) or of cellular brightness in organotypic slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p><italic>How was the membrane capacitance and other items in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> calculated? The capacitance would be the value I would expect to rise, upon insertion of voltage-sensing domains in a plasma membrane. It looks like the numerical value of ASAP2s's capacitance is higher than that of untransfected cells (spread of data on untransfected bar is larger).</italic> </p><p>Resting membrane potential, capacitance and, input resistance were calculated in whole cell mode using pClamp software (Molecular Devices), with additional details provided in the Materials and methods. We agree with the reviewers that an increase in capacitance is predicted given the charges present on voltage indicators. However, this increase appears to be sufficiently small such that the capacitance of cells expressing voltage indicators was not statistically different from that of untransfected cells. This observation is consistent with other reports showing no or modest changes in variables that depend in part on membrane capacitance (as reviewed in: Yang HH, St-Pierre F (2016). J Neurosci 36:9977–9989). However, given that a previous study using the (related) voltage indicator ArcLight reported an increase in capacitance, we added a sentence to the text recommending users to re-evaluate membrane electrical properties when changing indicator expression conditions. We also improved the description of this data by converting our bar plots to box and whisker plots. We also added data for ASAP2f given the new experiments we performed with this indicator in this revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) A more nuanced discussion of the photobleaching under 2P illumination would be helpful. For a given illumination intensity, NA, pulse duration, and wavelength, one would expect the photobleaching rate to be proportional to the duty cycle of illumination at each pixel, i.e. the fraction of the time the laser resides on the pixel. For the photobleaching measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>, the duty cycle is ~10^-6 (0.4 us per pixel x 2.23 Hz). For the applications in slice culture, the duty cycle is ~0.04 (50 us per voxel x 925 Hz). This is a 40,000-fold difference in illumination dose per voxel. The authors should discuss the importance of illumination duty cycle in determining the photobleaching rate.</italic> </p><p><italic>Surprisingly, the fast photobleaching time-constants only differed by a factor of ~100 (5 s in the table in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> vs. 0.04 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> ). This discrepancy deserves comment.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that a more comprehensive discussion and characterization of photobleaching would be helpful. We have therefore performed several new experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>), and greatly expanded our discussion of photostability in the main text. First, we tested how photobleaching kinetics varied with two-photon laser power, keeping all other imaging parameters constants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>). As suspected, the response was nonlinear. It was also very complex, with lower-power curves being better described with an additional time constant. As suggested, we also discussed the impact of pixel duty cycle on photobleaching. We further show how the pixel duty cycle and laser power should be considered together (i.e. that a key determinant is the power per pixel). Specifically, two conditions with different laser power, frame rate, and dwell time – but identical power per pixel – produced comparable photobleaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). We also carefully characterized reversible photobleaching, as discussed later.</p><p>We also sought to address the specific example mentioned by the reviewers. Including differences in power levels and given a correction of a pixel dwell time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>), the difference in power per pixel between the two assays is ~8,000. This is indeed larger than the difference in time constants. However, comparing these two conditions is extremely difficult for at least three reasons:</p><p>a) If two-photon photobleaching is at least proportional to the square of the laser power (e.g. Oheim et al. 2001. J Neurosci Methods 111:29–37), then the fast component of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>. would be orders of magnitude smaller than the ~2 ms exposure time per image of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. As a result, it would be detected as photobleaching and would simply appear as a lower brightness in the first data point. In other words, the fast photobleaching components of the two experiments may not be functionally equivalent.</p><p>b) The difference in power per pixel is so large that GFP photobleaching mechanisms may be mechanistically different. For example, over a much smaller range of power, we already see that the number of exponential terms needed to fit photobleaching kinetics changes depending on laser power (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C, D</xref>).</p><p>c) The two experiments differ in hardware, microscopy technique, and biological preparation. For example, imaging in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref> was performed by continuously moving the laser (raster scanning), and used a 60X objective. Meanwhile <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> was performed by rapidly moving the laser beam using Acousto-Optic Deflectors to only image selected cellular voxels, and used a 25X objective. These differences will affect, for instance, the actual irradiance (power per unit area). Another important difference is that laser pulses of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref> were pre-compensated for dispersion of laser pulses in the microscope optical path, while those of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> were not. Moreover, scattering of the excitation light is expected to be greater for experiment <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, which was performed on cells <italic>in tissue</italic>, compared to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>, which was performed on dissociated cells in media. Finally, the extracellular environment is different between the two conditions, a parameter which may be relevant given that the GFP in ASAP is extracellular and circularly permuted and might therefore be sensitive to its environment.</p><p>Given the above, the Discussion now recommends users to re-evaluate some performance metrics when deploying indicators in new experimental preparations or when using different illumination conditions.</p><p><italic>The presence of multiple time-scales in the photobleaching deserves some comment and analysis. One suspects the fast timescale represents photobleaching of the molecules directly under the laser focus, while the slower timescale represent depletion of surrounding molecules as they diffuse into the focus. If this guess is correct, then the authors could partially 'restore' the higher fluorescence of the cell either by briefly shutting the laser (so that GEVI concentration gradients can disperse), or by shifting the illumination spots to new locations. A demonstration that one can partially counteract photobleaching by these approaches would help allay some of the concerns about 2P voltage imaging.</italic> </p><p><italic>It is not a foregone conclusion that 2P imaging is the best approach to voltage imaging in tissue. The number of points that can be multiplexed at high time resolution is limited, and photobleaching is a serious concern. A more detailed discussion of the photobleaching issues could help advance this discussion substantively.</italic> </p><p>Fast and slow photobleaching time constants are observed with superfolder GFP, the parental protein of the GFP in ASAP indicators (Pédelacq J-D et al. (2006) Nat Biotechnol 24:79–88), suggesting that at least some of ASAP1/ASAP2s’ multiple photobleaching time-scales are an intrinsic molecular property. The revised manuscript now references this study to provide a context for the multiple exponentials observed.</p><p>We next followed the reviewers’ recommendation to quantify fluorescence following illumination gaps. Under both one- and two-photon illumination, we observed a partial recovery in fluorescence following a period of incubation in darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). This fluorescence recovery may represent dark reversion of bleached to unbleached molecules, diffusion of unbleached probes to the illuminated area, or both. Illumination gaps could therefore provide a strategy for partially mitigating photobleaching in experiments that can tolerate regular incubations in the dark.</p><p>We also note that our RAMP imaging system excludes the vast majority of available photons per cell by only recording from a smaller number of small voxels. In cases where subcellular resolution is not needed, expanding the point spread function of the illumination beam could enable excitation of an entire soma rather than a small number of voxels. This approach would require lower light power to produce identical total fluorescence, thereby reducing photobleaching kinetics. We incorporated this possible solution in the Discussion, and mentioned that further improvement in indicator photostability would be critical for long-term imaging.</p><p><italic>5) The paper should also be more specific in the Abstract and throughout that the rodent &quot;brain tissue&quot; experiments are in organotypic slice cultures. Don't bury this fact. In many places the manuscript simply refers to &quot;brain slice&quot; or &quot;intact brain tissue&quot;. The authors should exclusively refer to &quot;organotypic slice culture.&quot;</italic> </p><p>We agree that “organotypic slice culture” is more specific and have made the recommended changes in the text. We have kept more generic terms (e.g. “brain tissue”) when discussing the use of voltage indicators more generally, encompassing our results from both in vivo (fly) and organotypic slice culture preparations.</p><p><italic>From the perspective of neuroscience applications, there is a world of difference between an acute slice and a cultured slice. These are also different from an optics perspective: cultured slices are thinner and sparser, offering much better imaging quality than acute slices. The impact of the work would have been greater had the authors looked in acute slice and e.g. characterized how deep they could image.</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewers that acute slices are a very valuable experimental preparation, and we hope to confirm that our results extend to acute slices in a future manuscript. For context, we imaged neurons at depths between 20 and 70 µm from the surface, avoiding the first 20 µm as done when recording from acute slices to avoid lower quality neurons (Booker et al. (2014) J Vis Exp 91:51706). This recording depth range is also comparable to what is commonly done when patch-clamping cells in acute slices (Okada Y. (2012) Patch clamp techniques: from beginning to advanced protocols). Patching cells at depths exceeding 100 µm is challenging because cells and pipette electrodes become difficult to visualize using transmitted light at deeper locations. While two-photon imaging enables excitation of fluorophores at greater depths, this manuscript sought to compare our optical signals with the ‘ground truth’ provided by simultaneous electrical recordings.</p><p>Of note, since our detector is located below the slice rather than above the objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Given our slice thickness of ~150 µm, and imaged neurons being 20-70 µm from the top surface of the slice, emitted photons will have to travel through tissue with thickness 80-130 µm thick prior to reaching the detector. Many upright imaging systems have their detectors located above the objective, so that SNR will vary primarily based on the depth of the imaged cell and not the slice thickness.</p><p>Although obviously different from acute slices, organotypic slice cultures are considered valuable preparations by many scientists to study the hippocampus because they retain important physiological attributes. For example, hippocampal principal neurons in organotypic slices maintain a normal cytoarchitecture, grow in layers (Stoppini L et al. (1991) J.Neurosci Methods 37:173-182) and present comparable dendritic morphology to age-matched acute slices (De Simoni A, Griesinger CB, Edwards FA (2003). J Physiol 550:135–147). In addition, compared to acute slices, organotypic slices present the advantage of being more easily amenable to transfection techniques. For these reasons, we choose to perform our experiments in organotypic slice cultures.</p><p>Overall, we agree with the reviewers that acute slices are a valuable preparation that we should evaluate in future work, given that they better preserve endogenous neuronal connectivity and often present a more challenging imaging environment. Our current results demonstrating fast two-photon voltage imaging combined with patch-clamp recordings in organotypic slice cultures motivate further evaluation of voltage imaging in acute slices and in vivo.</p><p><italic>There have been many applications of GEVIs in organotypic slice culture with 1P imaging. It is not obvious that 2P imaging in organotypic slice cultures enables applications that could not have been achieved with more widely available 1P techniques.</italic> </p><p>We agree that 1P voltage imaging in slices can also be valuable. However, 1P experiments with widefield imaging will typically rely on sparse expression of the sensor to avoid convolving signals from neurons located above or below the plane of focus. Signal overlap is especially problematic for indicators that are bright at the resting membrane potential, a category that includes many of the best-performing GEVIs. 2P mitigates this issue by providing greatly improved optical sectioning. 2P also enables more focal excitation, reducing phototoxicity in neurons outside of the focal area. This is an important advantage given that voltage imaging typically requires continuous illumination at relatively high power. More generally, the development and characterization of indicators under 2P imaging is critical to eventually enable deep-tissue voltage imaging in rodents.</p></body></sub-article></article>
