This instability has been explained by the ability of R-loops to induce DNA damage. Here, we show that persistent R-loops also compromise DNA repair. Depleting endogenous RNase H activity impairs R-loop removal in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, causing DNA damage that occurs preferentially in the repetitive ribosomal DNA locus (rDNA). We analyzed the repair kinetics of this damage and identified mutants that modulate repair. We present a model that the persistence of R-loops at sites of DNA damage induces repair by break-induced replication (BIR). This R-loop induced BIR is particularly susceptible to the formation of lethal repair intermediates at the rDNA because of a barrier imposed by RNA polymerase I.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20533.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20533.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>RNase H</kwd><kwd>genome instability</kwd><kwd>break-induced replication</kwd><kwd>rDNA</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM118189-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Jeremy D</given-names></name><name><surname>Koshland</surname><given-names>Douglas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amon</surname><given-names>Jeremy D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In addition to causing DNA damage, R-loops cause genomic instability by interfering with DNA repair.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>R-loops are structures that form when RNA invades double-stranded DNA and hybridizes to complementary genomic sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaillard and Aguilera, 2016</xref>). R-loops can form spontaneously across many genomic loci, but the activity of two endogenous RNases H prevents their accumulation and persistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cerritelli and Crouch, 2009</xref>). RNase H1 and H2 are highly conserved ribonucleases with the ability to degrade the RNA moiety of a DNA:RNA hybrid. Disrupting the activity of the two enzymes (<italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>) has been a useful tool for increasing the persistence of DNA:RNA hybrids and studying the effects of hybrid-induced instability. Indeed, efforts to map R-loops genome-wide have shown that in the absence of RNase H activity, the levels of hybrids formed at susceptible loci increase dramatically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wahba et al., 2016</xref>). This increase in hybrids is associated with increased rates of genome instability that include loss of heterozygosity (LOH) events, loss of entire chromosomes, and recombination at the ribosomal locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wahba et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Connell et al., 2015</xref>). The RNases H have therefore been implicated as important protectors of genome stability.</p><p>The ribosomal locus (rDNA) appears to be particularly prone to R-loops. Approximately 60% of all transcription in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is devoted to producing ribosomal RNA from about 150 repeated units located in a clustered region on chromosome XII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Warner, 1999</xref>). These repeats, at 9.1 kb each, make up about 10% of the budding yeast genome. Accordingly, almost 50% of all R-loops map to the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wahba et al., 2016</xref>). R-loops found at the rDNA are associated with increased rates of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wahba et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">2013</xref>), RNA polymerase pileups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>), and stalled replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stuckey et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>A growing body of evidence has attributed various biological roles to R-loops, including modifying gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2013</xref>), terminating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2014</xref>), driving sequence mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gómez-González and Aguilera, 2007</xref>), and inducing changes in genome structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Li and Manley, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ruiz et al., 2011</xref>). However, the mechanisms of R-loop induced genome instability remain elusive. Most studies on the mechanisms of hybrid-induced instability have been ‘damage-centric,’ investigating how R-loops are converted to mutations, single-stranded nicks, and double-stranded breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012</xref>). Current models focus on the involvement of active replication forks that stall or collapse upon encountering the aberrant structure. While this remains an area of active research, we note that any instability event is the result of a complex interplay between the initial damage event and the repair processes that follow. Phenotypes that involve the loss of genetic information (terminal deletions, certain LOH events) imply both that damage occurred and that repair processes failed to accurately maintain the genome. Few studies have investigated how R-loop induced damage is repaired, and it remains possible that defects in repair contribute to instability. This possibility raises several questions. First, do genomic changes induced by R-loops reflect increases in damage events, failures of repair, or both? Second, are specific pathways involved in the repair of R-loop induced damage, and if so, what are they?</p><p>To begin to answer these questions, we turned to the Rad52-GFP foci system in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Rad52 is required in almost all homologous recombination (HR) pathways, and in yeast forms bright foci upon induction of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lisby et al., 2001</xref>). Most foci appear in the S/G2-M phases of the cell cycle and have a moderate rate of repair – almost all spontaneous Rad52-GFP foci are resolved within 40 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lisby et al., 2003</xref>). Consistent with phenotypes of increased genomic instability, <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> mutants display an increase in Rad52-GFP foci. A large fraction of these foci appear to co-localize with the nucleolus and form in a window between late S and mid-M (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stuckey et al., 2015</xref>). Here, by monitoring the persistence of Rad52 foci across the cell cycle in RNase H mutants, we implicate DNA:RNA hybrids in the disruption of DNA repair. We show that topoisomerase I works at the rDNA to prevent these disruptions from becoming lethal events. Furthermore, we identify a new role for the RNases H in preventing break-induced replication (BIR) from repairing R-loop induced DNA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The presence of either RNase H1 or H2 prevents the accumulation of DNA damage in G2-M</title><p>To better understand the mechanisms by which DNA:RNA hybrids contribute to genome instability, we began by characterizing DNA damage in exponentially dividing wild-type, <italic>rnh1∆, rnh201∆,</italic> and <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> budding yeast cells.

Thus, by measures of Rad52-GFP foci and Rad52-dependent growth, cells lacking RNase H1 and H2 had a larger fraction of persistent R-loop induced damage than wild-type cells or cells lacking only one of the RNases H. This persistent damage could have arisen from increased R-loop induced damage and/or an inability to efficiently repair that damage.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20533.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cells lacking both RNases H accumulate DNA damage in G2-M.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Assessment of Rad52-GFP foci in RNase H mutants.

We arrested <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells in G1 using the mating pheromone alpha factor and released them into nocodazole, allowing them to proceed synchronously through the cell cycle until they arrested in mid-M phase at the spindle checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). During this cell-cycle progression, aliquots of cells were removed and fixed to assess Rad52-GFP foci accumulation. Cell-cycle stage was determined by measuring DNA content using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fraction of cells with Rad52-GFP foci remained around 10 to 15 percent through S-phase. Additional foci appeared at the S/G2-M boundary and accumulated to around 50 percent, as reported previously.</p><p>The failure to observe accumulating foci early in the cell cycle was not a limitation of the system, as an identical analysis of a single cell cycle of <italic>sin3∆</italic> cells, which also accumulate hybrids, revealed an increase in focus formation during S-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A and B</xref>). The increase in foci in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells did not appear to be due to a cell-cycle dependent increase in hybrid formation, as cytological staining revealed similar levels of R-loops in cells staged in G1, S, and M, with around 95% of all nuclei staining for presence of R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, the increase in damage during the S/G2-M window in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells likely occurred because hybrids were more efficiently converted to damage. The mechanism of the hybrid-induced damage observed here could have involved collisions with late-firing replication forks (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaillard and Aguilera, 2016</xref>]). Alternatively, the repair of hybrid-induced damage became impaired.</p><p>The presence of DNA damage such as DSBs leads to a Rad9-dependent cell-cycle checkpoint that delays entry into anaphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weinert and Hartwell, 1988</xref>).

A number of observations suggested that alleles of <italic>TOP1</italic>, which encodes the major topoisomerase I in yeast, might be good candidates for doing so. Top1 is thought to clear or prevent R-loops and stalled RNA polymerase I (RNA pol I) complexes at the ribosomal locus by resolving supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Drolet et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Massé and Drolet, 1999</xref>). A potential synergistic relationship between Top1 and the RNases H came from the observation that while cells with either the <italic>top1∆</italic> mutation or the <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> mutations are viable, the <italic>top1∆ rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> mutant is inviable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, treatment of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells with the Top1 inhibitor camptothecin led to increased Rad52-GFP foci that co-localized with the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stuckey et al., 2015</xref>). Encouraged by these results, we used the auxin-inducible degron (AID) system to create a conditional <italic>TOP1-AID</italic> allele in wild-type, the two single RNase H mutants, and the double RNase H mutant. We then reassessed viability and DNA damage phenotypes.</p><p>Consistent with published results, <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells failed to grow when treated with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

Thus, the synergistic lethality occurred only when both RNases H and Top1 were inactivated.

However, foci nearly doubled in the <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells compared to an untreated control, such that a large majority of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells (85%) had foci. Furthermore, after four hours of treatment with auxin, over 98 percent of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells were arrested pre-anaphase at the G2-M checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). This arrest reflected an exacerbation of the cell cycle delay observed in the <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> strain and in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells left untreated with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3C</xref>).

Importantly, deletion of <italic>RAD9</italic> did not restore viability to <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells treated with auxin.

The fraction of triple mutant cells with Rad52-GFP foci in both cultures remained around 15 to 20 percent until the end of bulk S-phase, similar to the <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> double mutant. At subsequent time points, the auxin-free triple mutant culture mimicked the double mutant, as foci rose to about 45 percent in G2-M. The fraction of Rad52-GFP foci in the triple mutant cells treated with auxin also rose in G2-M but to a higher value of about 75 percent. As we suggested for double mutants, the accumulation of DNA damage after bulk S-phase was consistent with DSBs being formed by impaired late-firing replication forks, such as those seen at the rDNA. Taken together, the triple mutant exhibited qualitatively similar but quantitatively greater cell-cycle and DNA damage defects relative to the double mutant, indicating that Top1 depletion enhanced the DNA damage phenotype caused by loss of RNase H activity.</p><p>The ability to conditionally inactivate Top1-AID allowed us to address the role of Top1 activity in the cell-cycle dependent appearance of Rad52-GFP foci and the connection between focus formation and lethality. Cultures of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells were arrested in mid-M with nocodazole and then treated with auxin. Top1-AID was depleted within 30 min of addition of auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). The fraction of cells with Rad52-GFP foci climbed to about 70 percent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This result suggested that Top1 activity was required after the completion of bulk S-phase to prevent focus formation.</p><p>To address whether Rad52-GFP foci induced by Top1 depletion were correlated with lethality, asynchronously dividing <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells were transiently treated with auxin for four hours, washed with fresh media, and then plated onto nonselective plates. The fraction of cells that survived, relative to an untreated control, was around 16 percent, similar to the percentage of cells that did not have Rad52 foci when given the same treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This correlation suggested that the persistent foci in the <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells represented lethal DNA damage that arose from inactivation of Top1 activity in G2-M.</p><p>To test this hypothesis further, we asked whether the appearance of foci was temporally correlated with inviability. The <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells were first arrested in S- or mid-M phase with hydroxyurea or nocodazole, respectively. The arrested cells were treated with auxin to deplete Top1-AID activity. These cells were plated for viability on media lacking auxin, allowing the restoration of Top1-AID activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Transiently depleting Top1 in S-phase, in which Rad52-GFP foci levels remain unchanged (18%), did not lead to loss of viability. However, transiently depleting Top1 in mid-M phase, which led to elevated foci levels (75%), also led to a dramatic increase in lethality. These results suggested that depletion of Top1 activity in G2-M in cells lacking the RNases H led to irreparable DNA damage in the vast majority of cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Screen for suppressors of hybrid-induced lethality</title><p>Taken together, our data suggested that <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells depleted of Top1 initiated homologous recombination, but ultimately could not repair R-loop induced damage. This led us to question which HR pathway was being initiated and why the damage was not repairable. The lethality of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆</italic> cells provided a powerful genetic tool to do so. We reasoned that suppressor mutations that confered viability to a strain lacking the RNases H and Top1 could either prevent damage from occurring or allow that damage to become repairable. These suppressor mutations could inform us about the processes that convert R-loops to DNA damage or the mechanisms by which R-loop mediated damage is repaired.

A culture of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID PIF1-E467G</italic> cells was arrested in G1 (alpha factor) and treated with auxin to deplete Top1-AID. The culture was switched into media containing nocodazole and auxin to perpetuate Top1-AID depletion and allow progression through the cell cycle until arrest in mid-M phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The pattern of appearance of Rad52-GFP foci in this culture showed a strong similarity to the parent strain expressing wild-type Pif1, with no increase in foci until the completion of bulk S-phase. The fraction of cells containing Rad52-GFP foci then rose to 80 percent with auxin treatment and 40 percent without. These results suggested that the <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> allele did not prevent hybrid induced DNA damage.</p><p>We next compared the appearance and disappearance of Rad52-GFP foci in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> and <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID PIF1-E467G</italic> strains as they progressed between S phase to the subsequent G1. Cultures of these cells were arrested in hydroxyurea to induce S-phase arrest and then treated with auxin to induce Top1-AID depletion. The cultures were switched into media with auxin and alpha factor to perpetuate Top1-AID depletion and allow progression through mitosis to the next G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast to <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells, which maintained 85% Rad52-GFP foci and never proceeded through anaphase, cells with <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> gradually resolved most of their foci as they completed mitosis. We therefore concluded that <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> promoted the repair of hybrid-induced damage.</p><p>These observations led us to question the role of break-induced replication (BIR) in hybrid-mediated instability. BIR is an HR-dependent repair process that can occur in G2-M when only one end of a DSB is available for recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Malkova et al., 2005</xref>). This end can be captured by homologous sequences and used as a primer for replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Saini et al., 2013</xref>). Break-induced replication is extremely processive and can extend the length of entire chromosomes. The Pif1 helicase contributes to this processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Davis and Symington, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). We hypothesized that BIR might be the pathway that repaired hybrid-induced damage and that the <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> allele modulated BIR.</p><p>To test this idea, we introduced <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> into a previously characterized in vivo system for assessing BIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, these strains carry an inducible HO endonuclease cut site centromere-distal to an incomplete <italic>URA3</italic> gene on chromosome V. Upon induction of a DSB, a telomere needs to be added to the chromosome to restore viability to the cell. This repair can proceed with BIR using homology from an incomplete <italic>URA3</italic> repair template on the opposite arm. The repair template is situated in a position that requires either 30 or 80 kb of BIR for telomere addition, the latter being less efficient. Repair by BIR results in a fully functional <italic>URA3</italic> gene, thereby conferring the ability to grow on media lacking uracil.</p><p>In a wild-type strain, the frequency of BIR using the 30 kb template was approximately 12%, consistent with previously published results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). In the absence of a functional Pif1 allele (<italic>pif1-m2)</italic>, repair by BIR dropped to approximately 5%. Similarly, the frequency of BIR in cells carrying <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> dropped to around 3%. In the 80 kb repair template strain, a similar pattern in BIR efficiency was seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Strains carrying the <italic>pif1-m2</italic> or <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> alleles saw drops in BIR frequency from approximately 5% to 1%. This led us to conclude that <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> inhibited BIR.</p><p>The common phenotype for <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> and <italic>pif1-m2</italic> was inhibition of BIR, suggesting that this inhibition was responsible for allowing repair of the otherwise lethal hybrid-induced DNA damage. To test this model further, we deleted <italic>POL32</italic> in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Pol32 is a non-essential subunit of the primary BIR polymerase (Polδ), and is required for replication fork processivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilson et al., 2013</xref>). These strains were no longer sensitive to auxin, corroborating the conclusion that inhibiting BIR was sufficient to allow for repair of otherwise lethal hybrid-induced DNA damage. Taken together, these results suggested that the inability to repair DNA damage in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells depleted of Top1 was caused by BIR processivity.</p><p>As expected, in the wild-type reporter strain, almost all DSBs were repaired by BIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The inhibition of BIR, either by increasing the distance the repair machinery had to replicate or by inhibiting Pif1, resulted in decreased viability. In contrast, while <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> cells also had reduced rates BIR, viability remained at wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Thus, BIR was compromised, but an alternative pathway stepped in to promote telomere addition. As expected if this repair was independent of BIR, this alternative pathway was as efficient with the 80 kb repair template as it was in cells with the 30 kb repair template – <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> cells in the 80 kb repair strain had a total level of repair that was 5-fold greater than wild-type cells but only six percent of which was repaired using BIR. This alternative pathway was poorly activated in <italic>pif1-m2</italic> cells, as evidenced by a depressed level of viability. The increase in repair was not due to increased non-homologous end joining (NHEJ), as less than one percent of cells of all genotypes retained a telomeric drug resistance marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Additionally, all strains efficiently induced DSBs, as evidenced by the failure to PCR-amplify DNA surrounding the cut site after HO induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Further analyses will be necessary to identify the alternative pathway for repair of hybrid-induced damage.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>RNA polymerase I is a barrier to the repair of hybrid-induced DNA damage</title><p>Our genetic screen also identified <italic>RPA190-K1482T</italic> and <italic>RPA190-V1486F,</italic> two novel alleles of Rpa190, the largest subunit of RNA pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

In previous studies, abnormal chromosome XII structures had been revealed by altered migration in pulsed-field gels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christman et al., 1993</xref>). While chromosome XII failed to enter pulsed-field gels in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ TOP1-AID</italic> cells treated with auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), chromosome XII also failed to enter pulsed-field gels in viable <italic>top1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christman et al., 1993</xref>). These results confounded the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to analyze the structure of the lethal damage.</p><p>To begin to understand the mechanism by which these alleles modify the activity of RNA pol I, we turned to previously reported crystal structures of the RNA pol I complex. Residues K1482 and V1486 map to the ‘jaw’ domain of RNA pol I, along potential contacts with the non-essential RNA pol I subunit Rpa12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Engel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernández-Tornero et al., 2013</xref>).

We observe an increase in Rad52 foci only in cells lacking both RNases H (<italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic>). The increase in foci begins at the exit from S-phase and continues until mid-M. We show that this damage induces a significant pre-anaphase delay by activating the Rad9-dependent checkpoint. When measured in a bulk population, foci disappear slowly such that even after most cells have lost foci and completed cell division, a subset of cells retain foci and remain arrested pre-anaphase. This phenotype is indicative of an inability to efficiently repair damage. The depletion of Top1 in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells appears to exacerbate this problem by generating more foci that lead to lethal, irreparable damage and permanent arrest. Importantly, disrupting factors that modulate BIR allows for repair of these foci and restores cell division without reducing the initial level of damage. This demonstrates that the inability to repair damage, not the level of damage per se, in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells is the root cause of the inability to proceed through the cell cycle. Taken together, these results suggest that DNA:RNA hybrids inhibit DNA repair and that a critical role of the RNases H is to remove hybrids so that efficient repair can occur.</p><p>While hybrids have been recognized for many years as agents of genome instability, most studies have focused on their ability to generate DNA damage rather than their ability to alter DNA repair. However, a number of observations support our hypothesis of R-loops as inhibitors of repair. Inactivation of RNase H2 (<italic>rnh201∆</italic>) by itself leads to large increases of genomic hybrids and loss of heterozygosity compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wahba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Connell et al., 2015</xref>). This result suggests that loss of RNase H2 generates elevated levels of DNA damage. However, dramatically elevated Rad52 foci are only observed in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201</italic>∆ cells – not <italic>rnh201∆</italic> cells. We suggest that damage may be repaired rapidly in cells lacking RNase H2, while damage is repaired slowly in cells lacking both RNases H, causing foci to accumulate and persist.</p><p>Additionally, <italic>sin3</italic>∆ cells have elevated R-loops and hybrid-mediated genome instability. Inactivation of RNase H1 in <italic>sin3</italic>∆ cells increases genome instability further, but skews the events from chromosome repair to chromosome loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wahba et al., 2011</xref>). This result also supports a role for RNase H1 as critical in allowing repair of hybrid-induced damage. Presumably, under conditions of elevated hybrid formation such as <italic>sin3</italic>∆, inactivation of RNase H1 alone is sufficient to cause a repair problem.</p><p>An insight into a potential role for the RNases H in DNA repair comes from a key observation in this study: lethality in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells when they are depleted of Top1 can be suppressed by mutations in Pif1 or Pol32 that inhibit BIR. The severity of the lethality – 88% cell death in a single cell cycle – suggests that BIR is a major pathway for the repair of R-loop induced damage in RNase H deficient cells. Consistent with this conclusion, previous studies mapped recombination events genome-wide in RNase H single and double mutants and found that 50% of the repair events occurred through BIR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">O'Connell et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, the percent of repair by BIR was elevated about five fold in the double mutant compared to either of the singles or wild-type, although validation of this difference awaits a larger sample size.</p><p>To explain the BIR bias, we suggest that the RNases H remove hybrids from chromosomes both before and after R-loops induce DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Conversely, in the absence of RNase H activity, more DSBs are induced and hybrids persist at these DSBs. While one free end of the DSB may be properly processed by HR machinery, the presence of a hybrid on the opposite free end may block resection and/or invasion of homologous sequences. Ultimately, failure to capture the second free end of the DSB leads to BIR.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20533.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed model for R-loop induced instability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) R-loops that cause DSBs persist at the break site. Early HR events (resection, homology search, strand capture and invasion) proceed as normal for one side of the break, but are inhibited by the presence of an R-loop on the opposite side. If RNase H1 or H2 act to clear the hybrid, repair can proceed as normal. If the hybrid persists, the second strand cannot be captured and the cell engages BIR. (<bold>B</bold>) BIR at the rDNA encounters replication blocks and slows. These replication blocks (over/under-winding, transcribing or stalled RNA polI, R-loops) are exacerbated in the absence of Top1, creating unresolvable structures that lead to cell death. <italic>PIF1</italic> and <italic>POL32</italic> mutants make BIR less processive, allowing BIR machinery to disengage before lethality occurs. The repair mechanism used after BIR is disengaged is unknown. <italic>RPA190</italic> mutants allow for resolution of these structures, perhaps by disengaging RNA pol I through termination or backtracking activities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20533.019">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20533.019</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-20533-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>Why does hybrid-induced BIR lead to cell-cycle arrest and a complete abrogation of repair when Top1 is depleted? An important clue comes from the fact that the lethality of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆</italic> cells can be suppressed by mutations in RNA pol I, an enzyme whose function is limited to transcribing ribosomal DNA. This result strongly suggests that the lethal damage we observe is due to DNA damage in the rDNA. A number of observations corroborate this conclusion. The rDNA is the biggest source of R-loops in cells, accounting for almost 50% of all hybrids in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wahba et al., 2016</xref>). A previous study showed that Rad52-GFP foci co-localize with the nucleolus in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells and in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells depleted of Top1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Stuckey et al., 2015</xref>). In addition, Top1 inactivation preferentially induces genome instability in the rDNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">El Hage et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christman et al., 1993</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">1988</xref>). These results suggest that BIR at the rDNA may be particularly challenging in the presence of hybrids and even more challenging in the absence of Top1. We therefore propose that the induction of hybrids in the rDNA generates a barrier to the processivity of DNA replication during BIR, thereby slowing repair (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Further inactivation of Top1 causes elevated hybrids and stalled polymerases, which we hypothesize terminally block BIR replication fork progression. This trapped BIR intermediate is an aberrant structure that then leads to lethality.</p><p>The mutations in RNA pol I that suppress the lethality of <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆</italic> map to the interface between subunits Rpa190 and Rpa12. This suppression is dependent upon Rpa12, a factor known to alleviate stalled polymerases either by promoting backtracking or transcription termination. Stalled RNA polymerases have been linked to R-loop dependent replication fork collisions that cause DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dutta et al., 2011</xref>). We therefore suggest that the <italic>RPA190</italic> suppressor mutations activate Rpa12, allowing it to remove stalled polymerases and possibly the associated hybrids, thereby removing the impediment to BIR imposed by Top1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Our model for stalled BIR intermediates as the cause of lethality in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆</italic> cells is supported by the kinetics of repair and the molecular functions of Pif1 and Pol32. BIR is known to be a multi-step process in which strand invasion happens rapidly followed by a long delay before replication initiates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jain et al., 2009</xref>). This delay would explain the slow disappearance of hybrid-induced Rad52-GFP foci in <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells. After this pause, Pif1 and Pol32 are required for processivity of the BIR replication fork. We suggest that inhibition of these two factors causes the invading strand to dissociate before it can reach the blocks imposed by the hybrids and/or RNA polymerases. A slower, alternative pathway can then repair the released strand.</p><p>The identity of this alternative repair pathway remains unclear, but we speculate that single-strand annealing (SSA) may be involved. SSA is a form of HR that occurs when 5’ to 3’ resection uncovers complementary sequences that then anneal to each other, resulting in deletion of the intervening DNA. The high copy number of direct repeats present at the rDNA makes the locus an ideal substrate for this repair pathway. Additionally, the kinetics of end resection (~4 kb/hr) and the size of a single rDNA repeat (9.1 kb) suggest that the repair of a DSB using SSA would take around 2–3 hr per repeat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fishman-Lobell et al., 1992</xref>). These estimates are consistent with the kinetics of Rad52-GFP foci dissolution seen here.</p><p>In summary, we show that the RNases H play a critical role in promoting proper repair of hybrid-induced DNA damage, particularly in highly transcribed repetitive DNA. This conclusion came from directly limiting RNase H activity in cells, but other conditions may also effectively limit RNase H. For example, many RNA biogenesis mutants induce hybrid formation and elevate genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wahba et al., 2016</xref>). The genome instability of these mutants can be suppressed by overexpression of RNase H, implying that RNase H activity becomes limiting when hybrid levels exceed a threshold. It has been assumed that this instability results only from increased damage induced by the persistence of R-loops. However, in light of our results, it is likely that limiting RNase H activity in these mutants also allows hybrids to interfere with repair. Finally, the particular sensitivity of the highly transcribed rDNA repeats is intriguing given that many cancer cells contain highly transcribed amplicons. These amplicons may be not only sites of R-loop formation and R-loop induced DNA damage, but also sites of improper repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, media, and reagents</title><p>Details on strain genotypes can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

Secondary antibody used was an HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse at 1:20,000 (BioRad, Hercules, CA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Genetic screen</title><p>Multiple independent cultures of strain JA271a (<italic>Mat<bold>a</bold> rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆ +pRS316-RNH1</italic>) were grown to saturation in YPD to allow for loss of plasmid pRS316-RNH1 (<italic>RNH1 CEN URA3</italic>). Cultures were plated on media containg 5-FOA to select for loss of the plasmid. Frequency of 5-FOA resistance was approximately 10<sup>−7</sup>. Colonies were patched onto 5-FOA to confirm resistance, then confirmed to be <italic>rnh1∆, rnh201∆, top1∆</italic>, URA<sup>–</sup>, <italic>grande</italic> (able to grow on glycerol as the sole carbon source, indicating functional mitochondria), and not carry any temperature sensitivities. Cells were grown to saturation in YPD, genomic DNA was extracted, and libraries were prepared using an IlluminaTruSeq kit (San Diego, CA). Libraries were multiplexed and sequenced with a minimum of 14-fold coverage. Sequences were mapped to an S288c reference genome and SNPs were called relative to the parental JA271a strain.</p><p>Sequencing results are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>. 25 SNPs were initially chosen for further analysis on the basis of the SNP being a nonsynonymous substitution lying within a gene with either unknown function or a known role in DNA metabolism. After PCR confirmation, several of the SNPs detected by whole-genome sequencing were found to have arisen in the outgrowth step before genomic DNA extraction and were therefore secondary, non-causative mutations (12/25 SNPs). To test if the remaining 13 primary SNPs were causative for the phenotype, suppressor strains were crossed to strain JA290a (<italic>Mat<bold>alpha</bold> rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆ +pRS316-RNH1</italic>). Diploids were sporulated and tetrads were dissected. Only four SNPs were found to consistently segregate with the <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆</italic> genotype in spores that had lost the pRS316-RNH1 complementation plasmid. Of these four SNPs, the two <italic>RPA190-V1486F</italic> hits are likely to be clonal because they arose from the same initial outgrowth culture. The three remaining suppressors – <italic>RPA190-K1482T, RPA190-V1486F,</italic> and <italic>PIF1-E467G</italic> – are discussed here. All three suppressors were built into <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆ top1∆</italic> strains to confirm that they were causitive before being built into <italic>TOP1-AID</italic> strains.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>BIR assay</title><p>Experiments were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anand et al., 2014</xref>). Strains were grown on YPD +cloNAT plates. Individual colonies were picked and serially diluted in water so that ~ 200 cells were plated onto YPD and ~ 2000 cells were plated on YP-GAL. Cells that grew on YP-GAL were counted then replica-plated onto SC –URA and YPD +cloNAT plates. Total survivors were calculated by dividing the number of colonies that grew on YP-GAL by the number that grew on YPD, adjusting for 10-fold dilution. Similar calculations were performed on SC –URA and YPD +cloNAT plates to determine rates of BIR and NHEJ, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)</title><p>Cultures were grown in YPD at 23°C to saturation or mid-log.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;RNase H enables efficient repair of R-loop induced DNA damage&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study reports the interesting observation that in budding yeast, RNA:DNA hybrids may promote instability not only by increasing DNA damage but also by interfering with DNA repair. Using Rad52-GFP foci as readout of chromosome breaks, it is shown that DNA damage accumulates in <italic>rnh1 rnh201</italic> mutants, which are defective for the two RNases H encoded by the yeast genome. It is also shown that DNA damage is further increased in the absence of topoisomerase I. Since the triple mutant <italic>rnh1 rnh201 top1</italic> is inviable, a conditional Top1 mutation is used in <italic>rnh1 rnh201</italic> mutants using an AID construct to identify suppressors. Interestingly, suppressors are a BIR-defective allele of the Pif1 helicase and a mutant of the large subunit of RNA polymerase I, the main RNAP involved in the transcription of ribosomal RNAs. Based on these and other observations, it is proposed a model in which R-loops induce the formation of chromosome breaks that cannot be properly repaired by homologous recombination, presumably because hybrids interfere with the resection of DNA ends. This would prevent the capture of the second end and would therefore promote BIR. For reasons that are not entirely clear at this stage, the BIR mediated completion of DNA replication in S/G2 would be particularly difficult at the rDNA array, which would induce mitotic defects and irreparable chromosome breaks.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A main concern relates to the question of whether the rDNA array is involved in this process. Indeed, it has been reported by the Maki lab (Ide et al., 2007, Mol Cell Biol 27, 568) that the rDNA array is extremely tolerant to replication defects. For instance, a massive depletion of active origins in the <italic>orc2-1</italic> mutant leads to a Rad9-dependent G2/M arrest, but deletion of the RAD9 gene rescues the viability of <italic>orc2-1</italic> cells at the restrictive temperature, presumably because yeast cells can tolerate the loss of a large fraction of their rDNA array. It is shown that the deletion of RAD9 in <italic>rnh1 rnh201</italic> TOP-AID cells does not restore viability, which argues that the incomplete replication of the rDNA array might not be the only cause of the loss of viability of the triple mutant. To address this possibility, completion of DNA replication of the chromosome XII relative to the other chromosomes should be monitored by PFGE. If their model is correct, the mobility of chromosome XII should be particularly affected, relative to other chromosomes.</p><p>A more complete discussion should be provided about the new pathway that would be acting. Disabling BIR presumably allows a more efficient and productive mechanism of repair to eventually be engaged, and this could be either canonical HR or single-strand annealing (SSA). The latter pathway would be particularly well suited to high copy number direct repeats. In particular, the potential involvement of SSA could be addressed by examining <italic>rad51</italic>.</p><p>The possibility that the Stuckey et al. 2015 results could be explained by stalled BIR intermediates should be tested experimentally, as it would provide a unified model to explain different results. It would be important to assay whether replication fork stalling in <italic>rnh1rnh201top1</italic> mutants at the rDNA is prevented by <italic>pif1</italic> or <italic>rpa1-190</italic> mutations.</p><p>To conclude that induction of hybrids in the rDNA generates a barrier to the processivity of DNA replication during BIR, it should be shown that <italic>rnh1rnh201</italic> mutants are deficient in the 30 or 80 kb BIR assays.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20533.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>A main concern relates to the question of whether the rDNA array is involved in this process.

If their model is correct, the mobility of chromosome XII should be particularly affected, relative to other chromosomes.</italic> </p><p>There are three points we wish to address for this comment:</p><p>1) We agree with the reviewers that incomplete replication is likely not the cause of loss of viability in our strains, and we do not make this claim in our manuscript. In part because of results from our Rad9 experiments, we believe that we are seeing a DNA damage and repair phenomenon – any incomplete replication occurring at the rDNA is likely coincidental and not the direct cause of lethality.</p><p>2) We agree that the tolerance of the rDNA to various insults, not just replication defects, makes it a curious source of lethality. However, multiple lines of evidence point to the rDNA as the source of the lethal damage. We have changed the Discussion to make these multiple lines of evidence more transparent:</p><p>“Why does hybrid-induced BIR lead to cell-cycle arrest and a complete abrogation of repair when Top1 is depleted? […] This trapped BIR intermediate is an aberrant structure that then leads to lethality.”</p><p>3) We have performed PFGE experiments and have shown that the mobility of chromosome XII is affected in cells depleted of Top1. This is consistent with work done in the Fink lab showing that chromosome XII (and an ectopically located rDNA array) fails to enter a pulsed-field gel in <italic>top1</italic> mutants (Christman, et al., PNAS, 1993). As they note in their paper, this mobility defect is not necessarily due to incomplete replication, but can be caused by torsional stress, recombination structures, or DNA damage. We have added these experiments as a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The following short paragraph has been added to the Results section:</p><p>“High rates of lethal damage at the ribosomal locus suggested that the structure of chromosome XII was altered. […] These results confounded the use of pulsed-field gel electrophoresis to analyze the structure of the lethal damage.”</p><p>The following figure legend has been added: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p>The Materials and methods have been expanded to include the new protocols:</p><p>“Cultures were grown in YPD at 23°C to saturation or mid-log. Mid-log cells were treated with auxin, nocodazole (15 µg/ml), or mock treated with DMSO for four hours. Equivalent amounts of cells were collected and subjected to PFGE and Southern blotting as previously described for large molecular weight resolution {Hage:2013ey}.”</p><p><italic>A more complete discussion should be provided about the new pathway that would be acting. Disabling BIR presumably allows a more efficient and productive mechanism of repair to eventually be engaged, and this could be either canonical HR or single-strand annealing (SSA). The latter pathway would be particularly well suited to high copy number direct repeats. In particular, the potential involvement of SSA could be addressed by examining rad51.</italic> </p><p>We also favor the SSA pathway due to the direct repeats present in the rDNA and the approximate kinetics, and have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“The identity of this alternative repair pathway remains unclear, but we speculate that single-strand annealing (SSA) may be involved. […] These estimates are consistent with the kinetics of Rad52-GFP foci dissolution seen here.”</p><p><italic>The possibility that the Stuckey et al. 2015 results could be explained by stalled BIR intermediates should be tested experimentally, as it would provide a unified model to explain different results. It would be important to assay whether replication fork stalling in rnh1rnh201top1 mutants at the rDNA is prevented by pif1 or rpa1-190 mutations.</italic> </p><p>After consulting with experts on 2D gel electrophoresis, we have determined that BIR forks are not likely to run with similar patterns as the canonical replication forks seen in the Stuckley, et al. 2015 paper. To our knowledge, BIR forks have not been analyzed by 2D gel electrophoresis. We have therefore removed these sentences from our manuscript. As for the stalled replication forks seen in the Stuckley, et al. paper, we expect them to act like the Rad52-GFP foci in this study. That is, in <italic>rnh1∆ rn201∆ top1∆</italic> cells in the presence of the <italic>PIF1</italic> or <italic>RPA190</italic> alleles, replication forks will still stall in G2-M. Given enough time, the stalled forks may eventually resolve as the cells continue to divide. Our paper is not focused on replication fork stalling but rather DNA repair, and so we feel that these experiments would answer a somewhat tangential question.</p><p><italic>To conclude that induction of hybrids in the rDNA generates a barrier to the processivity of DNA replication during BIR, it should be shown that rnh1rnh201 mutants are deficient in the 30 or 80 kb BIR assays.</italic> </p><p>We have built these strains and performed the necessary experiments. However, we note that the BIR assays measure BIR efficiency on chromosome V, not at the rDNA locus on chromosome XII, where the lethal events are occurring. As such, inducing hybrids should have no effect on the BIR assay. Indeed, as shown in the updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>, <italic>rnh1∆ rnh201∆</italic> cells are proficient for BIR on chromosome V. We have updated the text to reflect these new data and to make the distinction between the rDNA and chromosome V clearer:</p><p>“Our genetic screen also identified <italic>RPA190-K1482T</italic> and <italic>RPA190-V1486F,</italic> two novel alleles of Rpa190, the largest subunit of RNA pol I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). […] These results suggested that topological stress and persistent R-loops were particularly problematic in the rDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
