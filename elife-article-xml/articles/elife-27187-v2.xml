Previously, we demonstrated that IRE1α forms a complex with the Sec61 translocon, to which its substrate XBP1u mRNA is recruited for cleavage during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). Here, we probe IRE1α complexes in cells with blue native PAGE immunoblotting. We find that IRE1α forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with the Sec61 translocon that is activated upon ER stress with little change in the complex. In addition, IRE1α oligomerization, activation, and inactivation during ER stress are regulated by Sec61. Loss of the IRE1α-Sec61 translocon interaction as well as severe ER stress conditions causes IRE1α to form higher-order oligomers that exhibit continuous activation and extended cleavage of XBP1u mRNA. Thus, we propose that the Sec61-IRE1α complex defines the extent of IRE1α activity and may determine cell fate decisions during ER stress conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27187.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27187.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH 1R01GM117386-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plumb</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><name><surname>Appathurai</surname><given-names>Suhila</given-names></name><name><surname>Mariappan</surname><given-names>Malaiyalam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007184</institution-id><institution>Yale School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Start-up</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaram</surname><given-names>Arunkumar</given-names></name><name><surname>Plumb</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name><name><surname>Appathurai</surname><given-names>Suhila</given-names></name><name><surname>Mariappan</surname><given-names>Malaiyalam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007184</institution-id><institution>Yale School of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Rudolph J Anderson Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sundaram</surname><given-names>Arunkumar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM007223</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Plumb</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Building on previous work (Plumb et al., 2015), it is shown that the Sec61 translocon controls the oligomerization, activation and inactivation of Ire1α during endoplasmic reticulum stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The majority of secretory and membrane proteins enter the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the Sec61 protein translocation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rapoport, 2007</xref>). In the ER, folding enzymes and chaperones facilitate maturation of newly synthesized proteins. Proteins that fail to achieve their folded state are eliminated by ER-associated quality control pathways (ERAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodsky, 2012</xref>), while correctly folded proteins are transported to their intra or extracellular site of activity. When the influx of proteins exceeds the ER protein folding and quality control capacity, misfolded proteins accumulate in the ER leading to a condition known as ER stress. During ER stress, signaling pathways, collectively termed the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), are activated in order to upregulate chaperones and folding enzymes, to reduce the influx of proteins into the ER, and to increase the capacity for ER-associated degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). In this way, the UPR adapts cells to ER stress conditions and restores ER homeostasis. However, the UPR can also trigger apoptosis during chronic or severe ER stress conditions, suggesting that UPR activity is tightly controlled in order to elicit the appropriate cellular response, whether pro-adaptive or pro-apoptotic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hetz, 2012</xref>). Indeed, inappropriate activation of UPR signaling is linked to a number of disease states, including pancreatic beta cell death in diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Back and Kaufman, 2012</xref>) and neuronal cell death in certain neurodegenerative diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Three transmembrane sensors, IRE1α, PERK, and ATF6, mediate the UPR. Upon ER stress, all three sensors become activated by changes in their oligomerization state. The most ancient UPR sensor is IRE1α, a transmembrane endonuclease/kinase that senses the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the ER lumen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mori et al., 1993</xref>). When ER misfolded proteins are detected, IRE1α self-oligomerizes through its luminal domains. This, in turn, leads to cytosolic trans-autophosphorylation of the IRE1α kinase domain and subsequent activation of its RNase domain. The activated IRE1α restores the ER folding capacity by cleaving XBP1u mRNA (u; unspliced) to initiate splicing on the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>). Efficient cleavage of XBP1u mRNA requires an interaction between IRE1α and the Sec61 translocon as well as the SRP pathway-mediated recruitment of XBP1u mRNA to the Sec61 translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kanda et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, the cleaved fragments of XBP1 mRNA are ligated by the RtcB tRNA ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jurkin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kosmaczewski et al., 2014</xref>) with its co-factor archease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Poothong et al., 2017</xref>). The spliced XBP1 mRNA is translated into an active transcription factor, XBP1s, which induces UPR genes to alleviate ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Alvear et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, IRE1α also promiscuously cleaves ER-localized mRNAs including mRNAs encoding secretory and membrane proteins, a process known as IRE1α-dependent mRNA decay (RIDD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hollien et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Han et al., 2009</xref>). RIDD is implicated in reducing the incoming protein burden on the ER during stress conditions as well as in mediating cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollien and Weissman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tam et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since the continuous activation of IRE1α is associated with cell death, the activation and inactivation of IRE1α must be properly regulated. Indeed, seminal studies from Peter Walter’s group demonstrated that IRE1α activity is temporally and quantitatively attenuated during ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). However, the mechanism by which IRE1α is inactivated in the presence of ER stress is unclear. Previous studies have provided important insights into how IRE1α activity can be regulated by its associated proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisbona et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eletto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morita et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, factors such as BiP and PDIA6 that are implicated in attenuating IRE1α activity also interact with PERK, which, in contrast to IRE1α, remains activated during prolonged ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). We therefore tested the role of the Sec61 translocon in regulating IRE1α activity because it selectively interacts with IRE1α but not with the other ER stress sensors PERK, ATF6 and Ire1β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). We have used a Blue Native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (BN-PAGE) immunoblotting procedure to probe IRE1α complexes in cells during normal and ER stress conditions. Our studies reveal that IRE1α exists as preassembled hetero-oligomeric complexes with the Sec61 translocon and becomes activated during ER stress conditions with minor changes to its complexes. We find that the Sec61 translocon limits IRE1α oligomerization and thereby controls activation and inactivation of IRE1α activity during ER stress conditions. Indeed, either the loss of the IRE1α interaction with the Sec61 translocon or severe stress causes IRE1α to form higher-order oligomers that exhibit continuous activation of IRE1α and extended cleavage of XBP1u mRNA. Thus, our studies suggest that the IRE1α-Sec61 complex plays a critical role in controlling IRE1α signaling during ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IRE1α forms hetero-oligomeric complexes with the Sec61 translocon</title><p>We hypothesized that the Sec61 translocon may limit IRE1α oligomerization during ER stress and thus control IRE1α activity because of the following observations. First, our previous studies showed that nearly all the endogenous IRE1α is bound with the Sec61 translocon in the ER membrane during normal and ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). Second, the concentration of the Sec61 translocon vastly outnumbers the concentration of IRE1α in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting that it could provide a barrier to IRE1α oligomerization. To test this hypothesis, we searched for IRE1α mutants that either disrupt or increase the interaction with the Sec61 translocon. Our previous studies identified a ten amino acid region in the luminal domain proximal to the transmembrane domain of IRE1α that when deleted nearly abolished the interaction with the Sec61 translocon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). We refer to the IRE1α Δ434–443 mutant as weakly interacting IRE1α or wIRE1α. Fortuitously, our previous mutagenesis studies also revealed that IRE1α S439A showed an increased binding to the Sec61 translocon. We then further significantly improved the interaction between IRE1α and Sec61 by combining S439A with the mutation of three hydrophilic residues in the transmembrane domain of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>) (Sun et al., 2015). We refer to this mutant (IRE1α S439A/T446A/S450A/T451A) as strongly interacting IRE1α (sIRE1α).</p><p>To investigate the role of the Sec61 translocon in regulating IRE1α oligomerization and activity, we complemented IRE1α, wIRE1α or sIRE1α into IRE1α-/- HEK 293 Flip-In T-Rex cells generated by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). IRE1α expression is controlled by the tetracycline promoter in these complemented cells. Low expression levels as well as ER stress dependent activation of IRE1α were achieved through leaky expression in the absence of doxycycline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To examine the oligomerization status of IRE1α in these different cells, we employed a BN-PAGE based immunoblotting procedure. This technique allows separation of large membrane protein complexes with minimal perturbation of native complexes using Coomassie G250 dye as the charged ion carrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wittig et al., 2006</xref>). The cells were treated with or without thapsigargin, which induces ER stress by inhibiting calcium import into the ER lumen, and analyzed by BN-PAGE immunoblotting. Surprisingly, BN-PAGE analysis of IRE1α complemented cells showed two forms of preassembled IRE1α complexes. Form A corresponds to a ~500 kDa complex, and Form B corresponds to a ~720 kDa complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intriguingly, upon ER stress treatment, IRE1α Form B slightly increased in intensity, while IRE1α Form A was reduced. Probing phosphorylated IRE1α using the phos-tag reagent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) further confirmed that IRE1α was activated upon ER stress as shown by stress dependent detection of phosphorylated IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To next determine the role of the Sec61 translocon in controlling IRE1α oligomerization, we performed BN-PAGE analysis with cells expressing either wIRE1α, which cannot interact with Sec61, or sIRE1α, which interacts strongly with Sec61 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In comparison to the wild-type IRE1α, wIRE1α predominantly existed in the Form B complex, whereas sIRE1α showed significantly more of the Form A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unlike the wild type, the stress-dependent changes were less obvious for both wIRE1α and sIRE1α oligomers, but they were clearly activated as shown by their phosphorylation using phos-tag based immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27187.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>IRE1α complexes are regulated by an interaction with the Sec61 translocon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IRE1α -/- HEK293 cells complemented with wild-type IRE1α-HA, wIRE1α-HA (Δ434–443), or sIRE1α-HA (S439A/T446A/S450A/T451A) were treated with 2.5 μg/ml thapsigargin (Tg) for the indicated hours (hr), lysed with digitonin, and analyzed by BN-PAGE immunoblotting (top) as well as phos-tag based immunoblotting to probe phosphorylated IRE1α (bottom). <italic>A</italic> denotes a ~500 kDa complex of IRE1α in BN-PAGE immunoblotting. <italic>B</italic> denotes a ~720 kDa complex of IRE1α.

Similar to IRE1α, PERK existed as a preformed complex, though of ~900 kDa, in cells under normal conditions. However, upon stress, PERK became a ~1200 kDa complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results were recapitulated in HEK293 and insulin secreting rat pancreatic beta-cells (INS-1) treated with ER stress. Here, the endogenous IRE1α again presented as approximately 500 and 720 kDa complexes that changed little during ER stress conditions, while PERK exhibited a significant ER stress-dependent shift in complex size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that if the Sec61 translocon controls oligomerization of IRE1α, its depletion in cells should resemble wIRE1α, which exhibited predominantly ~720 kDa complexes on BN-PAGE. Such a result would suggest that the mutation in wIRE1α does not cause secondary effects in IRE1α independent of the Sec61 translocon interaction disruption. To test this, we depleted the Sec61 translocon by treating cells with siRNA oligos against Sec61α and performed BN-PAGE analysis. Remarkably, wild-type IRE1α resembled wIRE1α in the Sec61 translocon depleted cells, as the 500 kDa Form A shifted to the 720 kDa Form B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the Sec61 translocon depletion had little effect in cells expressing wIRE1α, which remained in Form B. Consistent with recent findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>), depletion of the Sec61 translocon partially activated IRE1α as shown by a slight increase in self-phosphorylation in the absence of ER stress compared to control siRNA treated cells. However, an efficient activation of IRE1α in these cells typically required treatment with the ER stress inducer thapsigargin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Intriguingly, the depletion of the Sec61 translocon specifically affected IRE1α complexes, as PERK complexes were less disrupted in Sec61 depleted cells relative to the control siRNA-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To determine if the Sec61 translocon co-migrates with IRE1α complexes, we performed BN-PAGE immunoblotting with Sec61α antibodies. The Sec61 translocon, which is composed of α, β, and γ subunits, ran predominantly as a ~146 kDa form and a minor ~350 kDa form on BN-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), which is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Conti et al., 2015</xref>). Currently, it is unclear why we were not able to detect Sec61 co-migration with IRE1α, though it is likely that only a small population of the highly abundant Sec61 exists in a complex with IRE1α in cells. Collectively, these results suggest that IRE1α complexes in cells are regulated by an interaction with the Sec61 translocon.</p><p>We next sought to determine whether the Sec61 translocon co-migrates with the different complexes of IRE1α by performing BN-PAGE with the purified Sec61-IRE1α complex. To achieve this, we established stable cell lines expressing IRE1α and purified the IRE1α and Sec61 complex through a combination of affinity and ion exchange chromatography using digitonin, which preserves the interaction between IRE1α and the Sec61 translocon. The coomassie blue stained gel revealed that purified IRE1α associated with the Sec61 translocon and Sec63, a component of the translocon complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Meyer et al., 2000</xref>). As expected, wIRE1α lacked the Sec61 translocon complex, whereas sIRE1α associated with the Sec61 translocon complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). All three IRE1α proteins had a similar ability to cleave in vitro transcribed XBP1u mRNA substrate, though wIRE1α and sIRE1α showed slightly slower kinetics of cleavage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27187.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>IRE1α forms a hetero-oligomeric complex with the Sec61 translocon.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Coomassie blue stained gels showing IRE1α variants that were purified from HEK293 cells stably expressing 2X strep-tagged IRE1α.

Similar to the IRE1α complexes in cells, purified IRE1α existed as complexes of both Form A and Form B when it associated with the Sec61 translocon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, the purified wIRE1α existed predominantly as Form B and as a ~240 kDa complex. The 240 kDa form of IRE1α was not obvious in cells, suggesting that IRE1α complexes may be labile during the purification procedure. sIRE1α closely resembled the wild-type IRE1α complexes because both purified IRE1α and sIRE1α proteins contained similarly enriched Sec61 translocon complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Remarkably, BN-PAGE analysis with Sec61α antibodies revealed that Sec61 co-migrates with both Form A and Form B in purified IRE1α and sIRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, Sec61α was not detectable in BN-PAGE with the purified wIRE1α. At present, the role of BiP, which is known to interact and inhibit IRE1α oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>), in the Sec61 translocon-mediated regulation of IRE1α complexes is unclear, since we could not detect BiP in our purified IRE1α complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Nevertheless, our results with purified IRE1α proteins are consistent with the results derived from cells. We find that IRE1α and sIRE1α exist in Forms A and B with the Sec61 translocon, while wIRE1α is predominantly in Form B but without the Sec61 translocon. Although further work is required to determine the precise copy numbers of IRE1α in these complexes, our data suggest that Sec61 is an intrinsic part of the IRE1α complexes under normal and ER stress conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The Sec61 translocon inhibits formation of higher order IRE1α oligomeric clusters in cells</title><p>We next asked whether the Sec61 translocon-mediated regulation of IRE1α oligomerization can be observed by immunofluorescence. Previous studies reported that IRE1α forms higher-order oligomers or clusters upon ER stress, which correlate with IRE1α RNase activity and are proposed to be important for IRE1α signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). To determine whether the Sec61 translocon mediates regulation of IRE1α oligomerization, we looked for ER stress-dependent changes in IRE1α oligomerization in IRE1α-/- HEK293 cells complemented with IRE1α variants containing a C-terminal HA tag to facilitate immunostaining. Under normal conditions, IRE1α and wIRE1α were diffusely distributed in the ER membrane and colocalized with Sec61β, a subunit of the Sec61 translocon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, we detected robust clusters with wIRE1α expressing cells but not in wild-type IRE1α expressing cells upon treatment with tunicamycin, which induces ER stress by inhibiting protein glycosylation in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similar to wild-type IRE1α, we failed to observe clusters in sIRE1α expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), supporting the idea that the IRE1α interaction with the Sec61 translocon limits cluster formation. wIRE1α clustering was not dependent on cell types since we obtained similar results when we analyzed IRE1α-/- mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells complemented with either wild-type or wIRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). In addition, ER stress-mediated clusters of wIRE1α were not unique to this particular wIRE1α mutant, which has a ten amino acid deletion in IRE1α, but were also observed in cells expressing a wIRE1α mutant where two critical residues are mutated within the ten amino acid region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Only after increasing the expression level of IRE1α using doxycycline, could we detect a small percentage of clusters in wild-type IRE1α expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C,D</xref>). In contrast, we detected robust wIRE1α clusters in ER stress treated cells even at low expression levels. Together, these results suggest that the Sec61 translocon interaction prevents the formation of IRE1α higher order oligomers or clusters in cells. In contrast with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>), we observe only a low percentage of cells containing wild-type IRE1α clusters. This difference may be due to the intensity of ER stress applied to monitor IRE1α clusters in cells. Nevertheless, the differences we observe between wild-type IRE1α and wIRE1α indicate that the Sec61 translocon inhibits the formation of these higher-order oligomers or clusters.<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27187.008</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The Sec61 translocon inhibits IRE1α higher-order oligomer or cluster formation in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IRE1α -/- HEK293 cells complemented with IRE1α-HA, wIRE1α-HA or sIRE1α-HA were treated with 5 μg/ml Tunicamycin (TM) for 4 hr.

To test this idea, we gradually increased the expression level of IRE1α by titrating the concentration of doxycycline and assayed for activation by probing for IRE1α phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Consistent with previous findings, overexpressed IRE1α was partially activated as shown by phosphorylation even in the absence of ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Overexpressed wIRE1α exhibited an even larger amount of auto-phosphorylation and thus activation compared to wild-type IRE1α, while overexpressed sIRE1α showed reduced auto-phosphorylation compared to wild-type IRE1α. Interestingly, all IRE1α variants required ER stress treatment, in this case thapsigargin, to achieve a full activation state, suggesting that the accumulation of misfolded proteins plays a major role in IRE1α activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We next tested the role of the Sec61 translocon in IRE1α activation during ER stress treatment.

Therefore, we compared ER stress-induced inactivation of IRE1α and wIRE1α by probing for IRE1α phosphorylation. IRE1α was fully activated after two hours of ER stress treatment as demonstrated by all IRE1α shifting to the phosphorylated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Spliced XBP1 (XBP1s) protein production peaked at five hours. During prolonged stress, IRE1α was gradually inactivated with a concomitant reduction in the production of spliced XBP1 protein (XBP1s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Unlike IRE1α, PERK was activated through the duration of the stress period. This is consistent with previous studies which showed that IRE1α-mediated XBP1u mRNA splicing diminished within a few hours of stress despite the continuation of the ER stress treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2007</xref>). In sharp contrast to wild-type IRE1α, the Sec61 interaction-defective mutant, wIRE1α, showed significantly reduced inactivation as well as extended production of XBP1s during prolonged ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>). A similar difference in IRE1α and wIRE1α phosphorylation was observed with tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Here, IRE1α was nearly completely inactivated, but wIRE1α was only partially inactivated during prolonged stress. The temporal inactivation of IRE1α during ER stress was not specific to the complemented recombinant IRE1α since we obtained a similar result with the endogenous IRE1α in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with our previous work, under ER stress treatment conditions when both IRE1α and wIRE1α are equally activated, wIRE1α cells produced less XBP1s protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C and</xref> five hour treatment) since the lack of the Sec61 translocon interaction prevented efficient XBP1u mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>). We therefore wondered whether the slow attenuation observed in wIRE1α expressing cells was due to decreased XBP1s production, which could cause a reduction in ER chaperone production. However, we found that production of XBP1s-induced proteins, such as BiP and the Sec61 translocon, were similar in both IRE1α and wIRE1α expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C</xref>). To further confirm that XBP1s levels were not causing the observed phenotype, we overexpressed XBP1s by transfecting an XBP1s expressing plasmid into both IRE1α and wIRE1α expressing cells. Despite the overexpression of XBP1s, wIRE1α was still attenuated significantly slower than wild-type IRE1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E,F</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27187.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The Sec61 translocon regulates the attenuation of IRE1α activity during ER stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IRE1α -/- HEK293 cells complemented with either wild type IRE1α-HA or wIRE1α-HA were treated with 2.5 μg/ml of Tg for the indicated time points and analyzed by phos-tag immunoblotting for IRE1α and standard immunoblotting for the indicated antigens.

Indeed, sIRE1α showed a faster inactivation rate during prolonged ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G,H</xref>). Finally, we asked whether the presence of misfolded proteins in the ER is required for the continuous activation of wIRE1α during ER stress. Halting protein synthesis after removing ER stress allowed for complete inactivation of wIRE1α similar to IRE1α and PERK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). This result implies that the presence of misfolded proteins in the ER is required for the continuous activation of wIRE1α. Together, these results indicate that an efficient inactivation of IRE1α requires the IRE1α interaction with the Sec61 translocon.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Severe ER stress induces clusters and extended activation of wild-type IRE1α</title><p>Our results suggested that the Sec61 translocon limits IRE1α oligomerization and thereby controls activation and inactivation of IRE1α during ER stress. Therefore, we hypothesized that severe ER stress may overcome this restriction and induce higher-order oligomers as well as extended activation of IRE1α in wild-type IRE1α expressing cells, similar to that observed with wIRE1α. To test this, we examined IRE1α cluster formation after increasing the intensity of ER stress by adding four-fold more thapsigargin. This high concentration of thapsigargin, but not a lower concentration, induced clusters in IRE1α, wIRE1α, and sIRE1α expressing cells, though a higher percentage of wIRE1α cells presented clusters than wild-type IRE1α or sIRE1α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). These results suggest that the Sec61-IRE1α complex plays a role in limiting IRE1α oligomerization under ER stress conditions, but increased misfolded protein accumulation during severe ER stress conditions overcomes the Sec61 translocon-mediated restriction of IRE1α oligomerization. Interestingly, the interaction between IRE1α and the Sec61 translocon was little changed during both medial and severe ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that the Sec61 translocon might be clustering with IRE1α during severe ER stress conditions. Consistent with our hypothesis, confocal imaging revealed that the endogenous Sec61 translocon co-localized with IRE1α clusters in both wild type IRE1α and sIRE1α expressing cells.

Thus, the production of spliced XBP1 mRNA and its protein were continued (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D and E</xref>). These results suggest that once IRE1α forms higher oligomers, due to either a defect in the interaction with Sec61 or under severe ER stress, it becomes resistant to inactivation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we addressed the question of how IRE1α activity is regulated during ER stress conditions. We find that IRE1α oligomerization and RNAse activity are limited by the Sec61 translocon during normal and remedial ER stress levels, but that severe ER stress overcomes this block, resulting in prolonged IRE1α activation. Our results point to an important role for the IRE1α-Sec61 complex in measuring ER stress levels and accordingly tuning IRE1α activity, which may determine cell fate during ER stress.</p><p>To determine the role of the Sec61 translocon in regulating IRE1α oligomerization in cells under normal and ER stress conditions, we employed a BN-PAGE immunoblotting protocol. To our surprise, we found that IRE1α appears to be in preassembled complexes during steady-state conditions. Upon ER stress, the IRE1α complexes showed little change, albeit the intensity of Form B slightly increased with stress. This result suggests that IRE1α activation is most likely caused by a conformational change induced within the preformed IRE1α complexes by binding with misfolded proteins in the lumen. In contrast, changes in the PERK complex were conspicuous upon ER stress, as it moves from ~720 kDa to ~1200 kDa in size. These results led us to wonder what advantage preassembled complexes of IRE1α might have over ER stress-induced IRE1α oligomers. We propose that the extreme low-abundance of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>) might result in a very slow rate of oligomer formation and activation. Thus, preassembled IRE1α complexes may be essential for the rapid and robust IRE1α activation observed in cells. Future work is required to determine how many IRE1α molecules are present in each complex of IRE1α on BN-PAGE.</p><p>We next investigated higher-order oligomerization of IRE1α by examining cluster formation during ER stress. It has been reported that IRE1α forms clusters upon ER stress that correspond to higher-order oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>). In accordance with previous reports, we find that wild-type IRE1α forms clusters, though we only observe significant cluster formation under severe ER stress conditions. In contrast, wIRE1α formed robust clusters during remediable ER stress conditions and exhibited a higher percentage of clusters than IRE1α during severe stress conditions. These data suggest that the Sec61 translocon limits IRE1α cluster formation and that the preassembled complexes of wIRE1α may collide and form clusters rapidly in the absence of the Sec61 interaction. Through this method, we observed large, ER stress dependent, IRE1α clusters that were not captured in our BN-PAGE assay. The precise reason for this is not well understood at this point, although we cannot exclude the limitation of BN-PAGE in detecting the transient and highly dynamic nature of higher-order oligomers or clusters of IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Severe ER stress drastically increases cluster formation in cells expressing wild-type IRE1α, suggesting that the Sec61 translocon-mediated restriction of IRE1α oligomerization may be overcome under these conditions. Exactly how severe stress precisely tempers the Sec61 translocon barrier warrants further investigation. One potential explanation is that severe ER stress increases the number of misfolded polypeptides in the ER, which may overcome the Sec61 barrier and drive the IRE1α and Sec61 complexes into clusters. This is supported by previous studies that indicate misfolded proteins can directly bind and activate yeast IRE1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kimata et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>), though the similar evidence is currently lacking in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oikawa et al., 2012</xref>). Future structural and biochemical studies are needed to understand how the Sec61 translocon is precisely arranged with IRE1α to prevent IRE1α oligomerization and how this barrier is overcome under severe ER stress conditions.</p><p>Our studies also revealed that IRE1α interaction with Sec61 might be necessary to prevent inappropriate activation during physiological low levels of stress. This is apparent with wIRE1α, where a small population is constitutively activated in the absence of stress, and overall it presents increased ER stress sensitivity and exhibits prolonged activity. The constitutive activation of wIRE1α under basal conditions is consistent with the recent findings that IRE1α signaling is activated upon depletion of the Sec61 translocon in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>). These findings fit with the intriguing model proposed where IRE1α may sense the Sec61 translocon level and accordingly upregulate Sec61 genes by cleaving XBP1u mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamson et al., 2016</xref>). However, it remains to be understood how the low abundant IRE1α becomes activated by subtle quantity changes in vastly more abundant Sec61 translocon.</p><p>At present, the role of BiP in the Sec61 mediated regulation of IRE1α oligomerization is unclear. Similar to wIRE1α, earlier studies have shown that a small fraction of the BiP interaction defective IRE1α mutant is constitutively activated even under normal conditions as reflected by XBP1u mRNA cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that both BiP and the Sec61 translocon are required to maintain IRE1α in an inactive form under normal conditions. However, unlike BiP, which is released from IRE1α during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>), the interaction with the Sec61 translocon is maintained throughout ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). We therefore propose that the Sec61 translocon may play a crucial role during ER stress to limit IRE1α activity. The disparate effects of the wIRE1α and sIRE1α mutants, which either promote or prevent IRE1α oligomerization and activation, respectively, lend support for this model.</p><p>In comparison to wild-type IRE1α, the attenuation of wIRE1α activity is significantly delayed. One plausible explanation is that wIRE1α robustly forms large oligomers that sustain a longer activation period during ER stress. In contrast, sIRE1α was slower to phosphorylate and more quickly attenuated than wild-type IRE1α. It is likely that other IRE1α interacting proteins besides Sec61 also contribute to IRE1α activation and attenuation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisbona et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pincus et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rodriguez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eletto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morita et al., 2017</xref>), since wIRE1α attenuation is significantly delayed but not completely prevented during prolonged ER stress.</p><p>An alternative possibility for the observed phenotypes of wIRE1α and sIRE1α is that these mutations in IRE1α affect IRE1α homo-oligomerization and/or ER stress-dependent activation of IRE1α independently of Sec61. Although future work is required to rule out this possibility, current results strongly indicate that the Sec61 translocon limits IRE1α oligomerization since two independent wIRE1α mutants exhibit similar effects and increased oligomerization. Furthermore, sIRE1α exhibits the opposite phenotype of wIRE1α, with reduced IRE1α oligomerization and slow activation/quick de-activation kinetics compared to wild-type IRE1α.</p><p>Upon first glance, the effects of disrupting the IRE1α-Sec61 interaction on XBP1u mRNA cleavage observed by our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>) and the current study may appear contradictory. However, the data are reconciled by considering the number of activated IRE1α molecules under all conditions. When an equal number of IRE1α and wIRE1α proteins are activated, wIRE1α exhibits less XBP1u mRNA cleavage because its RNase domains cannot access XBP1u mRNA as efficiently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Plumb et al., 2015</xref>), and thus produces less XBP1s protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C and</xref> five hour treatment). However, as we demonstrate in this study, disrupting the Sec61-IRE1α interaction results in a slight increase in the number of activated IRE1α molecules under normal conditions and a more dramatic increase during prolonged ER stress conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). In this case, the difference in the ability of IRE1α and wIRE1α to access XBP1u mRNA becomes negligible, since so many more wIRE1α molecules are active compared to wild type IRE1α. Thus, the production of XBP1s protein is in fact greater in wIRE1α than wild type IRE1α expressing cells under such conditions.</p><p>Our data suggest that the intensity of ER stress determines whether IRE1α signaling is attenuated or remains active. We propose that the selective attenuation of IRE1α signaling may be beneficial for secretory cells such as pancreatic beta cells and plasma cells by providing a longer time window to resolve ER stress and avert inappropriate cleavage of ER-localized mRNAs, including mRNAs encoding secretory proteins such as insulin and immunoglobulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lipson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benhamron et al., 2014</xref>). If ER stress is prolonged and irremediable, as shown by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rutkowski et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu et al., 2014</xref>), the PERK pathway remains active and induces CHOP-mediated cell death. However, severe ER stress may induce higher-order oligomers of IRE1α by overcoming the Sec61 translocon barrier, thus leading to a defect in the attenuation of IRE1α signaling. This continuous IRE1α activation might be beneficial for tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cubillos-Ruiz et al., 2015</xref>) but may promote cell death in secretory cells such as pancreatic beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>). In conclusion, the Sec61 translocon plays an essential role in controlling oligomerization and activity of IRE1α during ER stress.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study from the Mariappan group is a follow-up to an earlier <italic>eLife</italic> contribution that described a physical interaction between Ire1α and the Sec61 translocon. The role of this interaction in the earlier study was proposed to be the efficient targeting of Xbp1 mRNA to Ire1α via the SRP-Sec61 targeting pathway. In this follow-up, the authors have exploited Ire1α mutants that either weaken (wIre1α) or strengthen (sIre1α) the Ire1α-translocon interaction to examine the consequences for ER stress-mediated Ire1α signaling. The central finding, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, is that wIre1α is partially active even without ER stress, and fails to be efficiently turned off during chronic stress. By contrast, sIre1α is slightly more efficiently turned off relative to wild type Ire1α. This is a carefully done study and a well-written paper including interesting and important results. However, some points need clarifying before publishing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The three reviewers all indicated that the authors should be much more cautious in their interpretation of the mobilities of membrane protein complexes on the Blue-native gels. Mobility of membrane proteins on these gels is impacted by shape and bound detergent. The molecular weight markers used for the gels are not membrane proteins, so they don't bind the detergent. Previous work from the Skach lab has characterized the mobility of a Sec61-heterotrimer on BN-PAGE gels. For example, the 66 kD band of Sec61 (panel E) is almost certainly not a Sec61 heterotrimer, but is instead just Sec61α. (The Sec61 heterotrimer should migrate at ~240 kD, see Conti et al. Mol.

Mobility of membrane proteins on these gels is impacted by shape and bound detergent. The molecular weight markers used for the gels are not membrane proteins, so they don't bind the detergent. Previous work from the Skach lab has characterized the mobility of a Sec61-heterotrimer on BN-PAGE gels. For example, the 66 kD band of Sec61 (panel E) is almost certainly not a Sec61 heterotrimer, but is instead just Sec61α. (The Sec61 heterotrimer should migrate at ~240 kD, see Conti et al. Mol. Cell 58:269). For this reason, the number of Sec61 and Ire1 proteins in the A and B bands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), is almost certainly smaller than the authors suggest in the Discussion. The Blue Native gel data can remain in a revised version of the manuscript, but these results should only be used to show that at a gross level, oligomerization/interaction status does not change appreciably upon ER stress.</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewers for pointing out the issues with the blue-native PAGE gels. As they suggested, we have removed the section in the Discussion describing the possible number of Sec61 and Ire1α molecules in A and B bands. We have now used the data to show only that Ire1α oligomerization is not appreciably changed upon ER stress and that oligomerization differs when the Ire1α-Sec61 interaction is disrupted. We apologize that in our initial manuscript we mistakenly labeled the Sec61 translocon as a 66 kDa band due to the difficulty in detecting the lower molecular weight marker proteins after transferring onto the PVDF membrane. We have now performed a careful experiment to validate the size of the Sec61 translocon on the BN-PAGE gels by comparing with a protein standard lane from the same BN-PAGE gel that was excised and stained with Coomassie blue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). We now see both Sec61a and Sec61b migrating as a ~146 kDa band. This suggests that the Sec61 translocon complex is intact and is also consistent with Conti et al., where they see the majority of the Sec61 translocon (α, β, γ) migrating as a ~130kDa band (Conti et al., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). The reviewers pointed to a ~240 kD band that corresponds to the Sec61 heterotrimer in Conti et al., but we were not able to find this complex in their data or Discussion. Interestingly, we detect a ~350 kDa band with the Sec61b antibodies and a faint band at 350kDa for Sec61a, consistent with Conti et al., where they identified this band as a Sec61 and TRAP complex. Collectively, these results suggest that the migration of the Sec61 translocon we observe is consistent with the previous findings from the Skach lab.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27187.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>BN-PAGE immunoblotting analysis of the Sec61 translocon complex.</title><p>IRE1α -/- HEK293 cells complemented with wild-type IRE1α-HA or wIREα-HA were treated with 2.5 μg/ml Tg for the indicated hours (hr), lysed with digitonin, and analyzed by BN-PAGE immunoblotting as well as a protein marker lane from the same BN-PAGE gel was excised.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.27187.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.27187.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="png" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-27187-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p><italic>2) The central conclusion is predicated on the assumption that the Ire1α mutants only affect its interaction with Sec61, and nothing else.

As reviewers suggested, we had previously attempted to find the Ire1α interacting region in Sec61a. Since the Sec61 translocon interaction region is present in the luminal domain of Ire1α, we predicted that a luminal of loop of Sec61a might be important for the interaction with Ire1α. However, we encountered a problem as some of the deletion constructs of Sec61 exhibit reduced expression and poor assembly with the endogenous Sec61b subunit, thus confounding the analysis of our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.27187.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Domain mapping of the IRE1α interaction region in Sec61α.</title><p>The lysates prepared from HEK293 cells transiently expressing the indicated 3x-HA tagged Sec61a variants were immunoprecipitated with anti-HA antibodies and analyzed by immunoblotting.

This data is consistent with the reduction in Xbp1s protein production for both sIre1α and wIre1α. However, since Xbp1 mRNA targeting to Ire1α should not be a factor in the in vitro cleavage assay, the reduction in wIre1α cleavage is somewhat surprising. It is likely that the lack of other components in this assay, such as misfolded protein activating ligands and BiP, prevents an accurate comparison between the Xbp1 mRNA cleavage observed in vitro and the Ire1α activity demonstrated in cells. We agree with the reviewers concerns about unintended effects, and now include the possibility of alternative effects of Ire1α mutations in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>4) The authors demonstrated that Ire1α formed cluster under severe stress condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A, B</xref>).

Our results suggest that wild type Ire1α and sIre1α clusters formed under severe stress conditions co-localize with the endogenous Sec61beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, wIre1α clusters were devoid of the Sec61beta staining. This result is consistent with co-immunoprecipitation experiments, where Ire1α always associated with the Sec61 translocon even during severe stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>5) The authors describe that ER stress is required for the activation of preformed Ire1α complex. However, overexpression of Ire1α spontaneously activate Ire1α molecules. How do the authors explain it?</italic> </p><p>Ire1α overexpression can indeed activate more than 50% of Ire1α molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but its complete activation still requires ER stress. Moreover, Ire1α over expression alone is insufficient to induce clusters in cells, which strictly require ER stress treatment. Although the precise mechanism for the partial activation of overexpressed Ire1α is unclear, it may be that Ire1α overexpression results in the formation of many pre-formed complexes that may transiently collide and trigger trans-autophosphorylation independent of ER stress. Alternatively, it could be that overexpression of Ire1α may disturb ER homeostasis and activate Ire1α.</p><p><italic>6) In their first paper (and independently discovered by Kohno group), Sec61 interaction facilitates Xbp1 splicing; now, they show that disrupting this interaction with their wIre1 allele facilitates Xbp1 splicing and in fact, results in mild constitutive Ire1 activation. Some discussion of this apparent contradiction is warranted.</italic> </p><p>We have described two independent functions of the Ire1α-Sec61 interaction in Ire1α signaling. In our first publication, we show that the maximal amount of Xbp1 mRNA cleavage during ER stress is less for wIre1α than wild-type Ire1α. In addition, Kenji Kohno’s group and we demonstrate that Xbp1 mRNA is targeted to the Sec61 translocon. Therefore, we conclude that the Ire1α-Sec61 interaction is necessary to bring together Ire1 and its primary mRNA substrate, Xbp1, for efficient cleavage during ER stress conditions. Consistent with this conclusion, in our current work we find that the maximal production of Xbp1s protein in wIre1α is reproducibly less than wild-type Ire1α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, see 5 hr treatment). It is important to point out that losing the interaction with Sec61 does not wholly abolish Xbp1 mRNA cleavage by Ire1α (Plumb and Zhang et al., 2015 and this study). In addition, we have noticed that the extent of the effect on Xbp1 mRNA cleavage is highly dependent on Ire1α and wIre1α expression levels; the closer to endogenous levels of Ire1α, the more dramatic the difference. Indeed, even a small increase in wIre1α expression can overcome this shortcoming.</p><p>Here, we describe an additional role for the Ire1α-Sec61 interaction, namely in limiting the extent of Ire1α oligomerization and the subsequent kinetics of its activation and de-activation, as shown by phosphorylation, during ER stress. Therefore, wIre1α activity is higher than wild type Ire1α under two different conditions. First, a small population of wIre1α is constitutively activated even under normal conditions. Second, we observe that wIre1α remains activated longer than Ire1α during prolonged ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, C</xref>). Under these conditions, the difference in the ability of Ire1α and wIre1α to access Xbp1 mRNA becomes negligible, since many more wIre1 molecules are active compared to wild type Ire1α. Thus, the production of Xbp1s protein is in fact greater in wIRE1α than wild type Ire1α expressing cells under such conditions. We have now included a section discussing this issue in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>7) The authors need to cite additional papers and comment on the role of BiP binding in activation of Ire1.
