At a given resolution, an optimal exposure can be defined that maximizes the signal-to-noise ratio in the image. Using a 2.6 Å resolution single particle cryo-EM reconstruction of rotavirus VP6, determined from movies recorded with a total exposure of 100 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>, we obtained accurate measurements of optimal exposure values over a wide range of resolutions. At low and intermediate resolutions, our measured values are considerably higher than obtained previously for crystalline specimens, indicating that both images and movies should be collected with higher exposures than are generally used. We demonstrate a method of using our optimal exposure values to filter movie frames, yielding images with improved contrast that lead to higher resolution reconstructions. This ‘high-exposure’ technique should benefit cryo-EM work on all types of samples, especially those of relatively low-molecular mass.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06980.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06980.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06980.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microscopes allow us to visualize objects that are invisible to the naked eye. One type of microscope—called the electron microscope—produces images using beams of particles known as electrons, which enables them to produce more detailed images than microscopes that use light.</p><p>There are several ways to prepare samples for electron microscopy. For example, in ‘electron cryo-microscopy’—or cryo-EM for short—a sample is rapidly frozen to preserve its features before it is examined under the microscope. This technique generates images that can be analyzed by computers to produce three-dimensional models of individual viruses, proteins, and other tiny objects. Unfortunately, the samples need to be exposed to high-energy beams of electrons that will damage the sample while the images are gathered, which results in sample movement and blurry images that lack the finer details.</p><p>The contrast between the sample and its background is one of the factors that determine the final quality of an image. The higher the contrast, the greater the level of structural information that can be obtained, but this requires the use of longer exposures to the electron beam. To overcome this issue, researchers found that instead of recording a single image, it is possible to record movies in which the movement of the sample under the electron beam can be tracked. After the movies are gathered, the movie frames are aligned using computer software to reduce the blurring caused by the sample moving and can then be used to make three-dimensional models.</p><p>Grant and Grigorieff improved this method further by studying how quickly a large virus-like particle called ‘<italic>rotavirus</italic> double-layered particle’ is damaged under the electron beam. These experiments identified an optimum range of exposure to electrons that provides the highest image contrast at any given level of detail. These findings were used to design an exposure filter that can be applied to the movie frames, allowing Grant and Grigorieff to visualize features of the virus that had not previously been observed by cryo-EM.</p><p>This method was also used to study an assembly of proteins known as the proteasome, which is responsible for destroying old proteins. Grant and Grigorieff's findings should be useful for cryo-EM studies on many kinds of samples.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06980.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06980.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>high-dose imaging</kwd><kwd>movie processing</kwd><kwd>radiation damage</kwd><kwd>optimal exposure</kwd><kwd>20S proteasome</kwd><kwd>tomography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grant</surname><given-names>Timothy</given-names></name><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM103310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grigorieff</surname><given-names>Nikolaus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The resolution of electron cryo-microscopy can be improved by using optimal exposure values to filter video frames.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Electron microscopy of isolated macromolecules and their complexes (single particles) embedded in a thin layer of vitreous ice (cryo-EM) has recently led to a number of structures determined at near-atomic resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allegretti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wong et al., 2014</xref>), a level of detail that had previously been restricted to X-ray crystallography and NMR (for a recent review of the technique, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>). A limiting factor in the resolution of EM images of biological specimens is radiation damage because the imaging of such specimens ultimately relies on the interaction of electrons with the sample. Some of these interactions will result in energy being deposited in the specimen, and these will cause radiation damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glaeser, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henderson, 1995</xref>). The radiation damage fundamentally limits the information present in the images because the useful signal added per incident electron decreases with increasing electron exposure, while the added noise (image contrast originating from other parts of the sample as well as inelastic scattering) remains approximately constant. If the signal gain per unit exposure is known at a given resolution, an optimal exposure can be chosen that will maximize the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at that resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The rate of exposure-dependent signal decay has been measured by following the intensities of the fading diffraction spots in exposure series obtained from 2D and thin 3D crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stark et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). These studies demonstrated that higher resolution intensities tend to fade faster than lower resolution intensities, and that the rate of fading for all resolutions is slowed under liquid nitrogen conditions relative to room temperature conditions. The fading of the spots can be described by an exponential decay that is characterized by <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>, the resolution-dependent critical exposure after which spot intensities are reduced to 1/e of their starting values. To perform similar experiments with non-crystalline material, that is single particles, the resolution-dependent fading of the signal present in an image (or average of images) has to be determined. Unlike diffraction spots obtained from crystals, the signal in an image will give rise to signal amplitudes in the image Fourier transform. The squared Fourier amplitudes are equivalent to crystal diffraction intensities but will be affected by a number of additional factors, for example, the contrast transfer function (CTF) of the microscope and movement of the specimen, both attenuating the amplitudes. However, assuming a linear imaging system and constant amplitude-attenuating factors throughout an exposure series, the rate of fading of the signal in an image can be determined from the fading of the signal amplitudes in the image Fourier transform. While the fading of spots can be measured directly from diffraction patterns, the signal amplitudes calculated from an image are superimposed on the noise generated by the stochastic detection of electrons forming the image, as well as background due to the embedding ice and support film if present. Therefore, instead of measuring signal amplitudes directly, they have to be estimated from measurements of the SNR. Since the exposure, and therefore the noise, in each image within a series remains approximately constant, the SNR is directly proportional to the signal in each image. Analogous to the fading of diffraction spots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</xref>), the SNR of an image recorded after a prior exposure of <italic>N</italic> electrons/Å<sup>2</sup> is therefore<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>SNR</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext>SNR</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>k</italic> is the spatial frequency, <italic>N</italic> is the accumulated exposure, and <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is the resolution-dependent critical exposure defined above. We can see from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">Equation 1</xref> that a plot of ln(SNR(<italic>k</italic>)) vs <italic>N</italic> should have a slope of −1/<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>(<italic>k</italic>), and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al. (2010)</xref> demonstrated that this relationship is true not just in the case of measurements of instantaneous signal, but also in the case of a detector that integrates measured intensities over time. The SNR of an image will continue to increase with electron exposures larger than the critical exposure. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser (1979)</xref> showed that the signal present in crystal diffraction spots is maximized at an optimal exposure of ∼2.5 times the critical exposure. The SNR increase per unit exposure is larger below the optimal exposure than the corresponding rate of SNR decay beyond the optimal exposure; thus, it is typically better to slightly overexpose a specimen than slightly underexpose. An exposure of 2.5 <italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub> is also expected to optimize the signal in images at a given resolution due to the analogy between image and crystal data as explained above.</p><p>Despite studies of the general effects of radiation damage on single-particle specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conway et al., 1993</xref>), direct measurement of the critical exposure on non-crystalline specimens has proven difficult in the past for a number of reasons. Firstly, recording a series of images with increasing exposure would have led to images with SNRs so low that they would be difficult to analyze. Secondly, until recently the resolutions commonly obtained with the single-particle method were of insufficient quality to follow radiation damage at near-atomic resolution (better than 4 Å). Finally, signal loss due to beam-induced specimen movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheres, 2014</xref>) was hard to quantify, and thus, the effects of radiation damage and movement could not be separated. The recent availability of direct electron detectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milazzo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Faruqi and Henderson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2013</xref>) has largely alleviated these problems. The ability to record movies instead of single images allows for easy collection of a continuous exposure series, while allowing for measurement and correction of specimen movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheres, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the improved detective quantum efficiency of the detectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ruskin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McMullan et al., 2014</xref>) has enhanced the signal present in the images, and this enhancement combined with motion correction has enabled single-particle reconstructions to reach higher resolutions. In this study, we used a K2 Summit direct detector (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA) to collect a single particle data set of rotavirus double-layered particle (DLP) and estimate the critical exposure of a non-crystalline specimen. Rotavirus DLP is a spherical particle with a diameter of about 700 Å and a molecular mass of about 70 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grigorieff and Harrison, 2011</xref>). The capsid has icosahedral symmetry and consists predominantly of viral proteins VP2 and VP6, forming an inner and outer layer, respectively. They have a combined mass of about 44 MDa and package 11 or 12 copies of viral proteins VP1 and VP3, as well as 11 dsRNA segments that make up the viral genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Estrozi et al., 2013</xref>). VP6 assembles into 260 trimers that arrange in a <italic>T</italic> = 13 surface lattice containing a total of 780 VP6 monomers. The <italic>T</italic> = 13 lattice enables 13-fold averaging of density in addition to the 60-fold icosahedral symmetry. The large size of DLP and its high symmetry make it an ideal specimen for this study, yielding high-contrast particles with very low-alignment errors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2011</xref>) and almost a thousand averaged subunits per particle.</p><p>The DLP data presented here are of sufficient quality to obtain sub-3-Å resolution reconstructions using just a few movie frames, enabling us to accurately measure the critical exposure over a large range of resolutions. To test the new filtering scheme, we also show its application to a recently published reconstruction of the <italic>Thermoplasma acidophilum</italic> 20S proteasome at 2.8 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating optimization of SNR in the final reconstruction and improved alignment when the SNR in the images is very low.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>2.6 Å reconstruction of rotavirus DLP</title><p>Examples of an aligned movie and particle images with different effective exposures are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

Despite good overall agreement, there are a number of significant differences, localized mainly to areas on the periphery of the molecule, which may indicate effects of crystal packing and/or the presence of additional protein interactions in the full capsid as opposed to the isolated VP6 subunit.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06980.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of an aligned movie sum of the rotavirus double-layered particle (DLP) sample imaged with a total exposure of 100 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Particle sum created using all frames and (<bold>C</bold>) the first 3 frames of the movie, demonstrating the kind of data used in the analysis.

One possibility for the difference between this and the ∼2.6 Å obtained with the half map is the absence of full density for the most radiation-sensitive side chains in the map, while they are present in the model. Assigning higher atomic temperature factors to side chains with weak density may accommodate these discrepancies, but we did not explore this in our model refinement.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Critical exposure curve</title><p>A complication of using images for the calculation of critical exposure as opposed to diffraction intensities is the beam-induced movement of the specimen. Previous studies have demonstrated that the magnitude of this movement is not constant across a single exposure, typically being greater at the beginning of the exposure than at the end (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campbell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li et al., 2013</xref>). Movement of a particle over the course of the exposure will lead to signal degradation, and if the movement is not constant across the entire exposure, it will lead to an exposure-dependent signal degradation unrelated to radiation damage. Non-constant movement across an exposure will therefore interfere with the critical exposure measurement and must be taken into account. In order to do this, we estimated per-frame shifts for each particle using a new movie alignment program called Unblur (see ‘Materials and methods’). During subsequent refinement (see below), we also estimated particle rotations by aligning 3-frame sums (see below). On average, particles rotate by ∼0.9° over the course of a movie, or an average of 0.02° per three frames. A rotation of 0.02° causes a translation of subunits on the surface of DLP of about 0.12 Å, too small to be relevant for our analysis of the fading signal. Movies were recorded such that the specimen was exposed to a total exposure of 100 electrons/Å<sup>2</sup>, split over 130 movie frames (0.77 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> per frame). By the 28th frame (an accumulated exposure of 21 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>), the average particle shift per frame had fallen to 0.2 Å, with 95% of particles shifting by less than 0.54 Å per frame. Between the 28th frame and the 130th frame, the average particle shift per frame remained constant at 0.2 Å, and 95% of the measured particle shift stayed between 0.4 Å and 0.54 Å per frame. Because the movement was almost constant between frames 28–130, we do not expect differences in their signal to be significantly affected by translational movement, and for this reason, only frames 28–130 were used during the analysis.</p><p>Movie frames for each particle were aligned individually, but in order to provide more signal, reconstructions were calculated from sums of every 3 movie frames (2.31 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> per sum). Each of these reconstructions of the VP6 trimer was used to calculate an FSC curve (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) for the corresponding accumulated exposure. These FSC curves were used to estimate the SNR of a resolution shell (<italic>k</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grigorieff, 2000</xref>):<disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>SNR</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mtext>FSC</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext>FSC</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, using the measured FSC curves and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">Equation 2</xref>, we were able to plot ln(SNR) for each resolution shell as a function of exposure.

At resolutions higher than 3.8 Å, there were too few points (estimated SNR values) for reliable fitting. At resolutions below 22 Å, the curves became much noisier resulting in poor quality fits. This may be due to the fact that at resolutions below 22 Å, errors due to inelastic scattering become more significant, and the FSC values at these spatial frequencies are so high (typically greater than 0.999) that small errors lead to large changes in the estimated SNR. Additionally, our VP6 reconstruction has only 4 resolution shells at resolutions lower than 22 Å (nominally at ∼27 Å, ∼37 Å, 55 Å, and 110 Å). These low-resolution shells thus effectively contain information from a wide range of frequencies, which may also cause errors in the estimation.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06980.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) The measured critical exposure curve plotting the critical exposure at each measured resolution and the fit function for comparison.</title><p>(<bold>B</bold>) Curve plotting the optimal exposure obtained in this study alongside that obtained in a previous study on crystalline specimens, scaled by a factor of 1.25 to compensate for the fact that the previous study was conducted at 200 kV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06980.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06980.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06980-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We could fit a function to the recorded data, which takes the form<disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The best fit to the data, with a R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.997, was <italic>a</italic> = 0.245, <italic>b</italic> = −1.665, and <italic>c</italic> = 2.81, plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> together with the experimental data. This function can be used to estimate the critical exposure at 300 kV; the critical exposure at 200 kV can be expected to be about 25% lower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yalcin et al., 2006</xref>). The optimal exposure, plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, is ∼2.5 times the critical exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</xref>).</p><p>At higher spatial frequencies (∼4 Å), our values agree well with values previously measured on crystalline specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>), but they deviate toward lower spatial frequencies, suggesting that the signal at these frequencies in single-particle images is less sensitive to electron exposure than in images of crystalline specimens. A possible explanation is that when imaging crystalline specimens, there are two modes of damage, a short-range component caused by damage to the molecules themselves and a long-range component caused by loss of crystalline order. We would expect single particles to be affected only by the former and so appear to be less radiation sensitive. Rotavirus DLP may also be affected by lattice distortions because the surface lattice formed by the VP6 trimers may be considered analogous to the lattice of a small crystal. However, the extent to which deformations will attenuate signal will depend on the size of the lattice: small deformations can add up to larger unit cell displacements across larger distances compared to displacements across smaller distances. The crystals used for electron diffraction typically measure 1 μm or more in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>), at least 5 times larger than the circumference of DLP. Furthermore, due to their geometry, 2D and thin 3D crystals are prone to in-plane and out-of-plane distortions, both of which can severely attenuate diffraction intensities. It is therefore essential for crystal diffraction studies to use a flat support film, usually amorphous carbon. Studies of beam-induced motion have shown that the observed motion in cryo-EM specimens involves both the ice and the carbon support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Glaser et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brilot et al., 2012</xref>). Some of the beam-induced motion may lead to distortions of the carbon support, causing long-range distortions in the crystals. Beam-induced distortions of the ice layer embedding the DLP particles may also perturb the particle structure. However, the tight packing of the capsids around the RNA genome is likely to yield a particle that is more resistant to distortions than the crystals. We therefore expect that, at least in terms of the structural properties relevant for this study, DLP is much closer to a single particle than a thin crystal. If the icosahedral surface lattice of DLP is also affected by lattice distortions due to radiation damage, we would expect the critical exposure for smaller, less symmetric samples to be higher still. A further difference to the crystal studies is that they used the fastest fading intensities in each resolution bin for their analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Unwin and Henderson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stark et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2010</xref>). With a single-particle specimen, we are limited to measuring the average loss of SNR in each resolution bin, which by definition is lower than the fastest fading components. However, the difference between the average and fastest fading components does not appear to be enough to explain the observed differences. Other factors may include the chemical makeup of the specimen, such as the presence of nucleic acids in DLP, as well as buffer and solvent components. However, the effect of these factors on radiation damage is not well understood.</p><p>The first 27 frames of the movie were excluded from the analysis so as to prevent beam-induced movement from interfering with the results. Our results are therefore based upon data, which have effectively been pre-exposed by ∼20 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. If radiation damage indeed occurs as a single-exponential process, pre-exposure should have no effect on the result presented here. We cannot exclude the possibility that the damage may occur in two (or more) phases and that we are only observing the final phase, but there is no evidence for a multi-phased process, and previous studies on crystalline specimens also demonstrate a single-exponential decay. Moreover, for lower resolutions at which beam-induced movement is expected to have less of an effect, a plot of ln(SNR) vs accumulated exposure across all frames shows a single-exponential process (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We also note that a reconstruction calculated using only frames 25–27 (∼19 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>–∼21 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>) still yields a 3.35 Å resolution reconstruction with clear side chain density (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), suggesting that the decay we have measured is relevant to the kinds of structural information we are interested in. As expected, the density of side chains fades with increasing exposure and dose deposited on the sample. The density of carboxyl groups (e.g., Asp29, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) fades most rapidly and is already partially gone after an exposure of about 3 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, while those of aromatic groups (e.g., Tyr24, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) persists even after an exposure of about 35–40 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. This general pattern agrees with that observed before in a number of cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allegretti et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartesaghi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fromm et al., 2015</xref>) and X-ray crystallography studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fioravanti et al., 2007</xref>). We note also that the density of the α-helix backbone remains visible even after an exposure of ∼50 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. This high exposure exceeds the optimal exposure of about 30 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> at 8 Å resolution where α-helical features become clearly visible. Such high tolerance of secondary structural features to radiation damage may help in the alignment of single-particle images recorded using high exposures (see below).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06980.008</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Surface rendering of an isolated small helix from different 3-frame reconstructions shown with the docked model.</title><p>Each reconstruction is shown with its exposure range and resolution as calculated from the FSC using the 0.143 cut-off.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06980.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06980.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06980-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Exposure filtering</title><p>When using a detector, which outputs single images, the optimal exposure curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) can be used to select the optimal exposure based on a targeted resolution, although this exposure will not be optimal for other resolutions.

Increasing the SNR of the movie sum should increase the accuracy of particle alignments leading to improved reconstructions, particularly in the most difficult cases such as very small proteins. Furthermore, correct filtering of movie frames allows the use of all later frames in the reconstruction with no need to test the inclusion of different numbers of frames in order to find an optimum.</p><p>In order to assess the effectiveness of applying the exposure filter, we first used trial and error to manually determine which range of frames, when summed, yielded the best VP6 reconstruction. The best reconstruction was found when using frames 4–21. Separately, we calculated a reconstruction using frames 4–130 (i.e., to the final frame of the movie), weighted with the exposure filter. The two reconstructions are nearly identical as judged by the FSC and are both of better quality than a reconstruction using the unfiltered sum of frames 4–130, suggesting that the exposure filter is weighting correctly (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>While the reconstructions calculated using exposure filtering and by selecting frames 4–21 have the same resolution, the exposure-filtered reconstruction visually appears slightly less sharp.

In the case of DLPs, which exhibit extremely low-alignment error using traditional processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2011</xref>), increasing the SNR at low and intermediate resolutions would not be expected to lead to improved alignment. However, additional resolution gains can be expected for smaller particles with a lower molecular mass, when using exposure-filtered particle sums (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Application of the exposure filter to 20S proteasome</title><p>Using recently published data to calculate a 2.8 Å reconstruction of the 20S proteasome, a 700 kDa complex with D7 symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell et al., 2015</xref>), we applied the exposure filter described above to test if it also optimizes the reconstruction of a smaller, less symmetrical particle. Movies of 20S proteasome consisted of 38 frames collected on a Gatan K2 detector using a total exposure of 53 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> (∼1.4 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> per frame). Using the frame alignment obtained by Campbell et al., we calculated four different frame sums: using the exposure filter, unfiltered sums of the first 9 frames (corresponding to an effective exposure of 12.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>), the first 14 frames (corresponding to an effective exposure of 19.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>), and all frames. An exposure of 12.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> approximates the optimal exposure at ∼3 Å resolution measured using rotavirus DLP, while an exposure of ∼20 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> is close to exposures used in previous high-resolution cryo-EM studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolf et al., 2010</xref>) that were published prior to the use of direct detectors and movies. The same particles selected and used by Campbell et al. (49,954 particles) were extracted from these four sets of micrographs, aligned against an initial model obtained from class averages (see ‘Materials and methods’) and refined using Frealign v9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>A comparison between the previously published structure and our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) suggests that the exposure filter described here and the B-factor weighting implemented in Relion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheres, 2014</xref>; see below) and used by Campbell et al. perform equally well. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> shows FSC curves for all four test cases, indicating a resolution of 2.8 Å for all reconstructions except the one calculated from unfiltered frame sums that included all 38 frames. The lower resolution of this last reconstruction (about 3 Å) is expected due to the effective total exposure of 53 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, which exceeds the optimal exposure at 3 Å by a factor of 4. The optimal exposure is also exceeded in the case of 19.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, albeit only by a factor of 1.5, which does not appear to affect the resolution of the reconstruction significantly. To better follow the effectiveness of the exposure filter, we also plotted the average spectral SNR of the filtered particle images (PSSNR, see above). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> shows that the SNR of the exposure-filtered sums of all frames equals or exceeds that of the other frame sums at all resolutions. Without exposure filtering, summing all 38 frames produces SNR values that are similar to the filtered sums at low resolution but are significantly lower as the resolution increases. At 3 Å resolution, the average SNR in the unfiltered sums is only about 30% of that of the filtered sums. The PSSNR curves estimated for the unfiltered sums, calculated from the first 9 and 14 movie frames, start out lower at low resolution than the other two curves as expected since they are missing the additional exposure to boosts the low-resolution signal. At 3 Å resolution, both curves converge with the curve calculated form the filtered sums using all 38 frames. Based on the effective radiation damage reflected in the data, we would expect the PSSNR at high resolution to be highest for the exposure-filtered sums, followed by the unfiltered sums corresponding to 12.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, 19.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, and 53 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>. However, in practice, the estimates are subject to some error due to the weak signal at high resolution and the fact that all data sets were independently refined from low resolution (see ‘Materials and methods’). Therefore, only the data set with the most significant signal attenuation (sums of 38 unfiltered frames) deviates significantly from the rest, and the remaining three curves indicate very similar SNR values.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06980.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of an isolated helix from the previously published reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Campbell, 2015</xref>) on the left, and the reconstruction using exposure-filtered data on the right.</title><p>The two maps appear almost identical after scaling the amplitudes using diffmap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap">http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/diffmap</ext-link>), suggesting that in this case exposure filtering performs as well as the weighting based on B-factors implemented in Relion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheres, 2014</xref>).

The benefit of a higher total exposure is not apparent in the alignment of rotavirus DLP because the alignment errors of all tested frame sums is extremely small. Even the resolution of the reconstruction of the 20S proteasome with a total mass of 700 kDa does not appear to be limited by alignment errors at exposures of 12.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> and higher (see previous section). To demonstrate improved alignment at higher total exposures when the signal is weak, we generated additional data sets by adding images of areas of empty ice to the proteasome particle images. The ice images were taken from the same micrographs as the particles they were added to, and they contained the same number of frames (total exposure) and filtering. The ice images add approximately the same amount of noise and background that is also present in the particle images, thus, reducing the effective SNR in the resulting images approximately by 50%. At low resolution (special frequencies larger than 1/10 Å<sup>−1</sup>), the new data sets should therefore emulate data that would have been obtained by a particle of half the mass, that is, 350 kDa, while at higher resolution (special frequencies smaller than 1/10 Å<sup>−1</sup>) the data should approximate the signal expected from a 175 kDa particle, that is, with a quarter of the mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rosenthal and Henderson, 2003</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref> shows the results of the processing of three data sets with added ice background, derived from exposure-filtered sums of 38 frames, as well as unfiltered sums of the first 9 and 14 frames (total exposures of 12.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, 19.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, respectively). Unlike the reconstruction calculated from the exposure-filtered original data (see above), the reconstruction calculated form the exposure-filtered images with added noise displays a significantly improved FSC curve compared with the other two noise-added data sets. To test if the improved resolution with exposure filtering is due to the improved alignment of the images, we also calculated reconstructions from the noise-added data sets with total exposures of 12.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>, 19.6 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> using the alignment parameters obtained from the exposure-filtered data. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, this parameter replacement increases the resolution for the two unfiltered reconstructions to that of the filtered reconstruction, similar to the results obtained for the original data sets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>. The superior resolution of the exposure-filtered reconstruction is therefore due to more accurate particle alignments. High-quality data sets of smaller particles (about 300 kDa or less) collected using 50 to 100 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> exposures are currently not available to demonstrate the improved particle alignment more directly with experimental data. However, the alignment accuracy of these particles is expected to be limited by weaker contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Henderson, 1995</xref>), and we expect improvements similar to those seen in our simulation when using exposures that significantly exceed the optimal exposure and applying the exposure filter described here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The optimal exposure curve we determined should correct well for radiation damage to the specimen, which has a substantial effect on the relative signal content of individual movie frames, in particular the later frames. As discussed earlier, the other major source of frame-dependent signal change is motion of the specimen, which tends to degrade the signal of earlier frames. For optimal filtering of the data, movement should also be included in the filtering, as should any other effects that change the relative signal in different frames. Currently, the exposure filter does not take movement into account and so will not filter the initial frames optimally. We plan to incorporate movement in a future version of the algorithm.</p><p>An alternative method for frame filtering has recently been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Scheres, 2014</xref>). This methodology uses the data set itself to estimate per frame weights based on fitting relative B-factors to reconstructions from individual frames. Although this is an elegant solution, which in the best case handles weighting of both radiation damage and movement, filtering with the exposure curve described in this paper should offer a number of advantages, at least in terms of filtering radiation damage. First, our filter can be applied at the beginning of processing without assessing the data, and thus, can help in the initial steps of picking particles and finding initial alignment and orientation parameters. Indeed, one could use the two methods in combination, by using the exposure filter described here for the initial refinement, then when a good quality reconstruction has been obtained, using frame filtering based directly on the data. Second, for some data, the estimate for the B-factor to be applied to each frame may be quite noisy and may lead to error, a problem, which is likely to be exacerbated with smaller data sets. Furthermore, accurate estimation of the B-factor relies on high-frequency signal and will thus fail on intermediate- and low-resolution structures. Third, even in situations in which a B-factor can be estimated, it is unclear how well a B-factor estimated using a specific resolution range will describe signal degradation due to radiation damage outside that range. In contrast, our calculated optimal exposure curve describes experimentally determined values at a wide range of resolutions. The tests carried out with the previously published 20S proteasome data (see above) show that the filtering is indeed close to optimal, not only for rotavirus DLP but also for smaller and less symmetrical particles, and that its performance matches that of B-factor weighting. Finally, exposure filtering can also be applied when B-factors are difficult to determine, such as in electron tomography. Using the filter described here, images collected at different specimen tilts can be filtered to optimize the final SNR and resolution in a tomogram. While a similar filtering could also be achieved using B-factors, the relatively low resolution of a tomogram and the presence of structural heterogeneity would likely prevent the determination of appropriate B-factors.</p><p>The results we present here indicate that the electron exposures commonly used in cryo-EM experiments (∼10–20 e<sup>−</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>) should be increased to obtain optimal image contrast. By using a considerably larger total exposure, the SNR of the images at intermediate and low resolutions will be increased, leading to greater accuracy in particle alignment and orientation determination in cases where the accuracy is limited by the signal, which will in turn lead to better reconstructions. This should especially be true for smaller particles where alignment errors can severely limit the attainable resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Henderson et al., 2011</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Specimen preparation</title><p>Rotavirus DLPs were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Street et al., 1982</xref>).

Unblur is stand-alone software available for download from the Grigorieff lab web page (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/unblur">http://grigoriefflab.janelia.org/unblur</ext-link>) and is based on iterative alignments of each raw frame to the current best total sum of all other frames, leaving the frame which is currently being aligned out of the total sum to avoid the frame ‘finding itself’ in the sum. After each iteration, a spline is fit to both the X and Y shifts to reduce sensitivity to noise. Frame sums can be filtered according to the described exposure filter, or the filtering step can be skipped.

Filtered amplitude spectra were calculated for each particle and were used to estimate the defocus and astigmatism values on a per-particle basis using the FindCTF program of the TIGRIS package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tigris.sourceforge.net/">http://tigris.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>). TIGRIS consists of a set of programs for single-particle image analysis, including algorithms for CTF determination and correction, image alignment and classification, 3D reconstruction and a fully-featured display. FindCTF attempts to determine the optimal defocus parameters by maximizing the correlation between an amplitude spectra and a theoretical CTF, first performing a brute-force parameter search followed by downhill simplex optimization.

An initial model was calculated from a single DLP image using Angular-Reconstitution in the IMAGIC package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">van Heel et al., 1996</xref>). Initial parameters were obtained on images resampled to 8 Å per pixel via Fourier cropping, which were aligned to the initial model with the brute force alignment program of the TIGRIS package. This alignment finds the highest cross-correlation peak across a specified set of in-plane rotations (in this case every 1°) of reference projections (in this case projections of the model sampled at every 5°). These parameters were further refined using Frealign v9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lyumkis et al., 2013</xref>) using data sampled at 1.023 Å per pixel, and using information between 200 Å and 15 Å.</p><p>In order to increase the signal present in the raw frames, 3-frame sums of the motion corrected particles were calculated, and these sub-sums were individually refined using Frealign again using data between 200 Å and 15 Å.

Frealign outputs two half map reconstructions used for calculating an FSC curve.

Your Tools and Resources article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Wes Sundquist (Reviewing editor); Janet Vonck (peer reviewer) and John Rubinstein (peer reviewer). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Grant and Grigorieff describe an exciting next step in the recent spectacular series of cryo-EM maps from direct electron detector data, with a reconstruction of the rotavirus VP6 protein at a resolution of 2.6 Å from 4000 virus particles, using both the icosahedral symmetry and the 13-fold non-icosahedral symmetry (more than three million asymmetric units). The large size of the particles made it possible to analyse individual movie frames, and a 130-frame, 100 e-/Å2 data set was used to assess the effects of radiation damage. The authors conclude that optimal doses for EM maps at low and intermediate resolutions are much higher than the 10-20 e-/Å2 determined previously using crystalline samples, for example with a pre-exposure of 50 e-/Å2 a map at better than 6 Å resolution could be obtained. The authors speculate that the loss of long-range order in the crystalline samples may have played a role. Making use of the fact that the rotavirus particles can be aligned well from very short exposures (they use the average of 3 frames) they devise a filtering scheme for the data based on the resolution-dependent SNR fall-off as a function of exposure, and show that using this scheme a 2.6 Å reconstruction can be done from the full 130-frame dataset that is indistinguishable from the best reconstruction using unweighted frames 4-21 only. The dose filtering scheme has been integrated in a new program for frame alignment.</p><p>The presented data are beautiful, the paper is clear and well-written, the work provides welcome additions to the growing toolbox available to the still young field of cryo-EM by direct electron detectors. Overall, this is an excellent paper of high value and high interest to the scientific community.</p><p>Significant issue that the authors must address</p><p>1) The dose optimized weighting scheme applied to the entire movies (frames 4-130) produces exactly the same resolution as when using a much smaller subset of the data (frames 4-21) determined by manually searching for the ideal dose fractionation set of frames. While it is convenient to be able to avoid the tedious manual search, it is a harder sell to justify acquiring 5x the number of frames (all needing storage and processing etc.) to get to the same resolution. The authors are no doubt aware of this—but ought to address it directly in the paper—and thus base the justification for the high dose acquisition and weighting scheme on the proposition that this will have a much more important impact on smaller particles. This could then justify the pain of acquiring many more frames but this remains to be proved. Can the authors use one of the publicly available datasets to prove this proposition (e.g. the raw movie frames and other metadata of the proteasome dataset, which goes to 2.8A resolution, are available on EMPIAR)? If the authors decide this is too much work then the emphasis on this point should be reduced, and the authors should modify the statement that the major impact of the paper is enabling SPEM on smaller particles (as this is not yet shown). Instead, the authors could choose to place more emphasis on the extraordinarily high resolution of the reconstruction that has been achieved here. This might involve including some discussion on how the data was obtained and what methods were used to reach the exceptionally higher resolution.</p><p>Other issues that the authors should address:</p><p>1) The authors base their analysis of radiation damage on SNR values calculated from the FSC. Is this really equivalent to the critical exposure (<italic>N</italic><sub><italic>e</italic></sub>) values measured by following the fading of the calculated diffraction spots from 2D crystals? (The answer may indeed be yes, but a little justification is needed).</p><p>2) The authors convert from critical exposures to optimal exposures using the Nopt=∼2.5Ne relationship from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser (1979)</xref>. This ratio is based on a rather complex derivation and several assumptions. The authors should justify its use here, showing or explaining how it still applies to the Ne values measured from SNRs and the FSC.</p><p>3) The dose filtering was tested on the same data that was used to derive the critical dose curve. However, the authors speculate that the rotavirus with 780 copies of VP6 may to some extent be affected by some loss of long-range order as a function of dose like the 2D crystal samples. If this is the case, their dose curve would overestimate the radiation sensitivity of smaller complexes. This issue should be discussed.</p><p>4) The details of the new program Unblur are vague.

This might involve including some discussion on how the data was obtained and what methods were used to reach the exceptionally higher resolution</italic>.</p><p>We toned down our statement that the high-exposure technique described here will benefit smaller particles. In addition, we have applied the exposure filter to the recently published proteasome data as suggested by the reviewers, and we also tested its performance in a situation where the alignment accuracy is significantly limited by the strength of the signal present in the images. For the latter, we added to the proteasome images background noise that was extracted from the proteasome micrographs. The resulting images should therefore resemble particle images with about half of the original SNR, similar to what would be expected from a smaller particle of between 175 – 350 kDa mass. In this test, the reconstruction calculated from the exposure-filtered images (with appropriate ice background added) exhibit a significantly higher resolution than reconstructions of non-filtered images with added ice background. We show that the resolution difference is due to different accuracies in the alignment. We describe the results in two new sections: “Application of the exposure filter to 20S proteasome” and “Improved alignment when signal is limiting”.</p><p><italic>Other issues that the authors should address</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) The authors base their analysis of radiation damage on SNR values calculated from the FSC. Is this really equivalent to the critical exposure (</italic>N<sub>e</sub><italic>) values measured by following the fading of the calculated diffraction spots from 2D crystals? (The answer may indeed be yes, but a little justification is needed)</italic>.</p><p>The critical exposure values describe the exponential decay of the diffraction intensities obtained from a crystal. When non-crystalline sample (i.e. single particles) are used, diffraction intensities are replaced by intensities calculated from the Fourier transforms of the images. As explained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hayward and Glaeser (1979)</xref>, the fading intensities reduce the SNR present in the affected diffraction spots. The same will be true for the intensities derived from the image Fourier transforms. The SNR is defined as the ratio of the intensity of the spot/squared Fourier amplitude (signal) and variance (noise) of the intensity due to the stochastic events of incident electrons forming the diffraction pattern/image. The magnitude of the intensity variance is determined by the number of electrons contributing to an exposure. When the exposure is evenly divided into frames of a movie as described here, each frame receives the same number of electrons and therefore, the variance of the intensities will remain constant from frame to frame. The fading of intensities is therefore directly proportional to the reduction of SNR. As explained in the manuscript, instead of following the intensities in Fourier transforms, the SNR can also be calculated from the FSC, making it equivalent to the measurement of fading diffraction intensities. We have added additional justification to the manuscript (Introduction section).</p><p><italic>2) The authors convert from critical exposures to optimal exposures using the Nopt=∼2.5Ne relationship from</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18"><italic>Hayward and Glaeser (1979)</italic></xref><italic>.

We now point this out in the text in the Introduction section.</p><p><italic>3) The dose filtering was tested on the same data that was used to derive the critical dose curve. However, the authors speculate that the rotavirus with 780 copies of VP6 may to some extent be affected by some loss of long-range order as a function of dose like the 2D crystal samples. If this is the case, their dose curve would overestimate the radiation sensitivity of smaller complexes. This issue should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We already state in the subsection “Critical exposure curve” that if the radiation damage causes disorder in the icosahedral lattice in addition to the damage of the protein, our critical dose measurements will underestimate the critical dose for a smaller, less symmetrical particles. The main parameter to consider here is the size of the object. Larger objects will be more strongly affected by small distortions as these can add up across large distances to large shifts of subunits. We have now added a discussion of differences between rotavirus DLP and crystals, including how likely either sample is affected by long-range disorder. Furthermore, we have added in the Discussion that there may be other factors affecting the critical dose measurements, for example the presence of nucleic acids (RNA in the case of rotavirus DLP), buffer conditions and particle density.</p><p><italic>4) The details of the new program Unblur are vague. Is it available? Is it stand-alone or part of a package? Is the dose filtering optional and (in light of the previous comment) are the values hard-wired? It is important to add this information so the new program can be tested by the community</italic>.</p><p>The new program Unblur is already available upon request and will be posted on the Grigorieff lab web page upon publication of this work. It is a stand-along program that uses the optimal filter described here, using a hard-wired critical dose function. If new and improved critical dose measurements should become available it will be trivial to update this function. Additional information about Unblur is now included in the manuscript (section “Image processing”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
