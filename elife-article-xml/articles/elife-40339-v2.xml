<italic>pfhrp2/pfhrp3</italic> gene deletions since the first observation of <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites in 2012. In a previous study (Watson et al., 2017), we characterised the drivers selecting for <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions and mapped the regions in Africa with the greatest selection pressure. In February 2018, the World Health Organization issued guidance on investigating suspected false-negative rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions. However, no guidance is provided regarding the timing of investigations. Failure to consider seasonal variation could cause premature decisions to switch to alternative RDTs. In response, we have extended our methods and predict that the prevalence of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is highest when sampling from younger individuals during the beginning of the rainy season. We conclude by producing a map of the regions impacted by seasonal fluctuations in <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions and a database identifying optimum sampling intervals to support malaria control programmes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>radid diagnostic tests</kwd><kwd>pfhrp2-deletion</kwd><kwd>mapping</kwd><kwd>mathematical modelling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>P. falciparum</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>109312/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Watson</surname><given-names>Oliver John</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N01507X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verity</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000278</institution-id><institution>Department for International Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ghani</surname><given-names>Azra C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Garske</surname><given-names>Tini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI132547</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meshnick</surname><given-names>Steven R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>American Society for Tropical Medicine and Hygiene</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Burroughs Wellcome Fund-ASTMH Postdoctoral Fellowship in Tropical Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parr</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Burroughs Wellcome Fund-ASTMH Postdoctoral Fellowship in Tropical Infectious Diseases</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Parr</surname><given-names>Jonathan B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000761</institution-id><institution>Imperial College London</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Slater</surname><given-names>Hannah C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The timing of surveillance for <italic>pfhrp2/3-</italic>deletions within a transmission season impacts estimates of the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to deletions, which may cause premature decisions to change RDT.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Diagnostic testing of suspected malaria cases has more than doubled in the last 15 years, with 75% of suspected cases seeking treatment from the public health sector receiving a diagnostic test in 2017Â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">World Health Organization, 2018a</xref>). Much of this progress reflects the increased distribution of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs), with the most commonly used RDTs targeting the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> protein HRP2 (PfHRP2). In 2014, a review of published reports of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions was conducted and included a critical assessment of the comprehensiveness of the diagnostic investigation. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2014</xref>). The findings of this review highlighted a need for a harmonized approach to investigating and confirming or excluding <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions and called for further studies to determine the prevalence and impact of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions. Since that review, false-negative RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions have been reported in 10 countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">World Health Organization, 2018b</xref>). The frequency of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions varies across SSA, with the highest burden observed in Eritrea where 80.8% of samples from Ghindae Hospital were both <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>negative and <italic>pfhrp3-</italic>negative in 2016 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berhane et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Mathematical modelling has predicted that the continued use of only PfHRP2 RDTs will quickly select for parasites without the <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gatton et al., 2017</xref>). This selection pressure occurs due to the misdiagnosis of infections caused by parasites lacking the <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene, which will subsequently contribute more towards onwards transmission than wild-type parasites that are correctly diagnosed due to the expression of <italic>pfhrp2.</italic> In 2017, we conducted an analysis of the drivers of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletion selection, identifying the administrative regions in SSA with the greatest potential for selecting for <italic>pfhrp2-deleted</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). The regions identified were areas with both a low prevalence of malaria and a high frequency of people seeking treatment and being treated on the basis of PfHRP2-based RDT diagnosis. The precise strength of selection, however, is not known, with other factors such as the rate of non-malarial fevers and non-adherence to RDT outcomes likely to impact the number of misdiagnosed cases receiving treatment.</p><p>In February 2018, the World Health OrganizationÂ (WHO) issued guidance for national malaria control programmes on how to investigate suspected false-negative RDTs with an emphasis on <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">World Health Organization, 2018c</xref>).

national change to non PfHRP2-based RDTs should be made if the estimated proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is above 5%. If the estimated proportion is less than 5% the country is recommended to establish a monitoring scheme whereby the study is repeated in two years if the 95% confidence interval does not include 5%, or one year if it does include 5%. The 5% threshold approximates the point at which the number of cases missed due to false-negative PfHRP2-based RDTs caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions may become greater than the number of cases that would be missed due to the decreased sensitivity of non PfHRP2-based RDTs. The guidance also specifies a sampling scheme to be used when estimating the prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions. Samples are to be collected from at least 10 health facilities per province to be tested, with sampling focussed on symptomatic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> patients presenting at the health facilities. All samplings are to be ideally completed within an 8-week period.</p><p>The 8-week interval permits for a rapid turnaround and allows for efficient investigations and policy responses. However, the timing of the 8-week interval chosen within a transmission season is important. The chosen interval could lead to estimates of the proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions that are not representative of the annual average proportion. Subsequently, any recorded estimate may not be predictive of the number of cases that may be misdiagnosed due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions in the years between sampling intervals. For example, an overestimation of the annual average proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions could result in a switch to a less sensitive RDT, resulting in an increase in the number of malaria cases misdiagnosed if the annual average proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is less than 5%. The alternative RDT may also be both more expensive and complicated to implement. Similarly, an underestimation of the annual average proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions would result in continued use of an overall less effective test and could provide <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deleted parasite populations an opportunity to expand.</p><p>In response to these concerns, we extended our original methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Watson et al., 2017</xref>) to characterise the impact of seasonal variations in transmission intensity on the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deleted parasites. We present an extended version of our previous model, which predicts that more false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions are observed when monoclonal infections are more prevalent, with the highest proportion observed when sampling from younger children at the start of the rainy season. We continue to assess how samples collected within an 8-week interval can both over- and underestimate this proportion when compared to the annual average, which reflects the monitoring scheme recommended by the WHO for follow up studies if the outcomes of the original study are inconclusive. Lastly, we map the administrative regions in SSA with the greatest potential for estimates of the proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due <italic>to pfhrp2</italic> deletions to be not predictive of the annual average. In addition, we identify the optimum sampling intervals for each level one administrative region, which are most representative of the annual average.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Using our model, we first explored how the proportion of clinical cases only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites varies throughout a transmission season. We recorded the proportion of clinical cases that are PfHRP2-negative in four settings (a low and moderate transmission setting with both a low and highly seasonal transmission dynamic), which had a starting <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion frequency of 6%. 6% was chosen to reflect our previously estimated frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions prior to the introduction of RDTs in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Watson et al., 2017</xref>). We initially assumed that the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions was not increasing over time before considering scenarios in which the selective pressure for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions causes an increase in the population frequency of <italic>phrp2</italic> deletions. This decision allowed for the impact of seasonality on the proportion of clinical cases that are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative to be isolated, before allowing comparisons to scenarios in which the proportion of clinical cases that are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative is increasing also due to changes in the population frequency of <italic>phrp2</italic> deletions.</p><p>Our predictions suggest that the misdiagnosis of clinical cases due to <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>negative RDT results is heavily dependent on transmission intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). For the same population frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1QâT</xref>), the observed proportion of clinical cases that are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative is predicted to be higher in lower transmission settings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1IâP</xref>). The annual average proportion of clinical cases that are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative was equal to 5% and 3.25% in the low and moderate transmission setting, respectively. This observation is attributable to the lower rate of superinfection in low transmission settings. The lower rate of superinfection reduces the number of polyclonal infections and increases the chance that an individual is only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

During the rainy season, the observed proportion of cases expected to yield a false-negative RDT due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites (PfHRP2-negative) falls, with the lowest proportion observed after the end of the rainy season. These dynamics are more pronounced in highly seasonal transmission regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B, F, J, N, R, D, H, L, P and T</xref>). In the highly seasonal settings, the observed proportion of clinical cases that are PfHRP2-negative is predicted to fluctuate above and below the 5% threshold for switching RDT provided by the WHO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J, L, N and P</xref>).

In a moderate transmission setting, a clear seasonal pattern is predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), with sampling at the beginning of the transmission seasons resulting in significant overestimation of the annual average proportion of false-negative RDTs. Subsequently, sampling at the end of the rainy season is predicted to yield estimates that are most representative of the annual average. In comparison, surveillance in regions with low seasonality is predicted to yield estimates representative of the annual average throughout the transmission season (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and D</xref>). In all settings, using a sampling scheme spanning the entire transmission season produced estimates that accurately estimated the annual average. A moderate increase in the proportion of false-negative RDTs is also predicted when sampling younger individuals, with the same patterns also seen within asymptomatic individuals. This observation reflects the increased probability that children younger than 5 years old yield symptoms after the first infection, due to their comparatively lower acquired clinical immunity.

These findings highlight the impact of both the seasonal timing and the age of individuals sampled when estimating the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. Policy decisions based on the proportion of clinical cases presenting with false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions should thus be made with an awareness of the seasonal transmission dynamics of the region considered.</p><p>Our modelling predicted that there would be increased observation of false-negative HRP2 RDT results after periods of lower transmission and within younger individuals. This prediction is consistent with a large, nationally representative survey of <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>negative samples among asymptomatic subjects in the DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Parr et al., 2017</xref>). These predictions are also in agreement with other observations from Dioro in the SÃ©gou region of Mali, where in 2012 more than 80% of smear-positive individuals had false-negative RDTs when collected at the end of the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Koita et al., 2013</xref>). The proportion of false-negative RDTs then rapidly decreased to 20% within 3â4 weeks after the start of the rainy season. It is, however, likely that a proportion of these false-negative RDTs were due to the increased observation of lower parasitaemia at lower transmission intensities such as at the end of the dry season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Okell et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, findings from Eritrea also support our model-predicted outcomes. Eritrea is a region with lower malaria prevalence compared to the SÃ©gou region of Mali. The resultant decrease in transmission intensity is likely to result in an increased proportion of monoclonal infections throughout the transmission season. Consequently, we would predict less variability in the number of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions at any given period within a transmission season. We also expect the observed prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions to be more stochastic due to the lower effective population size of the parasite. Indeed, infections due to <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deleted parasites identified in Eritrea between November 2013 and November 2014 were not more likely to have occurred after periods of lower transmission intensity (p=0.56, n=144, pfhrp2 deletions at 9.7%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Menegon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Similar to the original publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Watson et al., 2017</xref>), there are a number of modelling assumptions in this study. Firstly, there are modelling uncertainties when predicting the dynamics of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites. To account for this uncertainty in this analysis, we have controlled for the drivers characterised in our earlier study by assuming there was no selective advantage associated with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites and recording the number of individuals who would have been <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative and subsequently misdiagnosed. The absence of a selective advantage in this way enabled the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions to remain constant, which ensured that any observed dynamics in the estimates of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions were due to the seasonality of transmission and not due to an increase in the population frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. However, we are aware that there is likely a selective advantage for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites and subsequently we repeated the analyses with the selective advantage included. In these simulations, we predicted a substantial increase in the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2Q-T</xref>), however clear seasonal dynamics, with an increased proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions at the beginning of the transmission season, were still observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). However, the observed dynamics were less clear in settings with the greatest increase in the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, we assessed the potential for a region to yield unrepresentative estimates of the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions through comparisons to the annual average proportion. This decision reflected firstly the monitoring period defined in the WHO technical guidance, with follow-up studies recommended after two years if the 95% CI for the proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is less than 5%, or one year if it does include 5%. It also reflected our modelling assumption that the population frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is not increasing over time. However, in simulations in which a selective advantage to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites was included, a comparison to the annual average proportion is less suitable. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>, because we started our simulations in January the optimum sampling interval is simply the interval in the middle of the year, reflecting the constant increase in <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites. In these scenarios, it could be argued that the correct comparison would be to the average proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions in the year after sampling, which reflects how many cases could be misdiagnosed between sampling rounds. Unfortunately, this comparison is difficult without knowing how the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions will change over time. However, we believe that it is more important to focus on the assumption that the strength of selection is negligible (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Our rationale for this is that it is only in areas with a low selective pressure, for which the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is constant over time, that one could repeatedly make an incorrect decision with regards to whether to switch RDT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In areas with a selective pressure, it is still possible to incorrectly estimate the annual average for the following year; however, the presence of the selective pressure is likely to cause any decision made to be simply premature as the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions and subsequently false-negative PfHRP2 RDTs will increase over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40339.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The impact of an assumed selective pressure for <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic>-deleted parasites on the decision to switch RDT.</title><p>The graphs show two hypothetical scenarios with two different regions shown in red and blue for each region. In (<bold>A</bold>) there are strong seasonal dynamics but no selective pressure. The absence of a selective pressure causes that the mean proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions over a 1 year period to be constant and is shown with a horizontal dashed line. Consequently, there are time periods in which an incorrect decision to switch RDT could be made for the region in blue, and an incorrect decision to not switch RDT could be made for the region in red. In (<bold>B</bold>), there are both seasonal dynamics and a selective pressure, which results in an increasing annual mean proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions over time. As in (<bold>A</bold>), there are periods in which the observed proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is both higher and lower than the rolling mean shown. However, decisions made in these periods are premature rather than definitively incorrect as the selection pressure would eventually cause the proportion to be greater than 5%.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-40339-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Lastly, it is important to note again that the true strength of selection is unknown. The precise strength of selection is dependent on a number of factors such as the magnitude of any fitness costs associated with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion, the degree to which microscopy-based diagnosis is used, the level of non-adherence to RDT results, the treatment coverage and the prevalence of malaria in the region considered. Consequently, our results should not be interpreted as precise predictions of how unrepresentative future samples may be. They should instead be used to support surveillance efforts and to reinforce the need for longitudinal measures conducted at the same point within a transmission season. In addition, we recommend that if possible, sample collection in highly seasonal regions should not occur at the beginning of the transmission season, as this is predicted to lead to premature decisions to switch RDT irrespective of the strength of selection. It will, however, be possible after the samples have been collected to estimate the likely frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions by incorporating estimates of the multiplicity of infection within the sampled population. This frequency could then be used to estimate how the proportion of false-negative RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions could increase in response to decreases in the prevalence of malaria.</p><p>In summary, our extended model predicts that highly seasonal dynamics in malaria transmission intensity will cause comparable dynamics in the observed proportion of false-negative RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions. The observed proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is higher when monoclonal infections are more prevalent, with the highest prevalence observed when sampling at the start of the rainy season as individuals are less likely to already be infected. Similarly, the observed proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is higher in younger individuals who have lower clinical immunity, as they are more likely to present with clinical symptoms after their first infection event. As the rainy season progresses, individuals are more likely to be superinfected and acquire wild-type parasites, resulting in positive PfHRP2-based RDT results and a decrease in the observed proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. In response to these dynamics, it may be sensible for national malaria control programmes conducting surveillance for <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions to choose a sampling interval towards the end of the transmission season, which is predicted to be most representative of the annual average proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. To support surveillance efforts, we have published an online database detailing the optimum sampling interval as well as the fluctuations throughout the transmission season for each administrative region.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Extensions to the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission model</title><p>In our previous publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Watson et al., 2017</xref>), we presented an extended version of an individual-based model of malaria transmission to characterise the key drivers of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion selection; however, it did not capture seasonality. To address this, we incorporated seasonal variation in malaria transmission intensity through the inclusion of seasonal curves fitted to daily rainfall data available from the US Climate Prediction Center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">National Weather Service Climate Prediction Center, 2010</xref>). Rainfall data was available at a 10 Ã 10 km spatial resolution from 2002 to 2009, with data missing for only two days. The data was subsequently aggregated to a series of 64 points per year, before Fourier analysis was conducted to capture the seasonal dynamics within this time period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cairns et al., 2012</xref>). The first three frequencies of the resultant Fourier transformed data were used to generate a normalised seasonal curve.

This proportion was summarised at 12 8-week intervals, thatÂ is January â March, February â April, December â February. This proportion was recorded in both high and low seasonality settings, characterised by a Markham Seasonality Index = 80% and 10%, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cairns et al., 2015</xref>). These settings were examined at both low and moderate transmission intensity (EIR = 1 and 10 respectively), with the starting proportion of <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deleted parasites in the whole population set equal to 6% in agreement with previous observations of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions in the DRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Watson et al., 2017</xref>) The proportion of symptomatic cases seeking treatment was assumed to be 40% (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>Â = 0.4). In all simulations, 10 stochastic realisations of 100,000 individuals were simulated for 60 years to reach equilibrium first, before setting the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. Initially, we assumed there was no assumed fitness cost or selective advantage associated with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletion. This was modelled by assuming that individuals who are only infected with parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions will still be treated. This decision allowed us to control for selection within our investigation by ensuring that the changes observed in the observation of PfHRP2-negative clinical cases are only due to seasonal variation in transmission intensity, and not due to an increase in the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions due to the selective advantage by evading diagnosis. As a result, when reporting the proportion of clinical cases that were misdiagnosed resulting from a false-negative PfHPR2-negative RDT we are reporting the proportion of cases that are infected with only <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deleted parasites, thatÂ is individuals who would have been <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative and subsequently misdiagnosed. We also assume that 25% of individuals who are only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites will still be <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>positive due to the cross reactivity of PfHRP3 epitopes causing a positive PfHRP2-based RDT result (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Model predictions were subsequently compared to data collected from the Democratic Republic of Congo as part of their 2013â2014 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS). In overview, 7137 blood samples were collected from children under the age of 5 years old, which yielded 2752 children diagnosed with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> infection by real-time PCR targeting the lactate dehydrogenase (<italic>pfldh</italic>) gene. The RDT barcodes for the 2752 samples were identified and matched to the DHS survey to identify both the age of the children and the date of sample collection. The collection date was used to predict the mean clinical incidence from the previous 30 days for each sample. This was estimated using the deterministic implementation of our model fitted to the observed PCR prevalence of malaria from the DRC DHS 2013â2014 survey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Meshnick et al., 2013</xref>), incorporating the seasonality and treatment coverage for each province. Children who were younger than the median age in the 2752 samples were grouped within a younger category. In addition, samples were classified as lower transmission if the clinical incidence of malaria in the month prior to sample collection was lower than the median clinical incidence. The counts of <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative samples within each group were subsequently compared using the Pearson chi-squared test with Rao-Scott corrections to account for the hierarchal survey design implemented within DHS surveys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Jnk and Scott, 1984</xref>). Pearson chi-squared tests were used in a similar analysis that was conducted using samples collected from the Gash-Barka and Debug regions in Eritrea between 2013 and 2014, for which the dates of sample collection were made available to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Menegon et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Finally, the seasonal profiles for 598 first-level administrative regions across sub-Saharan Africa were used to characterise the potential for estimates of the proportion of false-negative PfHRP2 RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions to be unrepresentative of the annual average. For each region, 100 simulation repetitions were conducted for 60 years to reach equilibrium first before fitting the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions in each simulation such that the annual average proportion of false-negative RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is equal to 5%. Each repetition was subsequently simulated for two further years, with 7300 individuals seeking treatment sampled from each 8-week interval. This number approximates the recommended sample size within the WHO protocol for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion prevalence at 5 Â± 0.5%. For each sample, the proportion of false-negative PfHRP2-based RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions was recorded. For each sample, a binomial confidence interval was calculated and the resultant percentage of intervals that did not include the annual prevalence of 5% was calculated. For each region, the number of 8-week intervals for which a premature decision to either swap from a PfHRP2-based RDT or continue using a PfHRP2-based RDT was made in more than 75% of simulations was recorded and mapped. The raw results of this analysis were subsequently used to create a database that details the optimum sampling intervals for estimating the annual proportion of false-negative RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Dr Michela Menegon for sharing the sample dates for the 2013â2014 study in Eritrea and the administrators and participants of the Demographic and Health Surveys.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writingâoriginal draft, Project administration, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Supervision, Visualization, Methodology, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Software, Methodology, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Methodology, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Resources, Formal analysis, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Methodology, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writingâreview and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40339.010</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Simulation model pseudocode.</title><p>Mathematical style pseudocode description of the simulation model.</p></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-40339-supp1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40339.011</object-id><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-40339-transrepform-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated are provided within the online database, hosted through a shiny application at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ojwatson.shinyapps.io/seasonal_hrp2/">https://ojwatson.shinyapps.io/seasonal_hrp2/</ext-link>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The impact of seasonal variations in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria transmission on the surveillance of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Ben Cooper as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Prabhat Jha as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Elena GÃ³mez-DÃ­az (Reviewer #2); Penelope Anne Lynch (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This research represents a research advance which builds on a previous paper by the same group which considered the selection pressure exerted by the widespread use of rapid diagnostic tests for malaria in sub-Saharan Africa for deletions to the <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene, which can lead to false negative test results. Subsequent to the previous publication, the World Health Organization has produced guidance for the investigation of suspected false-negative diagnostic test results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions. However, this guidance says nothing about the recommended timing of such investigations. The current work uses an extension of the model-based analysis to show that seasonal variation in malaria transmission can lead to substantial biases in estimates of the prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions, leading to poor choices of rapid diagnostic test. The risk of this sampling bias is mapped by region, and optimum sampling intervals are proposed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All reviewers thought that the work was important and conducted to a high standard and should be published if some essential revisions are made. These revisions are needed primarily to improve the clarity of the work and in some cases to extend the Discussion to consider other factors that might be important (see individual reviews below). Comments marked with a * below should be considered discretionary revisions. In particular, though non-essential, it was felt that an additional figure might help to clarify the relationship between monoclonal/multiclonal infections and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions prevalence and selection. An important part of these clarifications is provision of pseudo code for the revised model, just to document exactly how the updated DDEs shown in the manuscript are incorporated into the simulation model.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The seems to be a useful research advance that addresses an important policy question using a model described in a previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper. The work is well-motivated and clearly described.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is an a research advance upon a previous study Watson et al., 2017.</p><p>In the previous article, authors modeled the potential for RDT-led diagnosis to drive selection of <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites. In the present work, authors extend the model so it now considers the impact of transmission intensity and seasonality on the prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions. They found that regions with low transmissibility and high seasonality are those with higher number of false negatives (higher prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions). They also show that this bias is stronger in young children.</p><p>The article is clearly written, the figures are very illustrative, and the new data support the conclusions. The new findings are significant. The data provided represents an important resource for the community.</p><p>- The extended analysis focus on seasonality and transmission intensity. I wonder about other possible causes of RDTs misdiagnosis. For example, the work seem to focus only on the clinical cases. What is the dynamics expected for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions in the asymptomatic? This is important because asymptomatic malaria significantly impacts transmission dynamics and asymptomatic infections show seasonality.</p><p>- The study model <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions but no consideration is made about the effect of the type of treatment driving selection. There might be a temporal and spatial variability at this regards that has not been considered?</p><p>*- The link between transmission intensity and multiplicity of infections is clear. However, I find confusing the relationship between monoclonal/multiclonal infections and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions prevalence and selection. I think this should be elaborated further and possibly modeled?</p><p>- Previous studies indicated that PfHRP3 may play a role in the performance of PfHRP2-based RDTs. Do authors have data on <italic>pfhrp3</italic>? Apart of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions, could other sequence differences contribute to lower sensitivity of RDTs?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This paper provides novel insights into an issue of practical public health importance. The results are interesting, and deserve to be disseminated and understood. In order to achieve this fully, the paper would benefit from greater clarity in some areas. Elements of the story which are perhaps viewed as self-evident by the authors may not be self-evident to readers, and are key to interpreting the paper and its results.</p><p>This paper adds seasonal variation to an individual-based model simulating prevalence of <italic>pfhpr2</italic>-del strains and false negative results in a population over time,. I have not attempted to check the original model, but the amendment shown in the current paper seems correct. Could the authors provide an updated version of the pseudo-code documentation reflecting the updates?</p><p>WHO guidelines recommend a transition from HPR2-based RDTs to alternatives when the prevalence of false-negatives due to <italic>pfhpr2</italic> deletion exceeds 5%, and specify survey protocols to test for this. This paper focusses on potential biases in the survey results arising from variation due to effects of seasonality and transmission intensity. Since it is central to the paper's premise, a brief explanation of the WHO survey protocol is needed, with an explicit explanation of the links between the simulation outputs and the values measured in the protocol. I think the relevant values are all present in the paper, but their meaning and relationships could be more clearly explained.</p><p>Can the authors clarify the basis on which the 5% threshold value was selected by WHO? The bias discussed in the paper may have different implications depending on whether the key comparator is the underlying prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions or the annual average proportion of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic>-del false negatives. Is there any potential to add some discussion about the implications of this study for the WHO threshold value, for example whether specific values could be specified for particular seasonality and transmission-intensity contexts?</p><p>The text regarding assumptions about selection and fitness (copied below) is confusing. False negative RDTs and consequent treatment choices reflected in the model will inherently exert selection, which seems to conflict with statements in the text.</p><p>'Additionally, there was no assumed fitness cost or selective advantage associated with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletion, i.e. individuals who are only infected with parasites with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions are assumed to yield a false-negative RDT result. This decision allowed us to control for selection within our investigation. This ensures that the dynamics observed are only due to seasonal variation in transmission intensity, and not due to an increase in the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions due to a selective advantage by evading diagnosis. As a result, when reporting individuals who are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative we assume that 25% of individuals who are only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites will still be <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-positive due to the cross reactivity of PfHRP3 epitopes causing a positive PfHRP2-based RDT result.'</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Impact of seasonal variations in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> malaria transmission on the surveillance of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Prabhat Jha as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you know, there was some confusion in this paper, as the original submission indicated that model did account for selection for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> mutants, but the subsequent correspondence indicated that the model didn't.</p><p>While we understand that there is some value in considering the situation where the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is not affected by selective forces (i.e. delayed treatment), clearly selective forces are likely to be acting in most settings and following consultation the consensus was that completely removing this real-world effect from the model was hard to justify. Therefore in addition to the analysis that has been done, the authors should add additional work where they do what they originally said they had done i.e. including a model where there is a selective advantage for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion changes/mutants as originally indicated.</p><p>The authors appear to be assuming that the intended meaning of the 5% threshold is the average proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions, during a given year. The Discussion and conclusion then focus on differences between the prevalence of false negatives at specific timepoints during a year vs the average prevalence value over the year. It would hugely improve the clarity of the paper to state this assumption explicitly and early in the text. It is also necessary to demonstrate using information in the WHO documentation that this is in fact the intended definition of the WHO 5% threshold. Without unequivocal evidence that this is the precise meaning of the threshold value intended by the WHO, then the use of terms such as 'bias', 'overestimate', 'underestimate' etc. is unjustified throughout.</p><p>If it is not clear that the threshold is defined as an annual average, then the paper's message needs to change slightly. By indicating the extent to which the prevalence of false negatives can vary seasonally, even when the prevalence of gene deletions is constant, the results presented here indicate that a conscious choice about this aspect of the definition is very important. Should the threshold represent the acceptable maximum prevalence of false positives, or should it be the annual average. In either case, the results can inform strategies for applying the protocol in ways most likely to identify the required value.</p><p>Because of the extensive nature of the requested revisions and clarifications which cannot easily be summarized, more extensive comments from both reviewers are appended below. All substantive points should be addressed satisfactorily as we are unable to extend the review process beyond this next revision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript has improved and authors addressed most of my comments satisfactorily. I have however a few additional comments on the revised manuscript and rebuttal letter which I feel would require additional clarification.</p><p>- Exceptionally unhelpfully, the use of &quot;false-negative&quot; should be &quot;positive&quot; here. We carried out all our simulations with the assumption that individuals who are only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deleted parasites will still be treated. As such, the gene deleted parasites behave exactly the same as the wild type parasites.</p><p>I am afraid I don't fully follow this reasoning. My understanding is that the motivation of the study was that <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deleted parasites could be indeed misdiagnosed and so simulations should treat them as false negatives (Introduction, second paragraph). If simulations threat those as positive, how could the model effectively estimate the rate of misdiagnosis and the seasonality in such estimate? May I have missed something?</p><p>Besides, I don't think that the reviewers have actually addressed the real concern that came with their original consideration that false negative RTD <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites would allow them to control for selection.</p><p>- Related to the same issue above, and in response to my comment, authors replied:</p><p>&quot;We do not include a selective advantage to <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletion (apologies again for the error mentioned at the beginning of our response) and so we would not expect there to see a temporal variability in the selection pressure. If we did consider this then there would definitely be a temporal element, with the increase in the absolute number of people who seek treatment (we assume a constant proportion of people with a malarial fever seek treatment) during periods of higher transmission causing an increase in the prevalence of the <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletion. It was because of this reason that we decided not to model selection, so that we could exclude this effect of selection and be more confident that the dynamics seen are due to the fluctuations in individuals being only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites.&quot;</p><p>The selective advantage comes with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletion individuals being misdiagnosed and not getting treatment. If you consider those as positive you remove selection but this is not reflecting any more the reality of the situation.</p><p>- About the relationship between monoclonal/multiclonal infections and <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions prevalence and selection.</p><p>I thank the authors about including a supplementary figure, but could it be possible to clarify further the relationships in the text?, saying that the relationship is unclear is not of much help.</p><p>- About my comment &quot;The regions identified were areas with both a low prevalence of malaria and a high frequency of people seekingâ¦&quot; Were these the only factors?&quot;</p><p>To which authors responded &quot;These were the only factors we looked at within our modelling study&quot;.</p><p>I don't find this reply satisfactory. I know they modelled only those, but my comment was more a recommendation so it is acknowledged somewhere in the Introduction or the Discussion whether they could be other factors that have not been considered and have been shown or suggested to influence the misdiagnoses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The author's clarifications make sense and are helpful. However, my improved understanding of the authors' intentions and the results and conclusions presented in the paper has generated some additional questions and comments. I still feel that the paper would benefit from greater clarity.</p><p>My understanding is that the key values being considered are;</p><p>1) The proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions at a given timepoint.</p><p>2) The average proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions, during a given year.</p><p>3) The proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in a given region which have <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions.</p><p>4) The 5% threshold in the WHO guidelines.</p><p>It would be incredibly helpful if the authors could provide a precise definition for this, as the various wordings I have found so far in the WHO protocol and information note are open to interpretation regarding whether the 5% is intended to represent: a) The proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions; or b) The proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in a given region which have <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions.</p><p>Part of a full definition for this value is the assumed timing. A quick review of the WHO documentation does not immediately yield any specific information about assumed timings, an absence which would be consistent with an assumption that the rate is effectively constant through a season, or might equally mean that the relevant value is that at the time of sampling.</p><p>In the paper, the authors appear to be assuming that the intended meaning of the 5% threshold is the average proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions, during a given year (item 2 in the list above). The Discussion and conclusion then focus on differences between the prevalence of false negatives at specific timepoints during a year vs the average prevalence value over the year. It would hugely improve the clarity of the paper to state this assumption explicitly and early in the text. It is also necessary to demonstrate using information in the WHO documentation that this is in fact the intended definition of the WHO 5% threshold. Without unequivocal evidence that this is the precise meaning of the threshold value intended by the WHO, then the use of terms such as 'bias', 'overestimate', 'underestimate' etc. is unjustified throughout.</p><p>If it is not clear that the threshold is defined as an annual average, then the paper's message needs to change slightly. By indicating the extent to which the prevalence of false negatives can vary seasonally, even when the prevalence of gene deletions is constant, the results presented here indicate that a conscious choice about this aspect of the definition is very important. Should the threshold represent the acceptable maximum prevalence of false positives, or should it be the annual average. In either case, the results can inform strategies for applying the protocol in ways most likely to identify the required value.</p><p>There is also some confusion in the text between the prevalence of false positives results, and the prevalence of the gene deletion, with the text referring to change of RDT being triggered by an incorrect assessment of the prevalence of gene deletions (e.g. Introduction, fourth paragraph), suggesting that the authors may in fact be defining the threshold value as equal to value 3 in the list above.</p><p>These are key to the meaning and the implications of the work presented here, and clarity about what is being assumed or referred to is crucial to allow the text to tell its story clearly, and to make it easy to assess the consistency of that story. Confusing references to different prevalence values in the text should be reviewed and resolved wherever they arise throughout the text, including some specific instances detailed below.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Introduction, third and fourth paragraphs: In the third paragraph of the Introduction the authors give a definition of the WHO threshold value as being the prevalence of false negatives caused by <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions. However, in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction they suggest that incorrect assessment of the prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions could drive the decision to switch to non HRP2 RDTs. Is there another mechanism in the WHO guideline in addition to the 5% false negatives threshold which would drive a change of policy based on gene deletion prevalence rather than false negative RTD prevalence?</p><p>'The protocol in this guidance details how to estimate the local prevalence of false-negative PfHRP2-based RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions and recommends that a national change to non PfHRP2-based RDTs be made if the estimated prevalence is above 5%.'</p><p>'the timing of the 8-week interval chosen within a transmission season could lead to bias in the sampled prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions. An overestimation of the true prevalence of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions could result in a switch to a less sensitive RDT'</p><p>Results, first paragraph and similar elsewhere in text: 'In a moderate transmission setting, a clear seasonal pattern is predicted (Figure 2C), with sampling at the beginning of the transmission seasons resulting in significant overestimation of the true proportion of false negative RDTs..'</p><p>'true' is not adequately defined to be used here in this way. It might legitimately be assumed to mean the population prevalence of false-negative RDTs at the time of sampling.

In the present work, authors extend the model so it now considers the impact of transmission intensity and seasonality on the prevalence of pfhrp2 gene deletions. They found that regions with low transmissibility and high seasonality are those with higher number of false negatives (higher prevalence of pfhrp2 deletions). They also show that this bias is stronger in young children.</p><p>The article is clearly written, the figures are very illustrative, and the new data support the conclusions.

I wonder about other possible causes of RDTs misdiagnosis. For example, the work seem to focus only on the clinical cases. What is the dynamics expected for pfhrp2 deletions in the asymptomatic? This is important because asymptomatic malaria significantly impacts transmission dynamics and asymptomatic infections show seasonality.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that considering asymptomatic individuals is very important, especially as they are the major driver of onwards transmission. Additionally, understanding the dynamics in asymptomatics will be useful in any planned community surveillance or reactive case detection.</p><p>The focus on the clinical cases within the analysis was initially chosen so that it aligned with the population of individuals that would be sampled within the WHO protocol. However, we did also look at the dynamics within the asymptomatics when conducting the analysis for Figure 2 and found very similar patterns. This was encouraging as the data from the DRC that we used to see if our model predictions were in agreement with real data was taken from mostly asymptomatic individuals. We have included though an additional plot, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1, which looks at the mean proportion of asymptomatic infections that are:</p><p>1) Only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deleted parasites</p><p>2) Only infected with wild type parasites</p><p>3) Infected with both <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deleted and wild type parasites</p><p>This plot also considers these proportions within clinical cases as well, which will hopefully clarify a later point about the relationship between monoclonal/multiclonal infections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The study model pfhrp2 deletions but no consideration is made about the effect of the type of treatment driving selection.

We make reference to this study in the original paper, but not in this paper and so we have added this reference to the end of the first paragraph under the âCharacterising the impact of seasonal transmission intensities upon <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion prevalenceâ section of the Materials and methods.</p><p>The latter point is, however, particularly interesting as we do believe that a full deletion of the <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene is not essential in reducing the detection sensitivity of a PfHRP2-based RDT.

This paper focusses on potential biases in the survey results arising from variation due to effects of seasonality and transmission intensity. Since it is central to the paper's premise, a brief explanation of the WHO survey protocol is needed, with an explicit explanation of the links between the simulation outputs and the values measured in the protocol. I think the relevant values are all present in the paper, but their meaning and relationships could be more clearly explained.</p></disp-quote><p>The overview of the WHO survey protocol is given within the now lengthened third paragraph of the Introduction.

The bias discussed in the paper may have different implications depending on whether the key comparator is the underlying prevalence of pfhrp2/3 gene deletions or the annual average proportion of pfhrp2/3-del false negatives. Is there any potential to add some discussion about the implications of this study for the WHO threshold value, for example whether specific values could be specified for particular seasonality and transmission-intensity contexts?</p></disp-quote><p>The 5% was calculated during the design of the protocol, and represents the difference in sensitivity between the HRP2-based RDTs vs. non HRP2-based RDTS. The justification is listed as follows in the WHO technical protocol:</p><p>âA threshold of 5% was selected because it is somewhere around this point that the proportion of cases missed by HRP2 RDTs due to non-hrp2 expression may be greater than the proportion of cases that would be missed by less-sensitive pLDH- based RDTsâ</p><p>We agree, however, that there is a difference between the underlying prevalence of the gene deletion and the annual average proportion of false negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions. Ideally samples that are collected as part of the WHO protocol would also be assessed for their multiplicity of infection, and then we would also be able to work out the true deletion frequency for a given region. We could then predict at what transmission intensity that region would expect to see 5% of RDTs yielding false negatives due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions. Unfortunately this reflects a substantially larger amount of lab work given the number of samples that are likely to be collected as part of the survey as it is.</p><p>We have added some discussion about this to the end of the third paragraph of the Discussion as follows:</p><p>âIt will, however, be possible after the samples have been collected to estimate the likely frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions by incorporating estimates of the multiplicity of infection within the sampled population. This frequency could then be used to predict the bias in future estimates, as well as estimating how the prevalence of false-negative RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions will change if the prevalence of malaria changes.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The text regarding assumptions about selection and fitness (copied below) is confusing. False negative RDTs and consequent treatment choices reflected in the model will inherently exert selection, which seems to conflict with statements in the text.</p><p>'Additionally, there was no assumed fitness cost or selective advantage associated with pfhrp2 gene deletion, i.e. individuals who are only infected with parasites with pfhrp2 gene deletions are assumed to yield a false-negative RDT result This decision allowed us to control for selection within our investigation. This ensures that the dynamics observed are only due to seasonal variation in transmission intensity, and not due to an increase in the frequency of pfhrp2 gene deletions due to a selective advantage by evading diagnosis. As a result, when reporting individuals who are pfhrp2-negative we assume that 25% of individuals who are only infected with pfhrp2-deleted parasites will still be pfhrp2-positive due to the cross reactivity of PfHRP3 epitopes causing a positive PfHRP2-based RDT result.'</p></disp-quote><p>Our apologies again for this error. This has been addressed in the opening section of our response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you know, there was some confusion in this paper, as the original submission indicated that model did account for selection for pfhrp2 mutants, but the subsequent correspondence indicated that the model didn't.</p><p>While we understand that there is some value in considering the situation where the frequency of pfhrp2 deletions is not affected by selective forces (i.e. delayed treatment), clearly selective forces are likely to be acting in most settings and following consultation the consensus was that completely removing this real-world effect from the model was hard to justify. Therefore in addition to the analysis that has been done, the authors should add additional work where they do what they originally said they had done i.e. including a model where there is a selective advantage for pfhrp2 deletion changes/mutants as originally indicated.</p><p>The authors appear to be assuming that the intended meaning of the 5% threshold is the average proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, during a given year. The Discussion and conclusion then focus on differences between the prevalence of false negatives at specific timepoints during a year vs the average prevalence value over the year. It would hugely improve the clarity of the paper to state this assumption explicitly and early in the text. It is also necessary to demonstrate using information in the WHO documentation that this is in fact the intended definition of the WHO 5% threshold. Without unequivocal evidence that this is the precise meaning of the threshold value intended by the WHO, then the use of terms such as 'bias', 'overestimate', 'underestimate' etc. is unjustified throughout.</p><p>If it is not clear that the threshold is defined as an annual average, then the paper's message needs to change slightly. By indicating the extent to which the prevalence of false negatives can vary seasonally, even when the prevalence of gene deletions is constant, the results presented here indicate that a conscious choice about this aspect of the definition is very important. Should the threshold represent the acceptable maximum prevalence of false positives, or should it be the annual average. In either case, the results can inform strategies for applying the protocol in ways most likely to identify the required value.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers and the editor for the reviews. The two major comments concerning selection and the decision to use an annual average measure are useful and we agree are important to consider. In response we have conducted the model simulations again with the assumed strength of selection used within the original study. These predictions have been included as new supplementary figures (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2, Figure 2âfigure supplement 1). We have also more clearly detailed why we are considering an annual average earlier in the Introduction, and have added two additional paragraphs in the Discussion exploring these comments. As the reviewers have pointed out, the annual average proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions will only be constant over time if the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions are constant, i.e. under negligible selection pressure. Because of the connection of the reviewersâ two major comments (the decision to keep the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions constant over time and the comparison of samples collected within time periods to the annual average), we wanted to address these comments firstly here in the following discussion before responding further to specific comments.</p><p>One reason for not wanting to explore selection was because this would lead to an increase in <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion, which would make it harder to observe patterns solely due to seasonal changes in transmission intensity and not due to the impact of a selective pressure. However, the true strength of any selective pressure is unknown â as raised by reviewer 3 and there are many factors that could affect how frequently individuals are only infected by <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites. In addition, the technical guidance seeks to identify regions with a sufficiently high frequency of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions causing false-negative RDTs (above 5% PfHRP2-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions) as these regions will have an increase in misdiagnosed cases compared to if a non-HRP2 RDT was used. Decisions made in light of these findings are made irrespective of any assumptions about the selective pressure, except that is greater than or equal to 0, i.e. it will mean that a switch to a non-HRP2 RDT is correct even if there is no selective pressure that would increase the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deletions.</p><p>If we assume that there is a negligible selective pressure then the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions (ignoring fade out and sufficiently large populations) will remain constant over the time period of monitoring for <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions. This period is defined on page 12 of the WHO technical guidance as either two years if the 95% CI for the proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is less than 5%, or one year if it does include 5%, which is quite likely given the size of the binomial confidence interval for 370 samples. With this assumption of no selection then any measure of this proportion collected at one 8-week time period is hoped to be representative for the period of monitoring, which would thus represent the annual or biennial average (with the biennial average being the same as an annual average if there is no selection). This was why we initially were interested in looking at the annual average given our assumption of no selective pressure.</p><p>If there is a selective pressure, however, then any measure is indicative of the proportion within that time period, which would only be the same as the annual average if the strength of selection tended to zero (i.e. the no selection scenario). However, with a strong selective pressure this proportion is likely to increase. Importantly, we do not know precisely by how much and thus we do not wish to make predictions about whether a measure made in a given 8-week period is representative of that regionâs average proportion in the annual or biennial period of monitoring. It is for this reason we think the recommendation for follow up studies made by the WHO in the technical guidance is very sensible. This is also because if there is a strong selective pressure but the seasonality profile of the region and the 8-week period chosen result in a measure that underestimates the annual average for the year after sample collection, then it is likely that the follow up study will correctly detect this increase. If the 8-week period chosen leads to an overestimate of the annual then the decision to switch RDT should not be considered as incorrect as it is likely that if the use of HRP2-based RDT was continued then the selective pressure would have meant a switch would have been needed at the end of the period of monitoring.</p><p>It is only in situations where there is a negligible selective pressure that you could make a decision that would actually be incorrect as opposed to premature. The regions identified in this way (Figure 4) would also likely have a negligible selective pressure as they are largely areas with both a high transmission intensity and high seasonality.</p><p>We hope the above clarifies why we were both interested in looking at areas with no selective pressure and considering annual averages. We acknowledge that this is definitely not clear nor obvious from the manuscript as it was written. To address this we have extended the Introduction to clearly lay out early what the measure we are recording is (the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions) and why we are comparing this to the annual average, i.e. due to the period defined for follow up monitoring. We agree that this comparison is open to interpretation and so we have removed the use of terms such as bias or unbiased, and have presented the results in terms of whether they are representative of the annual average proportion. We also have added Figure 5 (referenced in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion), which is a new paragraph in which we discuss the assumption we are making about looking at the annual average as well as why we are focussing on the seasonal dynamics with the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion fixed. This figure describes the above discussion through considering 2 scenarios: a seasonal setting with selection and without selection. In this diagram we hope to show clearly for readers why we are focussing our study on the assumption that <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletion frequency is not changing over time and subsequently why we would compare measures collected in 8-week periods to the annual average.</p><p>Thank you again to the reviewers for their incredibly helpful comments and we hope our responses to the specific comments have addressed the outstanding points satisfactorily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because of the extensive nature of the requested revisions and clarifications which cannot easily be summarized, more extensive comments from both reviewers are appended below. All substantive points should be addressed satisfactorily as we are unable to extend the review process beyond this next revision.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript has improved and authors addressed most of my comments satisfactorily. I have however a few additional comments on the revised manuscript and rebuttal letter which I feel would require additional clarification.</p><p>- Exceptionally unhelpfully, the use of &quot;false-negative&quot; should be &quot;positive&quot; here. We carried out all our simulations with the assumption that individuals who are only infected with pfhrp2 gene deleted parasites will still be treated. As such, the gene deleted parasites behave exactly the same as the wild type parasites.</p><p>I am afraid I don't fully follow this reasoning. My understanding is that the motivation of the study was that pfhrp2 gene deleted parasites could be indeed misdiagnosed and so simulations should treat them as false negatives (Introduction, second paragraph). If simulations threat those as positive, how could the model effectively estimate the rate of misdiagnosis and the seasonality in such estimate? May I have missed something?</p><p>Besides, I don't think that the reviewers have actually addressed the real concern that came with their original consideration that false negative RTD pfhrp2 deleted parasites would allow them to control for selection.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up, and we hope the following explanation and changes make it clearer how we simulated this. To clarify how we were conducting the earlier simulation in which no selective pressure was assumed, we assumed individuals who were infected with only <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites would be correctly treated, which removed the selective pressure. However, when reporting on the rate of misdiagnosis we would regard these individuals as misdiagnosed as they are only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites. Thus we are reporting the frequency of misdiagnoses that would have occurred throughout the time period for a given frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions, while controlling for any increases in <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions. The advantage of conducting simulations in this way is that we are more certain that dynamics observed in the frequency of misdiagnoses are due to seasonal fluctuations in the prevalence of individuals only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deleted parasites, and not due to increases in the population frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. We have added text to clarify this in the Materials and methods section as follows:</p><p>âAs a result, when reporting the proportion of clinical cases that were misdiagnosed resulting from a false-negative PfHPR2-negative RDT we are reporting the proportion of cases that are infected with only <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>deleted parasites, i.e. individuals who would have been <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative and subsequently misdiagnosed.â</p><p>To make this clearer for the reader, this is further expanded upon in the opening paragraph of the Results:</p><p>âWe initially assumed that the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions was not increasing over time before considering scenarios in which the selective pressure for <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions causes an increase in the population frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions. This decision allowed for the impact of seasonality on the proportion of clinical cases that are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative to be isolated, before allowing comparisons to scenarios in which the proportion of clinical cases that are <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative is increasing also due to changes in the population frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Related to the same issue above, and in response to my comment, authors replied:</p><p>&quot;We do not include a selective advantage to pfhrp2 gene deletion (apologies again for the error mentioned at the beginning of our response) and so we would not expect there to see a temporal variability in the selection pressure. If we did consider this then there would definitely be a temporal element, with the increase in the absolute number of people who seek treatment (we assume a constant proportion of people with a malarial fever seek treatment) during periods of higher transmission causing an increase in the prevalence of the pfhrp2 gene deletion. It was because of this reason that we decided not to model selection, so that we could exclude this effect of selection and be more confident that the dynamics seen are due to the fluctuations in individuals being only infected with pfhrp2 deleted parasites.&quot;</p><p>The selective advantage comes with pfhrp2 gene deletion individuals being misdiagnosed and not getting treatment. If you consider those as positive you remove selection but this is not reflecting any more the reality of the situation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that a selective pressure is likely and that the presence of a selective pressure better represents the biological realism of the dynamics of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions in most settings. We have conducted these additional model simulations in the revised manuscript as supplementary figures (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). In these simulations, the selective pressure used in the original study was included, and the same simulation settings were explored.</p><p>The included supplementary figures for Figures 1 and 2 that consider selection show that there is a significant increase in <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions over the time period studied, in particular in the low transmission setting considered with low seasonality the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> gene deletions doubled from 6% to over 12% on average after two years (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2Q). As a result, for this setting there is a systematic increase in the proportion of false-negative PfHRP2 RDTs within clinical cases within 8 week periods (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B). This manifests in the observation that you would expect estimates collected at the end of the calendar year (because we started our simulations in January) to overestimate the prevalence of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-deletions when compared to the annual mean over the time period shown. However, this comparison is arguably unsuitable and perhaps should be compared to the annual prevalence after sample collection, i.e. what is the mean for the period of monitoring. We, however, do not know that true strength of selection and would feel it incorrect to suggest what this would be, whereas we are confident that the results presented when the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2</italic> deletions is constant are able to demonstrate which time periods are most likely to be systematically above or below the annual average.</p><p>We hope that the inclusion of these additional figures and the discussion made here have helped to clarify the above two issues. We have included a discussion of this in the third, fourth and fifth paragraph of the Discussion, which also includes some of the earlier discussion at the top of this response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- About the relationship between monoclonal/multiclonal infections and pfhrp2 deletions prevalence and selection.</p><p>I thank the authors about including a supplementary figure, but could it be possible to clarify further the relationships in the text?, saying that the relationship is unclear is not of much help.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this as reading it back the supplementary figure wasnât actually linked or the relationships clarified. The second Results paragraph has a longer description about why lower transmission settings have an increased chance of individuals being only infected with <italic>pfhrp2-</italic>negative parasites, and the supplementary figure is now linked here:</p><p>âThis observation is attributable to the lower rate of superinfection in low transmission settings. The lower rate of superinfection reduces the number of polyclonal infections and increases the chance that an individual is only infected with <italic>pfhrp2</italic>-negative parasites (Figure 1âfigure supplement 1).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- About my comment &quot;The regions identified were areas with both a low prevalence of malaria and a high frequency of people seekingâ¦&quot; Were these the only factors?&quot;</p><p>To which authors responded &quot;These were the only factors we looked at within our modelling study&quot;.</p><p>I don't find this reply satisfactory. I know they modelled only those, but my comment was more a recommendation so it is acknowledged somewhere in the Introduction or the Discussion whether they could be other factors that have not been considered and have been shown or suggested to influence the misdiagnoses.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this again and apologies for misunderstanding. We have added the following sentence to the end of the second paragraph of the Introduction highlighting that there are other factors that could affect the rate of selection and the number of misdiagnoses made:</p><p>âThe precise strength of selection, however, is not known with other factors such as the rate of non-malarial fevers and non-adherence to RDT outcomes likely to impact the number of misdiagnosed cases receiving treatment.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The author's clarifications make sense and are helpful. However, my improved understanding of the authors' intentions and the results and conclusions presented in the paper has generated some additional questions and comments. I still feel that the paper would benefit from greater clarity.</p><p>My understanding is that the key values being considered are;</p><p>1) The proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions at a given timepoint.</p><p>2) The average proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, during a given year.</p><p>3) The proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in a given region which have pfhrp2/3 gene deletions.</p><p>4) The 5% threshold in the WHO guidelines.</p><p>It would be incredibly helpful if the authors could provide a precise definition for this, as the various wordings I have found so far in the WHO protocol and information note are open to interpretation regarding whether the 5% is intended to represent: a) The proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions; orb) The proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> parasites in a given region which have pfhrp2/3 gene deletions.</p><p>Part of a full definition for this value is the assumed timing. A quick review of the WHO documentation does not immediately yield any specific information about assumed timings, an absence which would be consistent with an assumption that the rate is effectively constant through a season, or might equally mean that the relevant value is that at the time of sampling.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the attention to the clarity regarding the model outputs that are discussed in the manuscript. We agree that we have not been consistent with which values we are referencing in the text. The main outcome that we are considering is #2 in the list above. The decision to compare to the annual average is based on the period of monitoring recommended in the WHO technical guidance on page 12, in which follow up studies should be conducted against after one year if the findings are inconclusive, i.e. the 95% CI for the proportion of false-negative RDTs due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions includes 5%. We have made this clearer in the text, with this assumption made clearer in the third paragraph of Introduction by including the specific equation listed in the WHO technical guidance as follows:</p><p>âIn February 2018, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance for national malaria control programmes on how to investigate suspected false-negative RDTs with an emphasis on <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions. (World Health Organization, 2018b). The primary study outcome to be calculated in the guidance is as follows:</p><p>Proportion of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> cases with false-negative HRP2 RDT results due to <italic>pfhrp 2/3</italic> deletions = # of confirmed <italic>falciparum</italic> patients with <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> gene deletions and HRP2 RDT negative results / # of confirmed <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (by either RDT or microscopy)&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the paper, the authors appear to be assuming that the intended meaning of the 5% threshold is the average proportion of HRP2 RDT results for patients infected with <italic>P. falciparum</italic> which are false negatives caused by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions, during a given year (item 2 in the list above). The Discussion and conclusion then focus on differences between the prevalence of false negatives at specific timepoints during a year vs the average prevalence value over the year. It would hugely improve the clarity of the paper to state this assumption explicitly and early in the text. It is also necessary to demonstrate using information in the WHO documentation that this is in fact the intended definition of the WHO 5% threshold. Without unequivocal evidence that this is the precise meaning of the threshold value intended by the WHO, then the use of terms such as 'bias', 'overestimate', 'underestimate' etc. is unjustified throughout.</p><p>If it is not clear that the threshold is defined as an annual average, then the paper's message needs to change slightly. By indicating the extent to which the prevalence of false negatives can vary seasonally, even when the prevalence of gene deletions is constant, the results presented here indicate that a conscious choice about this aspect of the definition is very important. Should the threshold represent the acceptable maximum prevalence of false positives, or should it be the annual average. In either case, the results can inform strategies for applying the protocol in ways most likely to identify the required value.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue of interpretation. We agree that the technical guidance is open to interpretation about whether the estimates collected should be reflective of that point in time or should be representative of the annual average. We have assumed the latter, which was based on the period of monitoring detailed above and on our assumption of a negligible selective pressure resulting in a constant deletion frequency. To make this clearer we have extended text in the second last paragraph of the Introduction to clarify that the comparisons to the annual average are chosen to reflect the established monitoring scheme:</p><p>âThe 8-week interval permits for a rapid turnaround and allows for efficient investigations and policy responses. [â¦] Subsequently, any recorded estimate may not be predictive of the number of cases that may be misdiagnosed due to <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions in the years between sampling intervals.â</p><p>However, we do acknowledge that this is open to interpretation and as such we have replaced our use of the terms biased and unbiased and refer to whether the reported estimates are representative of the annual average. We have discussed at length this in the fifth paragraph of the Discussion, in which we discuss this assumption in the context of scenarios in which the proportion of false-negative RDTs due <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions is increasing overtime, because these setting make the comparison to the annual average trickier. However, we conclude this paragraph by arguing that it is more prudent to be concerned with scenarios under the assumption that there is a negligible selective pressure, in which case the comparison to the annual average is justified. Our justification is demonstrated in an additional figure (Figure 5), with the following text at the end of the fourth paragraph of the Discussion raising this justification:</p><p>âHowever, we believe that it is more important to focus on the assumption that the strength of selection is negligible (see Figure 5). [â¦] In areas with a selective pressure it is still possible to incorrectly estimate the annual average for the following year, however the presence of the selective pressure is likely to mean any decision made is simply premature as the frequency of <italic>pfhrp2/3</italic> deletions and subsequently false-negative PfHRP2 RDTs will increase over time (Figure 5B).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is also some confusion in the text between the prevalence of false positives results, and the prevalence of the gene deletion, with the text referring to change of RDT being triggered by an incorrect assessment of the prevalence of gene deletions (e.g. Introduction, fourth paragraph), suggesting that the authors may in fact be defining the threshold value as equal to value 3 in the list above.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting these inconsistencies, as they do make the messaging harder to follow. We agree we were not consistent in the prevalence values mentioned, and we have addressed these below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These are key to the meaning and the implications of the work presented here, and clarity about what is being assumed or referred to is crucial to allow the text to tell its story clearly, and to make it easy to assess the consistency of that story. Confusing references to different prevalence values in the text should be reviewed and resolved wherever they arise throughout the text, including some specific instances detailed below.</p><p>Detailed comments:</p><p>Introduction, third and fourth paragraphs: In the third paragraph of the Introduction the authors give a definition of the WHO threshold value as being the prevalence of false negatives caused by pfhrp2/3 gene deletions. However, in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction they suggest that incorrect assessment of the prevalence of pfhrp2/3 gene deletions could drive the decision to switch to non HRP2 RDTs. Is there another mechanism in the WHO guideline in addition to the 5% false negatives threshold which would drive a change of policy based on gene deletion prevalence rather than false negative RTD prevalence?</p><p>'The protocol in this guidance details how to estimate the local prevalence of false-negative PfHRP2-based RDTs due to pfhrp2/3 gene deletions and recommends that a national change to non PfHRP2-based RDTs be made if the estimated prevalence is above 5%.'</p><p>'the timing of the 8-week interval chosen within a transmission season could lead to bias in the sampled prevalence of pfhrp2/3 gene deletions.
