of the plasma membrane (PM). The majority of PM cholesterol forms complexes with other PM lipids, making it inaccessible for intracellular transport. Transition of PM cholesterol between accessible and inaccessible pools maintains cellular homeostasis, but how cells monitor the accessibility of PM cholesterol remains unclear. We show that endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-anchored lipid transfer proteins, the GRAMD1s, sense and transport accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. GRAMD1s bind to one another and populate ER-PM contacts by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol via their GRAM domains. They then facilitate the transport of this cholesterol via their StART-like domains. Cells that lack all three GRAMD1s exhibit striking expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol as a result of less efficient PM to ER transport of accessible cholesterol. Thus, GRAMD1s facilitate the movement of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER in order to counteract an acute increase of PM cholesterol, thereby activating non-vesicular cholesterol transport.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The human body contains trillions of cells. At the outer edge of each cell is the plasma membrane, which protects the cell from the external environment. This membrane is mostly made of fatty molecules known as lipids and about half of these lipids are specifically cholesterol. Human cells can either take up cholesterol that were obtained via the diet or produce it within a compartment of the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Cells need to monitor the cholesterol levels in both the endoplasmic reticulum and the plasma membrane in order to regulate the uptake or production of this lipid. For example, if there is too much of cholesterol in the plasma membrane, then the cell transports some to the endoplasmic reticulum to tell it to shut down cholesterol production. However, how these different areas of the cell communicate with each other, and transport cholesterol, has remained unclear.</p><p>Naito et al. set out to look for key regulators of cholesterol transport and identified a group of endoplasmic reticulum proteins called GRAMD1 proteins. Cholesterol in the plasma membrane is either accessible or inaccessible, meaning it either can or cannot be moved back into the cell. The GRAMD1 proteins sense accessible cholesterol, and experiments with human cells grown in the laboratory showed that, specifically, the GRAMD1 proteins work together in a complex to sense accessible cholesterol at or near the plasma membrane. One particular part of the protein senses when the amount of accessible cholesterol reaches a certain level at the plasma membrane; when this threshold is reached, the complex flips a switch to start the transport of cholesterol to the endoplasmic reticulum and tell it to shut down cholesterol production.</p><p>This coupling of sensing and transporting lipids by one protein complex also helps maintain the right ratio of accessible and inaccessible cholesterol in the plasma membrane to prevent cells from activating unwanted cell-signaling events. Getting rid of the GRAMD1 proteins in cells, or removing sensing part of these proteins, leads to inefficient transport of cholesterol. A better understanding of how GRAMD1 proteins sense the accessibility of cholesterol could potentially help identify new approaches to control cholesterol transport inside cells. This may in turn eventually lead to new treatments that counteract the defects in cholesterol metabolism seen in some forms of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cholesterol</kwd><kwd>GRAM domain</kwd><kwd>membrane contact sites</kwd><kwd>StART-like domain</kwd><kwd>non-vesicular lipid transport</kwd><kwd>plasma membrane</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H05065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saheki</surname><given-names>Yasunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2017-T2-2-001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saheki</surname><given-names>Yasunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001475</institution-id><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Nanyang Assistant Professorship (NAP)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saheki</surname><given-names>Yasunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001475</institution-id><institution>Nanyang Technological University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Lee Kong Chian School of Medicine startup grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Saheki</surname><given-names>Yasunori</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001352</institution-id><institution>National University of Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Life Sciences Institute NRFI2015-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Triebl</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Torta</surname><given-names>Federico Tesio</given-names></name><name><surname>Wenk</surname><given-names>Markus R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001381</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRFSBP-P4</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Triebl</surname><given-names>Alexander</given-names></name><name><surname>Torta</surname><given-names>Federico Tesio</given-names></name><name><surname>Wenk</surname><given-names>Markus R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Overseas Research Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Naito</surname><given-names>Tomoki</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>GRAMD1 proteins sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of plasma membrane cholesterol and facilitate its transport to the endoplasmic reticulum at ER-PM contact sites.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sterol is one of the major membrane lipids in eukaryotes. In metazoans, cholesterol represents ~20% of total cellular lipids and is therefore essential for the structural integrity of cellular membranes and for cell physiology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Vance, 2015</xref>). Sterol is distributed among cellular membranes primarily via non-vesicular transport, a process that is independent of membrane traffic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baumann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hao et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Heino et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ikonen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Urbani and Simoni, 1990</xref>). Levels of sterol vary considerably between different cellular membranes. Between 60% and 80% of total cellular cholesterol is concentrated in the plasma membrane (PM), where it represents up to ~45% of total lipids in this bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">de Duve, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lange et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ray et al., 1969</xref>). Cellular cholesterol levels are maintained by regulated delivery and production, primarily through receptor-mediated endocytosis of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldstein and Brown, 2015</xref>) and de novo synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) that is controlled by the activation of SREBP transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldstein and Brown, 1990</xref>). Cholesterol is also supplied to cells via high-density lipoproteins (HDL) through the reverse cholesterol flux pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acton et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Phillips, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Cholesterol within the bilayer membranes exists in two distinct chemical states: one being free and ‘accessible’ (also known as ‘unsequestered’ or ‘chemically active’), and the other being ‘inaccessible’ (also known as ‘sequestered’ or ‘chemically inactive’) owing in part to the formation of complexes with other membrane lipids, including sphingomyelin and phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakrabarti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lange et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ohvo-Rekilä et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). Most cholesterol in the PM is sequestered, but a small fraction of PM cholesterol (~15% of PM lipids) remains accessible for extraction and transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>). Although the majority of cellular cholesterol resides in the PM, the biosynthesis of cholesterol occurs exclusively in the ER. Thus, the ER must communicate with the PM to monitor levels of PM cholesterol and to adjust cholesterol biosynthesis in order to maintain lipid homeostasis. To achieve this, cells sense transient increases in the accessible pool of PM cholesterol and rapidly transport the newly expanded pool of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. This suppresses cholesterol biosynthesis by inhibiting SREBP-2, a master regulator of de novo cholesterol synthesis, thereby avoiding cholesterol overaccumulation while maintaining PM cholesterol levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lange and Steck, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lange et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Scheek et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Slotte and Bierman, 1988</xref>). Artificially trapping the accessible pool of cholesterol in the PM results in dysregulated activation of SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Infante and Radhakrishnan, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>). Despite its critical importance, the intracellular transport machinery that senses the accessibility of PM cholesterol is unknown. This machinery is likely to respond to a sharp change in the accessibility of cholesterol on the cytoplasmic leaflet of the PM and to facilitate transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER, thereby helping the ER to communicate with the PM. Such a homeostatic system would also allow cells to monitor PM cholesterol accessibility in order to help to maintain cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</p><p>The ER extends throughout the cytoplasm, forming physical contacts with virtually all other cellular organelles and the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Phillips and Voeltz, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Growing evidence indicates that these membrane contact sites play critical roles in cellular physiology, including lipid exchange and delivery via non-vesicular lipid transport that is facilitated by lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonny et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elbaz and Schuldiner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Holthuis and Menon, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jeyasimman and Saheki, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lahiri et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lev, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nishimura and Stefan, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petrungaro and Kornmann, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Saheki and De Camilli, 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, LTPs may participate in intracellular cholesterol transport and may help to maintain PM cholesterol homeostasis by regulating non-vesicular cholesterol transport between the PM and the ER at ER–PM contact sites.</p><p>Decades of biochemical and genetic research into cholesterol metabolism has identified several key LTPs that bind to cholesterol and mediate its non-vesicular transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wong et al., 2018</xref>). These proteins include a family of 15 proteins that contain a StAR-related lipid transfer (StART) domain, which binds and transports a wide variety of lipids, including cholesterol, glycerolipids, and sphingolipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alpy and Tomasetto, 2014</xref>). Five members of this family, namely STARD1, STARD3, STARD4, STARD5, and STARD6, bind and transport cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alpy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iaea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Lin et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mesmin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Soccio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Stocco, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wilhelm et al., 2017</xref>), but they are not conserved in yeast. This lack of conservation suggests that there may be a more ancient family of sterol transfer proteins that control cholesterol homeostasis in all eukaryotes.</p><p>A bioinformatics search for proteins that possess StART-like domains identified a novel family of evolutionarily conserved proteins that includes six Lam/Ltc proteins in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murley et al., 2015</xref>), and five GRAM domain-containing proteins (GRAMDs) in metazoans. These GRAMDs include the StART-like domain-containing GRAMD1s, also known as Asters (GRAMD1a/Aster-A, GRAMD1b/Aster-B, and GRAMD1c/Aster-C), and two highly related proteins that lack a StART-like domain (GRAMD2 and GRAMD3). Lam/Ltc proteins and GRAMDs all possess an N-terminal GRAM domain, which has structural similarity to the PH domain and thus may sense or bind lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Begley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tong et al., 2018</xref>), and a C-terminal transmembrane domain, which anchors the proteins to the ER. Structural and biochemical studies of yeast and mammalian StART-like domains have identified a hydrophobic cavity that can bind sterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gatta et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jentsch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tong et al., 2018</xref>). The StART-like domains of GRAMD1s bind and transport sterols in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies have demonstrated that some GRAMDs, including GRAMD1a, GRAMD1b, and GRAMD2, localize to ER–PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besprozvannaya et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>). GRAMD2 facilitates STIM1 recruitment to ER–PM contacts and potentially regulates Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Besprozvannaya et al., 2018</xref>), whereas GRAMD1b facilitates the transport of HDL-derived cholesterol to the ER in the adrenal glands of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, yeast Lam/Ltc proteins sense cellular stress and potentially regulate cholesterol exchange between the ER and other membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Murley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murley et al., 2017</xref>). However, the role of these proteins in PM cholesterol or sterol homeostasis has been elusive. In this study, we provide evidence that GRAMD1s sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol and facilitate its transport to the ER at ER–PM contact sites, thereby contributing to PM cholesterol homeostasis.</p><p>We found that GRAMDs form homo- and heteromeric complexes via their transmembrane domains and predicted the existence of luminal amphipathic helices that interact with each other within these complexes. We also found that GRAMD1s rapidly move to ER–PM contacts upon acute hydrolysis of sphingomyelin in the PM. We characterized the mechanisms of this acute recruitment and found that the GRAM domain acts as a coincidence detector of unsequestered/accessible cholesterol and anionic lipids in the PM, including phosphatidylserine, allowing the GRAMD1s to sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol once it increases above a certain threshold. We generated HeLa cells that lacked GRAMD1a/1b/1c (i.e., all of the GRAMDs that contain a StART-like domain) and determined the effect of knocking out these proteins on cholesterol metabolism, using a combination of cholesterol-sensing probes for live cell imaging and lipidomics of membrane extracts. Upon treatment with sphingomyelinase, which liberates the sphingomyelin-sequestered pool of PM cholesterol into the ‘accessible’ pool and thus stimulates its PM to ER transport, GRAMD1 triple knockout (TKO) cells exhibited exaggerated accumulation of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol and reduced suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage compared to wild-type control cells. This accumulation resulted from less efficient transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER.</p><p>Using structure–function analysis, we demonstrated that GRAMD1s couple their PM-sensing property and cholesterol-transport function via their GRAM and StART-like domains, and that GRAMD1 complex formation ensures the progressive recruitment of GRAMD1 proteins to ER–PM contacts. Finally, we observed striking expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol in GRAMD1 TKO cells at steady state. Drug-induced acute recruitment of GRAMD1b to ER–PM contacts was sufficient to facilitate removal of the expanded pool of accessible cholesterol from the PM in GRAMD1 TKO cells. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for novel cellular mechanisms by which GRAMD1s monitor and help to maintain PM cholesterol homeostasis in mammalian cells. As one of the key homeostatic regulators, GRAMD1s sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol and facilitate its transport to the ER, thereby contributing to PM cholesterol homeostasis at ER–PM contact sites.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GRAMD proteins form homo- and heteromeric complexes</title><p>Previous studies identified GRAMD1s as ER-resident proteins that are distributed throughout ER structures in a punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandhu et al., 2018</xref>).

Secondary structure predictions indicated the presence of a conserved alpha helix within the luminal region of GRAMD1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, helical wheel analysis of the luminal helix from GRAMD1b predicted that this protein contained an amphipathic helix, with charged and hydrophobic amino acids occupying opposite sides of the helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Therefore, we first asked whether the luminal helix was necessary for these proteins to form discrete patches on tubular ER. We focused on GRAMD1b as a model protein for analysis of the properties of the GRAMD1 luminal helices, generating a version of GRAMD1b that lacked the luminal helix (Δhelix), and a second version in which the five hydrophobic residues within the luminal helix were mutated to glutamic acid (5E), thereby disrupting the hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Right: incorporation of sphingomyelin into the artificial membranes reduces the accessibility of cholesterol in dose-dependent manner (due to complex formation between sphingomyelin and cholesterol) and suppresses the binding of the GRAM domain to the artificial membranes.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig3s1sdata1"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Dataset for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-51401-fig3-figsupp1-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51401-fig3-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig3s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>The GRAM domain of GRAMD1s binds to membranes by sensing cholesterol accessibility.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Liposome sedimentation assays of the GRAM domain of GRAMD1b (GRAM<sub>1b</sub>).

In this assay, purified GRAM domains were mixed with sucrose-loaded heavy liposomes in sucrose-free buffer. After incubation, free liposomes and the liposomes that bound to GRAM domains (P) were pelleted by centrifugation; the supernatant contained only unbound GRAM domains (S) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B,D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). The GRAM domain did not bind liposomes when the liposome contained only phosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). By contrast, the GRAM domain bound liposomes that contained free cholesterol, although such binding was rather weak, and only ~25% of purified GRAM domains bound liposomes even when the liposome contained high levels of cholesterol (Chol) (60%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The GRAM domain also bound liposomes when the liposomes contained phosphatidylserine (PS), the predominant anionic phospholipid in the PM. However, such binding only occurred when the liposomes contained non-physiological high levels of phosphatidylserine (50% or 80%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, we explored the possibility that the GRAM domain may bind to membranes more efficiently in the presence of both lipids, thereby acting as a coincidence detector of unsequestered/accessible cholesterol and phosphatidylserine.</p><p>Little binding was observed when the liposomes contained 50% cholesterol or 20% phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, strong binding was observed when 50% cholesterol and 20% phosphatidylserine were both present in the liposomes (~80% of the GRAM domains bound to liposomes) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, the addition of free cholesterol dramatically enhanced binding of the GRAM domain to phosphatidylserine-containing membranes. Replacing cholesterol with a non-bilayer forming lipid, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), abolished the binding of the GRAM domains to liposomes, confirming the specific effect of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similar synergistic effects were observed with the GRAM domain of GRAMD1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting the conserved function of GRAMD1 GRAM domains.</p><p>Despite the presence of phosphatidylserine (~10% of PM lipids) and high levels of cholesterol (~45% of PM lipids) in the PM of mammalian cells, GRAMD1s are not enriched at ER–PM contacts at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). The majority of cholesterol in the PM (~27% of PM lipids) is sequestered and ‘inaccessible’ to cytosolic proteins, and only ~15% of PM lipids remain unsequestered and accessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, interactions between GRAM domains and the PM could be suppressed by ‘the factors that sequester cholesterol’ in this bilayer in cells.</p><p>One of the major factors that mediate the direct sequestration of PM cholesterol is sphingomyelin, which forms a complex with cholesterol and makes it inaccessible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Endapally et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finean, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Slotte, 1992</xref>). The sphingomyelin-sequestered pool of PM cholesterol consists of ~15% of PM lipids, while the rest of the inaccessible pool is sequestered by other membrane factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>). To test whether the sequestration of cholesterol by sphingomyelin affects the binding of GRAM domains to artificial membranes, we incorporated increasing amounts of sphingomyelin (SM) (10% or 25%) into liposomes that contained 50% cholesterol and 20% phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). When these liposomes contained 25% sphingomyelin, the percentage of GRAMD1b GRAM domains that bound to the liposomes decreased from ~80% to ~45% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Similar results were obtained with the GRAM domain of GRAMD1a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, the binding of GRAM domains to artificial membranes that contain cholesterol and phosphatidylserine can be modulated by the presence of sphingomyelin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results suggest that sphingomyelin helps to suppress the binding of GRAM domains to the PM at rest by reducing the accessibility of the cholesterol in this bilayer.</p><p>In addition to sphingomyelin, phospholipid acyl chain saturation has profound effects on the accessibility of cholesterol in membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chakrabarti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Radhakrishnan and McConnell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). If the GRAM domain binds to the PM by sensing the accessibility of cholesterol, its binding to artificial membranes should also be influenced by the acyl chain diversity of the phospholipids. To test this possibility, we generated liposomes containing fixed amounts of phosphatidylserine (20%) with varying ratios of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We individually tested the three types of phosphatidylcholine that possesses different acyl chain structures, namely POPC, DOPC, and DPhyPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Branched (DPhyPC) and more unsaturated (DOPC) acyl chains lower the tendency to form ordered conformation in the membranes, and thus, POPC has the strongest cholesterol sequestration effect of these three lipids, followed by DOPC and DPhyPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). The binding of the GRAM domain of GRAMD1b to liposomes shifted to lower cholesterol concentration as the ordering tendency of phosphatidylcholine is lowered (i.e. as the cholesterol sequestration effect is reduced) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results are consistent with the ability of the GRAM domain to sense the accessibility of cholesterol in membranes.</p><p>Finally, to determine whether GRAM domains bind more broadly to other anionic lipids, we replaced phosphatidylserine with other anionic lipids, namely phosphatidic acid (PA), PI(4)P, and PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>, and asked whether they affected GRAM domain binding similarly. In this assay, we used 5% anionic lipids, including phosphatidylserine, because even 5% phosphatidylserine was sufficient to mediate the binding of the GRAM domain to liposomes that also contained 50% free cholesterol, albeit less efficiently than 20% phosphatidylserine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). No or little binding was observed when GRAM domains were mixed with liposomes that contained 5% of these anionic lipids (each was tested individually) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, as seen when phosphatidylserine and cholesterol were combined, the addition of free cholesterol to these anionic-lipid-containing liposomes enhanced the binding of GRAM domains to the liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>As anionic lipids, including phosphatidylserine, are enriched in the inner leaflet of the PM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yeung et al., 2008</xref>), these results indicate that the recruitment of GRAMD1s to the PM is regulated by interactions between GRAM domains and anionic lipids, and that these interactions are enhanced by the additional presence of accessible/unsequestered cholesterol in the PM.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Liberation of sphingomyelin-sequestered pool of cholesterol induces acute recruitment of GRAMD1b to the PM</title><p>To examine the physiological role of sphingomyelin in GRAM domain-dependent recruitment of GRAMD1s to the PM, HeLa cells expressing either EGFP–GRAMD1b or EGFP–GRAMD1b ΔGRAM were treated with sphingomyelinase, which hydrolyzes PM sphingomyelin, and imaged under total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy. Although sphingomyelin is enriched in the outer leaflet of the PM bilayer, it also contributes to suppressing the accessibility of cholesterol in the inner leaflet of the PM, because unsequestered cholesterol can spontaneously flip flop between the outer and inner leaflets of this bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Leventis and Silvius, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Steck and Lange, 2018</xref>). Within 30 min of sphingomyelinase treatment, GRAMD1b was indeed recruited to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), albeit this recruitment was less efficient than cholesterol loading to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). GRAMD1b ΔGRAM, however, failed to localize to the PM, even after 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). EGFP-tagged GRAMD1 GRAM domains (namely EGFP–GRAM<sub>1a</sub>, EGFP–GRAM<sub>1b</sub>, and EGFP–GRAM<sub>1c</sub>) were all recruited to the PM upon sphingomyelinase treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), revealing a direct role of the GRAM domain in detecting the unsequestered/accessible pool of PM cholesterol in cells. These results are also consistent with the lack of enrichment of GRAMD1s at ER–PM contact sites at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Taken together, these data demonstrate that GRAMD1s are recruited to the PM by sensing an increase in the accessibility of PM cholesterol (i.e. acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol that exceeds a certain threshold at which the GRAM domain interacts with the PM). Furthermore, the data show that this recruitment depends on the GRAM domain, which acts as a coincidence detector for both unsequestered/accessible cholesterol and anionic lipids in the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Deletion of GRAMD1s results in exaggerated accumulation of the accessible pool of cholesterol in the PM</title><p>As GRAMD1s move to ER–PM contact sites upon acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G,H</xref>), they may also contribute to the extraction of accessible PM cholesterol in order to maintain homeostasis. To investigate the potential functions of GRAMD1s in this process, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to disrupt GRAMD1 function by targeting all three GRAMD1 genes (GRAMD1A, GRAMD1B and GRAMD1C) in HeLa cells. Guide RNAs specific to exon 13 of GRAMD1A and GRAMD1B and to exon 11 of GRAMD1C were chosen, as they encode the lipid-harboring StART-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). After transfection of plasmids expressing GRAMD1-specific guide RNAs and Cas9 protein, two independent isolates of GRAMD1a/1b double knockout cell clones (DKO #38 and DKO #40) and two independent isolates of GRAMD1a/1b/1c triple knockout cell clones (TKO #1 and TKO #15) were selected. The absence of GRAMD1a and GRAMD1b was confirmed by western blotting and genomic sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).

No obvious defects in cell viability or overall morphology were observed for these KO cells, with the exception that KO cells grew slightly slower than parental HeLa cells.

Brief sonication was used to remove most organelles, whereas PM sheets remained attached to the bead surface (visualized by BODIPY-labeled ceramide) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>). As shown by western blotting, the PM sheets that remained bound to the beads were highly enriched for PM marker proteins (such as CD44) relative to the starting material. The endosomal marker, EEA1, was greatly depleted, whereas small amounts of ER proteins (such as VAPA and VAPB) were recovered in the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This probably reflected the tight attachment of cortical ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the levels of endogenous GRAMD1a and GRAMD1b on bead-attached PM sheets were similar to those seen for the integral ER protein, VAP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This confirmed that the majority of these two proteins are distributed throughout the ER, with only a very small fraction localizing to ER–PM contact sites at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Mass spectrometry analysis of whole-cell and purified PM lipid extracts from wild-type control and GRAMD1 TKO HeLa cells did not reveal significant changes in cholesterol and other major lipids, except for very minor increases in cholesterol esters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Thus, GRAMD1s are not essential for maintaining total levels of PM cholesterol. This result is also consistent with very little enrichment of GRAMD1s at ER–PM contacts at the steady state. Collectively, these results indicate that GRAMD1s may contribute to PM cholesterol homeostasis by counteracting acute increases in the accessible pool of PM cholesterol through its extraction and transport to the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The cholesterol transporting property of the StART-like domain of GRAMD1s is critical for the removal of an acutely expanded pool of accessible PM cholesterol</title><p>Although GRAMD1 StART-like domains transport cholesterol in vitro, it remains unclear whether this property is relevant to cellular physiology. Our live-cell imaging analysis of EGFP–GRAM<sub>1b</sub> (which is a novel biosensor for detecting acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol that we identified in this study) allowed us to conduct a structure–function analysis of GRAMD1s in the context of cellular functions for the first time. We first asked whether the sterol-binding pocket of the StART-like domain is required for the cellular functions of GRAMD1s. As a first step, we characterized the cholesterol-transporting properties of individual StART-like domains in vitro and generated a series of structure-guided mutations in order to identify key amino-acid residues that are essential for cholesterol transport. We purified StART-like domains from all three GRAMD1s and performed cell-free liposome-based lipid transfer assays. In this assay, the amount of dehydroergosterol (DHE) (a fluorescent analog of cholesterol) in liposomes was quantitatively measured using fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) between DHE and Dansyl-PE (DNS-PE) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). DHE was initially loaded only into donor liposomes, and its transfer from donor to DNS-PE-containing acceptor liposomes was monitored over time by measuring FRET between transferred DHE and DNS-PE in acceptor liposomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In the absence of StART-like domains, very few increases in the FRET signal were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, buffer). However, when GRAMD1 StART-like domains were mixed with donor and acceptor liposomes, a rapid increase in FRET signal was observed, indicating the efficient extraction of DHE from donor liposomes and its loading onto acceptor liposomes by the StART-like domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Increasing amounts of purified proteins (0.5 µM, 1 µM, and 2 µM) reduced the time required for the FRET signal to plateau (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). GRAMD1a StART-like domains transferred DHE most efficiently, at a rate corresponding to ~8 DHE molecules per minute. In comparison, GRAMD1b and GRAMD1c transported ~1 DHE molecule per minute, as calculated using a standard curve (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,F</xref>).

Strikingly, the enhanced PM recruitment of EGFP–GRAM<sub>1b</sub> was dramatically suppressed by expressing wild-type mRuby–GRAMD1b but not by expressing a mutant version of mRuby–GRAMD1b that is defective in cholesterol transport [mRuby–GRAMD1b (5P)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). By contrast, PM recruitment of mRuby–GRAMD1b upon sphingomyelinase treatment of TKO cells was higher for the 5P mutant GRAMD1b than for wild-type GRAMD1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). These results suggest that the StART-like domain-dependent extraction and transport of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER facilitates the dissociation of GRAMD1b from the PM, as the interaction of the GRAM domain of GRAMD1b with the PM is weakened, owing to a reduction in accessible cholesterol in the PM.</p><p>Our results to date suggest that GRAMD1b may play a unique role in sensing and controlling the movement of accessible PM cholesterol. To further support this notion, we used GRAMD1 TKO cells to examine whether overexpression of other known cholesterol-transfer proteins, such as STARD4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Iaea et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mesmin et al., 2011</xref>) and some ORPs [including OSBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonny et al., 2018</xref>), ORP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Charman et al., 2014</xref>) and ORP9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ngo and Ridgway, 2009</xref>)] could substitute the function of GRAMD1s.

As GRAMD1 TKO cells show exaggerated accumulation of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol upon sphingomyelinase treatment compared with wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), GRAMD1s may be involved in PM to ER transport of the accessible pool of cholesterol via their GRAM and StART-like domains.

In this assay, we first depleted most of the accessible cholesterol from control and TKO cells by treating them with a combination of lipoprotein-deficient serum (LPDS) and mevastatin, an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, for 16 hr (a treatment designed to induce maximum SREBP-2 cleavage by cholesterol starvation). We then stimulated the cells with sphingomyelinase and, using total cell lysates, we monitored over time the suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage, which results from the PM to ER transport of accessible cholesterol in response to the liberation of the sphingomyelin-sequestered pool of PM cholesterol by sphingomyelinase. Cell lysates were collected at different time points (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immuno-blotting against SREBP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). At time 0, there were no detectable changes in the cleavage of SREBP-2 in GRAMD1 TKO cells compared to wild-type control cells.

We hypothesized that both the recruitment of GRAMD1s to ER–PM contact sites and their ability to transport cholesterol are critical for the suppression of the cleavage of SREBP-2 by facilitating transport of the newly expanded pool of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. To test this hypothesis, we used a GRAMD1b mutant that lacks the GRAM domain (GRAMD1b ΔGRAM), which cannot be recruited to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and a GRAMD1b with the mutated StART-like domain, which is defective in cholesterol transport (5P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref>). The expression of GRAMD1b ΔGRAM or GRAMD1b 5P in TKO cells failed to rescue the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data demonstrate that GRAMD1s play a role in the transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER upon acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol and help to suppress SREBP-2 activity. Furthermore, the data show that such functions require the recruitment of GRAMD1s to ER–PM contact sites, which is regulated by the ability of their GRAM domain to sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol, and by their StART-like-domain-dependent cholesterol transport.</p><p>In order to measure changes in the accessible pool of PM cholesterol, we took advantage of the cholesterol-binding domain 4 (D4) of bacterial Perfringolysin O (PFO), which has been widely used as a probe to measure the accessible pool of PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Das et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gay et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shimada et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010</xref>). Wild-type control and GRAMD1 TKO cells that had been pre-treated with a combination of LPDS and mevastatin for 16 hr were stimulated with sphingomyelinase for a fixed period of time (0, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180 min) and washed. Cells were then incubated with recombinant EGFP-tagged D4 (EGFP–D4) proteins for 15 min at room temperature. After washing, cell lysates were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immuno-blotting against GFP to detect EGFP–D4 proteins that were bound to accessible cholesterol in the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). At time 0, there were no detectable changes in EGFP–D4 signals in TKO cells compared to wild-type control cells. A 30 min treatment with sphingomyelinase induced a similar increase in the binding of EGFP–D4 to both control and TKO cells. A gradual decrease of EGFP–D4 signals was observed in control cell lysates over the time course of 180 min, similar to that reported in a previous report that utilized a mutant form of PFO to assess changes in accessible cholesterol in the PM upon sphingomyelinase treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>). TKO cells, however, showed continuous increase in binding of EGFP–D4 to the PM even after 180 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>), suggesting a sustained accumulation of accessible cholesterol in the PM of TKO cells, due to less efficient transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER, that does not occur in wild-type control cells.</p><p>Together with the results obtained with the cytosolically expressed EGFP–GRAM<sub>1b</sub> biosensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>), these data strongly indicate that the extraction and transport of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER by GRAMD1s is able to counteract with acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol (e.g. acute expansion induced by sphingomyelinase treatment) to prevent the accumulation of accessible cholesterol in the PM in wild-type control cells, and that this homeostatic response is impaired in GRAMD1 TKO cells. It is also important to note that there might be other intracellular cholesterol transport mechanisms that may act in parallel with GRAMD1s to facilitate accessible cholesterol extraction from the PM for its transport to the ER, as suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage is not eliminated even in the total absence of GRAMD1s (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Efficient transport of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol to the ER requires GRAMD1 complex formation</title><p>A version of GRAMD1b in which the transmembrane domain and luminal region are both replaced by those of Sec61β (TM swap) cannot form protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–J</xref>).

TIRF microscopy analysis of HeLa cells expressing the GRAMD1b TM swap mutant, however, revealed major differences in how this protein was recruited to the PM compared to wild-type GRAMD1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). GRAMD1b TM swap remained diffusely distributed on the tubular ER (which is closely attached to the PM) even at the end of the 180 min imaging period. By contrast, wild-type GRAMD1b progressively accumulated at ER–PM contacts as discrete patches with much stronger PM recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F,G</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These results support an important role for GRAMD1 complex formation in facilitating the progressive accumulation of GRAMD1s at ER–PM contacts, thereby supporting efficient accessible cholesterol transport at these contacts. Taken together, we conclude that GRAMD1s play a role in PM to ER transport of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol upon acute expansion of this pool. Loss of GRAMD1 function leads to sustained accumulation of accessible cholesterol in the PM, resulting in less effective suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage and possibly dysregulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Chronic expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol in GRAMD1 TKO cells</title><p>Distinct pools of cholesterol co-exist in the PM at steady state: a major pool is ‘inaccessible’ (i.e., sequestered or chemically inactive) and a smaller pool is ‘accessible’ (i.e., unsequestered or chemically active).

We have also identified the molecular mechanisms by which GRAMD1s interact with one another to form a complex, and how they are recruited to the PM. Key findings of the current study are the following:</p><p>(1) We found that GRAMD1s and GRAMD3 form homo- and heteromeric complexes and localize to discrete patches on tubular ER in mammalian cells at rest. We identified that their transmembrane domains and luminal helices, which are predicted to form amphipathic surfaces, mediated the formation of protein–protein complexes and regulated their progressive recruitment to ER–PM contacts and their functions.</p><p>(2) Using in vitro liposome sedimentation assays and live-cell imaging, we found that the GRAM domain of GRAMD1s acts as a coincidence detector, tuned to the presence of both ‘unsequestered/accessible’ cholesterol and anionic lipids, including phosphatidylserine, in the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Importantly, the binding of the GRAM domain to membranes requires that unsequestered/accessible cholesterol exceeds a certain threshold. As the majority of cholesterol in the PM is sequestered (i.e., inaccessible), this switch-like property allows GRAMD1s to move to ER–PM contact sites only when the accessible pool of PM cholesterol transiently expands, preventing GRAMD1s from accumulating at ER–PM contacts at rest.</p><p>(3) We have deciphered the novel cellular mechanisms by which the accessibility of PM cholesterol is monitored by an LTP at ER–PM contacts. We found that GRAMD1s sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol through their GRAM domain and facilitate its transport through their StART-like domain. Disruption of their functions leads to less efficient transport of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER and reduced suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage. Importantly, we showed that the formation of GRAMD1 protein complexes, as well as the StART-like and GRAM domains of GRAMD1 proteins, is critical for the cellular functions of GRAMD1s in vivo.</p><p>(4) Our results demonstrate that removal of accessible PM cholesterol occurs within ~1 hr, when re-expressed GRAMD1 proteins are artificially recruited to ER–PM contact sites to facilitate transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER in GRAMD1 TKO cells. These experiments utilized a drug-induced dimerization approach. In addition, this GRAMD1 function requires the sterol-transporting StART-like domain. Previous studies of yeast mutants lacking Lam/Ltc proteins relied on genetic approaches (over a time scale of ~20 hr), making it difficult to interpret the significance of their lipid-transfer functions in vivo.</p><p>Using the CRISPR/Cas9 gene-editing system, we demonstrated that GRAMD1s are not essential for cell viability. Although cells that lack all three GRAMD1s grow more slowly than wild-type cells, they do not exhibit major abnormalities. Overlapping functions between mammalian GRAMD1s and other sterol-binding STARD proteins may explain the lack of major defects in these cells. Accordingly, PM lipidomics did not reveal major differences in PM cholesterol levels between GRAMD1 TKO cells and wild-type cells. Our analyses suggest, however, that GRAMD1s facilitate the transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER in response to a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol, thereby contributing to PM cholesterol homeostasis. First, GRAMD1 TKO cells exhibited an exaggerated accumulation of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol in response to acute hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, which liberates the sphingomyelin-sequestered pool of cholesterol into the ‘accessible pool’. This was revealed by sustained binding of the PFO D4 probe to the PM and by enhanced PM recruitment of the GRAM domain of GRAMD1b, a novel biosensor for detecting acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol that we identified in this study, in GRAMD1 TKO cells. Second, GRAMD1 TKO cells showed reduced suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage upon hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, reflecting less efficient PM to ER transport of the newly expanded pool of accessible cholesterol in these cells. Third, GRAMD1 TKO cells exhibited a chronic expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol, as detected by the D4H probe. All of these phenotypes are consistent with defects in efficient PM to ER transport of the accessible pool of cholesterol. Importantly, re-expression of GRAMD1b rescued these phenotypes, with rescue depending on the sterol-binding property of GRAMD1b's StART-like domain, the GRAM domain, and protein complex formation.</p><p>Although the transition of cholesterol between ‘inaccessible’ and ‘accessible’ pools in the PM plays crucial roles in controlling cellular cholesterol homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Das et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Endapally et al., 2019</xref>), the molecular mechanisms by which these transitions are monitored, and the intracellular transport machinery responsible for the PM to ER transport of the accessible pool of cholesterol, have both remained elusive. Our results suggest that these two mechanisms can be coupled by non-vesicular cholesterol transport mediated by an LTP at ER–PM contact sites. We found that GRAMD1s sense a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol and facilitate its transport to the ER at ER–PM contact sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–C</xref>). We found that interactions between the purified GRAM domains of GRAMD1a/b and artificial membranes that contain phosphatidylserine, which is a major acidic phospholipid in the PM, are dramatically enhanced by the presence of unsequestered/accessible cholesterol that exceeds a certain threshold. Furthermore, such interactions are modulated by sphingomyelin and phospholipids, which sequester cholesterol by forming dynamic complexes. Thus, the GRAM domain allows GRAMD1s to sense an increase in accessible PM cholesterol and facilitates the accumulation of GRAMD1s at ER–PM contacts only when the accessible pool of cholesterol transiently expands in this bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). Importantly, such regulation prevents GRAMD1s from depleting PM cholesterol at steady state. Loss of GRAMD1 functions, however, leads to chronic and acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,C</xref>). It has been known that accessible cholesterol, upon reaching a certain threshold, is extracted for transport to the ER and regulates cholesterol biosynthesis to maintain homeostasis. How the intracellular transport machinery senses such a sharp threshold has been unknown. The ability of the GRAMD1s to accumulate at ER–PM contacts in a switch-like fashion, by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol through their GRAM domain, provides a conceptual framework for this process. Importantly, GRAMD1s themselves directly facilitate the transport of the expanded pool of accessible PM cholesterol from the PM to the ER, thereby contributing to PM cholesterol homeostasis as a critical homeostatic regulator.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>GRAMD1s facilitate the transport of the accessible pool of cholesterol from the PM to the ER, thereby contributing to PM cholesterol homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Distinct pools of cholesterol co-exist in PM bilayers at steady state: a major pool is inaccessible (i.e. sequestered or chemically inactive) and a smaller pool is accessible (i.e. unsequestered or chemically active). Sequestration is in part mediated by sphingomyelin. Compositions of phospholipids also influence the overall accessibility of PM cholesterol. Top: at rest, GRAMD1 complexes localize on the tubular ER network with little enrichment at ER–PM contact sites. Bottom: a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol (e.g. hydrolysis of sphingomyelin, cholesterol loading to the PM) induces the acute recruitment of GRAMD1 complexes to ER–PM contacts once the levels of accessible PM cholesterol exceed a certain threshold. The red arrow denotes the expansion of the accessible pool; the blue arrow denotes transport of the newly expanded pool of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER by GRAMD1s and other, yet to be identified, intracellular cholesterol transport systems. (<bold>B</bold>) Top: in wild-type cells, the GRAM domain of GRAMD1s only weakly interacts with the PM at rest due to sequestration of the majority of cholesterol in this bilayer. Bottom: upon reaching a certain threshold of the accessibility (i.e. a transient expansion in the accessible pool of PM cholesterol), the interaction of the GRAM domain with the PM is enhanced, and GRAMD1s are recruited to ER–PM contacts. Supporting this model, the binding of the purified GRAM domains of GRAMD1a and GRAMD1b to liposomes containing phosphatidylserine, a major anionic lipid in the PM, is dramatically enhanced by the presence of unsequestered/accessible cholesterol in a dose-dependent manner with a switch-like response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Upon recruitment of GRAMD1s to ER–PM contacts, the StART-like domain initiates the extraction of accessible PM cholesterol and facilitates its transport to the ER, contributing to the suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage and to PM cholesterol homeostasis. (<bold>C</bold>) Top: in GRAMD1 TKO cells at rest, D4H binding to the PM increases, indicating chronic expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol due to the absence of GRAMD1s-mediated transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Bottom: upon a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol, GRAMD1 TKO cells show exaggerated accumulation of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol due to the absence of GRAMD1s-mediated transport of accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. Consistent with this model, sphingomyelinase treatment leads to enhanced recruitment of the GRAM domain of GRAMD1b, a novel biosensor for detecting acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol that we identified in this study, to the PM in GRAMD1 TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D,E</xref>). Reduced transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER in GRAMD1 TKO cells also results in less efficient suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage and continuous increase in the binding of recombinant D4 proteins to the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Other parallel cholesterol transport and regulatory systems, yet to be identified, may operate to maintain the total levels of PM cholesterol in the absence of GRAMD1s.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51401-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Levels of PM cholesterol are maintained at an equilibrium by balancing the efflux and influx of cholesterol out of and into the PM, respectively. Thus, inhibition of the efflux pathway only (e.g., by loss of GRAMD1s) disrupts this equilibrium, potentially increasing total levels of PM cholesterol. However, levels of PM cholesterol are unchanged in GRAMD1 TKO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C,D</xref>). Thus, alternative backup systems may support the efflux of PM cholesterol (or reduce the influx of cholesterol to the PM) to maintain total cholesterol levels in the PM in the absence of GRAMD1s. For example, recent studies found that macrophages are able to dispose of accessible cholesterol by releasing PM-derived particles that are rich in cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hu et al., 2019</xref>). It is also important to note that suppression of SREBP-2 cleavage upon sphingomyelinase treatment (an estimate of the efficiency of PM to ER transport of accessible cholesterol) is reduced but not eliminated in the absence of GRAMD1s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,C</xref>). Thus, other intracellular cholesterol transport machineries might also participate in the transport of accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER. Such robust parallel mechanisms may be partially mediated by other non-vesicular sterol transport systems, such as those mediated by STARDs or ORPs; vesicular transport may also be involved in maintaining total levels of PM cholesterol. Further studies are needed to better understand the interplay between GRAMD1s and other sterol efflux/transfer systems in the regulation of cellular cholesterol homeostasis.</p><p>GRAMD1s interact with each other through their transmembrane domains and predicted luminal amphipathic helices (e.g., GRAMD1b homomeric and GRAMD1b/GRAMD1a heteromeric interactions). Mutant GRAMD1b proteins that lack these regions fail to interact with one another and are diffusely distributed throughout the tubular ER. Other lipid transfer proteins that are known to localize to membrane contact sites also form complexes or oligomers. These proteins include E-Syts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giordano et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Saheki et al., 2016</xref>), ORP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), and ORP5/8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chung et al., 2015</xref>), as well as the yeast ERMES complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">AhYoung et al., 2015</xref>). ORP2 oligomerization and ERMES assembly enhance the ability of these proteins to transfer lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kawano et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). Accordingly, mutant GRAMD1b proteins that lack the ability to form protein complexes accumulate less robustly at ER–PM contacts, and less effectively rescue phenotypes associated with GRAMD1 TKO cells. Thus, the formation of GRAMD1 complexes plays important roles in regulating GRAMD1 localization and function.</p><p>A recent study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sandhu et al. (2018)</xref> reported that GRAMD1s facilitate the transport of PM cholesterol that is additionally loaded from external sources. In particular, they showed that GRAMD1b mediates PM to ER transport of HDL-derived cholesterol that is taken up by adrenal glands via the scavenger receptor SR-B1 in mice. On the basis of these results, they proposed that GRAMD1s might also play more general roles in intracellular cholesterol transport by sensing accessible cholesterol in the PM. Our findings support this notion and further demonstrate that GRAMD1s contribute to PM cholesterol homeostasis and cholesterol metabolism by sensing a transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol by their GRAM domain, and facilitate the transport of this cholesterol to the ER by their StART-like domain. Interestingly, GRAMD1a is broadly expressed in many tissues with particular enrichment in the brain. Future studies will be needed to determine the physiological functions of GRAMD1s in other tissues in mammals.</p><p>In summary, our study has demonstrated that ER-localized GRAMD1s help to maintain PM cholesterol homeostasis in trans via their ability to transport accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER at ER–PM contact sites. Our results show that GRAMD1s sense a transient expansion of the pool of accessible PM cholesterol and facilitate its transport to the ER through non-vesicular transport. These proteins probably perform additional functions, as yeast mutants that lack Lam/Ltc proteins show pleiotropic defects in cell signaling, including altered mTOR kinase signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Murley et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the StART-like domain of GRAMD1b has been shown to transport PI(4,5)P<sub>2</sub> in addition to cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horenkamp et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, potential changes in the properties of other organelles and the PM in GRAMD1 TKO cells deserve future investigations. Further elucidating the physiological functions of these proteins, as well as other sterol-transfer proteins, at membrane contact sites will be important to gain insight into how cellular cholesterol homeostasis is regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Antibodies and chemicals</title><p>Primary and secondary antibodies, chemicals, lipids and other reagents used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>DNA plasmids</title><p>DNA plasmids used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; the sequences of oligos and primers used are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>For mammalian expression</title><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Cloning of EGFP–GRAMD1a, EGFP–GRAMD1b, EGFP–GRAMD1c and EGFP–GRAMD3</title><p>cDNAs of GRAMD1a/Aster-A (NP_065946.2), GRAMD1b/Aster-B (NP_065767.1), GRAMD1c/Aster-C (NP_060047.3), and GRAMD3 (NP_001139791.1) were amplified by PCR using the following primer sets: GRAMD1a — GRAMD1a_F and GRAMD1a _Stop_R; GRAMD1b — GRAMD1b_F and GRAMD1b_Stop_R; GRAMD1c — GRAMD1c_F and GRAMD1c_Stop_R; and GRAMD3 — GRAMD3_F and GRAMD3_Stop_R.

Most of a cell's cholesterol resides in its plasma membrane (PM), however the regulatory machinery that ensures cholesterol homeostasis is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane. How the PM communicates its cholesterol status to the ER is still not well understood, although the distribution of PM cholesterol into accessible and inaccessible pools has been shown to play a role. Here, Naito et al. show that the ER-localized GRAMD1 proteins form oligomers, accumulate at ER-PM contact sites, and bind and transport accessible PM cholesterol to the ER. These findings are consistent with and build upon earlier work on these proteins in yeast and mammalian cells. Cells lacking all three GRAMD1 proteins are unable to relieve the accumulation of accessible cholesterol in the PM. This study brings a deeper understanding of the players involved in intracellular cholesterol transport and will thus be of broad interest to scientists in the fields of cell biology and lipid metabolism.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The regulation of plasma membrane cholesterol states by GRAMD1 lipid transfer protein complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and makes important contributions to the field of intracellular cholesterol trafficking. The authors have added to the field by showing that GRAMD1 proteins may affect the distribution of cholesterol in plasma membranes (PMs) between accessible and inaccessible forms. Studies that support these points include a careful analysis of the cholesterol-sensing properties of GRAM domains and phenotypes of complete (triple) GRAMD1 knockout cells. Other parts of these studies showing the enrichment of GRAMD1s at ER-PM contact sites, binding/transport of cholesterol in vitro, and facilitation of PM-to-ER cholesterol transport nicely confirm previous conclusions from work on these proteins and their yeast homologues. All the reviewers were enthusiastic about this paper, but also raised the following concerns that need to be addressed before acceptance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key point of this paper is that the GRAMD1 proteins sense and influence levels of accessible cholesterol in PMs. One nice piece of evidence provided by the authors is that accessible cholesterol generated after SMase treatment is not transported to ER to block SREBP activation in GRAMD1 triple knockout cells. However, more direct measurements of changes in accessible cholesterol would be desirable. The experiments where fluorescent D4H is expressed in cells cannot be interpreted because of the severe perturbing effects of the D4 probes in live cells. The authors do point out this limitation and we recommend removing these studies. Instead, endpoint assays where direct binding of D4H or ALOD4 or other toxin variants is measured after various treatments would be more informative and should be performed. Another option is to measure the decline in sphingomyelin-sequestered or inaccessible cholesterol using the OlyA probe (Endapally et al., 2019).</p><p>2) If GRAMD1 proteins play a unique role in determining the size of accessible cholesterol pools in the PM, then their effect should not be influenced by high-level expression of other cholesterol transporters such as STARD4 or the OSBP family members. This can be easily tested by the authors in the cell lines they have generated.</p><p>3) The liposome experiments showing the interaction of GRAM domains with cholesterol-containing membranes are well executed. To rule out the possibility of other membrane factors affecting binding, the authors could test whether other non-bilayer forming lipids such as PE can replace cholesterol. Also, the phospholipid acyl chain saturation has profound effects on accessibility of cholesterol. This can also be tested.</p><p>4) References to previous contributions to this field are incomplete. The authors reference several original papers, which we commend them on, but they also unnecessarily reference additional reviews in many cases. The referencing is also repetitive, since the same block of references are cited at multiple points. It would add, not detract, from the impact of this paper if the authors were to be generous to those who made earlier contributions. Specific cases are:</p><p>a) While it is true that the Tontonoz paper focused on the role of GRAMD1 proteins in handling HDL-derived cholesterol in the adrenal gland, it is unfair to say that their paper failed to appreciate a more global role for Asters/GRAMs in intracellular cholesterol trafficking. Indeed, a more general role in sensing accessible cholesterol was explicitly proposed in the first paragraph of the Discussion of that paper. This should be acknowledged here.</p><p>b) The authors should mention in the Discussion section the intriguing possibility that some cell types, such as macrophages, can dispose of accessible cholesterol by release of PM particles (aside from non-vesicular transport to ER).</p><p>c) The authors neglect the seminal contributions of the McConnell group at Stanford and others, which inspired the later studies. These earlier papers first introduced the concept of complexes, chemical activity, and &quot;accessibility&quot; and should be referenced at appropriate points in the paper (Radhakrishnan et al., 2000, McConnell and Radhakrishnan, 2003, Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010, Gay et al., 2015).</p><p>5) Please include a statement in the Introduction to clarify the nomenclature difference between Asters and GRAMD1s.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The regulation of plasma membrane cholesterol states by GRAMD1 lipid transfer protein complex&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The revised submission by Naito et al. has improved and has addressed some of the reviewer concerns. The new experiments in Figure 3 and its supplements are convincing in showing the specificity of the GRAM domains for accessible cholesterol. However, a few important points that were raised by the reviewers remain unresolved and need additional attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The main concern centers on the authors' claim that GRAMD1 proteins not only transport cholesterol between the plasma membrane (PM) and the ER (which has already been shown by the Tontonoz group and by papers on the yeast homologs), but that they also affect the distribution of cholesterol between accessible and inaccessible pools in the PM. The data supporting this latter claim (including the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2) are not very convincing. If GRAMD1 proteins are increasing the pool of accessible cholesterol, but not changing total cholesterol, then inaccessible cholesterol must be decreasing. How do the authors propose that the GRAMD1 proteins accomplish this redistribution? Probing for such a decrease using probes for inaccessible cholesterol (Endapally et al., 2019) would strengthen this argument. Alternatively, the data can be explained simply by a role for GRAMD1s in transporting accessible cholesterol, but not in regulating the accessibility of PM cholesterol.</p><p>The authors seem to have misunderstood the suggestion to test whether STARD4 or ORPs can substitute for GRAMD1 proteins. The question is not whether these other transporter proteins can localize to the PM but whether they can also influence the size of the accessible cholesterol pool (by D4H binding for instance). This measurement may give insights into unique roles of GRAMD1 proteins.</p><p>These points need to be addressed to give some mechanistic insights into the functioning of GRAMD1 proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51401.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A key point of this paper is that the GRAMD1 proteins sense and influence levels of accessible cholesterol in PMs. One nice piece of evidence provided by the authors is that accessible cholesterol generated after SMase treatment is not transported to ER to block SREBP activation in GRAMD1 triple knockout cells.

We appreciate the constructive suggestions and addressed the concerns by performing additional experiments.</p><p>First, we monitored changes in accessible PM cholesterol after SMase treatment more directly, using a recombinant EGFP-tagged D4 of PFO protein (EGFP-D4) via endpoint assays. In brief, wild-type control and GRAMD1 TKO cells were treated with SMase for a fixed period of time (0 min, 30 min, 60 min, 90 min, 120 min, 150 min, 180 min), washed, and then incubated with recombinant EGFP-D4 proteins. After wash, cell lysates were collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immuno-blotting against GFP to detect EGFP-D4 proteins that were bound to accessible cholesterol in the PM. 30 min treatment with SMase induced similar extent of the binding of EGFP-D4 to both control and TKO cells. Gradual decrease of EGFP-D4 signals was observed in control cell lysates over the time course of 180 min. TKO cells, however, showed persistent increase in binding of EGFP-D4 to the PM even after 180 min. These new results suggest that acute extraction of accessible PM cholesterol is able to counteract with acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol to prevent its further expansion in wild-type control cells and such homeostatic response is impaired in GRAMD1 TKO cells, resulting in larger expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol in these cells. These results are now included in new Figure 6—figure supplement 2with relevant text changes in the fourth paragraph of the subsection “GRAMD1s play a role in PM to ER cholesterol transport during acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol”</p><p>Second, we removed all the data sets where D4H was expressed in cells from our revised manuscript (old Figure 7, Figure 7—figure supplement 1, Figure 7—figure supplement 2, Figure 7—figure supplement 3, and Figure 7—figure supplement 4)and replaced them with new data sets that we obtained from microscopy-based endpoint assays where a recombinant EGFP-D4H protein was used as a probe to assess the accessible pool of PM cholesterol. We repeated various rescue experiments, including the rapamycin-induced acute PM recruitment of chimeric GRAMD1b proteins, and obtained results that confirm the roles of GRAMD1s in regulating the size of accessible cholesterol pools in the PM. These new results are now included in new Figure 7, new Figure 7—figure supplement 1, new Figure 7—figure supplement 2, and new Figure 7—figure supplement 3. Accordingly, we made necessary text changes in the subsections “PM cholesterol states are altered in GRAMD1 TKO cells” and “Acute recruitment of GRAMD1b to ER-PM contacts in GRAMD1 TKO cells restores PM cholesterol states”. Our results are consistent with the important roles of GRAMD1s in regulating the accessibility of cholesterol in the PM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If GRAMD1 proteins play a unique role in determining the size of accessible cholesterol pools in the PM, then their effect should not be influenced by high-level expression of other cholesterol transporters such as STARD4 or the OSBP family members. This can be easily tested by the authors in the cell lines they have generated.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for suggesting this important experiment. In the previous manuscript, we showed that SMase treatment induced enhanced PM recruitment of exogenously expressed EGFP-tagged GRAM domain of GRAMD1b (EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub>) in GRAMD1 TKO cells and that such phenotype was rescued by re-expression of GRAMD1b. Using this assay, we tested if overexpression of other cholesterol transporters, including STARD4 and selected OSBP family members could compensate the loss of GRAMD1s (thereby rescuing the enhanced PM recruitment of EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub> in GRAMD1 TKO cells). We expressed either one of mCherry-tagged STARD4, mRuby-tagged OSBP, mRuby-tagged ORP4, or mRuby-tagged ORP9, individually together with EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub> in GRAMD1 TKO cells and stimulated cells with SMase. While GRAMD1b was rapidly recruited to the PM upon SMase treatment, none of the other cholesterol transporters were recruited to the PM, demonstrating the unique property of GRAMD1s to respond to acute increase in the PM cholesterol accessibility. Accordingly, none of these proteins suppressed the enhanced PM recruitment of EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub> in TKO cells. These new results are now included in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 with relevant text changes in the subsection “The cholesterol transporting property of the StART-like domain of GRAMD1s is critical for the clearance of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The liposome experiments showing the interaction of GRAM domains with cholesterol-containing membranes are well executed. To rule out the possibility of other membrane factors affecting binding, the authors could test whether other non-bilayer forming lipids such as PE can replace cholesterol. Also, the phospholipid acyl chain saturation has profound effects on accessibility of cholesterol. This can also be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the nice comments on our liposome-based experiments. We performed additional liposome experiments as suggested by the reviewers and included these new results in the revised manuscript.</p><p>First, we examined if PE would show similar effects as cholesterol by replacing cholesterol with PE. The GRAM domain did not bind liposomes that contained PE instead of cholesterol, demonstrating the specificity of cholesterol in the binding of the GRAM domain. These new results are included in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2A with relevant text changes in the subsection “The GRAM domains of GRAMD1s act as coincidence detector of unsequestered cholesterol and anionic lipids and sense the accessibility of cholesterol”.</p><p>Second, we examined the effect of the phospholipid acyl chain saturation and branching on membrane binding of the GRAM domain. We generated liposomes containing fixed amounts of phosphatidylserine (20%) with varying ratios of cholesterol and phosphatidylcholine. We individually tested either one of the three types of phosphatidylcholine that possesses different acyl chain structures, namely POPC, DOPC, and DPhyPC. The binding of GRAM domain of GRAMD1b to liposomes shifted to lower cholesterol concentration as the ordering tendency of phosphatidylcholine is lowered (i.e. as cholesterol sequestration effect is reduced). These results are consistent with the ability of the GRAM domain to sense the accessibility of cholesterol in membranes. Citing several key references suggested by the reviewers (e.g. Radhakrishnan et al., 2000, Sokolov and Radhakrishnan, 2010, Gay et al., 2015), these new results are now included in new Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, C with relevant text changes in the sixth paragraph of the subsection “The GRAM domains of GRAMD1s act as coincidence detector of unsequestered cholesterol and anionic lipids and sense the accessibility of cholesterol”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) References to previous contributions to this field are incomplete.

Indeed, a more general role in sensing accessible cholesterol was explicitly proposed in the first paragraph of the Discussion of that paper. This should be acknowledged here.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment and apologize for this mistake. We toned down our sentences and acknowledged the contribution of the Tontonoz paper more properly.

We agree with the reviewers that such release of PM particles and GRAMD1s-mediated PM to ER transport can act as parallel mechanisms to remove accessible PM cholesterol.

The data supporting this latter claim (including the new Figure 6—figure supplement 2) are not very convincing. If GRAMD1 proteins are increasing the pool of accessible cholesterol, but not changing total cholesterol, then inaccessible cholesterol must be decreasing. How do the authors propose that the GRAMD1 proteins accomplish this redistribution? Probing for such a decrease using probes for inaccessible cholesterol (Endapally et al., 2019) would strengthen this argument. Alternatively, the data can be explained simply by a role for GRAMD1s in transporting accessible cholesterol, but not in regulating the accessibility of PM cholesterol.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important concern. We would like to clarify our claim. First of all, we <italic>did not</italic> propose that GRAMD1 proteins are increasing the pool of accessible cholesterol in any part of our original/revised manuscript. Instead, we have been proposing that the key function of GRAMD1s is to monitor/sense increase in accessible PM cholesterol by their GRAM domains and to transport accessible PM cholesterol to the ER by their StART-like domain when the accessible pool of PM cholesterol transiently expands. Such homeostatic function is important in cells to maintain normal levels of accessible cholesterol in the PM (i.e. to limit accessibility of PM cholesterol). This is evidenced by our original and new data showing that the lack of GRAMD1s results in changes in accessible pool of cholesterol in the PM in acute (e.g. sustained accumulation upon SMase treatment: Figure 4 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2 and the related data within the section of “GRAMD1s play a role in PM to ER cholesterol transport during acute expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol”) and chronic conditions (e.g. expansion at steady state: Figure 7 and Figure 7—figure supplement 2, using recombinant D4H proteins as specified by the reviewer in the first revision).</p><p>We agree with the reviewer/s that our data can be explained by a role for GRAMD1s in transporting accessible cholesterol. In fact, in the original Discussion section, we specifically stated, “All these phenotypes are consistent with defects in efficient PM to ER transport of the accessible pool of cholesterol.” We had also stated at the end of the Introduction, “Collectively, our findings provide evidence for novel cellular mechanisms by which GRAMD1s monitor and regulate PM cholesterol states in mammalian cells as one of the key homeostatic regulators. GRAMD1s dynamically localize to ER-PM contact sites and limit the accessibility of PM cholesterol by their ability to sense transient expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol, and to facilitate its transport to the ER, thereby regulating PM cholesterol homeostasis.”</p><p>Furthermore, we showed in the new Figure 7 (specifically by using endpoint assays where we measured direct binding of D4H to the PM after various treatments as suggested by the reviewer in the first revision) that the forced recruitment of wild-type GRAMD1b (but not a mutant version that is defective in cholesterol transport) to ER-PM contacts can reduce the binding of recombinant EGFP-D4H proteins to the PM in GRAMD1 TKO cells (Figure 7E, F). These results further support the direct role of GRAMD1s in extracting and transporting accessible cholesterol from the PM to the ER at these contacts (thereby limiting the accessibility of PM cholesterol).</p><p>Although we tried to explain this notion (i.e. our data can be explained by a role for GRAMD1s in transporting accessible cholesterol) explicitly in our original and revised manuscript, we realize that we use “regulating the accessibility of PM cholesterol” in some parts of our manuscript as if it was another separable function of GRAMD1s (including within the previous rebuttal letter). We apologize if such phrasing caused confusion regarding the functions of GRAMD1s to the reviewer/s. We have revised the texts throughout the manuscript to remove or clarify “regulating the accessibility of PM cholesterol” to be consistent with our claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors seem to have misunderstood the suggestion to test whether STARD4 or ORPs can substitute for GRAMD1 proteins. The question is not whether these other transporter proteins can localize to the PM but whether they can also influence the size of the accessible cholesterol pool (by D4H binding for instance). This measurement may give insights into unique roles of GRAMD1 proteins.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify our experiments. We performed these experiments specifically to test if overexpression of STARD4 and ORPs would rescue/influence exaggerated expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol in GRAMD1 TKO cells upon SMase treatment [by using EGFP-tagged GRAM domain (EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub>) as a biosensor to detect increase in the size of accessible PM cholesterol pool in combination with total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) imaging technique to focus on the PM] (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, D).</p><p>In the original manuscript, we presented that cells lacking GRAMD1s showed enhanced PM recruitment of EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub> upon SMase treatment compared to wild-type control cells (i.e. exaggerated expansion of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol) (Figure 4D, E). We showed that such enhanced PM recruitment of EGFP-GRAM<sub>1b</sub> can be rescued by wild-type GRAMD1b but not by a mutant GRAMD1b that is defective in cholesterol transport (Figure 5E). Thus, our live cell imaging-based assay is sensitive enough to examine whether overexpression of other cholesterol transporters, including ORPs and STARDs, are sufficient to substitute the functions of GRAMD1s or not. Our results demonstrate that the function of GRAMD1s cannot be substituted by STARD4 or ORPs in our imaging-based assay (Figure 5—figure supplement 2B, D). Based on these considerations, we revised the text accordingly to avoid confusion (subsection “The cholesterol transporting property of the StART-like domain of GRAMD1s is critical for the clearance of the accessible pool of PM cholesterol”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
