Proper localization of signaling arrays is mediated by ParP, which tethers arrays to a cell pole anchor, ParC. Here we show that ParP’s C-terminus integrates into the core-unit of signaling arrays through interactions with MCP-proteins and CheA. Its intercalation within core-units stimulates array formation, whereas its N-terminal interaction domain enables polar recruitment of arrays and facilitates its own polar localization. Linkage of these domains within ParP couples array formation and localization and results in controlled array positioning at the cell pole. Notably, ParP’s integration into arrays modifies its own and ParC’s subcellular localization dynamics, promoting their polar retention. ParP serves as a critical nexus that regulates the localization dynamics of its network constituents and drives the localized assembly and stability of the chemotactic machinery, resulting in proper cell pole development.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31058.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Many bacteria live in a liquid environment and explore their surroundings by swimming. When in search of food, bacteria are able to swim toward the highest concentration of food molecules in the environment by a process called chemotaxis. Proteins important for chemotaxis group together in large networks called chemotaxis arrays. In the bacterium <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> chemotaxis arrays are placed at opposite ends (at the “cell poles”) of the bacterium by a protein called ParP. This makes sure that when the bacterium divides, each new cell receives a chemotaxis array and can immediately search for food. In cells that lack ParP, the chemotaxis arrays are no longer placed correctly at the cell poles and the bacteria search for food much less effectively.</p><p>To understand how ParP is able to direct chemotaxis arrays to the cell poles in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> Alvarado et al. searched for partner proteins that could help ParP position the arrays. The search revealed that ParP interacts with other proteins in the chemotaxis arrays. This enables ParP to integrate into the arrays and stimulate new arrays to form. Alvarado et al. also discovered that ParP consists of two separate parts that have different roles. One part directs ParP to the cell pole while the other part integrates ParP into the arrays. By performing both of these roles, ParP links the positioning of the arrays at the cell pole to their formation at this site.</p><p>The findings presented by Alvarado et al. open many further questions. For instance, it is not understood how ParP affects how other chemotaxis proteins within the arrays interact with each other. As well as enabling many species of bacteria to spread through their environment, chemotaxis is also important for the disease-causing properties of many human pathogens – like <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. As a result, learning how chemotaxis is regulated could potentially identify new ways to stop the spread of infectious bacteria and prevent human infections.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Vibrio cholerae</kwd><kwd>Chemotaxis</kwd><kwd>ParP</kwd><kwd>array formation</kwd><kwd>array localization</kwd><kwd>ParC</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007769</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Institut für Terrestrische Mikrobiologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ringgaard</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RI 2820/1-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ringgaard</surname><given-names>Simon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R37 AI-042347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldor</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Waldor</surname><given-names>Matthew K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Formation and cell pole-localization of chemotactic signaling-arrays is a coupled process mediated by ParP, which drives localized array-assembly and regulates the localization-dynamics of its network constituents.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chemotaxis is one of the primary means by which motile bacteria sense, respond, and adapt to changing environmental conditions. This process enables motile bacteria to perceive changes in local concentrations of chemicals; as a result, they can bias their movement away from unfavorable chemical stimuli and towards more favorable compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sourjik and Armitage, 2010</xref>). In the best studied model organism <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, chemotaxis is mediated by an array of highly organized macromolecular complexes built from core chemotaxis units. The core units are themselves composed of a highly organized set of chemotaxis signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). In general, the chemotaxis signaling cascade is initiated upon the detection of chemotactic stimuli by methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins (MCPs). These membrane-spanning receptors then interact with a cytoplasmic histidine kinase, CheA, while the adaptor protein CheW stabilizes this interaction and participates in regulating CheA kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ortega et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parkinson et al., 2015</xref>). A phosphosignaling cascade is initiated via CheA and its cognate response regulator CheY. Phosphorylated CheY induces a change in flagellar rotation and consequently in the direction of bacterial swimming, which over time results in net movement towards a more favorable environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wadhams and Armitage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sourjik and Armitage, 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31058.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ParP contributes to signaling array formation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the domain architecture of the MCP dimer.

Importantly, the tip contains sites for forming trimers of receptor dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Parkinson et al., 2015</xref>), and for binding to CheA and CheW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piasta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pedetta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassidy et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The histidine kinase CheA is comprised of five separate domains (P1 to P5) with specific functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, green). P1 is the phosphotransfer domain and contains the substrate histidine for autophosphorylation; P2 binds CheY for phosphotransfer from P1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Swanson et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrison and Parkinson, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilwes et al., 1999</xref>); P3 is the dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassidy et al., 2015</xref>); P4 is the kinase or ATP binding domain; and P5 is an SH3-like regulatory domain, which binds the signaling tip of MCPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkovich et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gegner et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bilwes et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao and Parkinson, 2006</xref>). The adaptor protein CheW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, red) consists of a single SH3-like domain, and is structurally similar to P5 of CheA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griswold et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassidy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Together, MCPs, CheA, and CheW form stable core signaling complexes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, one CheA dimer joins two MCP trimer-of-dimers and two CheW proteins. The helix formed by the dimerization of the P3 domains of CheA positions itself between the two MCP dimer-of-trimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Hazelbauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briegel et al., 2014a</xref>) and each P5 domain of a CheA dimer binds to one CheW. Therefore, a single core unit is arranged in a hexagonal structure held together by contacts between: (i) CheA-MCPs, (ii) CheW-MCPs and (iii) CheA-CheW. According to the current model, further hexagonal core units then join to form a super-lattice structure, commonly known as the chemosensory array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briegel et al., 2014a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piasta and Falke, 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In vivo and in vitro observations indicate that CheA-CheW interactions bridge the two receptor trimers of every core and give the array its characteristic stability and high sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao and Parkinson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hazelbauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erbse and Falke, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briegel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Hazelbauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Slivka and Falke, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sourjik and Wingreen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Briegel et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Piasta and Falke, 2014</xref>). However, while there is much knowledge of array structure, the mechanisms that underlie the formation and localization of these elaborate structures are incompletely understood, especially in systems other than <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p><p>As mentioned above, chemotaxis has been extensively studied in <italic>E. coli,</italic> a peritrichously flagellated bacterium. Here, array formation is thought to be a stochastic process in which individual receptors are inserted randomly in the membrane, and subsequently diffuse freely until they either join existing arrays or nucleate new ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thiem and Sourjik, 2008</xref>). This process results in a non-uniform distribution of signaling arrays at cell poles and randomly along the cell length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sourjik and Berg, 2000</xref>), and likely ensures that sensory arrays are in close proximity to the lateral flagella. In organisms such as <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>, and several <italic>Vibrio</italic> species, chemosensory arrays are actively localized to the cell poles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alley et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maddock and Shapiro, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wadhams et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bardy and Maddock, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>). In the polarly flagellated pathogens <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> and <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus,</italic> we recently reported that chemosensory arrays are exclusively localized at one or both cell poles by a mechanism that depends on the partner proteins ParC and ParP, both of which are encoded within the chemotaxis operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yamaichi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>). For <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> chemotaxis proteins encoded by chemotaxis operon II, e.g. CheA1 and CheW1, are directed to the cell pole by ParC and ParP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ringgaard et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Briegel et al., 2016</xref>), and from here on, CheA and CheW will be used instead of CheA1 and CheW1, respectively. In newborn <italic>Vibrio</italic> cells, these signaling arrays are exclusively localized to the old flagellated cell pole, then recruited to the new cell pole as cells enlarge, resulting in a bi-polar localization pattern. Thus, at cell division each daughter cell inherits a signaling array positioned at its old pole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2014</xref>). In the absence of either ParC or ParP, the chemotaxis arrays are no longer properly recruited to the cell poles. Instead, signaling arrays form and localize randomly along the cell length, and bi-polar localization is not established prior to cell division. Therefore, daughter cells do not faithfully inherit a signaling array at their old poles, resulting in altered motility and decreased chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2014</xref>).</p><p>ParC mediates polar localization of ParP, which in turn interacts with a specific domain of CheA that is only present in CheA proteins with an associated ParC/ParP-system (CheA-LID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>). ParP prevents dissociation of CheA from chemotaxis arrays and disruption of either ParP-ParC or ParP-CheA interactions results in defective recruitment of chemotaxis arrays to the cell poles, leading to their random instead of polar localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">2014</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms by which this protein interaction network governs the dynamic localization of chemotactic signaling arrays remain to be elucidated. Notably, there is little knowledge of how factors promoting array positioning are able to access and guide localization of chemotaxis proteins. In particular, it is not clear how such factors are integrated within the widely conserved structure of signaling arrays.</p><p>Here, using <italic>V. cholerae</italic> as a model organism, we analyze how ParP is able to gain access to and interact with chemotaxis proteins positioned within the highly ordered structure of signaling arrays and how it mediates their intracellular localization. We identify MCP proteins as a new interaction partner for ParP. Via interactions with MCPs and CheA, ParP is a part of the chemotaxis core unit and integrates into the chemotactic signaling arrays. Importantly, ParP integrates into arrays and promotes their formation via a C-terminal Array Integration and Formation (AIF) domain, which is linked to ParP’s N-terminal ParC interaction domain. Linkage of these domains within ParP couples array formation and localization and results in localized formation of arrays at the cell poles and thus promotes cell pole maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ParP contributes to signaling array formation</title><p>To address how ParP is able to access chemotaxis proteins within signaling arrays in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>, we analyzed array localization in wild-type, <italic>cheA1, parP</italic> and <italic>cheA1 parP</italic> deletion backgrounds using a functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>) YFP-CheW1 fusion as a marker for array localization and formation. In wild-type cells YFP-CheW1 mainly localized in clusters at the cell poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). In contrast to localization in wild-type cells, in the absence of ParP, YFP-CheW1 clusters were not recruited to the cell poles, but were instead mislocalized along the cell length or completely absent in 74% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>).

For both strains, chemotaxis arrays were detectable and indistinguishable in structure, consisting of an inner membrane-anchored array of MCP proteins and an associated cytosolic baseplate. Out of 61 cells imaged with cryo-EM for each strain, there was a 60% reduction in the number of cells with observable arrays in the Δ<italic>cheA</italic> background compared to wild-type – consistent with a role of CheA in stimulating array formation. However, the cryo-EM experiments reveal that ordered signaling arrays can still form in the absence of CheA. Furthermore, these cryo-EM images strongly suggest that the YFP-CheW1 clusters reflect the localization and formation of properly structured arrays in the absence of CheA, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that YFP-CheW1 clusters may reflect misformed or variant states of supramolecular complexes in some cells. Strikingly, in the double deletion strain <italic>∆cheA1 ∆parP</italic>, YFP-CheW1 did not form clusters but was localized diffusely in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CE</xref>, bottom). Immunoblot analysis showed that the difference in localization of YFP-CheW1 was not due to differences in expression levels or cleavage of the YFP moiety from the YFP-CheW1 fusion construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data indicate that formation of signaling arrays is severely compromised in the absence of both ParP and CheA, and that CheW1 alone only has a minor effect on array formation but requires the presence of either ParP or CheA, which individually are sufficient for promoting array formation. These data are supported by cryo-EM analyses of the <italic>∆cheA1 ∆parP</italic> strain, in which out of 61 imaged cells there was an 85% reduction in the number of cells with detectable signaling arrays compared to wild-type. Together, these observations suggest that ParP participates in the process of array formation in addition to its previously known function in promoting polar localization of signaling arrays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ParP interacts with the signaling domain of methyl-accepting-chemotaxis proteins</title><p>To further investigate how ParP contributes to array formation and localization, we performed a screen to identify additional ParP interaction partners.

The highly conserved protein interaction tip within the MCP signaling domain is responsible for interactions with CheW and CheA-P5 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Hazelbauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cassidy et al., 2015</xref>).

We chose MCP VC1898, the MCP with the strongest signal for interaction with ParP, to create individual amino acid substitution variants (VC1898-L518R, L521R, N522R, A524R; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and tested their interaction capabilities. Three of the four substitutions (L518R, L521R, and N522R) disrupted the capacity of the MCP to interact with CheW1, but not with itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, the same substitutions also abolished the interaction between the MCP and ParP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Since the MCP variants retained the ability to self-interact, the effect on their interactions with CheW1 and ParP is likely not due to reduced expression levels of the MCP variants. Moreover, we tested the L518R variant for interaction with ParP in the <italic>E. coli</italic> VS296 co-expression assay. Notably, YFP-ParP no longer formed clusters co-localizing with mCherry-MCP-L518R clusters, but instead localized diffusely in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) in 95% of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), indicating that the L518R substitution abrogates the capacity of YFP-ParP and mCherry-MCP to interact. Altogether, these observations suggest that ParP-AIF targets the same MCP residues that mediate MCPinteractions with CheW and CheA, and thus lends support to the idea that ParP is a component of the chemotaxis core unit of signaling arrays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>A conserved hydrophobic pocket within the SH3-like domain of ParP mediates interaction with MCP signaling domains</title><p>While ParP-AIF domains form their own distinct clade of SH3-domains, they are more similar to the P5 domain of CheAs than to CheWs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). CheW and CheA-P5 are each composed of two subdomains (1 and 2) and the junction between the two subdomains contains branched hydrophobic residues that form a groove mediating interaction with the MCP interaction tip (in CheW from <italic>Thermotoga maritima</italic> MSB8: V27, I30, L14, V33; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, red residues) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Griswold et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>). The AIF domain of ParP is predicted to have a similar overall protein architecture as CheA-P5 and CheW, and we hypothesized that the corresponding hydrophobic amino acids (L196, L209, L212A, and I215) in the junction between its putative subdomains function to promote ParP’s interactions with MCPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We replaced each of these amino acid residues with alanine, and evaluated each variant ParP’s capacity to interact with the MCP signaling domain (MCP-SD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). L196A, L209A, and to some extent L212A (but not I215A), showed reduced interaction with the MCP-SDs, supporting that ParP interacts with the MCP protein interaction tip via residues in its putative interaction groove, in a manner similar to the way in which CheW and CheA-P5 interact with the MCPs. Notably, this hybrid assay suggested that replacement of L209 with alanine (ParPL209A) completely disrupted interaction between ParP and MCP-SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, in the <italic>E. coli</italic> co-expression assay, YFP-ParPL209A did not co-localize with mCherry-MCP clusters, but were instead localized diffusely in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>), further indicating that this residue is involved in mediating ParP-MCP interactions. Thus, ParP appears to rely on analogous residues as CheW and CheA-P5 to interact with MCPs. Interestingly, L196A, L209A, and L212A are almost 100% conserved amongst ParP proteins, suggesting it is a general property of ParP proteins to interact with the MCP-SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31058.009</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Two distinct interaction interfaces of ParP-AIF mediate its interaction with MCP and CheA respectively.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of the SH3-like domains of CheW, CheA-P5 and ParP-AIF proteins.

ParP carrying both substitutions (ParPL209A-W305A, denoted ParP2PM) did not interact with either CheA or the MCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

Since ParP’s N-terminus mediates interaction with ParC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>), ParP has at least three distinct interaction interfaces. These distinct interaction surfaces potentially allow ParP to simultaneously couple two critical signaling components (MCP and CheA) to the polar determinant ParC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, ParP is a protein of high connectivity upon which both the chemotactic signaling network, as well as the system responsible for cell pole development, depend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Interaction with MCPs or CheA is required for association of ParP with signaling arrays</title><p>We monitored localization of YFP-ParP and its variants co-expressed with CFP-CheW1 (a marker of arrays), to address whether ParP interactions with MCPs and/or CheA are required for its capacity to associate with signaling arrays.

In ~75% of cells, YFP-ParP and CFP-CheW1 formed co-localized clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Similarly, in ~50–55% of cells, CFP-CheW1 clusters were co-localized with those of YFP-ParPL209A or YFP-ParPW305A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Thus, ParP’s association with signaling arrays can be mediated by its interaction with either MCPs or CheA, though its capacity to interact with both these array components likely enhances its association with arrays. In striking contrast, when we expressed a ParP variant carrying both amino acid substitutions L209A and W305A (ParP2PM), which is unable to interact with either CheA or MCPs, fused to YFP (YFP-ParP2PM), almost no YFP-ParP2PM clusters were observed, despite the presence of CFP-CheW1 clusters in ~55% of cells.

Thus, the ParC-interaction domain of ParP is capable of mediating polar localization of signaling arrays independent of the AIF-domain if fused to a protein that is part of the chemotaxis core unit and participates in array formation and structure (the CheA P5-domain). Collectively these observations suggest that ParP’s capacity to localize arrays at the cell pole (mediated by its ParC-interaction domain) can operate independently of its capacity to promote array formation (mediated by AIF), and thus that ParP couples two distinct and separable functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Integration of ParP within signaling arrays is required for their polar localization and inheritance</title><p>To test if the incorporation of ParP into signaling arrays and its facilitation of array formation had functional consequences on the polar localization of arrays, the localization of signaling arrays was determined in a set of ParP interaction mutants.

We performed FRAP (fluorescence-recovery-after-photobleaching) analysis on YFP-ParP and YFP-ParP2PM, to monitor the recruitment of new ParP molecules to the cell pole. After photobleaching of polar YFP-ParP and YFP-ParP2PM polar foci, we monitored the recovery of polar YFP fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>). These experiments showed that there was a continuous recruitment of new ParP and ParP2PM from the cytoplasm to the cell pole, however, no significant difference in recovery rate was observed between the two ParP variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–E</xref>). Next we measured the release of YFP-ParP and YFP-ParP2PM from polar clusters by bleaching the cytoplasmic signal from YFP-ParP and YFP-ParP2PM in cells with uni-polarly localized foci. The intensity of polar clusters was subsequently measured and plotted relative to the initial intensity as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>). Post-bleach, the intensity of polar YFP-ParP and YFP-ParP2PM clusters decreased over time, demonstrating that both protein versions are continuously released from the polar clusters. However, the decay curves for the two ParP variants differed significantly: ParP reached a steady state after about 5 min, while ParP2PM was released at a faster rate than wild-type ParP, and the YFP-ParP2PM intensity continued to drop for over 11 min. This suggests ParP2PM is released from polar clusters to the cytoplasm to a much greater extent than wild-type ParP. Together, these experiments show that there is a continuous release of ParP molecules from the pole to the cytoplasm and recruitment of new ParP from the cytoplasm to the cell pole. Moreover, they reveal that ParP’s capacity to interact with MCPs and CheA (and thereby integrate into signaling arrays) prevents its release, and as such promotes its retention, at the cell pole and consequently stabilizes its localization at this site.</p></sec><sec id="s2-12"><title>Integration of ParP within signaling arrays is required for proper polar localization of ParC</title><p>We also tested if ParP’s ability to interact with the chemotaxis proteins MCP and CheA influenced the intracellular localization of the polar localization determinant ParC by ectopically expressing a functional YFP-ParC fusion protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>) in wild-type and <italic>parP2PM</italic> background strains.

However, it is not well understood how factors responsible for array positioning are able to access chemotaxis proteins within arrays to mediate localization. In addition to interacting with ParC and CheA, we found that ParP also interacts with MCP proteins. ParP interacts with the MCP interaction tip domain in a manner analogous to CheA and CheW proteins and promotes array formation. Thus, ParP, like CheA and CheW, appears to be a component of the chemotaxis core unit. Mapping of ParP’s interaction interfaces revealed that its C-terminal SH3-like AIF domain includes distinct surfaces that enable interaction with MCPs and CheA. Furthermore, its N-terminal ParC interaction domain is responsible for recruitment of ParP and signaling arrays to the cell pole. The linkage of these domains within ParP couples array formation and localization and results in localized formation of arrays at the cell poles. By stimulating polar array formation, ParP also promotes its own and ParC’s polar localization. Collectively, by defining ParP’s interaction network and interfaces, we uncovered how this protein couples array formation and polar localization.</p><p>We identified MCP proteins as essential interaction partners for ParP. The screen identified 15 distinct MCPs, and all but two MCPs of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> possess the motif within the conserved protein interaction tip that mediates ParP-MCP interaction. The screen likely only identified 15 of the 45 predicted MCPs encoded by <italic>V. cholerae</italic> because only ~50,000 colonies were screened, and thus the screen was not comprehensive. Furthermore, the screen only identifies ParP interaction partners that were fused in frame with the <italic>t18</italic> gene during library generation. These factors likely explain why a subset of MCPs, as well as known interaction partners ParC and CheA were not identified in the screen.</p><p>ParP integrates into signaling arrays through its interactions via its AIF domain with the conserved protein interaction tip of MCP proteins and with CheA. Through these complex interactions, ParP promotes array formation rather than compromising array structure. ParP-AIF’s similarity to CheW and CheA-P5 in regions that mediate interaction with MCP suggests that ParP might compete with CheW and CheA-P5 for MCP binding, and thereby to become part of the chemotactic core unit. Previous studies indicate that other proteins with SH3-like structures compete to become part of the array in a comparable manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Asinas and Weis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erbse and Falke, 2009</xref>); e.g., CheV can replace CheW (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexander et al., 2010</xref>) and CheA-P5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>) within signaling arrays. Although CheW, CheA-P5 and ParP-AIF all appear to have the capacity to recognize and bind the MCP interaction tip within the chemotactic core unit, all have distinct functions and interestingly form their own distinct clades of SH3-like domains. Thus, evolution has exploited the ability of the SH3 domain to interact with MCPs within the core unit of arrays for diverse functions including signal transduction, array formation and the intracellular localization of signaling arrays.</p><p>Transactions between ParP and its array partners - MCPs and the LID domain of CheA - likely reflect the balancing of the requirement for an additional array component mediating array localization (ParP) with preservation of array structure and function. Arrays can still form if one of ParP or CheA is absent, due to the presence of the other. owever, in the absence of both proteins, the chemotaxis core unit is no longer assembled and signaling arrays are barely able to form. Arrays form at almost wild-type levels in the absence of CheA, suggesting that ParP is able to fully replace CheA within the core unit. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that ParP also is able to compete with CheW for integration into the core unit. In the prevailing model of array structure, two CheA proteins are present within a core unit, dimerized through their P3 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, type #1) – an interaction that contributes to array stability and signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briegel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li and Hazelbauer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Briegel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Briegel et al., 2014b</xref>). If ParP-AIF replaces a CheA protein within the arrays, CheA dimerization, and its associated array stabilization, would be lost; however, it was shown that the ParP-CheA interaction (via CheA-LID) reduces dissociation of CheA from arrays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>) and thereby provides an alternate means of stabilization. Thus, our data are consistent with a model where ParP-AIF replaces some CheA-P5 in binding the MCP interaction tip within the chemotaxis core unit, and is tethered there through binding to the LID domain of the remaining CheA of the core unit. Presumably this AIF-LID interaction is able to substitute for the absence of CheA-P3 dimerization within the core unit and thus maintains the stability of the array structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, type #2). Since ParP is able to dimerize via its N-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ringgaard et al., 2014</xref>), it is also possible that a ParP dimer is able to replace the CheA dimer within the core unit of wild-type cells, resulting in a core unit comprised of two CheWs and a ParP dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, type #3). Core units consisting only of CheW, ParP, and MCPs presumably constitute the arrays observed within a CheA-deficient strain, which form at close to wild-type levels. Additional studies will be required to elucidate whether interactions between ParP/CheW and ParP/CheA-P5 occur and the factors that modulate the MCP interaction tip’s accessibility to different partners. In a wild-type background arrays might consist of all three types of core units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas in the <italic>ΔparP</italic> and <italic>ΔcheA</italic> deletion backgrounds, arrays consist of type #1 and type #3 core units only, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, it is also a possibility that the flexible dimerization domain of ParP could link ParP proteins from neighboring core units, and in this way augment retention of ParP itself and chemotaxis proteins within the array, thereby contributing to array stability and ultimately their sequestration at the cell pole via ParP’s ParC interaction domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31058.019</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Model of ParP’s integration within the chemotactic core unit.</title><p>Schematic model of potential ParP interactions in the chemotaxis core unit – discussed in detail in the main text.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-31058-fig9-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig9s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31058.020</object-id><label>Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Chemotaxis core-unit- and array structure in different strain backgrounds.</title><p>In wild-type cells three distinct core unit occurs and the arrays might consist of all three types of core units.

In <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, a ParA-like protein, PpfA, (ParC is also a ParA-like protein) is thought to ensure proper segregation and positioning of the cytosolic chemotaxis arrays over the bacterial nucleoid by means similar to that used by ParA proteins involved in plasmid segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). PpfA mediates array localization in concert with a predicted cytoplasmic chemoreceptor TlpT, which, in combination with a CheW, is required for array formation. TlpT interacts with PpfA via its N-terminus, thereby likely stimulating PpfA ATPase activity – an action that is required for PpfA function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wadhams et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roberts et al., 2012</xref>). It is possible that TlpT integrates into the cytoplasmic arrays, bridging chemotaxis proteins and PpfA to promote array formation and localization in a manner similar to that of ParP.</p><p>Importantly, ParP’s interactions with the chemotaxis proteins in the core unit (CheA and MCPs) are also important for ParC-mediated sequestration of ParP at the poles and for the polar localization of ParC itself. Disruption of ParP’s interactions with MCPs and CheA resulted in a much higher percentage of non-polar (cytosolic) ParC and ParP. Thus, although ParC is still able to recruit ParP to the cell poles, sequestration of ParC and ParP at this site is diminished when ParP interactions with MCPs and CheA are disrupted. As seen with ParC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ringgaard et al., 2011</xref>), here we show that there is a continuous exchange of ParP between the cell pole and the cytoplasm. Our photobleaching-based comparisons of ParP and ParP2PM suggest that ParP’s capacity to integrate into signaling arrays does not influence its recruitment to the cell pole. In contrast, the capacity of ParP to bind MCPs and CheA and integrate into signaling arrays had a significant impact on its release from the pole into the cytoplasm. Particularly, that integration of ParP into signaling arrays prevents the release of ParP molecules from the cell pole and consequently promotes its retention at this site. Thus, ParP’s integration into arrays modifies its own and likely in turn ParC’s subcellular localization dynamics, promoting their polar retention.</p><p>We have shown that ParP is a protein of high network connectivity and functions as an important nexus that facilitates chemotaxis array formation, array localization, and regulates the localization dynamics of its network elements. ParP retains partial function as long as one of its network connections to the core unit exists (i.e. to either CheA or MCPs). Only loss of both ParP’s connections to the core unit results in a non-functional ParP variant. In contrast, when either of its connections to the core unit are disrupted, the retention of ParP, and ParC, at the cell pole is compromised to the same extend as when both connections simultaneously are disrupted. This suggests that when a ParP loses a network connection to the core unit, ParP is still able to function partially in mediating polar array localization due to the other connection, however, the ability of ParP to mediate retention of its network constituents at the cell pole is lost – ultimately resulting in its partial loss of function. This further emphasizes the importance of ParP’s interconnectivity within the chemotaxis protein interaction network in regulating the polar retention of itself and its network constituents and in mediating the proper polar localization of chemotactic signaling arrays.</p><p>Taken together our findings show that ParP’s high connectivity allows it to serve as a critical nexus that regulates the temporal dynamics of its network constituents and stabilizes the polar localization of the cell-pole anchor ParC and itself. Furthermore, it facilitates the localized assembly and inheritance of signaling arrays at the pole, hereby ensuring proper cell pole development.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th colspan="2" valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>parP</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2613440</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V.cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>cheA</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2613443</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V. cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>vca0068</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2612100</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V. cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>vc1868</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2613622</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V.cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>cheW</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2613439</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V. cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>parC</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2613441</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V. cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>mcp; vc1898</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2613527</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>V. cholerae</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>vca0658</italic></td><td colspan="2" valign="top">N/A</td><td valign="top">NCBI-GeneID: 2612769</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain (<italic>V. cholerae</italic> N16961)</td><td valign="top">wild type</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">Clinical isolate</td><td valign="top">NCBI-Taxonomy ID: 243277</td><td valign="top">For complete strain list see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-GFP</td><td colspan="2" valign="top">Clontech Laboratories, Inc.

Samples from different strains were normalized to optical density and subjected to western-blot analysis using JL8 anti-GFP antibodies (also recognizing YFP). As a positive control, a strain only expressing YFP was included. Additionally, a strain not expressing any YFP variant was included as a negative control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Photobleaching time-lapse experiments</title><p>Photobleaching time-lapse experiments were performed using the Andor FRAPPA system. Cells were treated and mounted on agarose pads as described for fluorescence microscopy of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells. For FRAP experiments, a point-of-interest was bleached using a 515 nm laser at 7% intensity. For bleaching of the cytoplasm, a region-of-interest corresponding to 2/3 of the cell length was chosen and bleached with 1 pulse using a 515 nm laser at 7% intensity. Cells were then imaged over time. For each time-point the fluorescence intensity at the cell pole was then calculated relative to the pre-bleach intensity and plotted as a function of time. Graphs represent the average intensity of the indicated number of cells analyzed, with error-bars representing SEM. The total number of cells analyzed (n) is mentioned in the figure.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic trees</title><p>In generation of multiple sequence alignments of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> MCPs and ParP orthologues, respectively, we used the MUSCLE tool at default settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar, 2004</xref>).

For each strain, 3 µl cell culture were applied to a freshly plasma-cleaned R2/2 copper Quantifoil grid (Quantifoil Micro Tools, Jena, Germany). Plunge freezing was carried out with a Leica EMGP (Leica microsystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Excessive liquid was wicked off from the grid by 1 s blotting inside the chamber set at room temperature and 95% humidity. Grids were plunge frozen in liquid ethane at −183°C and then stored in liquid nitrogen until imaging. Cryo EM images were collected on a Talos L120C transmission electron microscope (Thermo Fisher Scientific (formerly FEI), Hillsboro, OR, USA) operating at 120 kV. All targets were randomly picked, manually located and imaged in low dose mode.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to Kathrin Schirner for comments on the manuscript and suggestions for experiments.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Gisela Storz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Grant Bowman (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The authors present a detailed study that addresses some important unanswered questions about the mechanism of chemotaxis array assembly. It makes significant strides in elucidating the role of ParP, a protein currently known as being important for array assembly and localization, yet its specific role is unclear. The manuscript identifies ParP as a central component in the core complex of the chemoreceptor array, by providing strong evidence that this protein participates in physical interactions with multiple core components. Interestingly, the results suggest competition between ParP, CheA, and CheW for binding to MCP tip, and that the same domain of ParP contains two genetically and functionally separable binding sites for MCP and CheA. The resulting model, though still incomplete insofar as describing a complete view of array formation (and especially the polar localization of assembled arrays), makes significant advancements in understanding the complex and interesting problem of polar chemotaxis array assembly.</p><p>Some modifications should be however made for the paper to be acceptable for publication:</p><p>- The authors refer to &quot;chemosensory arrays&quot; when they only observe fluorescent clusters throughout the study. Granted these clusters might reflect ordered arrays but it is also possible that they represent supramolecular complexes in various states, which might change depending on the genetic background. For example, what is the evidence that the chemotaxis proteins are indeed organized in hexagonal arrays in a CheA mutant? From the study, this conclusion is only inferred from a polar CheW-YFP cluster. The authors should make it clear when <underline>an ordered array</underline> is hypothesized.</p><p>- All reviewers agree that the FRAP analysis only shows modest differences that could have methodological origins. As presented, the FRAP data only shows that Polar ParP (WT and mutant) do exchange quite rapidly with the polar pool. The FRAP analysis could be deleted. Alternatively it should be expanded, perhaps by performing FRAP experiments on CheW-YFP clusters and explore the supramolecular complexes discussed above ?</p><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-C</xref>: In this experiment, the P2M mutant did not show an increased effect over single mutants, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the additive effect of the P2M mutant is apparent.

We have addressed this point by performing cryo electron microscopy to evaluate array formation and structure in wild-type and <italic>cheA</italic> mutant cells. The results of these experiments are now shown as “<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>”. The following new paragraph describing our findings has been added to the revised manuscript in the first section of the Results (“ParP contributes to signaling array formation”):</p><p>“To analyze if arrays are still properly formed in the absence of CheA, we performed cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) on wild-type and <italic>ΔcheA</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). […] Furthermore, these cryo-EM images strongly suggest that the YFP-CheW1 clusters reflect the localization and formation of properly structured arrays in the absence of CheA, although we cannot formally exclude the possibility that YFP-CheW1 clusters may reflect misformed or variant states of supramolecular complexes in some cells.”</p><p>Furthermore, a paragraph has been added to the “Materials and methods” section, which describes the methods used for cryo-EM of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> cells. The cryo-electron microscopy was carried out by Wen Yang and Ariane Briegel at the Institute of Biology, Leiden University, The Netherlands, and as such they have been added to the author list of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- All reviewers agree that the FRAP analysis only shows modest differences that could have methodological origins.

We have now performed statistical analysis on the recovery curves for wild-type and ParP2PM in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>. This analysis showed that, indeed, the reviewers are astute; there is no significant difference in recovery between wild-type ParP and ParP2PM (p-value added to the figure). We thank the reviewers for bringing this important point to our attention. However, we still think that the FRAP experiment is important to include in the manuscript, in order to show that there is a continuous recruitment of new ParP protein from the cytoplasm to the cell pole. We have now revised the manuscript accordingly, and it is no longer stated that ParP2PM has a faster recovery rate than wild-type ParP. Furthermore, we performed a significance test on the ParP decay experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F-G</xref> (p-value added to the figure). The decay experiment shows that ParP2PM has a significantly higher release from the cell pole than wild-type ParP. In fact, we think these changes strengthen the manuscript, since the FRAP experiment shows that integration of ParP into arrays does not affect ParP’s recruitment to the cell pole. While the decay assay shows that ParP’s capacity to interact with MCPs and CheA (and thereby integrate into signaling arrays) prevents its release, and as such promotes its retention at the cell pole, consequently stabilizing its localization at this site. Accordingly, we have changed the title of the paragraph to “Integration of ParP within signaling arrays promotes its retention at the cell pole”. We have also changed the Discussion accordingly to reflect these changes. The Discussion now reads: “As seen with ParC (Ringgaard et al., 2011), here we show that there is a continuous exchange of ParP between the cell pole and the cytoplasm. […] Thus, ParP’s integration into arrays modifies its own and likely in turn ParC’s subcellular localization dynamics, promoting their polar retention.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A-C</xref>: In this experiment, the P2M mutant did not show an increased effect over single mutants, but in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, the additive effect of the P2M mutant is apparent.

This might make it possible to determine if it is dependent on ParP self-interaction or interaction with ParC.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewers point out, there is a clear additive effect on combining the L209A and W305A aa-substitutions (ParP2PM) on the ability of ParP to associate with signaling arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and to recruit chemotaxis arrays to the cell pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). However, there is no additive effect of combining L209A and W305A on ParP’s own localization at the cell pole, which is almost equally compromised for both single (L209A and W305A, respectively) and double (ParP2PM) aa-substitutions in ParP. It is also important to note that both ParP’s association with arrays and ParP’s recruitment of arrays to the cell pole is compromised when its interaction to either CheA or MCP is disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) – and thus that disruption of either of ParP’s interactions to CheA or MCP results in a partial deficiency in ParP function.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Discussion (seventh paragraph): “We have shown that ParP is a protein of high network connectivity and functions as an important nexus that facilitates chemotaxis array formation, array localization, and regulates the localization dynamics of its network elements. […] This, further emphasizes the importance of ParP’s interconnectivity within the chemotactic protein interaction network in regulating the polar retention of itself and its network constituents and in mediating the proper polar localization of chemotactic signaling arrays.”</p><p>We believe this point had not been emphasized properly in the manuscript text, and we thank the reviewers for bringing it to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Discussion: The difference in the connections among ParP, CheW, and CheA in core chemotaxis units (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) versus their role in promoting interconnected arrays of core units (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) is confusing. Is it possible that ParP and / or CheA could be participating in one type of interaction but not the other? Could the loose dimerization domain of the ParP element shown in model 9-2 participate in linking with ParP proteins in neighboring arrays?</p></disp-quote><p>In order to clarify the role of ParP and CheA in promoting interconnected arrays of core units, we have added a new Figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), which depicts the structure of signaling arrays in wild-type, <italic>ΔparP, ΔcheA</italic>, and <italic>ΔparPΔcheA</italic> strain backgrounds. Furthermore, we agree with the reviewers that it is possible that the loose dimerization domain of the ParP element shown in model 9-2 could participate in linking with ParP proteins in neighboring core units. This is a very important point and we have added the following statement to the Discussion (fourth paragraph): “In a wild-type background arrays might consist of all three types of core units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), whereas in the <italic>ΔparP</italic> and <italic>ΔcheA</italic> deletion backgrounds, arrays consist of type #1 and type #3 core units only, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, it is also a possibility that the flexible dimerization domain of ParP could link ParP proteins from neighboring core units, and in this way augment retention of ParP itself and chemotaxis proteins within the array, thereby contributing to array stability and ultimately their sequestration at the cell pole via ParP’s ParC interaction domain.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- A description of the methods used to make the phylogenetic tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, or the reasons why representatives from the species shown in the multispecies alignments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> were chosen, is missing. Further, it is important to mention in the manuscript that E. coli does not have ParP or ParC homologs, because this greatly reduces the possibility that the interactions identified in the BACTH assay occur indirectly through a hypothetical additional factor, endogenous to E. coli, that exists for chemotaxis array assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a paragraph titled “Multiple sequence alignment and generation of phylogenetic trees” to the Materials and methods section of the manuscript. Here we describe the methods used to generate the multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees presented in the study. Furthermore, we describe the reasons why the representatives from the different species were chosen.</p><p>In order to make it more clear what MCPs were chosen for the sequence alignment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref> we added the following sentence: “Multiple sequence alignment of all predicted MCPs from <italic>V. cholerae</italic> against the sequence of MCP TM1143 from <italic>T. maritima</italic>, showed that these four residues are conserved in all of the MCPs identified in the two-hybrid screen and all but two putative MCPs found in <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>)”.</p><p>Furthermore, we agree with the reviewers that is important to mention that <italic>E. coli</italic> does not encode any ParP/ParC homologs. Thus, we have added the following statement to the manuscript: “It is important to note that <italic>E. coli</italic> does not encode homologs of either ParP or ParC, thus reducing the possibility of indirect interactions mediated by an endogenous <italic>E. coli</italic>, factor, and suggesting that interaction partners identified in this assay likely interact directly with ParP.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
