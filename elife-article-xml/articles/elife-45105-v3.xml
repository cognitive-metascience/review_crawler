In recent years, new methods have emerged to enable cell lineage tracking with increasing resolution, leading to substantial biological insights (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Woodworth et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, genome editing of reporter constructs via CRISPR-Cas9 allowed synthetic reconstruction of cell lineage relationships in model organisms, and has been coupled with transcriptome profiling to inform cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Spanjaard et al., 2018</xref>). These prospective âmutate-and-recordâ methods provide powerful tools to resolve the developmental origin of cells in genetically engineered cells and organisms, but cannot be utilized in living humans, archival clinical samples, or any wild type organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Woodworth et al., 2017</xref>). Given these limitations, retrospective lineage tracing using endogenous genetic markers is an alternative solution. Recent advances in sequencing enable naturally occurring somatic mutations to be used as lineage markers, which usually required single-cell genome sequencing to capture the sparse genetic information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lee-Six et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Regions with high mutation rates, such as microsatellite repeats, retrotransposons, and copy-number variants, has been used to resolve the lineage relationship for normal or cancerous tissue samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evrony et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Biezuner et al., 2016</xref>). These methods reduce the cost of whole genome sequencing, but still lack information on cell phenotypes.</p><p>Simultaneous measurement of the lineage relationship and cell fates is ultimately required to address many biomedical questions. Here we describe EMBLEM (<underline>E</underline>pigenome and <underline>M</underline>itochondrial <underline>B</underline>arcode of <underline>L</underline>ineage from <underline>E</underline>ndogenous <underline>M</underline>utations), a strategy to track cell lineage using endogenous mitochondrial DNA variants in ATAC-seq data. The end result of EMBLEM is single-cell lineage information and rich global epigenomic profile from the same individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45105.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>EMBLEM reveals cell lineage from mtDNA mutations.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) EMBLEM workflow.Â Usings standard ATAC-seq data as input (left), an SNV calling step was added to enumerate all single nucleotide variants in mtDNA (middle).

During DNA transposition and amplification in cells, mitochondrial DNA is also amplified at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is aÂ ~Â 16 kb circular genome withÂ ~10 fold higher mutation rate compared to the nuclear genome. Hence, mtDNA incrementally accumulates unique, irreversible genetic mutations that are passed on to daughter cells even in healthy humans and may be used for lineage tracing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Morris et al., 2017</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fellous et al., 2009</xref>). The majority of somatic mtDNA mutations are noncoding and thought to be passenger (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the number of mitochondria (and therefore mtDNA) range from several hundreds toÂ &gt;10,000 per cell in different cell types, facilitating robust mtDNA analysis even from a single cell.</p><p>We first observed that ATAC-seq effectively enriches for mtDNA. While mtDNA is present in many kinds of DNA sequence libraries, it is substantially enriched in ATAC-seq libraries due to the fact that mtDNA is not chromatinized and is therefore highly accessible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). ATAC-seq enables a 17-fold or greater enrichment of mtDNA compared to exome sequencing or whole genome sequencing in GM12878 human B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), leading to an averageÂ ~18,000X coverage of mtDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). With this coverage, we detected 27 mitochondrial variants from GM12878 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). 13 of these variants have a variant allele frequency (VAF) greater than 90%, which are known as homoplasmic variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). We also detected 14 low frequency mitochondrial DNA variants, with VAFs ranging from 0.1% to 24% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Similar results for mtDNA enrichment were observed in human K562 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The VAF from bulk ATAC-seq data represents the average of the allele frequencies of the cell population. A 25% VAF may arise from 25% of cells in the population with a homoplasmic variant, or alternatively arise from 100% of cells all having a quarter of their mitochondria with the variant allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). To distinguish between these two models, we analyzed single-cell ATAC-seq data from GM12878. For four mtDNA variants (VAF between 0.5%Â ~Â 24% at population level), we find that a mixture of both models is in action for different variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). For instance, mtDNA mutation 3082 is widely spread among single cells, but at low frequency per cell. Because it is extremely unlikely (see MaterialsÂ andÂ method) that the identical mutation arose independently in every single cell, cells sharing the same mitochondrial mutations are inferred to have descended from the same ancestral cell. These results suggest that even low frequency heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations can be exploited for lineage tracing.</p><p>To prove the principle that somatic mitochondrial mutations can track cells from the same ancestor and to quantify the power of lineage mapping, we next applied EMBLEM to primary blood cells from patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Human AML is organized as a hierarchy: a hematopoietic stem cell first acquires an initiating mutation in one of a number of chromatin modifier genes, previously termed as âpre-leukemicâ hematopoietic stem cell (pHSC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>). pHSCs are functionally normal and are not able to transplant AML, but upon accumulation of additional mutations, they give rise to leukemic stem cells (LSCs) that are able to self-renew and recapitulate AML disease upon transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thomas and Majeti, 2017</xref>). Finally, LSCs give rise to the bulk leukemic blast cells in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Thomas and Majeti, 2017</xref>). Targeted exome sequencing in these samples have identified somatic mutations in tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes that link the lineage relationship of pHSCs, LSCs and blasts, providing the ground truth for our analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We applied EMBLEM to the ATAC-seq profiles of FACS-purified LSCs and leukemic blasts first (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Using high-confidence mtDNA mutations, detected both from bulk ATAC-seq and single cell ATAC-seq, we found the LSC and blast populations not only shared the same heteroplasmic variants, but also showed similar distribution and allele frequency at the cellular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These results indicate the two populations are identical at the genetic level, but divergent at the epigenomic level, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schep et al., 2017</xref>). In patient SU353, we identified four diagnostic mtDNA mutations in the same cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which indicates these four mitochondrial variants already co-existed in the ancestral cell (see MaterialsÂ andÂ method). With the assumption that all these LSCs and blasts are clonal, we further quantified the detection rate of each mtDNA variant as a function of allele frequency and sequencing depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We found that when a single variant allele has a frequency greater than 20%, the detection rate can be up to 90% withÂ &gt;20X coverage (e.g. site 6776). In contrast, when the variant allele has a frequency lower than 1%, the detection rate drops to 20% when the coverage is below 100X (e.g. site 6705). While high drop-out rate is a common challenge for single-cell technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kharchenko et al., 2014</xref>), computational imputation of the missing information from single cell data can address this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhang and Zhang, 2018</xref>). When multiple mtDNA variants are co-detected in multiple single cells, we can infer their origin and linkage in the ancestral cell (see MaterialsÂ andÂ method). Thus, cells containing any one of these variants will still inform their origin from the same lineage. With any combination of the four variants, 90% (sensitivity) of the cells can be unambiguously assigned to the correct lineage with just 20x mtDNA coverage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Furthermore, two mtDNA mutations identified in other cells (e.g. pHSC specific site 2967,6268) were never detected (false positiveÂ =Â 0) in LSCs and blasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4</xref>), showing a high specificity of the method. Similar performance of single cell lineage tracing for another patient (SU070) is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1âfigure supplement 5</xref>. These results demonstrate that somatic DNA mutations in the mitochondrial genome are a powerful endogenous marker to identify clonal cell populations.</p><p>To expand on these findings to additional different cell lineages, we applied EMBLEM to bulk ATAC-seq data from sorted blood cells from healthy human donors and patients with AML(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). We identified heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations in multiple cell populations of primary blood cells from healthy donors and all AML patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations showed a similar mutant spectrum as observed by previous studies using cancer genomic data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ju et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, EMBLEM, not only confirmed the previous lineage hierarchy of AML, but also extended the previous model of pHSC heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In the AML cases with LSCs sequenced by ATAC-seq, the LSCs and their corresponding leukemic blasts have nearly identical heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting a direct lineage relationship and short generation history between LSCs and blasts. We then examined whether any of the mtDNA variants present in LSCs can be seen in the pHSCs, where the first leukemia-associated protein-coding mutations have already occurred in functional normal hematopoietic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Corces-Zimmerman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). We detected blast-associated mtDNA mutations in pHSCs in all 11 cases. Interestingly, we also detected additional heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations present specifically in pHSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the 11 cases we investigated, seven cases have pHSC-unique heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>), a previously unrecognized level of pHSC heterogeneity. pHSCs are capable of long-term self-renewal and possess a clonal growth advantage, allowing them to clonally outcompete normal HSCs. Indeed, the clonal frequency of pHSCs is a poor prognostic factor for overall survival in AML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). Our discovery of pHSCs with distinct heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations suggests the existence of multiple distinct sub-clones of pHSCs in AML patients.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45105.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Clonal evolution of pre-leukemic HSCs inferred from joint lineage tracing and single cell chromatin accessibility.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Lineage hierarchy in acute myeloid leukemia based on EMBLEM and prior genetic information. mtDNA mutations reveals pHSC clonal heterogeneity.

We identified the heteroplasmic mtDNA variants from each single cell, which separated the HSCs into three lineages: Two clonal subpopulations termed âclone 1â (18 cells) and âclone 2â (104 cells), and a third population with no mtDNA variants despite sufficient mtDNA coverage (pHSC with WT mtDNA, 31 cells) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, clone 2 possessed pHSC-specific mtDNA mutations, while clone 1 possessed mtDNA mutations shared with LSCs, indicating clone1 is the lineage precursor of AML. These results confirm that multiple pHSC clones arise in AML patients, and one subclone eventually evolved to become the LSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we related the clonotype of pHSCs to their single-cell chromatin accessibility profiles. We interrogated the patterns of active DNA elements and enriched transcription factor motifs in sequential stages of AML development from the same patient, and contrasted with HSCs from normal donors using ChromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schep et al., 2017</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). The chromatin accessibility profiles of pHSCs are more similar to HSCs than to LSCs or leukemic blasts. The greatest deviation between HSC and other cell types occurred at DNA binding motifs of the transcription factor Jun/Fos, a known key regulator of HSC biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Santaguida et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Furthermore, the three lineages of pHSCs revealed by mtDNA mutations also showed distinctive chromatin profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Clone 1 pHSC, which gives rise to the LSC and AML leukemia, is already more similar to LSCs and blasts in its chromatin accessibility. In contrast, clone 2 that comprises the larger fraction of pHSCs exhibited variable chromatin profiles at the single-cell level that spanned the range of normal HSCs, pHSC with WT mtDNA(WT cells), is also diverged from normal HSCs. Thus, both lineage tracing and single cell epigenomic states indicate clone 1 as the original stem cell of the AML in patient SU353. Supervised comparison of the chromatin accessibility profiles among these clonal sub-populations further identified distinct and significantly enriched transcription factor motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2CâE</xref>). These results indicate the heterogeneity of HSCs from AML patients both on a genetic and epigenomic level.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We present a computational strategy to combine cell lineages tracing by endogenous mtDNA mutations and chromatin accessibility profiling in the same cell using single-cell ATAC-seq data. This approach is applicable to any eukaryote, does not require genetic engineering or genome editing, and is cost effective as the lineage information comes âfor freeâ on top of epigenomic insights. The relative merits of mtDNA vs other genetic markers for lineage tracing are outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>. An important advantage of EMBLEM is that we enable clonotype tracing in existing ATAC-seq data sets and hierarchical lineage construction from ATAC-seq that thousands of labs have already generated. All future ATAC-seq data acquired for other inquiries will also have the benefit of lineage information. EMBLEM may also be extended to other single cell technologies, in which mtDNA is sequenced. We show that EMBLEM is successful even with low frequency heteroplasmic mutations, detection of rare clones in a population, and authentic clinical samples. With advances in the throughput and depth of single-cell genomic technologies, we believe EMBLEM may be a powerful tool to bring insight for many biomedical questions, including development, regeneration, immunity, and cancer with integration of genotype and phenotype information from the same cell. During revision of this work, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ludwig et al. (2019)</xref> reported the feasibility of using mtDNA and single cell genomics for lineage tracing, which independently validates the potentially broad utility of this approach.</p><p>Although powerful and broadly applicable, mtDNA lineage tracing also has its limitations. One limitation of this method is absence of mtDNA mutations in cells and tissues of embryos and young animals, which precluded us from applying EMBLEM to published scATAC-seq data of early animal development. Moreover, the possibility of selective mitochondrial inheritance or intercellular mitochondria transfer may affect the accuracy of inferred lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Mishra and Chan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Moschoi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marlein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hayakawa et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, asymmetric transmission of mitochondria would not necessarily affect cellular lineage tracing, as long as the variant alleles are randomly segregated. Using scATAC-seq data from a mixing experiment with human and mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Satpathy et al., 2018</xref>), we found species-specific mtDNA always paired with species-specific nuclear genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggest that mitochondrial horizontal transfer is not a confounder of our study and does not universally occur between cells. The aforementioned two scenarios reflect the potential uncoupling of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, which would be of interest to investigate by EMBLEM in combination with other nucDNA tracing methods.</p><p>mtDNA lineage tracing produced new insights concerning the pHSC, the human hematopoietic stem cell that suffers the first oncogenic mutation in AML evolution. Our results add to the evidence that the pHSC population is heterogeneous, with evidence of multiple mtDNA clones. Unexpectedly, the pHSC lineage that gives rise to the subsequent acute myeloid leukemia is not the lineage with the best competitive potential among pHSCs, as the leukemogenic lineage is often in the minority. pHSC burden is a strong poor prognostic predictor of AML survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corces et al., 2016</xref>). It is widely believed that the association between high pHSC burden and poor AML patient prognosis reflected the enhanced self-renewal and competitive ability of the mutant pHSC. Our analysis suggests that high pHSC burden may reflect the diversity of pHSCs or the underlying mutational processes. These alternative interpretations of the link between pHSC burden and poor clinical prognosis should be addressed in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Public data accession</title><p>Aligned bam files for GM12878 whole exome, low coverage whole genome, and PCR free whole genome sequence, were downloaded through phase 3 release of 1000 genomes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk</ext-link>).</p><p>The alignment files were accessed via the following ftp links:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/exome_alignment/NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.exome.20121211.bam">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/exome_alignment/NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.exome.20121211.bam</ext-link></p> </list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/alignment/NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/alignment/NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.low_coverage.20121211.bam</ext-link></p> </list-item><list-item><p><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/high_coverage_alignment/NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.high_coverage_pcr_free.20130906.bam">ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/phase3/data/NA12878/high_coverage_alignment/NA12878.mapped.ILLUMINA.bwa.CEU.high_coverage_pcr_free.20130906.bam</ext-link></p> </list-item></list><p>ATAC-seq and single cell ATAC-seq data for GM12878 generated by Buenrostro et al. were downloaded through GEO with accession number GSE47753 and GSE65360, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>).

We found that in one patient (SU209), the number of heteroplasmic mutations (37) and their VAF are significantly higher than other patients. Most of these heteroplasmic mutations also overlapped with common variants present in the general human population (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/ALL.chrMT.phase3_callmom-v0_4.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz">http://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/ALL.chrMT.phase3_callmom-v0_4.20130502.genotypes.vcf.gz</ext-link>), which indicates potential sample contamination.

Cells at a concentration of 260â380 cells/ÂµL were then assayed using scATAC-seq as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Buenrostro et al., 2015</xref>).

Recalibration steps were not applied for single cell data, as the sequence depth is not sufficient to empirically adjust the quality scores. After cleaning the alignment, files from every single cell were merged and heteroplasmic variants were first called with the merged bam and filtered using the same criteria as bulk data. Heteroplasmic variants called from merged data or from bulk data were re-counted in each individual cell using Samtools with â-q 20 -Q 20â. And the non-reference allele had to match the variants detected in merged or bulk data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Detection rate estimation</title><p>In every single cell, if the variant allele detected in merged or bulk data were supported by any reads, it was considered positive; otherwise, it was counted as zero. A binary matrix was used to present the lineage relationship among single cells and plotted as a heat map. The intersections of the variants were quantified by the Upset R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conway et al., 2017</xref>). The number of detected variants showed a correlation with sequencing depth and the number of cells with all variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplements 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>) confirmed the variants already co-existed in the ancestral cell. Following this assumption, the detection rate can be measured as the proportion of cells with variants in the total number of cells. For each variant, cells were separated into different bins, increased by 10, according to the total sequencing depth at each variant. The detection rate for each variant site was then calculated in each bin. The combined detection rate was estimated by 1-(1 <italic>R<sub>1</sub></italic>)*(1 <italic>R<sub>2</sub></italic>)*(1 <italic>R<sub>3</sub></italic>)*(1 <italic>R<sub>4</sub></italic>), where <italic>R<sub>n</sub></italic> is the detection rate for each variant.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Lineage inference</title><p>The probability of observing a mutation at a given site is <italic>P<sub>n</sub>Â =Â n*r</italic>, where <italic>r</italic> is the average mutation rate in the mitochondrial genome and <italic>n</italic> is the copy of mtDNAs in a single cell. <italic>r</italic> is estimated to beÂ ~10<sup>^-7</sup> per base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coller et al., 2001</xref>), n is around 100Â ~Â 10000 per cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Miller et al., 2003</xref>), so <italic>P<sub>n</sub></italic> will be 10<sup>^-5</sup>Â ~Â 10<sup>^-3</sup>. The probability of N cells sharing the same mtDNA mutations, but arising independently, will be (<italic>P<sub>n</sub></italic>)<sup>^N</sup>. Thus, when there are more than 3 cells in the population sharing a common mtDNA mutation, the probability of these independently occurring will be close to 0. Cells with common mtDNA mutations havingÂ inherited the mutations from the same ancestral cell is more likely to explain the observedÂ result. Furthermore, when a set of mutations (more than 1) is detected in more than 1 cells, the null hypothesis (independent occurrence) is rejected more confidently. The mutations within the ancestral cells can be inferred from the intersection of mutations. If a set of mutations co-existed in the ancestral cell, the absence of one of several linked mutations in the daughter cells is more likely caused by false negativeÂ detection in single-cell libraries or genetic draft during cell replication. Then the observed cells with different intersections (e.g <italic>V1Â +V2</italic>)Â are expected to be given by <italic>P<sub>v1</sub>*P<sub>v2</sub>*N</italic>, after normalization by sequencing depth. The divergence of intersections from high-frequency mutations indicates the separation of mtDNA mutations and multiple cell lineage. The intersections of the variants were quantified by the Upset R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Conway et al., 2017</xref>). In the scATAC-seq from pHSCs from SU353, the intersection of variants showed most of the cells were separated by two sets of different variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). But there are a few cells displaying a mixture of variants from the two sets. We suspected these may cause by the doublet of cells in the same well during single cell separation on C1 chip. We further separated the intersection map by the chip and observed the number of cells with mixture variants correlated to the concentration of cells loaded to C1 Chip. These cells were removed during subsequent analysis. Single cells with any variants in the two sets were kept and cells with more than 40X coverage of mtDNA, butÂ with no variants in the two sets were considered as HSCs with WT mtDNA. After all the filter steps, 153 pHSCÂ cells had lineage information and were separated into three subgroups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single cell ATAC-seq chromatin analysis</title><p>ATAC sequences mapped to the nuclear genome were used for chromatin accessibility profiling. Bam files were merged for the same cell types and used as input files for chromVAR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schep et al., 2017</xref>). Peak files from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buenrostro et al. (2018)</xref> were used as open background regions to quantify the accessibility signal from every single cell. Cells with fewer than 200 unique reads or less than 25% of reads in peak regions were removed for chromatin analysis. chromVAR was applied to calculate TF motif-associated chromatin accessibility landscape changes and identify potential regulators of epigenomic variability. This approach quantifies accessibility variation across single-cells by aggregating accessible regions containing a specific TF motif, then compares the observed accessibility of all peaks containing a TF motif to a background set of peaks normalizing for known technical confounders. For determining differentially accessible motifs between different subpopulations, a Wilcoxon test was used to calculate the p values of the difference between the two groups.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Code availability</title><p>Custom analysis code can be downloaded from GitHub (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/ChangLab/ATAC_mito_sc">https://github.com/ChangLab/ATAC_mito_sc</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Xu, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ATAC_mito_sc">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ATAC_mito_sc</ext-link>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Christina Curtis, Ava Carter, Furqan Fazal, Kevin Parker and Chun-Kan Chen for insightful advice and assistance.

We have added this analysis to the revised manuscript (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4). The human and mouse cells were co-cultured for 6 hours prior to the single cell analysis. We mapped the mtDNA reads to the human and mouse references separately. As shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A-B, we found that mtDNA strictly tracked with species-of-origin along with the genomic DNA, with the exception of one pair of cell doublets (in red) that was detected on both genomic and mtDNA. Species-specific mtDNA always paired with species-specific nuclear genomic DNA (Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C). These results suggest that mitochondrial horizontal transfer is not a confounder of our study.</p><p>Furthermore, the literature reports that the rare events of mitochondrial DNA transfer is unidirectional from stromal cells to AML cells, and requiring cell-to-cell contact. There is an average increasing of 14% in the mitochondrial mass of the receiver cells, which is ~17 copies of mtDNA (Moschoi et al., 2016). With this knowledge, we would expect that: 1) Mitochondria donors are normal cells, which would not accumulate high frequency mtDNA mutations. Transfer of wild type mtDNA would have no impact on lineage tracing. 2) The variant allele frequency from the donor cell will be diluted by ~8 fold in the receiving cells, even assuming the extremely unlikely scenario of selective transfer of mutant mtDNA into neighbor cells. Thus, we would expect the variant allele frequency from horizontal transfer to be much lower than the endogenous variants, and not substantially impact the results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors demonstrate that ATAC-seq enriches for mtDNA compared to whole exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing (Figure 1B, 1C and Figure 1âfigure supplement 2).

These method-specific mutations have VAF lower than 0.5% (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C). These low frequency mutations can only be detected when the sequence coverage is very high (~10,000X), and are not strong signals that drive the lineage tracing results because they are very infrequently detected. These method-specific, low frequency mutations are scattered across mtDNA. As requested, we added a new panel(C) to Figure 1âfigure supplement 2 to provide the allele frequency and the position of these heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations detected by WGS_H and ATAC-seq.</p><p>We speculate that the low frequency mtDNA mutations may be new mutations that arose during serial passage in cell culture. The published WGS_H and ATAC-seq data of GM12878 cells were not concurrently obtained. All of the WGS_H and the ATAC specific mutations showed a strong enrichment of C-&gt;T mutations, which match the mitochondrial specific mutation spectrum and are consistent with our hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to ask the authors to perform the same analysis and compare the mtDNA coverage and the number of mutations after ATAC-seq and WGS-H in one more human cell line, in order to validate their results from GM12878 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed human K562 cells, a myeloid leukemia cell line with both whole genome sequencing and ATAC-seq data available. These results have been added to the revised manuscript (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3). We observed a 35-fold enrichment of mtDNA sequence in ATAC-seq data compared to whole genome sequencing (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3A). The average coverage of the mitochondrial genome is 16,928 and 5,940 for WGS and ATAC-seq, respectively (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B). We detected 87 heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations in total with the same criteria as described in the Materials and methods section. 36 of these mutations can be detected by both WGS and ATAC, while 51 of them are only detected in either WGS or ATAC (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C). Similarly, these method-specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations have VAF lower than 0.5% as observed in GM12878 (Figure 1âfigure supplement 3D).</p></body></sub-article></article>
