By replacing key amino acid residues in AmTrac we constructed a set of dual-emission AmTrac sensors named deAmTracs. deAmTracs show opposing changes of blue and green emission with almost doubled emission ratio upon ammonium addition. The response ratio of the deAmTracs correlated with transport activity in mutants with altered capacity.

We recently engineered single fluorescent protein (FP)-based ammonium transport activity sensors, termed AmTrac and MepTrac, which allowed monitoring of the activity of ammonium transporters in living yeast cells by means of fluorescence intensity (FI) measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). Both AmTrac and MepTrac are composed of a circularly permuted enhanced green fluorescent protein (cpEGFP) inserted into the central loop of plant or yeast AMT/MEP ammonium transporters. Quantitative fluorescence spectroscopy of yeast cells expressing the sensor variants demonstrates that they accurately report transporter activity as 30–50% FI decrease of green FI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). Being based on a single FP, AmTrac and MepTrac are intensiometric, since the readout consists of FI modulations of a single wavelength. However, ratiometric signal output would be clearly advantageous for sensor calibration and reliable quantitative imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Tantama et al., 2012</xref>). Only a few existing single FP sensors are ratiometric, displaying two emission maxima at a single excitation wavelength. The pH-sensors deGFP1 and deGFP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>) and the calcium sensor GEM-GECO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Zhao et al., 2011</xref>) belong to this category. Based on similar steady-state fluorescence spectra of AmTrac and deGFP1 and deGFP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>), we reasoned that it should be possible to turn AmTrac into a ratiometric, dual-emission sensor.</p><p>In AmTrac, the cpEGFP was inserted between residue 233 and 234 of the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> ammonium transporter AtAMT1;3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, top). The AmTrac sensors differ only by two residues at the N-terminus of the cpEGFP, also referred to as left linker, the right linker being composed of phenylalanine (F) and asparagine (N) in all sensors. The first AmTrac engineered, also named AmTrac-LE, carries leucine (L, Leu<sup>234</sup>) and glutamate (E, Glu<sup>235</sup>) in the left linker. Brighter versions carry a serine (S, Ser<sup>235</sup>) in the second position of the left linker, and variable amino acids in the first position. AmTrac-GS carries a glycine (G, Gly<sup>234</sup>), AmTrac-LS a leucine (L, Leu<sup>234</sup>) and AmTrac-IS an isoleucine (I, Ile<sup>234</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07113.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence analysis of AmTrac sensors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Scheme of AmTrac sensors showing left (LL) and right linker (RL) positions (top).

The fluorescence spectra of all AmTracs show two excitation maxima, at λ<sub>exc</sub> ∼390 nm and λ<sub>exc</sub> ∼500 nm, also referred to as A- and B-band hereafter. In AmTrac-LE, the A-state dominates the fluorescence spectrum, whereas all other AmTracs (-GS, -LS and -IS) show an equilibrium shift toward the B-state. In wild type GFP (wtGFP) (44), the A-band derives from the A-state, the protonated chromophore, while the B-state indicates the deprotonated chromophore (43). Both states are coupled by a protonation equilibrium in both wtGFP and the AmTrac sensors.</p><p>The generally accepted mechanism of single-FP sensors assumes changes in the solvent accessibility and consequent quenching of the fluorescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). However, AmTracs are substantially different from the soluble sensors characterized so far. Membrane localization of the sensors reduces motion and mobility. Therefore, we performed time-resolved fluorescence measurements to detect if non-radiative processes such as solvent quenching or homo-FRET are involved in the sensor response. This analysis was performed for AmTrac-GS and -LE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). AmTrac-GS showed single exponential decay kinetics with lifetime values of τ = 2.55 ± 0.04 ns and τ = 2.48 ± 0.1 ns when treated with water and ammonium, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> top and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These values are in agreement with most reports on a single lifetime of about τ = 2.5 to 2.8 ns for EGFP in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Stepanenko et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arpino et al., 2012</xref>). AmTrac-LE showed bi-exponential decay kinetics with fluorescence decay times of τ<sub>1</sub> = 1.96 ± 0.4 ns and τ<sub>2</sub> = 3.98 ± 0.32 ns and τ<sub>1</sub> = 1.69 ± 0.07 ns and τ<sub>2</sub> = 3.96 ± 0.17 ns when treated with water or ammonium, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> bottom and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>). The two lifetime components found for AmTrac-LE are indicative of the presence of two species in the excited state. We thus conclude that the response mechanism of AmTrac-LE vs -GS differs with regard to which state (A- or B-state) is excited, and postulate that either different excited state reactions and/or different excited state species are involved. Since the lifetime values in absence and presence of ammonium differed, at most, by less than 1 ns for AmTrac-LE and -GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) we exclude external quenching effects due to altered solvent access in AmTracs, which is the widely accepted mechanism of single-FP sensors.</p><p>The distance of the cpEGFP moieties in the sensors allows for homo-FRET, but anisotropy decay kinetics changed only minimally in the presence of ammonium for AmTrac-GS and -LE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The large initial r-values found are most likely artificial and probably due to weak signal of the green fluorescence and strong light scattering of the yeast cells. We thus conclude that the FI decrease is not the result of a change in the efficiency of (a possible) homo-FRET and postulate that structural rearrangements affect the protonation states and thus the FI.</p><p>Excitation of the A-state of wtGFP leads to green emission due to excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chattoraj et al., 1996</xref>). ESPT in wtGFP is a photophysical phenomenon that describes the rapid deprotonation of the neutral chromophore in the excited state leading to loss of blue fluorescence and formation of a green-emitting intermediate state (I-state). The proton travels from the chromophore hydroxyl group, via a buried water molecule and neighboring side chain serine 205 (Ser<sup>205</sup>), to the final acceptor Glu<sup>222</sup> after excitation of the A-form. ESPT is usually prevented in EGFP due to the S65T mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brejc et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>To test for ESPT in AmTracs, we recorded fluorescence emission spectra of yeast transformed with AmTrac-LE and -GS after excitation of the A-state (λ<sub>exc</sub> 395 nm), in presence of varying ammonium concentrations. Green fluorescence was detected, further supporting the hypothesis of ESPT occurrence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, AmTrac-LE failed to fully respond to ammonium treatment when the A-state was excited, since the FI decreased by 30% only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Conversely, when the B-state was excited, the FI decreased up to ∼50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The emission spectrum of AmTrac-LE was characterized by another unique feature: the excitation of the A-state showed two emission maxima, one higher energy shoulder-like maximum at λ<sub>em</sub> 490 nm and a distinct peak at λ<sub>em</sub> 515 nm. Upon ammonium addition, the relative intensity of the peaks was altered and an iso-emissive point was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Interestingly, this iso-emissive behavior was detected for AmTrac-LE but not for AmTrac-GS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07113.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Steady-state fluorescence spectra for excited-state proton transfer (ESPT) analysis of yeast transformed with AmTrac-LE and postulated structural differences.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence excitation (dashed line; λ<sub>em</sub> 530 nm) and emission (solid line; λ<sub>exc</sub> 485 nm) after treatment with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl at indicated concentrations.

However, crystal structures have been solved for cpEGFP, as free protein or within sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akerboom et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Leder et al., 2010</xref>) and can provide clues on how the linker residues are involved in the structural rearrangements during the sensing mechanism. The crystal structure of cpEGFP (PDB 3EVP) shows two rotamers for Glu<sup>148</sup> in close proximity to the chromophore Thr65–Tyr66–Gly67, which indicates a high degree of flexibility at position 148. We assume that due to re-arrangements in the cpEGFP barrel, Glu<sup>148</sup> may exist in different orientations and distances to the phenyl-group of the chromophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Since Glu<sup>148</sup> corresponds to Glu<sup>235</sup> in AmTrac-LE, we consider the solved structure of cpEGFP as a proxy for AmTrac-LE. Theoretical modifications of the linker sequence were performed using Pymol by replacing the linker residues LE of cpEGFP (PDB 3EVP) with GS. The result shows only one conformational state for serine of the GS linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) indicating more stability during conformation changes. This also indicates the impact of different amino acid linkers on the structural environment of the chromophore. We postulate that Glu<sup>235</sup> of AmTrac-LE relocates during the sensing process, most likely altering the efficiency of ESPT and in turn leading to blue and green fluorescence emission.</p><p>The spectral behavior of AmTrac-LE shows similarities with the dual-emission pH sensor deGFP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Hanson et al., 2002</xref>) as well as the GFP mutant S65T/H148E (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Shu et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, we reasoned that it should be possible to generate improved dual-emission sensors with a larger ratio change compared to AmTrac-LE. We modified the left linker amino acids only, since they appeared to be involved in the dual-emission behavior. We replaced LE with two random amino acids, to check for all possible combinations, and analyzed these constructs in yeast. Out of more than 500 yeast colonies screened, we found four candidates with the new linker composition CP, FP, RP, YP that displayed distinct dual-emission patterns and two of these candidates showed improved ratios upon ammonium treatment. Interestingly, all four constructs, named deAmTracs, contained a proline residue at the linker position of the former Glu<sup>235</sup>, while the first amino acid of the linker varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The two candidates with the highest ratio changes, deAmTrac-CP and -FP, are described in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). deAmTrac-CP carried a cysteine and proline, while deAmTrac-FP contained phenylalanine and proline in the left linker. Upon excitation with λ<sub>exc</sub> 395 nm, blue and green emission maxima at 490 nm and 515 nm, respectively, were detected, which showed opposing changes in FI upon ammonium treatment. A clear iso-emissive point in the dual-emission spectra was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Plotting the response ratio of the intensity of the A-state /I-state vs the external ammonium concentration showed that the ratio values almost doubled for both deAmTrac-CP and -FP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The affinity constants from the response ratio towards ammonium for deAmTrac-CP (EC<sub>50</sub> 54 ± 9 µM) and deAmTrac-FP (EC<sub>50</sub> 36 ± 6 µM) were similar to AmTrac (EC<sub>50</sub> 55 ± 7 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07113.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Steady-state fluorescence titration analysis of intact yeast transformed with deAmTrac-CP and -FP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence emission spectrum (λ<sub>exc</sub> 395 nm) recorded after NH<sub>4</sub>Cl addition (concentrations indicated).

Theoretical modification of the LE linker in the crystal structure of cpEGFP (PDB 3EVP) for either CP or FP using Pymol yields different rotamers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We postulate that the residues CP and FP allow for more flexibility due to the possibility of different conformational states. Differently from GS in AmTrac-GS, these linker residues may partially disrupt the ESPT pathway, preventing rapid proton transfer and trapping the excited A-state which consequently emits blue light. The blue emission is rather small, since the green emission from successful ESPT dominates the spectrum.</p><p>Several lines of evidence demonstrated that AmTrac's fluorescence response is strictly correlated to the ammonium transporter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). To verify that such correlation was maintained in deAmTracs, we generated a series of mutants with altered transporter activity, based on the suppressor screen for the inactivating mutation T464D in AmTrac-LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>). In deAmTrac-CP and -FP, the T464D mutation was still sufficient to block growth and response. In the T464D mutant background the presence of the suppressing mutation A141E increased the ratiometric response and transport capacity, shown as reduced growth of the mutants on high ammonium concentrations. Conversely, mutation Q61E restored growth and response of deAmTrac-T464D, although not to the full extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the mutations had an effect on transport activity and response similar to AmTrac-LE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Spectral analysis of the mutant deAmTracs showed the impact of the introduced mutations on the dual-emission pattern. In the T464D mutant the blue emission disappeared, and only green emission was detected. In presence of A141E, blue emission increased and green emission decreased. Q61E shows the opposite effect with decreased blue and increased green emission at high ammonium concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results support the utility of deAmTracs in assessing ammonium transporter activity. However, our findings also point out that such sensors are complex systems and that a single mutation affecting the structure and function of the transporter may also affect the direct environment of the chromophore.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07113.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Response ratio and spectral analysis of mutant deAmTrac-CP and -FP.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fluorescence response to NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (indicated concentrations) plotted as ratio of the intensity of the A-state /I-state (I<sub>A</sub>/I<sub>I</sub>).

(1996)</xref>, we postulate a mechanistic model with three co-existing processes: (i) structural rearrangements in the sensor protein upon ammonium perception, (ii) a predominantly protonated state of the cpEGFP chromophore and (iii) partial disruption of the ESPT pathway to prevent efficient proton transfer. In the absence of ammonium transport activity, an efficient hydrogen bond network is established in close proximity to the chromophore, allowing for fast proton transfer from the excited state of the neutral chromophore to the final acceptor. Under these conditions, green emission from the deprotonated chromophore is observed. With increasing ammonium transport activity, the well-established ESPT pathway is partially inhibited, so that the proton cannot be efficiently transferred. Emission from the protonated intermediate is observed as blue light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07113.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Suggested mechanistic ESPT model to describe the dual-emission in AmTrac-LE and deAmTracs during high and low ammonium transport activity.</title><p>A, protonated A-state of the chromophore; I, deprotonated intermediate state; B, deprotonated B-state.

Still, the motion is not dramatic enough to completely prevent ESPT, explaining why green emission is still observed as the dominant peak during conditions of high ammonium transport. Therefore, deAmTracs only show modest ratio changes compared to other published dual-emission sensors, possibly due to only small spatial rearrangements or averaging of the ensembles during the ammonium binding/transport process. Future efforts will address and explore alternative approaches for the design of improved ratiometric sensors for ammonium transporters.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA constructs and mutagenesis</title><p>All cpEGFP-based sensor plasmid constructs described are based on pDRF'-AmTrac-LE and -GS; described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Random mutagenesis</title><p>The deAmTrac sensors were generated by substituting the LE-linker of AmTrac-LE with random amino acids to test all the possible linker sequences and effects on dual-emission patterns.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Detlef Weigel (Senior editor), Richard Aldrich (Reviewing editor), and two reviewers, and the two reviewers (Janice Robertson and Jonathan Javitch) have agreed to share their identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting following up story to the original publication on a fluorescence-based ammonium binding/transport sensor, AmTrac. The authors carried out additional fluorescence characterization, which revealed a prominent “A-band” excitation in one of the sensors. They randomly modified one of the linkers and identified several new sensors with enhanced emission in the blue spectrum in response to ammonium. The most improved sensor has nearly a two-fold change in blue to green emission in response to high ammonium. This relatively modest change compared with dual emission sensors will limit the utility of the new sensors but the study nevertheless does provide interesting new information and a theoretical proposal for the underlying mechanism. The authors propose that small linker-related perturbations of excited-state proton transfer underlie the enhancement of the blue relative to the green emission, but argue that the small conformational changes aren't sufficient to create a more dramatic shift. This is an exciting development pushing forward the technology to directly observe membrane protein transport via fluorescent methods.</p><p>The following issues should be addressed in a revised version.</p><p>1) The study seems to have omitted a key piece of analysis: a full titration of the ratiometric fluorescence signal vs. external ammonium concentration, i.e. a quantification of the changes observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2B and 3A</xref>. This type of plot would demonstrate the range of sensitivity for the different constructs and clarify the number of states that are observed in the fluorescent read-out.</p><p>2) In addition, the paper could be strengthened by showing a series of tests of the ratiometric fluorescence signal, for instance, with different functional mutants that change the transport activity in a predicted manner. These types of experiments were elegantly carried out in the previous paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref>) and really showed the robustness of the fluorescence intensity changes on the original AmTrac sensors.</p><p>3) In the final sentence the authors write: “However, since most single-fluorophore sensors are based on the evaluation of a single fluorescence wavelength, this work will aid the design of future ratiometric single fluorophore sensors.” It is not clear how this will work. It is interesting that a disruption in ESPT may create ratiometric sensors, how to use this knowledge to rationally improve the sensor further is unclear as the authors have already tried 500 random mutations. We understand the urge to generalize the utility of the findings, but if the authors have some idea of a rational approach to extend this would be nice to hear it.</p><p>4) On several occasions the authors refer to theoretical modification or replacement of residues in the structure and show new conformations and distance measurements, but the methodology used was unclear. Is this simply visualizing based on the structure with a new side chain present or was some sort of molecular dynamics or energy minimization used?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07113.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The study seems to have omitted a key piece of analysis: a full titration of the ratiometric fluorescence signal vs. external ammonium concentration, i.e. a quantification of the changes observed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3"><italic>Figures 2B and 3A</italic></xref><italic>.

From the information obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">De Michele et al., 2013</xref> we chose 3 mutations as test cases for the sensor response and coupling between activity and fluorescence response. The T464D mutation inactivates the transporter activity and, consequentially, the sensor response. Two mutations suppressed this inactivation, the high capacity mutation A141E, which we expected to increase the ratio of the response, and one of the mutations with reduced transport activity Q61E, which we expected to show a decreased response ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The data not only support our hypothesis, but also the final mechanistic model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, where low and high transport activities are correlated with ESPT.</p><p><italic>3) In the final sentence the authors write: “However, since most single-fluorophore sensors are based on the evaluation of a single fluorescence wavelength, this work will aid the design of future ratiometric single fluorophore sensors.” It is not clear how this will work.

We understand the urge to generalize the utility of the findings, but if the authors have some idea of a rational approach to extend this would be nice to hear it</italic>.</p><p>We think that the insights obtained, including the occurrence of ESPT and presence of proline in the linker sequence, are useful to guide future efforts in designing ratiometric single fluorophore sensors. However, we agree with the reviewers that our results cannot be generalized. The results of deAmTrac-FP and –CP mutants show the complexity of these sensor systems. We have come to the conclusion that screening of randomly generated constructs will most likely be more successful. Thus we removed that sentence.</p><p><italic>4) On several occasions the authors refer to theoretical modification or replacement of residues in the structure and show new conformations and distance measurements, but the methodology used was unclear. Is this simply visualizing based on the structure with a new side chain present or was some sort of molecular dynamics or energy minimization used</italic>?</p><p>The methodology was simple visualization using an existing structure of cpEGFP (3EVP) and replacing the side chains to illustrate the possibility of different conformations of certain residues. We did not attempt to predict different rotamers, rather to postulate a higher degree of flexibility of the linkers in the deAmTracs.</p></body></sub-article></article>
