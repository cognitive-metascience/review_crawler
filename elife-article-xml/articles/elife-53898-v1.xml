granulosa</italic>) use tetrodotoxin (TTX) to block voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels as a chemical defense against predation. Interestingly, newts exhibit extreme population-level variation in toxicity attributed to a coevolutionary arms race with TTX-resistant predatory snakes, but the source of TTX in newts is unknown. Here, we investigated whether symbiotic bacteria isolated from toxic newts could produce TTX. We characterized the skin-associated microbiota from a toxic and non-toxic population of newts and established pure cultures of isolated bacterial symbionts from toxic newts. We then screened bacterial culture media for TTX using LC-MS/MS and identified TTX-producing bacterial strains from four genera, including <italic>Aeromonas</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Shewanella</italic>, and <italic>Sphingopyxis</italic>. Additionally, we sequenced the Na<sub>v</sub> channel gene family in toxic newts and found that newts expressed Na<sub>v</sub> channels with modified TTX binding sites, conferring extreme physiological resistance to TTX. This study highlights the complex interactions among adaptive physiology, animal-bacterial symbiosis, and ecological context.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Rough-skinned newts produce tetrodotoxin or TTX, a deadly neurotoxin that is also present in some pufferfish, octopuses, crabs, starfish, flatworms, frogs, and toads. It remains a mystery why so many different creatures produce this toxin. One possibility is that TTX did not evolve in animals at all, but rather it is made by bacteria living on or in these creatures. In fact, scientists have already shown that TTX-producing bacteria supply pufferfish, octopus, and other animals with the toxin. However, it was not known where TTX in newts and other amphibians comes from.</p><p>TTX kills animals by blocking specialized ion channels and shutting down the signaling between neurons, but rough-skinned newts appear insensitive to this blockage, making it likely that they have evolved defenses against the toxin. Some garter snakes that feed on these newts have also evolved to become immune to the effects of TTX. If bacteria are the source of TTX in the newts, the emergence of newt-eating snakes resistant to TTX must be putting evolutionary pressure on both the newts and the bacteria to boost their anti-snake defenses. Learning more about these complex relationships will help scientists better understand both evolution and the role of beneficial bacteria.</p><p>Vaelli et al. have now shown that bacteria living on rough-skinned newts produce TTX. In the experiments, bacteria samples were collected from the skin of the newts and grown in the laboratory. Four different types of bacteria from the samples collected produced TTX. Next, Vaelli et al. looked at five genes that encode the channels normally affected by TTX in newts and found that all them have mutations that prevent them from being blocked by this deadly neurotoxin. This suggests that bacteria living on newts shape the evolution of genes critical to the animals’ own survival.</p><p>Helpful bacteria living on and in animals have important effects on animals’ physiology, health, and disease. But understanding these complex interactions is challenging. Rough-skinned newts provide an excellent model system for studying the effects of helpful bacteria living on animals. Vaelli et al. show that a single chemical produced by bacteria can impact diverse aspects of animal biology including physiology, the evolution of their genes, and their interactions with other creatures in their environment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>taricha granulosa</kwd><kwd>amphibian</kwd><kwd>neurotoxin</kwd><kwd>TTX</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>autoresistance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBI-0939454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaelli</surname><given-names>Patric M</given-names></name><name><surname>Theis</surname><given-names>Kevin R</given-names></name><name><surname>Eisthen</surname><given-names>Heather L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1354089</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eisthen</surname><given-names>Heather L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-1655392</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eisthen</surname><given-names>Heather L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS-0920505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Theis</surname><given-names>Kevin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007229</institution-id><institution>Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Bauer Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>O'Connell</surname><given-names>Lauren A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate research fellowship, fellow ID: 2014165835</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vaelli</surname><given-names>Patric M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Skin-associated bacteria underlie the production of a potent defensive neurotoxin in newts, impacting host physiology, molecular evolution, and predator-prey interactions in a coevolutionary arms race.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coevolutionary interactions among species are a central force driving the origin of novel, adaptive phenotypes, yet the traits under selection are often complex and arise from multifaceted interactions among genetic, physiological, and environmental forces that are not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ehrlich and Raven, 1964</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Futuyma and Agrawal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schoener, 2011</xref>). Chemical interactions among species in the form of defensive compounds have evolved across all domains of life, and these toxins often target evolutionarily conserved proteins in potential predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodie and Ridenhour, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hodgson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Whittaker and Feeny, 1971</xref>). For example, tetrodotoxin (TTX), the primary neurotoxin found in poisonous pufferfishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tsuda and Kawamura, 1952</xref>), has been discovered across a broad phylogenetic distribution of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanifin, 2010</xref>). The unusual molecular structure of this toxin serves to selectively target voltage-gated sodium (Na<sub>v</sub>) channels, which are critical for generating action potentials in neurons, muscles, and other excitable cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hille, 2001</xref>). Thus, TTX toxicity can have substantial impacts on eco-evolutionary interactions among species, impacting both the toxic species and potential predators.</p><p>Rough-skinned newts (<italic>Taricha granulosa</italic>) are among the most poisonous TTX-producing animals and serve as an excellent model system for understanding ecological influences on toxin production and predation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This species is endemic to the Pacific Northwest of North America, where certain populations possess high quantities of TTX relative to other TTX-laden species including pufferfishes and blue-ringed octopuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanifin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Williams, 2010</xref>). In some populations, individual newts possess enough TTX to kill several adult humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanifin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hanifin et al., 1999</xref>). Variation in newt toxicity is driven in part by the evolution of TTX resistance in predatory garter snakes (<italic>Thamnophis sirtalis</italic>), as TTX toxicity and resistance in newts and snakes are strongly correlated geographically, suggesting that these two phenotypes are coevolving (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodie et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hanifin et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, TTX resistant Na<sub>v</sub> channels have evolved independently across different garter snake populations, suggesting multiple independent origins of TTX resistance in predatory snakes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geffeney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geffeney et al., 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of the skin-associated microbiota of rough-skinned newts.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Rough-skinned newt (<italic>Taricha granulosa</italic>); photo by Gary Nafis (CC by ND NC 3.0).

In TTX-bearing marine species, toxicity is derived either from dietary accumulation from TTX-laden prey, or from symbiotic interactions with TTX-producing bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chau et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Miyazawa and Noguchi, 2001</xref>). Pufferfishes harbor numerous TTX-producing bacteria symbionts in toxic tissues including skin, liver, intestines, and ovaries, and cultured non-toxic pufferfishes are able to sequester dietary-administered TTX under laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jal and Khora, 2015</xref>). TTX-producing bacteria have also been isolated from xanthid crabs, horseshoe crabs, starfish, chaetognaths, nemerteans, gastropods, and blue-ringed octopuses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jal and Khora, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Magarlamov et al., 2017</xref>). However, the origin of TTX in rough-skinned newts has been more controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanifin, 2010</xref>). Newts raised in long-term captivity on artificial diets maintain their TTX toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanifin et al., 2002</xref>), and captive newts forced to secrete their TTX by electric shock are able to slowly regenerate their toxicity over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardall et al., 2004</xref>). Additionally, one group attempted to amplify bacterial DNA from various newt tissues using 16S rRNA gene primers, but failed to recover any PCR products aside from the intestine, which contains low levels of TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lehman et al., 2004</xref>). These studies suggest that the source of TTX in newts is not dietary, but whether newts have acquired the ability to produce TTX endogenously via convergent evolution or horizontal gene transfer, or from symbiosis with TTX-producing bacteria remains unclear.</p><p>Furthermore, despite the extreme toxicity of some newt populations, the molecular basis of TTX resistance in this species is not well understood. A previous study identified amino acid replacements in the highly conserved pore-loop (P-loop) region of the skeletal muscle isoform Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 and found that skeletal muscle fibers were considerably resistant to TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanifin and Gilly, 2015</xref>). Amphibians, however, possess six Na<sub>v</sub> channel isoforms that are differentially expressed across excitable tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zakon et al., 2011</xref>). Unlike pufferfishes in which TTX is sequestered in certain tissues, newts possess TTX throughout their bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mebs et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wakely et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yotsu et al., 1990</xref>), indicating that the central and peripheral nervous systems are exposed to TTX. Thus, the evolution of whole animal resistance should necessarily involve all Na<sub>v</sub> channel subtypes, providing an opportunity to examine molecular evolution in response to a specific selective pressure (i.e., TTX) across an entire gene family.</p><p>In this study, we investigated the source of TTX toxicity and the molecular basis for TTX resistance in rough-skinned newts. We re-examined the hypothesis that newts derive their TTX from symbiosis with TTX-producing bacteria, focusing on the bacterial communities inhabiting the skin of <italic>T. granulosa</italic>, as this organ possesses specialized granular glands for storing toxins and contains the highest quantities of TTX in the animal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daly et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hamning et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hanifin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Santos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Toledo and Jared, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tsuruda et al., 2002</xref>). We took advantage of the natural variation in TTX toxicity across newt populations to characterize the skin-associated microbiota in newts from a highly toxic and a non-toxic population and applied an unbiased cultivation-based approach to isolate numerous bacterial symbionts from the skin of toxic newts. Subsequent LC-MS/MS screening of bacterial cultivation media revealed TTX production in eleven bacterial strains from four genera: <italic>Aeromonas</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, <italic>Shewanella</italic>, and <italic>Sphingopyxis</italic>. Furthermore, to determine the molecular and physiological basis of extreme TTX resistance observed in this species, we cloned and sequenced five uncharacterized Na<sub>v</sub> channel paralogs (Na<sub>v</sub>1.1, Na<sub>v</sub>1.2, Na<sub>v</sub>1.3, Na<sub>v</sub>1.5, Na<sub>v</sub>1.6) from a highly toxic population of newts in Oregon. We identified amino acid substitutions in all five genes, many of which have been observed in other TTX-possessing species. To test whether Na<sub>v</sub> channel mutations impact TTX resistance in newts, we used site-directed mutagenesis to insert three newt-specific replacements identified in Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 into the TTX-sensitive Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 ortholog from <italic>Mus musculus</italic>. We found that each amino acid replacement reduced TTX sensitivity compared to wild-type <italic>M. musculus</italic> channels, but these mutations had the greatest effect when combined together. Overall, our results suggest that host-associated bacteria may underlie the production of a critical defensive compound in a vertebrate host, impacting predator-prey coevolution and potentially shaping the evolution of TTX resistance in a well-known ecological model system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Characterization of newt-associated microbiota from toxic and non-toxic newts</title><p>To investigate whether bacterial symbionts produce TTX in newts, we leveraged natural variation in toxicity across newt populations to characterize skin-associated microbiota and determine whether highly toxic newts harbored candidate TTX-producing bacteria.

Although TTX-producing symbionts have been identified in marine animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chau et al., 2011</xref>), this is the first identification of TTX-producing bacteria associated with a freshwater or terrestrial animal. The origin of TTX in rough-skinned newts and other amphibians has been controversial: wild-caught toxic newts maintain their toxicity in long-term laboratory captivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hanifin et al., 2002</xref>), and newts forced to secrete their TTX by electric shock regenerate their toxicity after nine months, despite laboratory conditions that prevented access to dietary sources of TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardall et al., 2004</xref>). Such results demonstrate that newts do not derive TTX from their natural diet, but the results do not explicitly rule out a symbiotic origin for TTX toxicity. A subsequent investigation attempted to amplify 16S rRNA genes from DNA extracted from newt tissues by PCR, but the authors were unable to amplify bacterial DNA from any tissue except the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lehman et al., 2004</xref>). This result has been widely cited to claim that newts lack symbiotic bacteria altogether, thus supporting an endogenous origin for TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cardall et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gall et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hanifin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hanifin and Gilly, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Williams, 2010</xref>). However, sequencing-based approaches for characterization of microbial communities were limited at that time, and it is increasingly clear that most, if not all, animals possess cutaneous bacterial communities on their external epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, our results strongly suggest that symbiotic bacteria are the ultimate source TTX toxicity in rough-skinned newts.</p><p>Surprisingly, many of the TTX-producing strains isolated from newts are from the same genera as those previously identified in marine animals. TTX-producing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. have been isolated from toxic pufferfish, blue-ringed octopus, and sea snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Hwang et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yotsu et al., 1987</xref>), and TTX-producing <italic>Aeromonas</italic> spp. and <italic>Shewanella</italic> spp. have both been isolated from pufferfish and sea snails (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auawithoothij and Noomhorm, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheng et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Simidu et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). TTX-producing <italic>Sphingopyxis</italic> spp. have not been identified in host animals or environmental samples, and this strain may be unique to freshwater or terrestrial environments. Interestingly, several other newt species from diverse genera are known to possess TTX, including <italic>Notophthalmus, Triturus</italic>, <italic>Cynops</italic>, <italic>Paramesotriton</italic>, <italic>Pachytriton</italic>, and <italic>Laotriton</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brodie et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yotsu-Yamashita and Mebs, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yotsu-Yamashita et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yotsu-Yamashita et al., 2017</xref>). Frogs and toads from the genera <italic>Atelopus</italic>, <italic>Brachycephalus, Colostethus</italic>, and <italic>Polypedates</italic> also possess TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daly et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kim et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mebs et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tanu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yotsu-Yamashita and Tateki, 2010</xref>), as well as two species of freshwater flatworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Stokes et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, the TTX toxicity observed in other amphibians and freshwater animals could be derived from bacterial sources similar to those identified in this study.</p><p>One of the most interesting insights to arise from this work is the possibility that the skin microbiome contributes to the predator-prey arms race between toxic newts and TTX-resistant garter snakes. Populations of garter snakes sympatric with TTX-laden newts possess several amino acid replacements in their Na<sub>v</sub> channels that prevent TTX binding, allowing resistant snakes to prey on highly toxic newts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feldman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Geffeney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Geffeney et al., 2005</xref>). As snake populations accumulate stepwise adaptive mutations in their Na<sub>v</sub> channels, selection drives increasing levels of toxicity in newts. Reciprocal selection for elevated toxicity and resistance in newt and snake populations, respectively, leads to an asymmetric escalation of these two traits, or a ‘coevolutionary arms race’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brodie and Brodie, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brodie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dawkins and Krebs, 1979</xref>). If selection by predatory garter snakes favors increasing levels of toxicity in newt populations, selection may be acting not only on genetic variation in the host species, but also potentially on variation across the skin microbiome.</p><p>Selection could also act by increasing the relative abundance of TTX-producing symbionts in the skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bordenstein and Theis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theis et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that three abundant <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> OTUs were present in greater relative abundance in the microbiota of toxic newts compared to non-toxic newts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>). <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> OTU00042 was particularly abundant in toxic newts and a significant driver of beta diversity between the toxic and non-toxic populations. Numerous TTX-producing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> strains were also isolated in our cultivation assay, suggesting that this differential abundance may contribute to observed variation in TTX toxicity across newt populations. However, we did not observe a differential abundance of <italic>Aeromonas</italic> OTUs, which were abundant in both populations, nor of <italic>Shewanella</italic> or <italic>Sphingopyxis</italic> OTUs, which were found only on toxic newts, but were only present in a few samples and in very low abundance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results may also reflect more favorable culture conditions for TTX-producing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> spp. than for the other genera. Thus, further population-level comparisons across toxic and non-toxic newts are needed to determine whether the composition and/or structure of the microbiome directly influences newt toxicity.</p><p>Additionally, if variation in TTX toxicity is subject to selective forces, TTX-producing symbionts would need to be heritable, directly or indirectly, across generations. The mechanisms underlying microbiome heritability vary from environmental acquisition of microbes across each generation to direct vertical transmission from parent to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mandel, 2010</xref>). The development of skin-associated microbial communities in newts, and amphibians more broadly, is not clear, as both host species identity and habitat appear to play important roles across different amphibian taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ross et al., 2019</xref>). In newts, one possibility is that TTX-producing bacteria are vertically transferred from females to their eggs, as newt eggs contain TTX and egg toxicity is correlated with the toxicity of the mother (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gall et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hanifin et al., 2003</xref>). Another possibility is that newts possess adaptive traits to facilitate the acquisition and proliferation of TTX-producing bacteria anew from the environment through each generation. Host factors impacting the microbiome may include anti-microbial peptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">SanMiguel and Grice, 2015</xref>) or the production of metabolites that favor TTX-producing microbes. Other traits may influence interspecific interactions within the microbiome to promote colonization and proliferation of TTX-producing symbionts. These traits may be under selective pressure to ultimately benefit TTX-producing symbionts and increase TTX toxicity across newt populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Magarlamov et al., 2017</xref>). Further investigations comparing toxic and non-toxic newts through developmental stages in the wild and in captivity may begin to shed light on this complex process.</p><p>Furthermore, because of the challenges of in vitro cultivation and characterization of microbial physiology in symbiotic microbes isolated from their hosts, it is difficult to determine how the dynamics of TTX production are regulated within the in vivo host-associated communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Magarlamov et al., 2017</xref>). Under our culture conditions in the lab, we observed TTX production that was typically less than 0.5 ng mL<sup>−1</sup>. However, given that the TTX-producing bacteria identified in this study and in other toxic animals were grown under artificial lab conditions independent of host factors and interactions with other host-associated microbes, estimating the true biosynthetic potential of these TTX-producing bacteria poses a major technical challenge. Identifying the genetic basis of TTX production may help circumvent this problem and allow future researchers to apply sequencing-based metagenomic approaches to determine which organisms are capable of producing TTX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chau and Ciufolini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chau et al., 2011</xref>). These efforts may also facilitate the development of targeted cultivation strategies to better replicate the host environment and more accurately measure TTX production in vitro.</p><p>Our results also show that toxic newts possess adaptations in their Na<sub>v</sub> channels that confer TTX resistance. The presence of parallel mutations across the Na<sub>v</sub> channel family of newts and other TTX-resistant animals suggests that the evolution of resistance involves a highly constrained walk through a narrow adaptive landscape. For example, studies of the skeletal muscle isoform Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 across a variety of TTX-resistant snake species identify numerous convergent substitutions in the P-loop regions of DIII and DIV, but never in DI or DII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Feldman et al., 2012</xref>). The Na<sub>v</sub>1.4 subtype of TTX-resistant newts, including <italic>T. granulosa</italic>, also possess several mutations in DIV and one in DIII, but none in DI or DII. Conversely, mutations in the DI Y/F-371 site are often seen in neural subtypes of TTX-resistant pufferfishes, and we found that this mutation was present in three of the four neural subtypes of newts. Furthermore, when comparing Na<sub>v</sub> channel sequences in newts and other TTX-resistant animals, we found that Na<sub>v</sub>1.6 sequences in newts and garter snakes share two identical substitutions in the P-loops of DIII V1407I and DIV 1699V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both newt and snake Na<sub>v</sub> sequences were derived from individuals caught in Benton Co., OR, where newts are highly toxic and snakes are highly resistant. These mutations may reflect convergent molecular evolution between predators and prey responding to the same selection pressure. Whether or not these patterns have arisen by chance or through Na<sub>v</sub> subtype-specific constraints on P-loop evolution would be interesting to explore in future studies.</p><p>Given the potential strength of selection on interactions between newts and their symbiotic microbiota with regard to TTX toxicity, it may be more appropriate to consider the effects of selection across the <italic>hologenome</italic>, the collective genetic variation present in both host and symbionts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bordenstein and Theis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rosenberg and Zilber-Rosenberg, 2013</xref>). Many recent studies emphasize the critical importance of host-associated microbes in basic animal physiology, development, nutrition, nervous system function, and even behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Archie and Theis, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisthen and Theis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McFall-Ngai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shropshire and Bordenstein, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">van Opstal and Bordenstein, 2015</xref>). In the coevolutionary arms race between toxic newts and resistant snakes, selection may act upon the phenotype that emerges from the collective interactions between the newt host and bacterial symbionts, termed the <italic>holobiont</italic>. One prediction of the hologenome theory is that adaptive evolution can occur rapidly by increasing the relative abundance of specific symbionts if the metabolites derived from that symbiont are critical for holobiont fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Theis et al., 2016</xref>). This potential evolutionary force would avoid a long and winding road through a complex adaptive landscape for the host, particularly for epistatic traits such as TTX biosynthesis, which is predicted to involve a dozen or more enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chau and Ciufolini, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chau et al., 2011</xref>). Future studies exploring the relationship between newt host toxicity and the composition of newt skin microbiota could provide a mechanistic basis for the observed variation in newt toxicity across different populations, revealing potentially interesting cases of parallel evolution occurring at the hologenomic level. Overall, chemical defenses such as neurotoxins provide excellent models for investigating adaptive evolution, as these toxins often target evolutionarily conserved proteins in animal nervous systems, revealing mechanistic associations among protein sequence, physiology, and evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td>STBL2 competent cells</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>10268019</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>mSCN8A (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-16-06093.1998">10.1523/JNEUROSCI.18-16-06093.1998</ext-link></td><td/><td>Construct kindly provided by Dr. Al Goldin, UC Irvine</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>)</td><td>Oocytes</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.xenopus1.com/Xenopus1/HOME.html">xenopus1.com</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>16S_rRNA_8F</td><td>Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td>51-01-19-06</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>16S_rRNA_515F</td><td>DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01043%E2%80%9313">10.1128/AEM.01043–13</ext-link></td><td>PCR primer</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>16S_rRNA_806R</td><td>DOI: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.1128/AEM.01043-13">10.1128/AEM.01043-13</ext-link></td><td>PCR primer</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">TGGACTACHVGGGTWTCTAAT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>16S_rRNA_1492R</td><td>Integrated DNA Technologies</td><td>51-01-19-07</td><td><named-content content-type="sequence">CGGTTACCTTGTTACGACTT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>Q5 Site-directed mutagenesis kit</td><td>New England Biolabs</td><td>E0554S</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td>T7 mMessage mMachine kit</td><td>ThermoFisher Scientific</td><td>AM1344</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tetrodotoxin</td><td>Alomone Labs</td><td>T-550</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Clampfit v10.7</td><td>Molecular Devices</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Geneious v11.0.5</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.geneious.com/">geneious.com</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>mothur v1.39.5</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mothur.org/">mothur.org</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>RStudio (v3.6.1)</td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://rstudio.com/">rstudio.com</ext-link></td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Oasis MCX cartridge</td><td>Waters</td><td>186000252</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>Acquity UPLC BEH amide column</td><td>Waters</td><td>186004801</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>All procedures involving animals were approved by and conducted under the supervision of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Michigan State University (approval no. 10/15-154-00), in accordance with guidelines established by the US Public Health Service.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Laboratory animals</title><p>Adult male rough-skinned newts (<italic>Taricha granulosa</italic>) were collected in Oregon, USA (January Pond; 44°36'13.8&quot;N 123°38'12.1&quot;W) under Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife permit number 104–15.

Animals were first anesthetized in pH-corrected 0.1% tricaine-S (MS-222) dissolved in Holtfreter’s solution. Two skin biopsies were then collected from symmetrical sites on the dorsal skin surface, approximately 1 cm laterally from the vertebrae and 1 cm anterior to the hind limbs, using sterile, disposable 2 mm skin biopsy punches (Acu-Punch, Acuderm Inc, Fort Lauderdale, FL). The two skin biopsies from each individual were weighed and then combined in 300 µL 0.1 M acetic acid. Each sample was then placed into a boiling water bath for 5 min followed by an ice bath for an additional 5 min. Subsequent steps were carried out at room temperature.

Individual oocytes were collected from the ovary by enzymatic digestion using collagenase (0.4 mg mL<sup>−1</sup>, type II activity 255 µ/mg) in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free ND96 solution (in mM: 96 NaCl, 2 KCl, 1.8 CaCl2, 1 MgCl2, and 5 HEPES adjusted to pH 7.5 and supplemented with 0.1 mg/ml gentamycin, 0.55 mg/ml pyruvate, and 0.5 mM theophylline). After 90 min incubation, treated ovaries were washed 5X with normal ND96, and Stage 5 and 6 oocytes were selected for injection.</p><p>Oocytes were injected with cRNA samples using a Nanoject III (Drummond Scientific, Broomall, PA). Nanoject glass capillaries (Drummond, 3-000-203-G/X) were pulled into pipettes using a Sutter P-97 micropipette puller (Sutter Instruments Co., Novato, CA) using the following conditions: Heat = ramp+5, Pull = 100, Velocity = 50, Delay = 50, Pressure = 500. Pipettes were backfilled with mineral oil and placed onto the Nanoject. A 4 µL droplet of each cRNA sample (50 ng/µL) was front loaded into the pipette, and oocytes were injected with either 10, 25, or 50 nL of cRNA (0.5–2.5 ng/oocyte). Oocytes were incubated at 14 °C in ND96 and used for recording within 2–10 days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Electrophysiology</title><p>Macroscopic sodium currents were measured by two-electrode voltage clamp using a Warner Instruments Oocyte Clamp (model OC-725C). Borosilicate glass pipettes (1B120F-4, World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL) pulled to a 1 or 2 MΩ tip (Heat = Ramp + 5, Pull = 100, Vel = 50, Time = 50, on a Sutter Instruments P-97 puller) served as current and voltage electrodes, respectively. Pipettes were filled with 3M KCl and 0.5% agarose. Oocytes were recorded in a RC-26Z diamond bath recording chamber with a chamber volume of 350 µL (Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) in filter-sterilized ND96 recording solution (96 mM NaCL, 2 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCal2, 1 mM MgCl2, and 10 mM HEPES; pH 7.5) at room temperature (20°−22 °C). Purified TTX (Sigma Aldrich or Abcam, Cambridge, UK) was diluted in recording solution and perfused through the chamber for experimental applications. Na<sup>+</sup> current traces were digitized at 10 kHz using a Digidata 1550B (Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) and recorded in pCLAMP v10.7 (Molecular Devices). Leak currents were subtracted by P/4 correction.</p><p>The electrophysiological properties measured from each construct (wildtype, triple mutant, and three individual mutants of <italic>mSCN8A</italic>) include peak Na<sup>+</sup> current (I<sub>max</sub>), conductance, and the voltage-dependence of fast inactivation. Current-voltage (I/V) relationships for each <italic>mSCN8A</italic> construct were determined using an activation protocol in which each oocyte was clamped to a membrane potential of −100 mV and depolarized from −80 to +65 mV in 5 mV steps. The pulse duration was 50 ms with an inter-pulse interval of 5 s. Fast inactivation was measured by clamping the membrane at increasingly depolarized membrane potentials from −100 mV to +10 mV in 5 mV steps for 100 ms followed by a 50 ms test pulse at 0 mV. In such a protocol, the current generated during the test pulse is inversely related to the proportion of channels that are inactivated.</p><p>To measure the effects of TTX on I<sub>max</sub>, 10 chamber volumes (3.5 mL) of ND96 recording solution containing experimental concentrations of TTX (100 nM, 1 µM, and 10 µM) were perfused over the oocyte at a flow rate of 5 mL per min. TTX block was monitored by delivering a 50 ms test pulse of 0 mV from a holding potential of −100 mV every 10 secs. Currents were considered to have reached steady-state block when we observed no change in peak current for 10 consecutive pulses, approximately 5 mins after the application of TTX. Step activation and fast inactivation were then measured in the presence of TTX using the protocols described above. To determine whether TTX was responsible for reductions in I<sub>max</sub>, all oocytes were then washed for 5–10 mins with normal ND96 and re-recorded by the same protocols. Recordings were discontinued if the membrane leak potential increased more than 0.1 mV during the recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Electrophysiology data analysis</title><p>Data were extracted from Na<sup>+</sup> current traces in Clampfit v10.7 (Molecular Devices) and exported for analysis in R Studio v3.6.0. Peak Na<sup>+</sup> currents elicited by each voltage step in the presence of TTX were normalized relative to the maximum peak current (I<sub>max</sub>) recorded for each oocyte prior to the addition of TTX. Statistical differences in peak current in the presence and absence of TTX were determined using one-way repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) at the −20 mV depolarization step, at which I<sub>max</sub> was typically largest, followed by a post-hoc Tukey’s test with Bonferroni correction.</p><p>Normalized conductance curves for each oocyte were determined by G<sub>Na</sub> = I<sub>max</sub>/(V-V<sub>Na</sub>), where I<sub>max</sub> is the peak current, V is the voltage step, and V<sub>Na</sub> is the Na<sup>+</sup> reversal potential. V<sub>Na</sub> was assessed empirically for each oocyte from the corresponding I/V curve. Conductance-voltage plots were fit with a single Boltzman equation, G<sub>Na</sub> = 1/(1 + exp[-(V – V<sub>1/2</sub>)/k]), where V is the voltage step, V<sub>1/2</sub> is the voltage required for half-maximal activation, and k is the slope of the Boltzmann fit. The IC<sub>50</sub> for TTX binding was determined from the ratio of peak currents in the presence and absence of TTX by a single-site Langmuir equation, IC<sub>50</sub> = [TTX](I<sub>TTX</sub>/I<sub>max</sub>) / (1 – (I<sub>TTX</sub>/I<sub>max</sub>)), where I<sub>max</sub> is the peak current recorded under control conditions and I<sub>TTX</sub> is the current recorded for a given concentration of TTX. The ratio of I<sub>TTX</sub>/I<sub>max</sub> across concentrations of 0.1, 1, 10, and 30 µM were fit with a single Hill equation to generate IC<sub>50</sub> values using the <italic>drc</italic> package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ritz et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Drs.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Christelle Robert as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Mabel Cristina GonzÃ¡lez Montoya (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript of Vaelli and colleagues takes an important step in understanding the production of TTX in amphibians. The authors characterized the skin microbiome of a toxic and of a non-toxic newt population. They identified TTX producing bacteria from 4 distinct genera from the skin surface of toxic newts. They further investigated and identified new mutations of the NA<sub>v</sub> channels underlying auto-resistance to TTX.</p><p>The manuscript is really exciting and represents an important contribution to the field. Yet, some concerns should be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The comparison between one toxic and one non toxic population of newts collected at different locations, but most importantly, at different time points (3 years apart and over different seasons) weakens the manuscript. Is there any evidence for the skin microbiome to be stable over such time/seasons that can be used to support this comparison? We believe that the manuscript is strong enough when focusing on toxic newts. We suggest the authors to move the data obtained about non toxic newts (half of Figure 1H and Figure 2) to the supplementary material. Please mention in the legend of these supplementary data that the 2 newt populations were collected at different time points.</p><p>2) The comparison is also confusing as one can't extract the information regarding the presence of the TTX-producing bacteria in non toxic newts from the current figures. Is there evidence for the absence of these 4 genera/11 strains in the non toxic population? The only comparison presented was made with OTUs from <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> (Figure 2C), but what about the OTUs for Aeromonas, Shewanella and Sphingopyxis?</p><p>3) Although the presence of TTX producing bacteria was shown by culturing the bacteria in vitro, both reviewers emphasized that no evidence is presented regarding their contribution to the presence of TTX on newt skin. Would it be possible to inoculate TTX producing bacteria to non toxic/skin sterilized newts and check for the production of TTX (complementation experiment, using toxic newts as positive controls)? Can this experiment be conducted within 2 months? in the current form, one can't exclude that the TTX producing bacteria strains have an inhibited production of TTX when present on the newt skin. In the case this concern can not be addressed, the authors should (i) calculate, based on the bacteria abundance data and the TTX production data, the overall expected production explained by those taxa compared to TTX production of toxic newts, (ii) down tone the conclusions of the document, (iii) revise/down tone the title and (iv) discuss this aspect in the paper.</p><p>4) The authors claim that TTX producing bacteria may drive an evolving arms race between prey and predators. This claim is supported by the fact that the skin microbiota is determined by some immune factors (eg genetic factors in newts). The argument would even be stronger if the bacteria were transmitted from one generation to the next (in/on the eggs?). Is there any information available on the topic? is there any available information regarding the origin of the bacteria the newts carry? Please discuss.</p><p>5) One reviewer mentioned that the hypotheses the authors wanted to test were difficult to grasp due to the overwhelming references to the Result section.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53898.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:1) The comparison between one toxic and one non toxic population of newts collected at different locations, but most importantly, at different time points (3 years apart and over different seasons) weakens the manuscript.

Regardless of the temporal or geographical variables in this comparison, we believe the comparison is appropriate for our goal, which was simply to characterize the microbiota associated with newts that varied dramatically in toxicity. Thus, we have not moved the data from non-toxic newts to the supplement. However, we explicitly state that the samples were collected at different time points in the Results section.</p><p>Further, the long-term stability and effects of host species/identity and habitat on the cutaneous microbiota of wild amphibians is still a subject of ongoing research, and no clear associations can be made from existing data (see dois: 10.1038/ismej.2011.129, 10.1111/mec.12510, 10.3389/fmicb.2018.00442). We did not attempt to address questions of microbiome stability in this study, as our 16S-based characterization was intended to provide an initial insight into the skin-associated communities of wild newts and provide guidance for subsequent microbial cultivation in the lab. However, we do note that 8 of the 20 most abundant OTUs identified separately in each population are <italic>shared</italic> between the two populations. This information is included in Figure 1—source data 2. These OTUs are &gt;97% identical in sequence and were identified in separate populations at separate times, which may be indicative of a core newt microbiome. However, we only briefly mention this observation (lines 158-161) and do not emphasize this point in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The comparison is also confusing as one can't extract the information regarding the presence of the TTX-producing bacteria in non toxic newts from the current figures. Is there evidence for the absence of these 4 genera/11 strains in the non toxic population? The only comparison presented was made with OTUs from Pseudomonas (Figure 2C), but what about the OTUs for Aeromonas, Shewanella and Sphingopyxis?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original manuscript, we focused on <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> because we found several strains that produce TTX. In addition, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> were differentially abundant between toxic and non-toxic newts: our linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe) revealed that <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> were among the top 10 most differentially abundant OTUs between the two populations overall and were statistically significantly more abundant in toxic newts than non-toxic newts (Fig 2D). Coupled with our cultivation data that revealed numerous TTX-producing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> isolates, this led us to propose that toxic newts may harbor more TTX-producing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> in their microbiota. This conclusion should be tested in future studies that sample the microbiota from numerous toxic and non-toxic newt populations to determine whether a true causal relationship exists; however, such work is outside the scope of our study.</p><p>In response to the reviewers’ question, we have added a heatmap of any OTU that was classified as <italic>Pseudomonas, Aeromonas, Shewanella,</italic> or <italic>Sphingopyxis</italic> as Figure 2—figure supplement 2. We found only a single OTU for <italic>Sphingopyxis</italic> and for <italic>Shewanella</italic>, both of which were only present in toxic newts and only in a few samples. The relative abundance of these OTUs was also low. We also identified three <italic>Aeromonas</italic> OTUs, one of which was highly abundant in all newt samples from both populations (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). This result was not surprising however, as <italic>Aeromonas hydrophila</italic> is a common commensal/opportunistic pathogen of amphibians and freshwater fishes (doi: 10.1016/j.micpath.2019.02.036). We added these findings to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Although the presence of TTX producing bacteria was shown by culturing the bacteria in vitro, both reviewers emphasized that no evidence is presented regarding their contribution to the presence of TTX on newt skin. Would it be possible to inoculate TTX producing bacteria to non toxic/skin sterilized newts and check for the production of TTX (complementation experiment, using toxic newts as positive controls)? Can this experiment be conducted within 2 months? in the current form, one can't exclude that the TTX producing bacteria strains have an inhibited production of TTX when present on the newt skin. In the case this concern can not be addressed, the authors should (i) calculate, based on the bacteria abundance data and the TTX production data, the overall expected production explained by those taxa compared to TTX production of toxic newts, (ii) down tone the conclusions of the document, (iii) revise/down tone the title and (iv) discuss this aspect in the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers’ concern. We did try once to treat toxic newts with a broad-spectrum antibiotic. Overall, we did not observe significant changes in TTX levels at two weeks and one month following antibiotic treatment; we also found that the antibiotic did not substantially eliminate skin microbes. In addition, given that the newts sequester TTX in the granular glands of their skin, even killing all skin-associated bacteria may not substantially reduce newt toxicity.</p><p>Several previous studies have attempted to identify the source of TTX in rough-skinned newts and amphibians more broadly; however, we are the first to successfully isolate and culture TTX-producing bacteria from this species. Further, identifying the production of secondary metabolites from host-associated microbes is challenging when the researcher does not know whether host factors contribute to the production of the metabolite in vivo. Thus, the identification of TTX production in vitro is, we believe, a significant achievement.</p><p>To address another point the reviewers make, given the complications of host-symbiont interactions, attempting to calculate TTX production based on bacterial abundance data would almost certainly be inaccurate. Our in vitromeasurements of TTX production are likely an underestimate of the true biosynthetic potential of these isolated symbionts, particularly given that we cultured bacteria in nutrient-limited media. We have added these points to the discussion on lines 395-408. We feel that the alternative scenario presented by the reviewers, that “TTX producing bacteria strains have an inhibited production of TTX when present on the newt skin” is inconsistent with observations made in other host-bacterial interactions involving TTX. For relevant discussion of this topic, please see page 12 of doi: 10.3390/toxins9050166.</p><p>Finally, we have down toned several sentences (for example, lines 123-126) that were mentioned in the minor revisions below, but overall we feel that we have not overstated our results in the discussion. In the revised manuscript, the relevant paragraph (line 343 et seq.) begins “One of the most interesting insights to arise from this work is the possibility that the skin microbiome contributes to the predator-prey arms race between toxic newts and TTX-resistant garter snakes.” We feel this is an entirely appropriate conclusion based on our clear demonstration of TTX-producing bacteria isolated from the skin of toxic newts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors claim that TTX producing bacteria may drive an evolving arms race between prey and predators. This claim is supported by the fact that the skin microbiota is determined by some immune factors (eg genetic factors in newts). The argument would even be stronger if the bacteria were transmitted from one generation to the next (in/on the eggs?). Is there any information available on the topic? is there any available information regarding the origin of the bacteria the newts carry? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>The mode of transmission of the skin microbiota is not known for these newts, nor, to our knowledge, for any amphibian. Host-associated microbes may be acquired from the environment each generation, as in the bobtail squid, or they may be directly transmitted vertically within eggs, as is the case for aphids and many insect symbionts. The larger point is that TTX plays a well-documented, critical role in driving the arms race between newts and garter snakes (dois: 10.1007/s10886-005-1345-x, 10.1023/A:1021049125805, 10.1093/icb/43.3.408); our work adds an interesting angle to this classic body of work by showing that newts possess microbes that produce TTX, raising new questions about the target of selection in the newt-snake arms race. To clarify this point in the paper, we added a discussion of the heritability of host-associated bacteria in the discussion. We suspect that selection is acting at least in part on the newts, perhaps by increasing production of TTX precursors in newt skin or by changing the mucosal environment in a way that favors growth of TTX producers (e.g. antimicrobial peptide expression), but the list of potential targets is long and not terribly germane to the point of the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One reviewer mentioned that the hypotheses the authors wanted to test were difficult to grasp due to the overwhelming references to the Result section.</p></disp-quote><p>We rewrote large sections of the introduction to clarify our hypotheses and experimental approach and removed extraneous details that are described later in the paper.</p></body></sub-article></article>
