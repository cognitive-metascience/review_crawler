other options. Two hypotheses have received empirical support: that a high value distractor improves the accuracy with which decisions between two other options are made and that it impairs accuracy. Recently, however, it has been argued that neither observation is replicable. Inspired by neuroimaging data showing that high value distractors have different impacts on prefrontal and parietal regions, we designed a dual route decision-making model that mimics the neural signals of these regions. Here we show in the dual route model and empirical data that both enhancement and impairment effects are robust phenomena but predominate in different parts of the decision space defined by the options’ and the distractor’s values. However, beyond these constraints, both effects co-exist under similar conditions. Moreover, both effects are robust and observable in six experiments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>independence of irrelevant alternatives</kwd><kwd>multiple choice</kwd><kwd>decision models</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002920</institution-id><institution>Research Grants Council, University Grants Committee</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>25610316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chau</surname><given-names>Bolton K H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WT100973AIA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rushworth</surname><given-names>Matthew F S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>203139/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rushworth</surname><given-names>Matthew F S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P024955/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rushworth</surname><given-names>Matthew F S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The value of any choice is not static but dynamically changes as a function of the context of the alternatives even if they are seemingly irrelevant.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Independence of irrelevant alternatives is one of the assumptions of decision theory and behavioural economics: optimally, decisions between two options should be made in the same way regardless of whether or not a third option – a distractor – is also present. In practice, however, several lines of evidence suggest distractors impact on the neural mechanisms underlying choice representation and decision making and, as a result, subtly but significantly, alter the choices people and animals take (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Louie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Louie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Two forms of distractor effects have recently received attention. First, it has been reported that the relative accuracy of decisions made between two choosable options – the frequency with which the better option is chosen -- decreases as the value of a third distractor increases. This has been interpreted as a consequence of <italic>divisive normalisation</italic> – the representation of any option’s value is normalised by the sum of the values of all options present including distractors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Louie et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Louie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Louie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>). The argument is bolstered by the observation that in many sensory systems, neural codes are adaptive and the rate of neural activity recorded in response to a given stimulus is related to the range of other stimuli encountered in the same context. For example, in the context of a bright light stimulus that leads to a high rate of neural responding in the visual system, the neural responses to two dimmer stimuli will be more similar to one another than they would otherwise be (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</xref>). As a result, discerning the brighter of the two dim stimuli becomes more difficult. The contention is that a similar normalisation process occurs during value-guided decision making when a high value distractor is present.</p><p>However, it has also been found that in some circumstances the presence of a high value distractor can have a positive effect and lead to an increase in accuracy when deciding between two choosable options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). This finding was explained by reference to a cortical attractor model in which decisions are made when choice representations in a neural network occupy a high firing attractor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>). Competition between representations of choices in the network is mediated by a pool of inhibitory interneurons. In turn the activity levels of the inhibitory interneurons are driven by pools of recurrently interconnected excitatory neurons that each represents a possible choice. Increasing activity in the inhibitory interneuron pool mediating the comparison process improves decision accuracy although it may also slow decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jocham et al., 2012</xref>). Because higher value distractors lead to more activity in the inhibitory interneuron pool, decisions between the choosable options are more accurate in the presence of high value distractors.</p><p>Although the explanation was framed in terms of the cortical attractor model, any model in which comparison mechanisms interact makes similar predictions. For example, if decisions are modelled by a drift diffusion process, then a similar prediction is made if the diffusion process proceeds for longer on trials when there is strong evidence for choosing the distractor instead. This is because initiating a response towards the distractor and then inhibiting it takes a finite amount of time. This allows additional time for the comparison between the choosable options to proceed concurrently and, hence, the better of the two choosable options is more likely to be taken. Other task manipulations that allow more time for the comparison process, for example by simply providing an opportunity for a second decision, after there has been time for more evidence accumulation, also make the ‘correct’ choice more likely to emerge from the comparison process and be chosen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Resulaj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>, however, have recently reported a series of experiments in which they claim there is no evidence of either divisive normalisation or positive distractor effects. Here, we therefore review the evidence for divisive normalisation and positive distractor effects. First, we explain how divisive normalisation and positive distractor effects are not ‘opposing results’ as is sometimes claimed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>). We explain how it is possible for both effects to co-exist within the same data set but to predominate in different parts of the decision space. Second, we re-analyse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> data and show that both divisive normalisation and positive distractor effects are robustly and consistently present. Similarly re-analysis of other previously published data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>) again confirms both effects are present. In addition we report a new data set, collected at a third site, which again exhibits both effects.</p><p>Third, we investigate further the nature of the positive distractor and divisive normalisation effects by examining their manifestation in decisions in which participants make choices between options that lead to losses rather than gains. We find that the impact of larger distractor values flips from being facilitative (positive distractor effect) for gains to being disruptive (negative distractor effect) for losses while the divisive normalisation effect continues to manifest in the same direction (negative distractor effect) as originally shown for gains. This pattern of results suggests that divisive normalisation effects are truly related to the value of the distractor while the positive distractor effect is related to both the distractor’s value and salience (its unsigned value – the size of its value regardless of whether it is positive or negative).</p><p>Finally, we consider a third consequence of the presence of a distractor; sometimes people choose the distractor itself even if this runs contrary to task instructions. Such choices have been termed attentional capture effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>). Again we show that such attentional capture effects exist in other data sets. However, we also show that the existence of attentional capture effects is not mutually exclusive with either positive distractor or divisive normalisation effects. In fact, whether or not attentional capture by the distractor occurs is itself subject to similar positive distractor and divisive normalisation effects. In a final experiment we use eye tracking data to demonstrate that in fact a relationship exists between the attentional capture effect and the positive distractor effect; positive distractor effects are particularly prominent after attentional capture by the distractor. This makes it possible to link the positive distractor effect to other situations in which the provision of a greater opportunity for evidence accumulation and comparison leads to more accurate decision making, for example when allowing participants extra time to revise their initial decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Resulaj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Divisive normalisation of value and positive distractor effects should predominate in different parts of the decision space</title><p>In order to evaluate the evidence for divisive normalisation and positive distractor effects, it is necessary to realise that reports of each are not ‘opposing results’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>) that are mutually incompatible. Instead, quite the converse is the case: both effects can theoretically co-exist and do so in practice. This is because the impacts of divisive normalisation and of the positive distractor effect are more likely to be seen in different parts of the ‘decision space’ defined by the values of the higher value (HV) and lower value (LV) choosable options.</p><p>It is equally important to realise that small changes in the organisation of a neural network for making decisions could result in different distractor effects. To demonstrate this, first, we established a mutual inhibition model by simplifying a biophysically plausible model reported elsewhere that exhibits a positive distractor effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). In brief, it involves three pools of excitatory neurons that receive noisy input from the HV, LV and distractor (D) options that compete via a common pool of inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). To visualise the impact of the distractor, we plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> the model’s choice accuracy as a function of relative distractor value (i.e. D-HV) and choice difficulty (HV-LV; as HV-LV becomes smaller it means that HV and LV have increasingly similar values and it is harder and harder to select the better option during the decision). When the distractor value is relatively large (left-to-right), the model makes more accurate choices (brighter colors). A similar trend is observed on both hard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, bottom) and easy trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, top). In addition, we applied a simple general linear model (GLM) to analyse the simulated choice accuracy data (GLM1a). This GLM involves regressors that describe the difficulty (the difference between HV and LV: HV-LV), the relative value of the distractor (D-HV), and as well as an interaction term (HV-LV)(D-HV) that tests whether the distractor effect is modulated as a function of difficulty. Consistent with the pattern in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>, the results show that the model exhibits a positive D-HV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.296, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 231.858, p&lt;10<sup>−142</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). There was also a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.697, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 663.224, p&lt;10<sup>−189</sup>) and a positive (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.094, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 83.377, p&lt;10<sup>−96</sup>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Distractor effects predicted by mutual inhibition model, divisive normalisation model, and a dual route model that combines both other models.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A mutual inhibition model involves three pools of excitatory neurons that receive excitatory input from the HV, LV or D options (P<sub>HV</sub>, P<sub>LV</sub> and P<sub>D</sub>). Concurrently, all excitatory neurons further excite a common pool of inhibitory neurons P<sub>Inh</sub>, which in turn inhibit all excitatory neurons to the same extent. The HV or LV option is chosen once its accumulated evidence (y<sub>HV</sub> or y<sub>LV</sub> respectively) reaches a decision threshold. (<bold>b</bold>) The decision accuracy of the model is plotted across a decision space defined by the difficulty level (i.e. value difference between HV and LV) and the relative distractor value (D–HV). The model predicts a positive distractor effect – the decision accuracy increases (brighter colors) as a function of relative distractor value (left-to-right side). (<bold>c</bold>) A positive distractor effect is found on both hard (bottom) and easy (top) trials. (<bold>d</bold>) A GLM analysis shows that the model exhibits a positive HV-LV effect, a positive D-HV effect and a positive (HV-LV)(D–HV) effect. (<bold>e</bold>) Alternatively, a divisive normalisation model involves only two pools of excitatory neurons that receive input from either the HV or LV option. The input of each option is normalised by the value sum of all options (i.e. HV+LV+D), such that the distractor influences the model’s evidence accumulation at the input level.

In contrast, accuracy of choices made the DivNorm component (red lines) decreases as a function of D-HV in both hard and easy trials and the negative slope is steeper on easy trials.

In the divisive normalisation model, there are only two pools of excitatory neurons that are related to the HV and LV options (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). The HV and LV inputs are normalised by the value sum of all options (HV+LV+D). Hence, instead of ‘competing’ directly with the HV and LV options, the distractor influences the model’s evidence accumulation at the input level.

To demonstrate this, we designed a dual route model, which is inspired by the fact that multiple brain structures have been identified with decision making. It is likely that they compete to select choices with one system predominating in some situations and another system in other situations. For example, in many situations, the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) carries decision-related signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glimcher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gold and Shadlen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hanks et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Shea et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Platt and Glimcher, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Shadlen and Newsome, 1996</xref>) and unlike decision-related signals elsewhere in the brain they remain present even when there is limited time in which to act (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jocham et al., 2014</xref>) or when decisions have become easy because of over-training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grol et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, divisive normalisation is present in activity recorded in IPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Louie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Another region with activity that is similarly decision-related is ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Martino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">FitzGerald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez-Persem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papageorgiou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wunderlich et al., 2012</xref>). However, in contrast to IPS, the impact of divisive normalisation in vmPFC is less prominent or absent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>), vmPFC activity diminishes with task practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>), and it is only engaged when more time is available to make the decision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jocham et al., 2014</xref>). VmPFC lesions particularly disrupt the most difficult decisions but have less impact on easier ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>). The fact that lesions of vmPFC increase the impact of divisive normalisation in decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>) suggests divisive normalisation effects are mediated by a different region of the brain, such as IPS, and are perhaps even mitigated by the operation of vmPFC.</p><p>Based on these observations from vmPFC and IPS, the dual route model comprises both mutual inhibition and divisive normalisation models as components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>). The evidence is accumulated independently in the two component models. A choice is made once one of the component models has accumulated sufficient evidence. Interestingly, when the model’s decision accuracy is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j</xref>, the pattern looks very similar to the empirical data produced by human participants reported in Figure 2c of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>. On hard trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, bottom) the decision accuracy <italic>increases</italic> as a function of the relative distractor value, whereas on easy trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k</xref>, top) the decision accuracy <italic>decreases</italic> as a function of the relative distractor value. This pattern should be best captured in GLM1a by the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction term, as it reflects how the distractor effect changes as a function of the trial difficulty level (i.e. HV-LV). The results of GLM1a indeed revealed a significant negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect on decision accuracy (<italic>β</italic> = −0.047, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = −32.195, p&lt;10<sup>−55</sup>). In addition, the distractor effect is slightly biphasic on hard trials and even more so on trials with intermediate difficulty levels – the accuracy increases from low to medium D-HV values and then decreases from medium to large D-HV values. This is due to the partial effects from the divisive normalisation route and mutual inhibition route. The biphasic pattern of the distractor effect is also reported in an alternative model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, there was a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.728, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 526.591, p&lt;10<sup>−179</sup>) and an absence of D-HV main effect (<italic>β</italic> &lt;0.001, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 0.218, p=0.828; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>).</p><p>In the dual route model positive and negative distractor effects predominate in different parts of the decision space. It is possible to understand the underlying reasons by analysing the choices made by the mutual inhibition and divisive normalisation components separately (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). On hard trials, when the distractor value becomes larger, the errors made by the mutual inhibition component decrease more rapidly in frequency than the increase in errors made by the divisive normalisation component, resulting in a net positive distractor effect. In contrast, on easy trials when the distractor value becomes larger the decrease in errors made by the mutual inhibition model is much less than the increase in errors made by the divisive normalisation model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the reaction time of choices made by each component when the other component is switched off.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Both divisive normalisation of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites</title><p>These predictions are borne out by the available data from several laboratories using a multi-attribute decision making task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; Materials and methods: multi-attribute decision-making task). First, as in Figure 2c of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>, we visualised how the relative accuracy of decisions between HV and LV varied as a function of the HV-LV difference and the relative value of a distractor. Chau and colleagues manipulated distractor value with respect to HV because part of their investigation was concerned with comparing the HV-LV and HV-D signals present in neuroimaging data. However, the HV-D term has a negative relationship with the value of the distractor itself: D. This makes it less intuitive for understanding how the distractor value, D, influences choices. Here we present relative distractor value using the more intuitive D-HV term. Larger values of this term are correlated with larger values of the distractor, D.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Behavioural task in Experiments 1–7.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The behavioural task was first described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref> as follows.

A subsequent color change in one box indicated which choice the participant took. In the outcome phase of the trial the outline color of the chosen stimulus indicated whether the reward had been won. The final reward allocated to the participant on leaving the experiment was calculated by averaging the outcome of all trials.

It is important to consider these two experiments first because they employ an identical schedule. Specifically, Chau and colleagues reported both divisive normalisation effects and positive distractor effects, while Gluth and colleagues claimed they were unable to replicate these effects in their own data and when they analysed this data set from Chau and colleagues. Here we found that both data sets show a positive D-HV distractor effect. In both data sets, when decisions are difficult (HV-LV is small) then high value D-HV is associated with higher relative accuracy in choices between HV and LV; for example, the bottom rows of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a and c</xref> turn from black/dark red to yellow moving from left to right, indicating decisions are more accurate. However, when decisions were easy (HV-LV is large) then the effect is much less prominent or even reverses as would be predicted if divisive normalisation becomes more important in this part of the decision space. As in the predictions of the dual route model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j,k</xref>), on easy trials although there was an overall decreasing trend in accuracy as a function of D-HV, there was an increasing trend at very low HV-LV levels. Overall, a combination of positive and negative D-HV effects on hard and easy trials respectively suggests that there should be a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect on choice accuracy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Decision accuracy across the decision space.</title><p>Accuracy (light-yellow indicates high accuracy, dark-red indicates low accuracy) is plotted across the decision space defined by decision difficulty (HV-LV) and relative distractor value (<bold>D–HV</bold>) from (<bold>a</bold>) Experiment 1 fMRI2014, (<bold>c</bold>) Experiment 2 Gluth4, (<bold>e</bold>) Experiment 3 Hong Kong.

Just as in the dual route model, the negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction term suggested that that the D-HV effect was particularly positive on hard trials where HV-LV was small. There was also a positive main effect of HV-LV (<italic>β</italic> = 0.738, <italic>t</italic><sub>20</sub> = 8.339, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>) and no main effect of D-HV (<italic>β</italic> = 0.046, <italic>t</italic><sub>20</sub> = 0.701, p=0.491).

There was a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.571, <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = 15.159, p&lt;10<sup>−18</sup>).</p><p>In addition to being present in the data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> the same effect emerged in a third previously unreported data set (<italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong</italic>; n = 40) employing the same schedule but collected at a third site (Hong Kong). The results were highly comparable not only when the choice accuracy data were visualised using the same approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>), but also when the same GLM was applied to analyse the choice accuracy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3f</xref>). There was a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect (<italic>β</italic> = −0.089, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = −2.242, p=0.031). Again there was a positive D-HV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.207, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 5.980, p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>) and a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.485, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 12.448, p&lt;10<sup>−14</sup>). The pattern of results was consistent regardless of whether an additional HV+LV term was included in the GLM, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect was found in Experiments 1–3 when an additional HV+LV term was included in the GLM (GLM1b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>It is clear that data collected under the same conditions in 105 participants at all three sites are very similar and that a positive distractor effect consistently recurs when decisions are difficult. Next, we aggregated the data collected from the three sites and repeated the same GLM to confirm that the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction (<italic>β</italic> = −0.101, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = −4.366, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>), D-HV (<italic>β</italic> = 0.223, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 6.400, p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>) and HV-LV (<italic>β</italic> = 0.529, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 20.775, p&lt;10<sup>−38</sup>) effects were all collectively significant. Additional control analyses suggest that these effects were unlikely due to any statistical artefact (see ‘Distractor effects are not driven by statistical artefact’ for details).</p><p>As in the empirical data from human participants, in the dual route model it is particularly obvious that there is a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect on the simulated choices, which is contributed by a combination of positive D-HV effect on hard trials and negative D-HV effect on easy trials. In contrast, in the mutual inhibition and divisive normalisation models only one of the two D-HV effects is present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To ascertain which model best describes the behaviour of the participants, each model was fitted to the empirical data, that is to each participant’s choices and reaction time (RT) data. An additional <italic>null model</italic> that assumes that no distractor is present was also included in the model comparison. After fitting the models, a Bayesian model selection was performed to compare the goodness-of-fit of the models. Interestingly, the dual route model provided the best account of the participants’ behaviour when <italic>Experiments 1–3</italic> were considered as a whole (estimated frequency Ef = 0.898; exceedance probability Xp = 1.000, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–h</xref>) and when individual experiments were considered separately (<italic>Experiment 1</italic>: Ef = 0.843, Xp = 1.000; <italic>Experiment 2</italic>: Ef = 0.924, Xp = 1.000; <italic>Experiment 3</italic>: Ef = 0.864, Xp = 1.000). Furthermore, the fitted parameters were applied back to each model to predict participants’ behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The results show that the dual route model is better than the mutual inhibition, divisive normalisation, and null models in predicting both choice accuracy and reaction time.</p><p>Additional models were run to confirm that the dual route model is a better model. The above models involve assigning fixed values for the non-decision time <italic>Tnd</italic> (at 0.3 s) and inhibition level <italic>f</italic>. In one set of analysis the <italic>f</italic> is fitted as a free parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3b</xref>) and in another set of analysis both <italic>Tnd</italic> and <italic>f</italic> are fitted as free parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3c</xref>). In both cases, as in the models with fixed <italic>Tnd</italic> and <italic>f</italic>, the dual route model is a better fit compared to the other three alternative models (Ef = 0.641, Xp = 1.000 and Ef = 0.587, Xp = 1.000 respectively). Finally, a comparison of all twelve models (four models × three versions of free parameter set) shows that the dual route model with fixed <italic>Tnd</italic> and <italic>f</italic> is the best fit (Ef = 0.413, Xp = 1.000; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3d</xref>).</p><p>The next step is to examine whether the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect from GLM1a and 1b arises because of the presence of a divisive normalisation effect (i.e. negative D-HV effect) on easy trials, a positive distractor effect on hard trials, or both effects. In other words, we need to establish which component of the interaction (or in other words, which main effect) is driving the interaction. To establish which is the case, the data were median split as a function of difficulty, defined as HV-LV, so that it is possible to easily visualise the separate predictions of the divisive normalisation and positive distractor accounts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>; a similar approach was also used by Chau and colleagues in their Supplementary Figure SI.4). Then, to analyse each half of the choice accuracy data we applied GLM2a in a stepwise manner. <italic>Step one</italic> included the regressor HV-LV to partial out any choice variance shared between this term and the relative distractor term D-HV. Another regressor HV+LV was also included in the same step to completely partial out any remaining choice variance shared between the HV/LV options and D-HV. <italic>Step two</italic> then only included the regressor D-HV and was fitted on the residual choice variance of step one to determine the unique impact of the distractor. In the simulated choices of the dual route model, a positive distractor effect is found on hard trials; in other words, high D-HV value is associated with significantly greater accuracy on hard trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, blue bar; <italic>β</italic> = 0.008, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = 32.173, p&lt;10<sup>−55</sup>). The same model also exhibited a negative distractor effect, which is predicted by the divisive normalisation account, on easy trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, red bar; <italic>β</italic> = −0.003, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub> = −17.105, p&lt;10<sup>−31</sup>). A very similar pattern was also found in the empirical data across all three experiments. There was a positive distractor effect on hard trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, blue bars – <italic>Experiment 1 fMRI2014: β</italic> = 0.020, <italic>t</italic><sub>20</sub> = 2.173, p=0.042; <italic>Experiment 2 Gluth4: β</italic> = 0.021, <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = 3.366, p=0.002; <italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong: β</italic> = 0.017, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 3.081, p=0.004). Moreover, in <italic>Experiment 1 fMRI2014</italic> high value D-HV was marginally associated with less accuracy on easy trials (<italic>β</italic> = −0.015, <italic>t</italic><sub>20</sub> = −2.080, p=0.051; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> red bars) and in <italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong</italic> it was significantly associated with less accuracy on easy trials (<italic>β</italic> = −0.016, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = −3.339, p=0.002). Although the effect was not significant in <italic>Experiment 2 Gluth4</italic>, a similar negative trend was found (<italic>β</italic> = −0.005, <italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = −0.914, p=0.366), which at least supports the notion that the D-HV effect became less positive from hard to easy trials in this particular experiment. The D-HV effects were significantly different between hard and easy trials across all three experiments (<italic>Experiment 1 fMRI2014: t</italic><sub>20</sub>=2.706, p=0.014; <italic>Experiment 2 Gluth4: t</italic><sub>43</sub>=3.001, p=0.005; <italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong: t</italic><sub>39</sub>=4.847, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). Similar results were found if we tested the effect of the absolute value of D instead of the relative D-HV effect (GLM2b; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). In summary, a positive distractor effect is present when decisions are difficult in all three data sets.

(<bold>a</bold>) In accordance with the predictions of the dual route model, high value distractors (D-HV is high) facilitated decision making when the decision was hard (blue bars), whereas there was a tendency for high value distractors to impair decision making when the decision was easy (red bars).

However, participants made decisions in these experiments in a different manner: they were less likely to integrate probability and magnitude features of the options in the optimal manner when making decisions and instead were more likely to choose on the basis of a weighted sum of the probability and magnitude components of the options. Thus, in Experiments 4–6 (i.e. Gluth1-3), the difficulty of a trial can be better described by the weighted sum of the magnitude and probability components associated with each option rather than the true objective value difference HV-LV. This may be because these experiments included additional ‘decoy’ trials that were particularly difficult and on which it was especially important to consider the individual attributes of the options rather than just their integrated expected value.

The answer is likely to be complex. A fundamental consideration is that it is important to examine the possibility that both distractor effects exist rather than just the possibility that one or other effect exists. This means that it is necessary to consider not just the main effect of D-HV but also D-HV interaction effects. Gluth and colleagues, however, focus on the main effect of D-HV in most sections of their paper, apart from their table S2. Careful scrutiny of their table S2 reveals that the (D-HV)(HV-LV) interaction is reliably significant in their data. A further consideration concerns the precise way in which the impact of the distractor D is indexed in the GLM particularly on control trials where no distractor is actually presented. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> recommend that a notional value of D is assigned to control trials which corresponds to the distractor’s average value when it appears on distractor trials. In addition, they emphasise that HV-LV and D-HV should be normalised (i.e. demeaned and divided by the standard deviation) before calculating the (HV-LV)(D-HV) term. If we run an analysis of their data in this way then we obtain similar results to those described by Gluth and colleagues in their Table S2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref> here). Although a D-HV main effect was absent, the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction term was significant when data from all their experiments are considered together. While Gluth and colleagues omitted any analysis of the data from Experiment 1 fMRI, we have performed this analysis and once again a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect is clear (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>).</p><p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy in the interpretation concerns the other three experiments reported by Gluth and colleagues. We turn to these next.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Examining distractor effects in further experiments</title><p>We can also examine the impact of distractors in three further experiments reported by Gluth and colleagues. Below, we show that essentially the same pattern of results emerges in these experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>): <italic>Experiment 4 Gluth3; Experiment 5 Gluth2; Experiment 6 Gluth1</italic>. Before we examine the data in detail, however, it is worth noting some differences between the experiments. First, the way in which participants made decisions in these next experiments was different. In the first three experiments participants tended to combine the information that the choice stimuli provided about both reward probability and reward magnitude; their choices indicated that they tended to choose the option where the product of reward probability and reward magnitude was larger than that of the alternative. By contrast in the next three experiments participants were still attracted by large reward probability options and large reward magnitude options but they did not always integrate reward magnitude and reward probability information to choose the option with the larger overall value. This is apparent when two simple GLMs (GLM3a and GLM3b) were used to describe the accuracy of each participant’s decision making. GLM3a involves two terms that relate to the expected values of the HV and LV option. The first term is, as previously, the HV-LV value difference term. The second term is an HV+LV term which captures the remaining variance associated with the HV and LV expected values. GLM3b, however, included four separate attribute-based terms. It involves two terms that describe the difference in reward magnitude and the difference in reward probability of the HV and LV options. It also involves two terms that describe the sum in reward magnitude and sum in probability of the two options, which capture the remaining variance of the attributes of the two options. The Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value was significantly smaller in the attribute-based GLM3b than the value-based GLM3a in all Gluth’s experiments: that is <italic>Experiments 2</italic> (<italic>t</italic><sub>43</sub> = 3.540, p&lt;0.001), <italic>4</italic> (<italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 1.942, p=0.065; where the difference was marginal), 5 (<italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub> = 5.616, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) and <italic>6</italic> (<italic>t</italic><sub>30</sub> = 3.635, p=0.004). This was not the case for the experiments conducted elsewhere: <italic>Experiments 1</italic> (<italic>t</italic><sub>20</sub> = 1.067, p=0.299) and <italic>3</italic> (<italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 1.311, p=0.198).</p><p>In summary, in participants from <italic>Experiments 2</italic> and <italic>4–6</italic> (i.e. <italic>Gluth1-4</italic>), the difficulty of a trial could be better described by the weighted sum of the magnitude and probability components associated with each option rather than the true objective value difference HV-LV. It is not clear why Gluth and colleagues’ participants performed the task in this way but we know that people and animals often make decisions in a similar manner in other experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Farashahi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Scholl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Scholl et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, while the behaviour of the participants in experiments 1 and 3 is not explained better by an attribute-based model than by the more normative model employing values based on the integration of both magnitude and probability, the integrative model is not a significantly better one. This suggests that they may have a tendency to use attribute-based heuristics. One way of interpreting such behaviour is that participants are not acting as if they estimate the HV and LV values from their magnitude and probability components in the optimal multiplicative manner but instead they are acting as if using an additive heuristic. Further consideration of the details of <italic>Experiments 4–6</italic> suggest possible reasons why participants might have been particularly prone to behave in this way in these experiments. The stimuli used in all six experiments were two dimensional in nature; stimulus color and orientation respectively indicated the expected magnitude and probability of the reward that participants would receive for taking a choice. This approach was taken by Chau and colleagues in their initial experiments because it was conjectured that positive distractor effects might be linked to vmPFC/mOFC and it is known that vmPFC/mOFC plays an important role when decisions are made between multi-attribute options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fellows, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papageorgiou et al., 2017</xref>). However, because <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> were interested in the possibility of ‘decoy’ effects they included a number of ‘novel’ trials in <italic>Experiments 4–6</italic> in addition to those that were used in the initial experiment by Chau and colleagues. Some decoy effects occur when decisions are difficult (HV and LV are close together in value) but the value associated with one of the components of the distractor is close to the value of one of the components associated with either HV or LV. They therefore included additional trials that were particularly difficult and on which it was especially important to consider the individual attributes of the options rather than just their integrated expected value. These additional trials accounted for 27% of all trials in <italic>Experiments 4–6</italic> and it is possible that this caused the participants to use an attribute-based approach when making their choices.</p><p>When we median split the data from <italic>Experiments 4–6</italic> as a function of difficulty described by HV-LV, we were not able to find any distractor effects on both hard (|<italic>t</italic>| &lt; 1.393, p&gt;0.178) and easy trials (|<italic>t</italic>| &lt; 1.072, p&gt;0.295). However, it is not so surprising that such an analysis was unable to reveal any difficulty-dependent distractor effect because for these participants in these experiments, difficulty is a function of the individual attributes rather than the correctly integrated expected value of each option. Thus, we extracted the weighting of each individual attribute on choice accuracy estimated in GLM3b above and calculated the difference in weighting between HV and LV for each component attribute. We then estimated the sum of the weighted probability difference and weighted magnitude difference and used this to estimate the subjective difference in the values of HV and LV and used this as an index of difficulty.</p><p>Interestingly, when we median split the trials according to this attribute-based difficulty index and applied GLM2c, which only differs from GLM2a by how difficulty is defined, the results of <italic>Experiments 4–6</italic> were then highly comparable to those found in <italic>Experiments 1–3</italic>. On hard trials, a positive D-HV effect was found in <italic>Experiments 4</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = 0.038, <italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = 3.958, p&lt;0.001), <italic>5</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = 0.046, <italic>t</italic><sub>48</sub> = 7.403, p&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>) and <italic>6</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = 0.0343, <italic>t</italic><sub>30</sub> = 4.278, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). On easy trials, a negative D-HV effect was found in <italic>Experiment 5</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = −0.014, <italic>t</italic><sub>45</sub> = −3.997, p&lt;0.001) and <italic>Experiment 6</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = −0.013, <italic>t</italic><sub>30</sub> = −2.590, p=0.015), while a similar trend was found in <italic>Experiment 4</italic> (<italic>β</italic> = −0.011, <italic>t</italic><sub>22</sub> = −1.684, p=0.106). We note that it was difficult to fit models to the data in three of the 149 participants (all were participants in <italic>Experiment 5</italic>) because their choices were all accurate on hard trials and so their data were omitted from the analysis. The D-HV effect was significantly different between hard and easy trials across all three experiments (<italic>t</italic> &gt; 4.428, p&lt;0.001). Again, a similar pattern of results emerged when the analyses employed the absolute value of D rather than the relative D-HV term (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>We realised that it is possible to observe similar difficulty-dependent distractor effects in all six experiments by analysing all data with one single approach. This is consistent with the fact that, even in <italic>Experiments 1</italic> and <italic>3</italic>, participants do not integrate probability and magnitude in the normatively optimal way but have some bias towards attribute-based heuristics even if it is not as strong as in <italic>Experiments</italic> 2, and 4–6. We excluded all ‘novel’ trials in <italic>Experiments 2, 4–6</italic>, added by Gluth and colleagues for testing decoy effects and applied a simple regression GLM2c (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref> for details). We found that there was a significant difference in the D effect between hard and easy trials in each of the six experiments (<italic>t</italic> &gt; 2.220, p&lt;0.034). The same is also true when we combined the data from all six experiments (<italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 7.679, p&lt;10<sup>−12</sup>). Finally, there was a positive distractor effect on hard trials (<italic>β</italic> = 0.026, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 6.080, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>) and a negative distractor effect on easy trials (<italic>β</italic> = −0.017, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = −4.732, p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) when all six experiments were considered together.</p><p>Finally, the four models (dual-route, mutual inhibition, divisive normalisation and null) were applied to fit the data of <italic>Experiments 4–6</italic>.

First, all of the interaction terms are calculated after their component parts, the difficulty and distractor terms, are <italic>z</italic>-scored (i.e. centered by the mean and then divided by the standard deviation). Second, the interaction effects were further confirmed by median splitting the data by difficulty level and testing the distractor effect on each half of the trials. The finding of opposite distractor effects on hard and easy trials when analysed separately is a key characteristic of true interaction effects. Additional simulations and control analyses also confirmed that the difficulty-dependent distractor effect was not due to any statistical artefact (Appendices 1 and 2).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>A more complete analysis of distractor effects</title><p>The dual route model predicts that the distractor effect varies to a degree as a function of difficulty (HV-LV; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1j,k</xref>). Other factors also mean that different types of distractor effects should be seen in different parts of the decision space. Even, in isolation, the divisive normalisation model predicts that the distractor effect varies strongly as a function of another term, the value sum: HV+LV. Since the overall normalisation effect depends on the total integrated value of the options (HV+LV+D), variance in this term mainly reflects variance in D when HV+LV is small. Thus, the dual route model predicts that negative distractor effect driven by the divisive normalisation component should become weaker when the value sum HV+LV is large and positive distractor effect driven by the mutual inhibition component should become stronger. This is exactly what has been shown in further analyses of the simulated data of the dual route model and the empirical data of the actual participants (Appendix 3).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Attentional capture distractor effects and further evidence for positive distractor effects and divisive normalisation</title><p>So far we have established that both positive and negative distractor effects on choice accuracy (i.e. choosing HV over LV) were each most robust in different parts of the decision space. Despite the fact that in all experiments participants were instructed not to choose the distractor, it was still chosen by mistake on some trials. These trials were excluded in all the analyses presented above. However, Gluth and colleagues emphasised that the distractor has an <italic>attentional-capture</italic> effect that impaired choice accuracy. As such, they found that when the distractor value was large, participants made more mistakes by choosing the distractor itself more often.</p><p>We consider that the <italic>attentional-capture</italic> effect and the difficulty-dependent distractor effects that we have described above (i.e. both the positive and negative distractor effects) should not be thought of as mutually exclusive. To illustrate this, we ran an analysis that also included trials where the distractor was chosen and then applied an analysis similar to GLM1a again. Unlike Gluth and colleagues who ran a binomial logistic regression to test whether HV or collectively LV and D were chosen, here in GLM1c we ran a multinomial logistic regression. In this analysis, we were able to test the effects of distractor value on the choice ratio between HV and LV and on the choice ratio between HV and D separately. This means that a single analysis has the power to reveal both attentional capture effects as well as other distractor effects. We also only included participants with at least three trials on which the distractor was chosen (n = 180). We removed another six participants that showed exceptionally large beta weights (|β|&gt;10) for the constant term on the HV/D choice ratio (remaining participants: n = 174), although the removal of these participants did not change the pattern of the results. First, we again replicated the finding that there was a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect (<italic>β</italic> = −0.076, <italic>t</italic><sub>173</sub> = −4.044, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>) and also a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic> = −0.530, <italic>t</italic><sub>173</sub> = −23.953, p&lt;10<sup>−56</sup>) on the choice ratio between HV and LV (i.e. choice accuracy; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). In addition, as the attentional capture model suggested, there was also a positive HV-D effect on the choice ratio between HV and D (<italic>β</italic> = 1.176, <italic>t</italic><sub>173</sub> = 18.996, p&lt;10<sup>−43</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>) – the HV was chosen more often when its own value was large and the same was true for the distractor when D value was large.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>A further replication of distractor effects in 174 participants.</title><p>On some occasions ‘attentional capture’ occurs and participants, contrary to their instructions choose the distractor itself. It is possible to analyse how participants distribute their choices between the choosable options HV and LV and between the high value choosable option HV and the distractor D using multinomial logistic regression. (<bold>a</bold>) Multinomial regression confirms that HV is chosen over LV if the HV-LV difference is large but also confirms that there is an interaction between this term and the difference in value between D and HV. (<bold>b</bold>) There are also, however, parallel effects when decisions between HV and D are now considered. In parallel to the main effect seen in decisions between HV and LV, decisions between HV and D are mainly driven by the difference in value between these two chooseable options – the HV-D difference. In parallel to the distractor effect seen when decisions are made between HV and LV, there is also an effect of the third option, now LV, when decisions between HV and D are considered; there is an (HV-D)(LV-HV) interaction. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001. Error bars indicate standard error.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53850-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Interestingly, in the same analysis we found additional evidence of both difficulty-dependent distractor effects and the attentional capture distractor effect. This is because in each of the six experiments we have considered so far there is effectively a second data set that co-exists somewhat like a palimpsest alongside the main one. Normally, the D option is regarded as a distractor when the HV/LV choice ratio (i.e. choice accuracy) is considered. However, analogously in the multinomial analysis the LV option can be regarded as a ‘distractor’ when we consider the HV/D choice ratio. Hence, we can also test the difficulty-dependent ‘distractor’ effect of LV on the HV/D choice ratio using the (HV-LV)(D-HV) term. It may be helpful to point out that the analogous term for testing the LV distractor effect on the HV/D choice ratio is perhaps most obviously (HV-D)(LV-HV) but this is mathematically identical to (HV-LV)(D-HV). Critically, we found a negative (HV-D)(LV-HV) effect on the HV/D choice ratio (<italic>β</italic> = −0.142, <italic>t</italic><sub>173</sub> = −2.674, p=0.008; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), suggesting that on hard trials (HV-D is the relevant metric of difficulty when considering the HV/D choice ratio; a small HV-D difference means that it is difficult to select the HV option over the D option) more HV choices were chosen over D when the value of the ‘distracting’ LV option was large. Ideally, a follow-up analysis of the negative (HV-D)(LV-HV) effect should also be run to examine how the distractor LV-HV effect varied from hard (small HV-D) to easy (large HV-D) trials. Since choices of the D option were rare, splitting the trials further according to the median HV-D index is obviously likely to result in even smaller numbers of D choices in each half of the data, especially in the half with large HV-D. This, in turn, is likely to lead to unreliable estimates of effect sizes. However, we still attempted to perform this analysis (which is analogous to those performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In particular, we applied a GLM that involved regressors HV-D, HV+D and LV-HV and focused on the LV-HV distractor effect in each half of the data. The results showed that on hard (small HV-D) trials there was a positive distractor LV-HV effect on the HV/D choice ratio (<italic>β</italic> = 0.170, <italic>t</italic><sub>171</sub> = −2.517, p=0.013). Another two participants were excluded in this analysis due to exceptionally large beta weights (|β|&gt;10). Next, we repeated the same analysis on easy (large HV-D) trials. As expected, a large number of participants had to be excluded in this analysis – 107 participants did not choose the D option on these trials and 22 participants showed exceptionally large beta weights (|β|&gt;10). Nevertheless, on easy (large HV-D) trials in the remaining 45 participants there was a lack of distractor LV-HV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.017, <italic>t</italic><sub>44</sub> = 1.407, p=0.936). Although it is expected that the distractor LV-HV effect should be negative on easy trials, it is possible that this is due to the scarcity of D choices. Finally, there was a significant difference in LV-HV effect between the hard and easy trials in these participants (<italic>t</italic><sub>44</sub> = 6.126, p&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>).</p><p>Taken together, the multinomial logistic regression provided evidence supporting both difficulty-dependent distractor effects and attentional capture distractor effects both when we consider the HV/LV choice ratio that has been the focus of previous studies but also when we consider the HV/D choice ratio that is often simultaneously present in these studies due to erroneous choices of the distractor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Experiment 7: Loss experiment</title><p>The attentional capture model raises the question of whether any distractor effect on choice accuracy is due to the value or the salience of the distractor. This is difficult to test in most reward-based decision making experiments because the value and salience of an option are often collinear – more rewarding options are both larger in value and more salient – and it is not possible to determine which factor drives behaviour. One way of breaking the collinearity between value and salience is to introduce options that lead to loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahnt et al., 2014</xref>). As such, the smallest value options that lead to great loss are very salient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, bottom), the medium value options that lead to small gains or losses are not salient and the largest value options that lead to great gain are again very salient. Having a combination of gain and loss scenarios in an experiment enables the investigation of whether the positive and negative distractor effects, related to mutual inhibition and divisive normalisation respectively, are driven by the distractor’s value, salience or both. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a and b</xref> show four hypothetical cases of how the distractor may influence accuracy. Hypothesis one suggests that larger distractor <italic>values</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, first row, left-to-right), which correspond to fewer losses or more gains, are related to greater accuracies (brighter colors). This is also predicted by the mutual inhibition component of the dual route model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and can be described as a positive D effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Hypothesis two suggests larger distractor saliences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, second row, center-to-sides) are related to greater accuracies (brighter colors). This can be described as a positive |D| effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Under this hypothesis the mutual inhibition decision making component receives salience, rather than value, as an input. Hypotheses 3 and 4 are the opposites of Hypotheses 1 and 2, and predict negative distractor effects as a result of the divisive normalisation component depending on whether the input involves value or salience. Hypothesis three predicts a value-based effect in which larger distractor values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, third row, left-to-right) are related to poorer accuracies (darker colors). Hypothesis four predicts a salience-based effect in which larger distractor saliences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, fourth row, center-to-sides) are related to poorer accuracies (darker colors). It is important to note that these four hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The earlier sections have demonstrated that positive and negative distractor effects can co-exist and predominate in different parts of decision space.

The first and second hypotheses suggest that the distractor effect is positive, which is predicted by the mutual inhibition model and is related to the distractor’s value and salience respectively. The third and fourth hypotheses suggest that the distractor effect is negative, which is predicted by the divisive normalisation model, and is related to its value and salience respectively. All four hypothesis are not mutually exclusive – value and salience are orthogonal factors and positive/negative distractor effects can predominate different parts of decision space.

Accuracy (light-yellow indicates high accuracy, dark-red indicates low accuracy) is plotted across the decision space defined by decision difficulty (HV-LV) and relative distractor value (D–HV). (<bold>c</bold>, left) A similar plot using the data from the loss trials of Experiment 7 Loss Experiment is shown. (<bold>d</bold>) GLM analysis indicates the distractor value D had a negative effect, suggesting that accuracy was more impaired on trials with distractors that were associated with fewer losses or more gains. In contrast, the distractor salience |D| had a positive effect, suggesting that accuracy was more facilitated on trials with more salient distractors (i.e. those related to larger gains or losses). (<bold>e</bold>, left) The negative value D effect was significant on easy trials (orange) and reversed and became positive on hard trials (blue). (<bold>e</bold>, right) In contrast, the positive salience |D| effect was significant on both hard and easy trials. In the dual route model, there are two components that guide decision making in parallel. This pattern suggests that the positive distractor effect of the mutual inhibition component is related to the salience and value of the distractor whereas the negative distractor effect of the divisive normalisation component is most closely related to the value of the distractor. *p&lt;0.05, **p&lt;0.01, ***p&lt;0.001.

We therefore refer to these additional trials as belonging to <italic>Experiment 7 Loss Experiment</italic> (n = 40 as in <italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong</italic>). The effect of signed D reflects the value of the distractor while the effect of the unsigned, absolute size of D (i.e. |D|) reflects the salience of the distractor. The correlation between these two parameters was low (<italic>r</italic> = 0.005), such that it was possible to isolate the impact that they each had on behaviour.</p><p>As in other experiments, we first plotted the accuracy as a function of difficulty (HV-LV) and relative distractor value (D-HV).

As described before, when the decisions were hard (bottom rows) larger distractor values were associated with greater accuracies (left-to-right: the colors change from dark to bright; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>) and when the decisions were easy, larger distractor values were associated with poorer accuracies (left-to-right: the colors change from bright to dark; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In a similar manner, the left panel of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> shows the accuracy data of the loss trials in <italic>Experiment 7</italic>. Strikingly, on both hard and easy trials (top and bottom rows), larger distractor values were associated with poorer accuracies (left-to-right: the colours changes from bright to dark).</p><p>To isolate the value-based and salience-based effects of D, we performed GLM6a (Materials and methods) to analyse both the gain and loss trials in <italic>Experiments 3</italic> and <italic>7</italic> at the same time. GLM6 includes the signed and unsigned value of D (i.e. D and |D| respectively). We also included a binary term, GainTrial, to describe whether the trial presented gain options or loss options and, as in GLM1a, we included the HV-LV term and its interaction with D but now also with |D| [i.e. (HV-LV)D and (HV-LV)|D| respectively]. The results showed a negative effect of value D (<italic>β</italic> = −0.236, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = −2.382, p=0.022; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) and a negative effect of (HV-LV)D interaction (<italic>β</italic> = −0.205, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = −2.512, p=0.016). In addition, there was a positive effect of salience |D| (<italic>β</italic> = 0.152, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 3.253, p=0.002) and a positive effect of (HV-LV)|D| (<italic>β</italic> = 0.219, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 3.448, p=0.001). Next, we examined closely the value-based and salience-based effect in different parts of decision space.</p><p>As in the analysis for Experiments 1–6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, we split the data (which included both gain and loss trials) according to the median HV-LV, such that the distractor effects can be examined on hard and easy trials separately. We applied GLM6b that first partialled out the effects of HV-LV, HV+LV and GainTrial from the accuracy data and then tested the overall effect of value D across the gain and loss trials. Similar to Experiments 1–6, a positive value D effect was identified on hard trials (<italic>β</italic> = 0.008, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 2.463, p=0.017; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, left) and a negative value D effect was identified on easy trials (<italic>β</italic> = −0.011, <italic>t</italic><sub>38</sub> = −3.807, p&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>; note that one participant was excluded due to the lack of variance in the accuracy data). Then we applied GLM6c which was similar to GLM6b but the value D term was replaced by the salience |D| term. The results showed that there were positive salience |D| effects on both hard (<italic>β</italic> = 0.011, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub> = 2.119, p=0.041; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>, right) and easy trials (<italic>β</italic> = 0.009, <italic>t</italic><sub>38</sub> = 2.338, p=0.025).</p><p>Taken together, in Experiments 1–6 a positive distractor effect predicted by the mutual inhibition model and a negative distractor effect predicted by the divisive normalisation model were found on hard and easy trials respectively. The results of Experiments 3 and 7 suggest that these effects are value-based and that the effects are continuous across the gain and loss value space. In addition, however, there was also a positive distractor effect that was salience-based that appeared on both hard and easy trials, suggesting that the effects driven by the mutual inhibition decision making component can be both value-based and salience-based.</p><p>In the future it might be possible to extend the models outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and S1 to provide a more quantitative descriptions of behaviour. While this topic is of great interest it will require modelers to agree on how loss trials might be modelled. For example, one possibility is to have a negative drift rate in the models that we have used. This implies that the decisions will then be about which option to avoid rather than which option to choose, because options that are more negative in value will reach the decision threshold more quickly. It is unclear, however, whether participants used such an avoidance approach in Experiment 7. Hence, we have refrained from modelling the results of Experiment 7.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>A relationship between attentional capture and positive distractor-salience effects</title><p>Although <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> reported an absence of divisive normalisation and positive distractor effects, as we have noted they emphasised the attentional capture effect. In essence the attentional capture effect is the observation that sometimes participants attempted to choose the distractor itself rather that one or other of the choosable options (even though this ran contrary to the instructions they had been given). In a similar vein, when analysing the data from both gain and loss trials in <italic>Experiments 3</italic> and <italic>7</italic>, we also found that the positive effect of the distractor reflected its salience, in addition to value; as suggested by Gluth and colleagues, salient distractors capture attention.

We found evidence for attentional capture when D had a high value; participants fixated D more frequently when D’s value was high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>; GLM7; <italic>β</italic> = 0.058, <italic>t</italic><sub>20</sub> = 4.719, p&lt;0.001).

For example, in the cortical attractor network model, this is due to the pulse of activity in the inhibitory interneuron pool that follows from the high-valued D input. This slows the selection of all options, which subsequently allows more time for evidence in favor of HV rather than LV to be accumulated. However, such models do more than simply predict the unavailable distractor option, D should be the focus of behaviour. In addition they argue that participants should go on to shift focus to the HV option as they realise the distractor option D is unavailable, and so no longer attend to it, so that the distractor boosts rather than lessens accuracy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Larger D values were associated with more gaze shifts from D to HV and more accurate decisions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A multivariate regression analysis showed that larger D values were associated with attentional capture effects as indexed by more fixations at D (right, purple bar).

The majority of studies have focused on binary choice scenarios in which participants decide between two options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glimcher, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>) but it is increasingly clear that the presence of an additional distractor may have an impact on which decisions are made between two choosable options. The nature of this impact varies as a function of the decision’s position within a decision space defined by the values of the choosable options (HV, LV) and the distractor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). When the values of choosable options and distractor are relatively low and high respectively then divisive normalisation means that decision accuracy is robustly and consistently impaired in data sets from a total of 243 participants from three sites (<italic>Experiments 1–6</italic> and <italic>8</italic>) including data sets from which such effects have previously been claimed to be absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>). When decisions are difficult (HV-LV is small) then high value as opposed to low value distractors robustly and consistently lead to an increase in accuracy in the same data sets.</p><p>A further experiment demonstrated a key difference in the nature of the positive distractor effect and the divisive normalisation effect. While the divisive normalisation effect is related to the distractor value on easy trials and the positive distractor effect is related to the distractor value on hard trials, an additional positive distractor effect is also related to the salience of distractor on both hard and easy trials. When participants make decisions between options associated with losses, the presence of more appealing distractor options (i.e. those associated with less loss) are also less salient. On easy trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, left panel, top rows) the distractors exert a combination of a value-based divisive normalization effect and a salience-based distractor effect (i.e. the reverse of the ‘positive distractor effect’) that results in a particularly strong negative effect on accuracy. In contrast, on hard trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>, left panel, bottom rows) the distractors exert a combination of a value-based positive distractor effect and a salience-based effect (i.e. reversed ‘positive distractor effect’) that result in a particularly weak effect on accuracy.</p><p>Positive distractor effects may be a consequence of interactions not just between the representations of choosable options in neural networks but interactions between these representations and the representation of the distractor. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref> argued that one way to think about these interactions is in terms of the cortical attractor model of decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wong and Wang, 2006</xref>). In such models separate pools of recurrently connected excitatory interneurons represent each possible choosable option and the distractor. Each pool receives an excitatory input proportional to its value. A common pool of inhibitory interneurons mediates competition or comparison between the pools of excitatory neurons representing the choosable options and distractor. As each option pool becomes more active it increases the activity in the inhibitory pool and this in turn leads to inhibition of the other option pools. Ultimately this means that the network ends up in one of a limited number of attractor states in which the pool representing the chosen option is in a high firing state but the pools representing the other options are in low firing states. If the option that is left in the high firing state is the highest value option (HV) then the decision taken is accurate. This should be the outcome of the competition because this pool received the highest input. However, the presence of some degree of stochasticity in the neural activity levels means that this is not always the case and when decisions are difficult (HV-LV is low) then sometimes the wrong choice is taken. Such effects are less likely to occur when the inhibitory interneurons mediating the decision process are more active, so that the evidence accumulation process is extended and decisions are less influenced by the noise. Sometimes the inhibitory interneuron pool is more active simply because of an individual difference; individuals with higher levels of inhibitory neurotransmitters such as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) in vmPFC/mOFC are more accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jocham et al., 2012</xref>). The inhibitory interneuron pool will also be more active when the distractor has a high value (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). In other situations, allowing participants more time to consider a decision, by giving them a later opportunity to revise their initial decision, also leads to greater accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Resulaj et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">van den Berg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Such predictions are not, however, limited to the cortical attractor model. A similar prediction might be made by other models, such as the mutual inhibition model used here, which is essentially a diffusion model but which posits interactions between the diffusion process comparing the values of the choosable options and the processes involved in selecting (and subsequently inhibiting selection) of the distractor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,c</xref>).</p><p>Decision making has been linked to neural processes in a number of brain circuits and it is increasingly clear that more than a single neural mechanism for decision making exists and that they operate in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rushworth et al., 2012</xref>). The mechanisms are not completely redundant with one another. Different mechanisms operate on different time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meder et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wittmann et al., 2016</xref>), are in receipt of different types of information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hunt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kennerley et al., 2009</xref>), and are anatomically placed to exert different types of influence on behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rushworth et al., 2012</xref>). There has been particular interest in two cortical regions in humans and other primates such as macaques: vmPFC/mOFC and IPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hunt and Hayden, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papageorgiou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philiastides et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shadlen and Kiani, 2013</xref>). The positive distractor effect may be particularly associated with vmPFC/mOFC. Activity in vmPFC/mOFC reflects the key decision variable – the difference in value between choosable options – during decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Basten et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Boorman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Martino et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lim et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez-Persem et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papageorgiou et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Philiastides et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Strait et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wunderlich et al., 2012</xref>). However, the size of the vmPFC/mOFC signal reflecting the difference in value between choosable options increases as D increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). A similar phenomenon has also been noted in vmPFC/mOFC in macaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, individual variation in the size of the neural effect is related to individual variation in the size of the positive distractor effect in behaviour (Figure 5 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, it is noteworthy that lesions in vmPFC/mOFC disrupt the balance between positive and negative distractor effects. VmPFC/mOFC lesions leave both macaques and human patients more vulnerable to the disruptive effects of distractors that are predicted by divisive normalisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Noonan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noonan et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Both lesion and neuroimaging experiments suggest that vmPFC/mOFC is especially important in novel as opposed to over-trained decisions and in decisions involving multi-attribute options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fellows, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Papageorgiou et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore possible that the positive distractor effects seen in the current experiment and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fouragnan et al., 2019</xref>) may be most prominent when decisions are being made between multi-attribute options or option values that have been newly learned or which are changing. A valuable distractor slows down the decision-making process and reduces choice stochasticity.</p><p>By contrast, divisive normalisation may be particularly associated with IPS. Divisive normalisation is a useful feature for a neural network model to have if it is to adapt to contexts with different overall levels of input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carandini and Heeger, 2012</xref>). Chau and colleagues (Figure 7 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>) reported a divisive normalisation-like decrement in performance that was associated with a decrease in the decision variable signal in IPS. Moreover, individual variation in the IPS-signal change was correlated with individual variation in the behavioural effect. Divisive normalisation has also been reported in the value signals recorded from individual neurons in IPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Louie et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Louie et al., 2014</xref>). IPS neurons frequently have sensorimotor fields and given the prominence of divisive normalisation effects throughout sensory brain circuits it is perhaps not surprising that normalisation is also found in value-driven signals in IPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Louie et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast to vmPFC/mOFC, decision-related signals in IPS become more prominent rather than less prominent with practice and training (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grol et al., 2006</xref>). If divisive normalisation is indeed linked to IPS then it may become more prominent with familiarity. Other types of distractor effects may be mediated by activity changes in yet other circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Summary of approach</title><p>We first conducted a series of computational modelling analyses to make predictions about the effect of distractors on choice accuracy. Then, we re-analysed empirical data from a series of experiments reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> and report data from three new experiments. In the first experiment, we re-analysed a data set that comes from a group of participants who performed an fMRI study. We refer to this first experiment as <italic>Experiment 1 fMRI2014</italic>. The second data set comes from Gluth and colleagues’ experiment 4 (<italic>Experiment 2 Gluth4</italic>). We focus on this data set next because it employs an identical schedule to the one used by Chau and colleagues. The third experiment again uses the same schedule but is previously unpublished. It was collected at a third site – Hong Kong – and so we refer to it as <italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong</italic>. The fourth, fifth, and sixth experiments are re-analyses of Gluth and colleagues experiments 1, 2, and 3 and are therefore referred to as <italic>Experiment 4 Gluth1, Experiment 5 Gluth2, Experiment 6 Gluth3</italic> respectively. An additional analysis was based on additional trials also collected at the same time as those collected for <italic>Experiment three</italic> and which again have not previously been published. The procedure used in these trials was similar to that used in all previous experiments and the schedule is very similar to that used in <italic>Experiments 1, 2,</italic> and <italic>3</italic>. The difference between these trials and those in all earlier experiments is that participants’ choices lead them to lose rather than win money. This experiment was conducted to establish whether positive distractor effects and divisive normalisation effects were related to the value or the salience of the distractor. It is therefore referred to as <italic>Experiment 7 loss experiment</italic>. The final experiment is also previously unpublished and used a new experimental procedure that made it possible to examine eye movements. It is therefore referred to as <italic>Experiment 8 Eye Movement</italic>. Finally, we note that although we have previously shared our data with Gluth and colleagues, the arrangement was not reciprocal, and so this is the first time we have been able to analyse the data from their experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Computational modelling</title><p>The <italic>mutual inhibition model</italic> is a simplified form of a biophysically plausible model that is reported elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref>).

Experiments 2–6 were replicates of Experiment one in which they all tested whether there was a difficulty-dependent distractor effect via the (HV-LV)(D-HV) term in GLM1a. In Experiment 1, the effect size in Cohen’s d for the (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect was d = 0.790. The required sample size was calculated at 13 participants and Experiments 1–6 all involved larger samples. Experiment seven was conducted simultaneously with Experiment three in which it tested the salience-based effect of the distractor via the |D| term in GLM6a. The effect size in Cohen’s d for the |D| effect was d = 0.514. The required sample size was calculated at 30 participants and the sample of Experiment seven exceeded this size. Experiment eight examined the impact of attentional capture on decision making. One key analysis was to examine whether more gaze shifts from D to HV were related to greater accuracies (GLM9), in which the effect size in Cohen’s d was 0.607.

However, associations between visual features and decision variables were counterbalanced across subjects. Participants were presented with 150 trials of two-option trials (in which no distractor was presented) and 150 distractor trials (300 trials in total) randomly interleaved. All the option value configurations in the two-option trials were matched with the <italic>available</italic> options in the distractor trials.</p><p>Each trial began with a central fixation cross indicating an inter-trial interval (3–6 s) followed by an <italic>initial phase</italic> in which two (two-option trials) or three (distractor trials) stimuli were presented in randomly selected screen quadrants. The initial phase was brief – only 0.1 s. Then, in the <italic>decision phase</italic>, orange boxes were presented around two stimuli indicating those options were available for choice. In distractor trials, a purple box was also presented around the third stimulus to indicate a distractor. Subjects were instructed to select one of the available options within 1.5 s. Subjects were warned they were ‘too slow’ if no response was made within 1.5 s and a new trial began. After an option was chosen, the box surrounding it turned red in the <italic>interval phase</italic> (1–3 s). Then the edge of each stimulus turned either yellow or grey in the <italic>outcome phase</italic> to indicate, respectively, whether the choice had been rewarded or not (1–3 s). The final reward allocated to the subject on leaving the experiment was calculated by averaging the outcome of all trials. Subjects learned the task and visual feature associations and experienced Distractor trials in a practice session before scanning. At the end of practice, all subjects chose HV on &gt;70% of two-option trials when it was associated with both higher reward magnitude and probability.</p><p>We provided incentives for subjects to attend to the visual features of every stimulus by interleaving ‘catch’ trials between decision phase and interval phase in 15% of all the trials. In this way we ensured that it was unlikely that subjects would ignore the distractor values. In a ‘catch’ trial, the word ‘MATCH’ was presented once subjects selected an option in the decision phase (1 s). Then, an exemplar stimulus was presented at the center of the screen and subjects had to indicate, within 2 s, the position of the same stimulus presented before and during the decision phase. Feedback was then given to indicate whether the response was correct or not (1.5 s). The trial then continued with the resumption of the interval phase, followed by the outcome phase. Each correct response in the ‘catch’ trial added an extra 10 pence to the final reward.</p><p>A very similar procedure was used in <italic>Experiment three</italic> with the exception that the reward magnitudes were presented in Hong Kong dollar ($25, $50, $75, $100, $125, $150).

Eye movement data were recorded from both eyes. The dominant eye of each subject was determined using the Miles test and only data from the dominant eye was analysed. Validity of each sample was determined by the Tobii Pro SDK software package. Eye movement data of a subject were excluded when the average validity across all samples was below 85% and so eye movement data from four of the initial 25 subjects tested were not analysed further (although the behavioural data from all 25 subjects were still analysed together with the behavioural data from 10 participants used to pilot the behavioural paradigm). Only data recorded during the decision phase were analysed. Trials where average validity within a trial was below 85% was excluded from analysis. On each trial, an area-of-interest (AOIs) of 300 × 300 pixel were drawn surrounding each option stimulus. The size of an AOI was slightly larger than the size of a stimulus (256 × 256 pixel) to account for any minor calibration error.

In Stimulations 1 and 2, simulated choices were generated by incorporating the effect of HV-LV only. Then GLM1a was applied to analyse the accuracy data of the simulated choices to test whether the D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) effects could be found when these effects were supposed to be absent in the simulated choice. The simulations involved the same number of hypothetical participants as in <italic>Experiments 1–6</italic> (i.e. n = 208) and the simulation of each hypothetical participant was iterated for 1000 times. In Simulation 1, the effect of HV-LV that was used to generate the simulated choice in each hypothetical participant was estimated from the choices of one actual participant using GLM1a, where D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) were also present in the model. In Simulation 2, the effect of HV-LV was estimated from another GLM where only the HV-LV term was present.</p><p>Simulation three was run as a positive control analysis to confirm that the distractor effects should be present in the data when they are introduced during the generation of the simulated choices. Similar procedures to those used in Simulations 1 and 2 were employed to generate the simulated choices, however, now all the effects of the terms present in GLM1a, i.e. HV-LV, D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV), were incorporated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Data availability</title><p>The codes for running the mutual inhibition model, divisive normalisation model, dual route model and null model can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6djh9w3c">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6djh9w3c. </ext-link>Behavioural data of Experiments 1, 3 and 7 can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi">https://datadryad.org/stash/dataset/doi</ext-link>:10.5061/dryad.040h9t7. Behavioural data of Experiments 2, 4–6 can be found from a link provided by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref> at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/8r4fh/">https://osf.io/8r4fh/. </ext-link>Behavioural and eye tracking data of Experiment eight can be found at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6djh9w3c">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.k6djh9w3c.</ext-link></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Hong Kong Research Grants Council (25610316), Wellcome Trust (WT100973AIA; 203139/Z/16/Z) and Medical Research Council (MR/P024955/1).</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Experiments 3, 7 and 8 were approved by ethics committee of The Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Experiment 1 was approved by that of University of Oxford.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Regression coefficients estimated using the analysis procedures suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gluth et al., 2018</xref>.

that the difficulty-dependent distractor effect was not due to any statistical artefact</title><p>To test whether the (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect, for example in GLM1a, could emerge as a statistical artefact if it were absent in a hypothetical situation, we simulated three sets of choice data based on these GLMs. We ran Simulations 1 and 2 where simulated choices were generated using a GLM including only the empirically measured HV-LV effect size as a coefficient estimate. The simulations employed the same set of trials as those performed by the participants. Simulations 1 and 2 differ in whether the effect size of HV-LV is estimated by GLM1a or by a similar GLM in which HV-LV is the only regressor. In both cases, the simulated choices should only contain the HV-LV effect and any distractor effect observed in these simulated choices should be considered a statistical artefact. When we applied GLM1a to analyse the simulated choices, we found a significant HV-LV effect (Simulation 1: <italic>β</italic> = 0.534, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 20.970, p&lt;10<sup>−52</sup>; Simulation 2: <italic>β</italic> = 0.577, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 22.337, p&lt;10<sup>−56</sup>).

In order to do this, we ran Simulation 3 that incorporated effects of all terms in GLM1a with effect sizes corresponding to those that had been empirically observed, that is HV-LV, D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV), while the simulated choices were generated. When re-fitting the choices produced by this simulation, as expected, we found a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.545, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 18.432, p&lt;10<sup>−44</sup>), positive D-HV effect (<italic>β</italic> = 0.149, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 5.564, p&lt;10<sup>−7</sup>) and negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect (<italic>β</italic> = −0.108, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = −4.129, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>). Thus, these simulations confirm that the difficulty-dependent distractor effect was not due to any statistical artefact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Palminteri et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we conducted additional simulations to test whether Type I error is inflated in GLM1a. We repeated Simulation 1 (which assumes only an HV-LV, but no D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV), effect in the accuracy data) for 1000 iterations and estimated the p value of each regressor in each iteration. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref> shows the cumulative distribution of p values of each regressor for all 1000 iterations. Since the statistical threshold is set at p=0.05, to determine the likelihood of Type I errors of D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) it is critical to examine the proportion of simulations that show p&lt;0.05 (at the dotted line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>). The result show that the Type I error of D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) are 5.6% and 5.1% respectively. Similarly, the Type II error of the HV-LV term can be determined by examining the proportion of iterations with p&gt;0.05 (i.e. 1-cumulative probability at Simulated p=0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1a</xref>). The results show that Type II error of the HV-LV term is 0%.

In 1000 iterations, the chance of obtaining a significant effect (p&lt;0.05; at the dashed line) from the HV-LV term is 100% (i.e. 0% Type II error; orange). For the D-HV and (HV-LV)(D–HV) terms, for which no effect is assumed, the chances of obtaining Type I errors are 5.6% and 5.1% respectively (yellow and purple respectively).

As before, these two simulations only differ in how the effect of HV-LV is introduced into the simulated accuracy data. In Simulation 1 it was estimated by applying GLM1a to participants’ empirical data. In Simulation 2 it was estimated by applying a GLM with only the HV-LV term to participants’ empirical data. The results show that Type I errors of D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) are 4.1% and 5.4% respectively and the Type II error of HV-LV is 0% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1b</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>, GLM1a).</p><p>Finally, the additional simulations for Simulation 3 assume that effects of HV-LV, D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) all exist in the accuracy data.

In other words, Type II errors of these terms are 0%, 0.2% and 2.9% respectively.</p><p>Similar simulation procedures are performed with GLMs 1b and 5 and 6 and there is no clear indication that the distractor effects (i.e. the effects of the D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) terms) are driven by statistical artefact.

In two sets of experiments, fMRI2014 and Gluth1-4, an equal number of precisely matched trials were collected in which HV and LV options with exactly the same probabilities and magnitudes (and thus values) were employed but no distractor was presented. Thus the same participants chose between the same HV and LV options and a ‘notional distractor’ of the same value – D – was assigned to the trial but not actually presented. Unlike in the previous analysis, if there is no collinearity between the interaction term and the main effect of difficulty (HV-LV), then there should now be a stronger (Difficulty)(D-HV) interaction effect on distractor trials than the matched ‘two-choice’ trials. This is what <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chau et al., 2014</xref> examined in their analysis SI.3 and thus we applied a very similar analysis (GLM4) to test the data from fMRI2014 and Gluth1-4. When difficulty was defined as HV-LV in fMRI2014, the distractor-difficulty interaction effect (Difficulty)(D-HV) was stronger on distractor trials than two-choice trials (<italic>t</italic><sub>109</sub> = 2.381, p=0.0279). Similarly, when difficulty was defined as the weighted sum of probability and magnitude differences in Gluth1-4 the (Difficulty)(D-HV) effect was also stronger on distractor trials than two-choice trials (<italic>t</italic><sub>109</sub> = 2.314, p=0.023). Note that there were no ‘two-choice’ trials in <italic>Experiment 3 Hong Kong</italic> and so it is not possible to run this analysis with those data.</p></sec></boxed-text></app><app id="appendix-3"><title>Appendix 3</title><boxed-text><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>A more complete analysis of distractor effects</title><p>In order to examine distractor effects as a function of both difficulty (HV-LV) and the integrated value of the options (HV+LV+D), we plotted the effect of the distractor on accuracy (rather than accuracy itself as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) as a function of both HV-LV and HV+LV in the dual route model and <italic>Experiments 1</italic> to<italic>3</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>). Again, in both model’s simulated choices and participants’ actual choice a positive distractor effect (yellow area) is most prominent on the hard trials at the bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1a-d</xref> while the negative distractor effect (blue area) is most prominent on the easy trials at the top of these figures. As predicted by divisive normalization models the negative distractor effect is most prominent at the left of these figures when the total sum of HV and LV is small.</p><p>Hence, rather than just looking at the (HV-LV)D interaction, a more complete three-way GLM (GLM5, Materials and methods) can be performed which also includes the (HV+LV)D term. For completeness we include the other possible interactions terms such as (HV-LV)(HV+LV) and (HV-LV)(HV+LV)D as well. Now the opposite effects exerted by the distractor as a function of difficulty (HV-LV) manifest as a negative (HV-LV)D interaction term; the distractor has a positive effect on decision accuracy when decisions are difficult but a negative effect when decisions are easy just as was seen in previous analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The divisive normalization model also predicts that the negative impact of D is reduced when HV+LV becomes larger and hence the positive distractor effect predicted by a cortical attractor or diffusion model should become predominant. This manifests as a positive (HV+LV)D interaction term. These interaction effects are clearly present in the data of all six experiments that we have surveyed above; there is a negative effect of the (HV-LV)D interaction term (<italic>β</italic> = −0.116, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = −4.262, p&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2a</xref>) and a positive effect of the (HV+LV)D interaction term (<italic>β</italic> = 0.414, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub> = 13.066, p&lt;10<sup>−28</sup>). All experiments showed the same trend in these key interaction terms. A one-way ANOVA showed that they were comparable in size across experiments [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig2">Appendix 3—figure 2b</xref>; (HV-LV)D: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,202</sub>=1.524, p=0.184; (HV+LV)D: <italic>F</italic><sub>5,202</sub>=0.625, p=0.681]. Finally, a follow-up analysis was run to confirm how the D effect varied as a function of HV-LV or HV+LV. These questions related to the (HV-LV)D and (HV+LV)D interaction effects respectively.

Next we examined how the (HV+LV)D effect or (HV-LV)D effect varied as a function of the third variable (HV-LV). One way to examine this is to look at simple effects in sub-sections of the data but because we are now considering a three way interaction, the necessary subsection may be only a quarter in size of the original data, which could produce unreliable results. Hence, we took an alternative approach by using the beta weights estimated in GLM5 and investigating the three-way interaction effect.

The authors present a &quot;dual-route&quot; model that explains the co-existence of these effects and they relate the facilitation and impairment effects to distractor salience and value respectively.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this research is important, informative and of interest for a broad readership. Reviewers also identified a number of issues which need to be addressed before the paper can be accepted for publication. Most importantly, it would be critical to determine why exactly the authors come to such vastly different conclusions than Gluth et al., when analyzing the same data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper is extremely long and detailed. The reviewers agreed that it would be good to edit it by delegating non-essential material to the supplement. For example, the sections &quot;distractor effect are not driven by artefacts&quot; and &quot;A more complete analysis of distractor effects&quot; could simply be referenced from the main text but detailed in Supplementary Information. Additionally, the manuscript contains substantial redundancy which could be streamlined.</p><p>2) The current paper directly contrasts with the results of Gluth, 2018, whose datasets comprise a portion of the results presented. Critically, both Gluth and the current authors examine identical datasets (Chau, 2014 and Gluth, 2018 Experiment 4) but come to different conclusions about the existence of distracter effects. While the authors in places do offer suggestions about why the conclusions are different, they provide no definite answers. It would be important to do more to address this directly. A simple explanation might be that two opposing effects exist in the data, that these on average can cancel out (given specific HV-LV conditions) – therefore the focus on the interaction term between (HV-LV)(D-HV). However, in the same dataset (Gluth, 2018 Experiment 4), Gluth sees no positive distractor effect (in fact he finds the opposite) and no interaction effect; the authors see both. Barring error, this means the authors are running different analyses and the critical question is what exactly is different?</p><p>2.1) Gluth et al., make a very specific technical point about the importance of centering or standardizing HV-LV and D-HV before computing the interaction term; without doing so, the interaction term can be highly correlated with one or both of the main predictor variables. Are predictors centered here prior to calculating interaction terms? Subsection “Distractor effects are not driven by statistical artefact” suggests so, but it is unclear what &quot;normalization&quot; means. Despite the statement in subsection “Distractor effects are not driven by statistical artefact”, there is no mention in the Materials and methods section of (1) whether there is centering before interaction terms are calculated, or (2) if so, in which GLMs. The authors should be explicit here.</p><p>2.2) The original analyses in Chau, 2014 and Gluth, 2018 included LV+HV as a covariate in the main analyses, which is not the case here for GLM1 which documents the main finding. Was this excluded for a specific reason, and what are the results if it is included? HV+LV *is* included in the stepwise regression in GLM2, but that is not a straightforward comparison.</p><p>2.3) The authors suggest (subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”) that including two-choice trials (with a nominal D value of zero) may have biased previous results. This sounds plausible but is speculative. It would help if the authors re-ran their analyses with these trials included. A different result would not only back up their assertion but would provide a more definite explanation for the reported differences in findings.</p><p>3) Given the reliance on regression measures throughout the paper, reviewers were concerned about whether there are potential multicollinearity issues, particularly because the predictor variables HV-LV and D-HV may be related (due to task design), and due to interaction terms. Illustrations in Figure 9 suggest that some of the GLMs feature strong correlations.</p><p>3.1) Please state whether or not the task design orthogonalized HV, LV, and D.</p><p>3.2) Please report multicollinearity measures (e.g. variance inflation factors) for the different regression models. This is a concern for all the models, but in particular GLM5 which has many regressors with related terms.</p><p>4) In analyzing Experiment 7, it would be important to investigate interactions with D or |D| (e.g., D*(HV-LV), |D|*(HV-LV)) as such interactions play a critical role in studying distractor effects in the rest of the paper. Additionally, it would be highly informative to present panels as in Figure 1 for this experiment and separately for the reward/loss conditions. Do the patterns look different for gains and losses? And can the dual route model account for separate effects of value and salience? Relatedly, how do the authors think negative values are handled in the normalization model?</p><p>5) There is now some history between the authors and Gluth et al. This shows in multiple places in the paper. For the sake of de-escalation, the authors are encouraged to tone down their language. Specific examples include (but are not limited to) the subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”.</p><p>6) In many places, statistical interactions are not interpreted using &quot;simple effects&quot;. When an interaction (e.g., X*Y) is significant it is unclear whether the main effects (e.g. of X) is meaningful or whether the simple effects change sign depending on the other variable (e.g., Y). It would be important to conduct follow-up simple effect analyses. Some of the analyses even contain triple interactions. If these are not interpreted it is difficult to understand what the patterns of results mean.</p><p>7) The dual route model is attractive as a simple conceptual mechanism for a combination of effects, but there were some questions about the precise implementation, model comparison, and whether the models can account for RT data:</p><p>7.1) As reported in Chau, 2014, distracter input to the mutual inhibition only occurs for a brief period of time (before it is indicated as unchoosable); is the same format used for the divisive normalization model?</p><p>7.2) How were relevant model parameters (d and σ) determined in the dual model? It appears that for individual mutual inhibition and normalization models, they were chosen to give 85% correct choices. Is the same thing true for all 4 parameters in the dual model?</p><p>7.3) It would be more informative to show model predictions based on parameters that were derived from model fits vis a vis empirical data (and show qualitative aspects that the dual route model fits better than the other models) as these parameters are more relevant.</p><p>7.4) The authors suggest that the ability of the model to generate both effects is due to the relative speed of each model component in different value conditions. While intuitive, it would be helpful if the authors actually showed this to be the case in the simulation data. Since the two processes act entirely in parallel, it would be simple to perform the simulations for the individual component models (using the dual model parameters) and report average RTs (in the [HV-LV, D-HV] space). In other words, rather than showing solely predictions for accuracy, it would be important to show also predictions for RT. Additionally, in models for RT it is essential to include a &quot;residual, non-decision, time&quot;. This doesn't seem to be the case here but should be.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Consistent patterns of distractor effects during decision making&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>All reviewers agreed that the authors have done a very thorough job of addressing the essential revisions and minor comments, and that the revised manuscript is much improved. In particular, the discussion of the significance of interaction effects in Gluth, 2018 is illuminating, as it supports the general conclusion in this manuscript. There are, however, a few remaining issues that the authors should address before publication.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In comment 6, the reviewers previously raised the issue of interpreting triple interactions (e.g., analyses pertaining to GLM5). The authors focus on interpretations of 2-way interactions (HV+LV)D and (HV-LV)D whose signs are of theoretical importance in their framework. The concern is that these interactions are qualified by a significant triple interaction (HV-LV)(HV+LV)D. This means that the sign of each of the 2-way interactions can change as a function of the third variable. Therefore, a simple effect analysis here should examine simple 2 way interactions as a function of the third variable. This analysis is critical for the interpreting the findings.</p><p>2) Some questions remain about the modelling.</p><p>2.1) In comment 7.4. Reviewers previously raised the importance of modeling residual time. In response the authors included RT but arbitrarily fixed it to 300ms rather that allowing it to vary freely. They argue in their response letter that &quot;because non-decision time has no reason to be different across our models, it would not bring more evidence in favor of one or another model during model comparisons.&quot;. It may be impossible to determine this a-priori because in each model residual-RT might trade-off differently with the other parameters. It would be important to re-fit the model with free residual time parameters to see which model is best. It is important to rule out that the results of model-comparison are due to arbitrary assumptions about residual rt.</p><p>2.2) A very similar issues pertains to the parameter f (inhibition) which was also fixed to a constant value rather than being a free parameter. This could potentially affect model comparison results.</p><p>2.3) It is still unclear whether in fitting the dual-channel model, each channel had its own free parameters or whether they were identical for both channels.</p><p>2.4) Why are models comparisons reported only for Experiments 1-3 but not for the other experiments?</p><p>3) In comment 4 the reviewers previously raised questions about the loss trials. The revised version does not fully address these questions.</p><p>3.1) There are still questions pertaining to how to model loss trials. According to the current equations, it seems that drift rates can be negative for the mutual inhibition model, and in the normalization model, the drift will be strongest for the highest loss option. Clearly, if this is correct, the model will require adjustments to account for loss trials and these have to be explained.</p><p>3.2) There are also questions pertaining to whether and how the model can account for differences between gain and loss trials. These are important issues because the results seem quite different for gain and loss trials. It would be important to perform a model comparison for the loss trial to determine the best model for these trials. It is not clear if the dual route model, or one of the simpler models, is best for loss trials. Additionally- looking at Figure 6 and the results of the regression (panel d) it seems that when D is positive (i.e., D = abs(D)) corresponding regression effects for these two terms offset each other but when D is negative (D = -abs(D)) they compound. So this could simply mean that the distractor effects are stronger for losses than for gains. Is this true? This can be seen, by including in the regression, interactions terms with trial identity (what the authors call GainTrial) instead of terms with abs(D). Furthermore, if distractors effects are indeed stronger for losses then these stronger effects could presumably be caused by adjusting model parameters (e.g., inhibition strength or other parameters). It is important to examine this. In sum, the authors should consider fitting models to loss trials to see (1) which model provides the best account for loss trials, (2) what account do the mechanistic models provide loss trials and for differences between gain and loss trials. This will provide a much more informative understanding of the gain-loss issue as compared to the current reliance on the regression model. Currently the authors argue that there are 2 separate effects in play, one for distractor value and one for distractor saliency. But a more informative way to understand the data might be that the context (gain/loss) modulated the distractor value effect, and to query the mechanistic models to identify the locus of this modulations.</p><p>4) Reviewers were still unclear about the meaning of terms in the GLMs. This needs to be clarified so that the models are better understood and evaluated. Just for example consider GLM1:</p><p>logit(accuracy) = β0 + β1(HV-LV) + β2(D-HV) + β3(HV-LV)(D-HV) + ε</p><p>The authors state that &quot;All interaction terms in all GLMs are calculated after the component terms are z-scored&quot;. Does this mean that the terms are z-scored only for the purpose of calculating the interaction, or are they z-scored for the main effects as well? Reviewers think they should be z-scored in all terms not just in interaction terms. Additionally, just to be sure- did the authors z-score HV and LV separately or z-score the difference (HV-LV)? A clearer way to write the model to avoid confusions could be:</p><p>logit(accuracy) = β0 + β1 z_(HV-LV) + β2z_(D-HV) + β3z_(HV-LV)*z_(D-HV) + ε (underscore indicates subscript).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53850.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper is extremely long and detailed.

It is indeed the case that, in brief, our argument is, as the reviewer says “A simple explanation might be that two opposing effects exist in the data, that these on average can cancel out (given specific HV-LV conditions) – therefore the focus on the interaction term between (HV-LV)(D-HV)”.</p><p>The reviewer, however, points out that “in the same dataset (Gluth Experiment 4), Gluth sees no positive distractor effect (in fact he finds the opposite) and no interaction effect; the authors see both”. We understand why the reviewer makes this argument. Indeed we initially believed exactly the same; that Gluth et al., made both these argument. It is only after reading Gluth’s et al., paper many times that we realized that only the first part of this statement is true “Gluth sees no positive distractor effect”. The second part of the statement “Gluth sees … no interaction effect” is not true. Very close reading of the paper reveals that although Gluth et al., state that our results were “neither replicable nor reproducible” in both their abstract and main text, they do not provide any statistics regarding the interaction effect in their main paper.</p><p>We realize that statement maybe surprising to the reviewer. But Gluth et al., only briefly touch on the interaction term at the end of the Results section. At that point in the main text Gluth et al., note an “incorrect implementation of the interaction term (HV-LV)x(HV-D) in the performed regression analysis. After correcting this error, the effect of HV-D disappears”. On first reading this section we were left with exactly the same impression as the reviewer “Gluth sees … no interaction effect”. It is likely that most other readers will have received the same impression. However, if you read this sentence again you will see that what they are arguing is that the main effect of the distractor is not observed after Gluth et al., perform the analysis with the correct interaction term. Gluth et al., actually avoid saying anywhere in the main text of their paper whether the interaction term itself remains significant. It does; the interaction term is robust even when Gluth et al., analyze the data in the way they suggest. The key statistics are not referred to or presented in their main manuscript but instead appear only in Supplementary file 2 (and some are omitted even from Supplementary file 2).</p><p>Careful reading of this table shows that Gluth et al.,, in fact, found a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect on choice accuracy (Gluth et al., 2018) just as we do. In Supplementary file 2 of their paper, they presented the distractor effects on choice accuracy across 5 experiments. We reproduce the table below. Since Gluth’s analysis involved the terms HV-D and (HV-LV)(HV-D), we edited the Table slightly by flipping these terms so that they become D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV) respectively and are therefore consistent with the other analyses in our manuscript and the terminology used in the reviewer’s comments and elsewhere in our reply:</p><p>Critically, in four out of five experiments, Gluth et al., observed negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) effects. These effects were significant in two experiments (Experiment 3 and Experiment 2 LP) and were marginally significant in another two experiments (Experiment 1 and Experiment 4). They also present an additional analysis that combined data from four experiments (All <sub>(exc. 2LP)</sub>), albeit excluding one dataset in which the interaction effect was clear, and again there was a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect. Hence, we are very sympathetic to the fact that it is easy to read Gluth’s paper and come away with the impression “that they see no interaction term”. This is the impression that we had too and that we believe most readers will have. However, careful reading of the supplementary material suggests that, on the contrary, there is indeed a significant interaction effect – a distractor effect on accuracy (i.e. relative choice accuracy as in Gluth et al., 2018) regardless of which approach is taken to the data.</p><p>Careful reading reveals that Gluth et al., explain their suggestion for the specific procedures that should be followed while computing the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction term (see Gluth et al., 2018). A critical point concerns how the absence of distractors in the control trials are treated. Gluth et al., argue that they should be assigned a notional value that is the mean of the distractor values taken from the main experimental trials in which distractors were presented. We followed these procedures strictly and re-analyzed their data. We are able to generate virtually identical results to those in their Supplementary file 2. Importantly, there is an additional set of statistics that was omitted from Gluth’s et al.,’ Supplementary file 2; they omitted to show that when they take the approach they recommend with our original 2014 data (referred to as Experiment 1 fMRI in the current manuscript) using Gluth’s et al.,’ suggested analysis approach then yet again the interaction term is significant.</p><p>To the best of our knowledge, the only statistic from Gluth’s et al.,’ analysis, that is actually reported in their paper is the effect size of the HV-D term in Cohen’s d (approximately 0.35; see their Figure 5—figure supplement 3). In addition, when we calculated the Cohen’s d of the D-HV term we obtained a very similar effect size d=-0.352, suggesting that we had run the analysis in a very similar way to Gluth et al.,.</p><p>In summary, we concur with the reviewer that it is very easy to receive the impression that “Gluth sees no positive distractor effect (in fact he finds the opposite) and no interaction effect”. Moreover, we believe that most other readers will have had this impression too. However, careful scrutiny of the main text of Gluth’s paper reveals no mention of whether or not the interaction term is significant and careful scrutiny of Supplementary file 2 reveals that the interaction term is significant even when Gluth’s et al.,’ suggested analysis approach is used. We have, therefore tried to make this clear in the revised manuscript in a manner consistent with the reviewers’ and editor’s comment 5 as follows:</p><p>It might be asked why the presence of distractor effects in their data was not noted by Gluth et al., 2018. The answer is likely to be complex. A fundamental consideration is that it is important to examine the possibility that both distractor effects exist rather than just the possibility that one or other effect exists. This means that it is necessary to consider not just the main effect of D-HV but also D-HV interaction effects. Gluth et al., however, focus on main effects apart from in their table S2 where careful scrutiny reveals that the (D-HV)(HV-LV) interaction is reliably significant in their data. A further consideration concerns the precise way in which the impact of the distractor D is indexed in the GLM particularly on control trials where no distractor is actually presented. Gluth et al., 2018 recommend that a notional value of D is assigned to control trials which corresponds to the distractor’s average value when it appears on distractor trials. In addition, they emphasize that HV-LV and D-HV should be normalized (i.e. demeaned and divided by the standard deviation) before calculating the (HV-LV)(D-HV) term. If we run an analysis of their data in this way then we obtain similar results to those described by Gluth et al., in their Table S2 (Supplementary file 1 here). Although a D-HV main effect was absent, the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction term was significant when data from all their experiments are considered together. While Gluth et al., omitted any analysis of the data from Experiment 1 fMRI, we have performed this analysis and once again a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect is clear (Supplementary file 1).</p><p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy in the interpretation concerns the other three experiments reported by Gluth et al. We turn to these next. (subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.1) Gluth et al., make a very specific technical point about the importance of centering or standardizing HV-LV and D-HV before computing the interaction term; without doing so, the interaction term can be highly correlated with one or both of the main predictor variables. Are predictors centered here prior to calculating interaction terms? Subsection “Distractor effects are not driven by statistical artefact” suggests so, but it is unclear what &quot;normalization&quot; means. Despite the statement in subsection “Distractor effects are not driven by statistical artefact”, there is no mention in the Materials and methods section of (1) whether there is centering before interaction terms are calculated, or (2) if so, in which GLMs. The authors should be explicit here.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion related to the term “normalization”. It actually means that predictors are <italic>z</italic>-scored before interaction terms are calculated. This involves all the component terms centered by their own mean and then divided by their own standard deviation. We applied the same procedures when calculating all interaction terms in every GLM. We have rephrased the sentence in subsection “Examining distractor effects in further experiments”:</p><p>“First, all of the interaction terms are calculated after their component parts, the difficulty and distractor terms, are z-scored (i.e. centered by the mean and then divided by the standard deviation).” (subsection “Examining distractor effects in further experiments”).</p><p>We have also added in the subsection “Analysis procedures<italic>”</italic> the following line:</p><p>“All interaction terms in all GLMs are calculated after the component terms are <italic>z</italic>-scored.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.2) The original analyses in Chau, 2014 and Gluth, 2018 included LV+HV as a covariate in the main analyses, which is not the case here for GLM1 which documents the main finding. Was this excluded for a specific reason, and what are the results if it is included? HV+LV *is* included in the stepwise regression in GLM2, but that is not a straightforward comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer makes a good point about the degree to which analyses might be compared. It is true that GLM1 is different from a key analysis in Chau et al., 2014 and Gluth et al., 2018 by lacking the HV+LV term. However, GLM1 has the strength of being very simple and straightforward by itself – it involves only the HV-LV and D-HV main effect terms and the interaction between the two. GLM2 is a follow-up analysis of GLM1 to investigate the nature of the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect by testing trials with large and small HV-LVs separately. It involves an HV+LV term, in addition to the HV-LV, and a stepwise procedure in order to partial out completely the effects of HV and LV from the choice accuracy data (note that a combination of HV-LV and HV+LV terms is equivalent to a combination of HV and LV terms). This procedure has a strength of ruling out the possibility that any D-HV effect is driven by the variance of the HV.</p><p>It seems that a GLM (GLM1b) that involves both the (HV-LV)(D-HV) and HV+LV terms can fill the gap between GLMs 1 (now renamed as GLM1a) and 2. In other words, GLM1b includes the regressors HV-LV, HV+LV, D-HV and (HV-LV)(D-HV). We applied this to analyze the data in a similar way as that in Figure 3. Critically the results were highly comparable to those of GLM1a – Experiments 1-3 all showed a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect. We have now added these results to our manuscript:</p><p>“In addition to being present in the data reported by Chau et al., 2014 and Gluth et al., 2018 the same effect emerged in a third previously unreported data set (Experiment 3 Hong Kong; n=40) employing the same schedule but collected at a third site (Hong Kong). The results were highly comparable not only when the choice accuracy data were visualized using the same approach (Figure 3E), but also when the same GLM was applied to analyze the choice accuracy data (Figure 3F). There was a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect (<italic>β</italic>=-0.089, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=-2.242, <italic>p</italic>=0.031). Again there was a positive D-HV effect (<italic>β</italic>=0.207, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=5.980, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-6</sup>) and a positive HV-LV effect (<italic>β</italic>=0.485, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=12.448, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-14</sup>). The pattern of results was consistent regardless of whether an additional HV+LV term was included in the GLM, as in Chau et al., 2014; a significant (HV-LV)(D-HV) effect was found in Experiments 1-3 when an additional HV+LV term was included in the GLM (GLM1b; Figure 3—figure supplement 1).” (Results section)</p><p>Behavior was analyzed using a series of GLMs containing the following regressors:</p><p>GLM1a: logit(accuracy) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>(HV-LV) + β<sub>2</sub>(D-HV) + β<sub>3</sub>(HV-LV)(D-HV) + ε</p><p>GLM1b: logit(accuracy) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>(HV-LV) + β<sub>2</sub>(HV+LV) + β<sub>3</sub>(D-HV) + β<sub>4</sub>(HV-LV)(D-HV) + ε” (Materials and methods section)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) The authors suggest (subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”) that including two-choice trials (with a nominal D value of zero) may have biased previous results. This sounds plausible but is speculative. It would help if the authors re-ran their analyses with these trials included. A different result would not only back up their assertion but would provide a more definite explanation for the reported differences in findings.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have noted above, in the first part of the response to point 2, it is easy to be confused as to whether Gluth’s claims of non-significance refer to the main effects of HV-D or the HV-D interaction terms. We have explained that actually the interaction terms are significant but they are only reported in Gluth’s Supplementary Table S2. We have tried to avoid compounding confusion by not reporting any analysis of two-choice trials with a nominal D value of zero because neither Gluth et al., nor we advocate this approach. Instead, when comparing the results of our analyses, with those adopted by Gluth we have used the one analysis approach that is explained and advocated by Gluth et al., (see Gluth , 2018). A critical point does indeed concern how the absence of distractors in the control trials is treated. Gluth et al., argued that, in addition to a binary term that describes the presence/absence of a distractor, non-distractor trials should be assigned a notional distractor value that is the mean of the distractor values taken from the main experimental trials in which distractors were presented. We followed these procedures strictly and re-analyzed their data. We make clear in the revised manuscript that when we use this approach, we obtain virtually identical results and the interaction term is significant. Moreover we obtain the same results when we applied it to the original data from our 2014 paper (here referred to as Experimental 1 fMRI). These findings are now reported in subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites” and Supplementary file 1 of our manuscript. As noted the revised text now reads as follows:</p><p>It might be asked why the presence of distractor effects in their data was not noted by Gluth et al., 2018. The answer is likely to be complex.

Illustrations in Figure 9 suggest that some of the GLMs feature strong correlations.</p></disp-quote><p>In Comment 3.2 it is suggested that the variance inflation factor (VIF) can be calculated to indicate multicollinearity of individual regressors. This is a helpful suggestion and so we have calculated the VIFs in all general linear models (GLMs). Since there is a concern about the multicollinearity issue of the HV-LV and D-HV terms, we checked carefully the VIFs of these terms, as well as the related terms D, (HV-LV)(D-HV), (HV-LV)D, HV+LV and (HV+LV)D. These results are now reported in Figure 9—figure supplement 1. All regressors show VIFs that are less than 10, which is sometimes used as a threshold for indicating high multicollinearity. In addition, the VIFs of all critical terms that are related to the distractor are less than 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.1) Please state whether or not the task design orthogonalized HV, LV, and D.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two subtly, but importantly, different ways in which the question whether “the task design orthogonalized HV, LV, and D” might be interpreted. First, it might be interpreted as asking whether the variance in HV, in LV, and in D was unrelated. This interpretation of the question is consistent with comment 3.2 which asks for multicollinearity measures such as variance inflation factors. As described below, in answer to comment 3.2, the variance in HV, LV, and D was not collinear and this is made clear in Figure 1—figure supplement 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in the revised manuscript. An alternative interpretation, however, is that the question is asking whether one regressor was made to be orthogonal to another by partialling out the shared variance from one of the two regressors. We have made clear whenever we partial out the variance related one regressor by explicitly using the phrase “partial out” to avoid any confusion (for example, subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites” and Subsection “Analysis procedures) but this was not done by default.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2) Please report multicollinearity measures (e.g. variance inflation factors) for the different regression models. This is a concern for all the models, but in particular GLM5 which has many regressors with related terms.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for suggesting the calculation of variance inflation factor (VIF), which is a convenient indicator of multicollinearity of individual regressors. All general linear models (GLMs) include regressors with VIF less than 10. In GLM5, about which the reviewer is particularly concerned, the VIFs are all less than 3.106. We have now included the VIFs of all GLMs in Figure 9—figure supplement 1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In analyzing Experiment 7, it would be important to investigate interactions with D or |D| (e.g., D*(HV-LV), |D|*(HV-LV)) as such interactions play a critical role in studying distractor effects in the rest of the paper. Additionally, it would be highly informative to present panels as in Figure 1 for this experiment and separately for the reward/loss conditions. Do the patterns look different for gains and losses? And can the dual route model account for separate effects of value and salience? Relatedly, how do the authors think negative values are handled in the normalization model?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has made a very useful suggestion to better relate the effects in Experiment 7 to the earlier sections of the manuscript and to examine closely the interaction effects. To achieve that, we now present the results in Figure 6 in a similar fashion to those in Figure 1J and L, Figure 3E-F and Figure 4. In panels A and B, we first illustrate hypothetically how value-based and salience-based effects should manifest in the accuracy data. Then on the right side of panel C, it shows Figure 3E (which is in the same format as Figure 1B,F,Jj) once again to illustrate the changes in accuracy as a function of D-HV and HV-LV on gain trials. A similar plot that shows the data from loss trials is presented adjacent to it. In panel d, as in Figure 1D,H,L and Figure 3F, it shows the results of GLM6a. As suggested by the reviewer, GLM6a now includes the interaction terms (HV-LV)D and (HV-LV)|D|, in addition to the GainTrial, HV-LV, D and |D| terms. In panel e, as in Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1, it shows the results of an analysis that tested the effects of value D and salience |D| on hard and easy trials separately. Critically, these further analyses revealed that the positive distractor effect was both value-based and salience-based, as opposed to our previous notion that it was only salience-based. We have now updated the subsection “Experiment 7: Loss experiment” substantially to describe the results of the additional analysis and how the results are related to the dual route model. The revised figure (Figure 6) and its accompanying legend are shown first below then we show the revised text that describes this part of the results.</p><p>The attentional capture model raises the question of whether any distractor effect on choice accuracy is due to the value or the salience of the distractor. This is difficult to test in most reward-based decision making experiments because the value and salience of an option are often collinear – more rewarding options are both larger in value and more salient – and it is not possible to determine which factor drives behavior. One way of breaking the collinearity between value and salience is to introduce options that lead to loss (Kahnt et al., 2014). As such, the smallest value options that lead to great loss are very salient (Figure 6A, bottom), the medium value options that lead to small gains or losses are not salient and the largest value options that lead to great gain are again very salient. Having a combination of gain and loss scenarios in an experiment enables the investigation of whether the positive and negative distractor effects, related to mutual inhibition and divisive normalization respectively, are driven by the distractor’s value, salience or both. Figures 6A and B show 4 hypothetical cases of how the distractor may influence accuracy. Hypothesis 1 suggests that larger distractor <italic>values</italic> (Figure 6A, first row, left-to-right), which correspond to fewer losses or more gains, are related to greater accuracies (brighter colors). This is also predicted by the mutual inhibition component of the dual route model (Figure 1) and can be described as a positive D effect (Figure 6B). Hypothesis 2 larger distractor saliences (Figure 6A, second row, center-to-sides) are related to greater accuracies (brighter colors). This can be described as a positive |D| effect (Figure 6B). Under this hypothesis the mutual inhibition decision making component receives salience, rather than value, as an input. Hypotheses 3 and 4 are the opposites of Hypotheses 1 and 2, and predict negative distractor effects as a result of the divisive normalization component depending on whether the input involves value or salience. Hypothesis 3 predicts a value-based effect in which larger distractor values (Figure 6A third row, left-to-right) are related to poorer accuracies (darker colors). Hypothesis 4 predicts a salience-based effect in which larger distractor saliences (Figure 6A, fourth row, center-to-sides) are related to poorer accuracies (darker colors). It is important to note that these four hypotheses are not necessarily mutually exclusive. The earlier sections have demonstrated that positive and negative distractor effects can co-exist and predominate in different parts of decision space. Value-based and salience-based distractor effects can also be teased apart with a combination of gain and loss scenarios.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we adopted this approach in an additional experiment performed at the same time as Experiment 3 Hong Kong, in which half of the trials included options that were all positive in value (gain trials) and the other half of the trials included options that were all negative in value (loss trials; the loss trials were not analyzed in the previous sections). We therefore refer to these additional trials as belonging to Experiment 7 Loss Experiment (n=40 as in Experiment 3 Hong Kong). The effect of signed D reflects the value of the distractor while the effect of the unsigned, absolute size of D (i.e. |D|) reflects the salience of the distractor. The correlation between these two parameters was low (<italic>r=</italic>0.005), such that it was possible to isolate the impact that they each had on behavior.</p><p>As in other experiments, we first plotted the accuracy as a function of difficulty (HV-LV) and relative distractor value (D-HV). For ease of comparison, Figure 3E that illustrates the accuracy data for the gain trials in Experiments 3 is shown again in the right panel of Figure 6C. As described before, when the decisions were hard (bottom rows) larger distractor values were associated with greater accuracies (left-to-right: the colors change from dark to bright; also see Figure 4B) and when the decisions were easy larger distractor values were associated with poorer accuracies (left-to-right: the colors change from bright to dark; also see Figure 4B). In a similar manner, the left panel of Figure 6C shows the accuracy data of the loss trials in Experiment 7. Strikingly, on both hard and easy trials (top and bottom rows), larger distractor values were associated with poorer accuracies (left-to-right: the colours changes from bright to dark).</p><p>To isolate the value-based and salience-based effects of D, we performed GLM6a (Methods) to analyze both the gain and loss trials in Experiments 3 and 7 at the same time. GLM6 includes the signed and unsigned value of D (i.e. D and |D| respectively). We also included a binary term, GainTrial, to describe whether the trial presented gain options or loss options and, as in GLM1a, we included the HV-LV term and its interaction with D but now also with |D| [i.e. (HV-LV)D and (HV-LV)|D| respectively]. The results showed a negative effect of value D (<italic>β</italic>=-0.236, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=-2.382, <italic>p</italic>=0.022; Figure 6d) and a negative effect of (HV-LV)D interaction (<italic>β</italic>=-0.205, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=-2.512, <italic>p</italic>=0.016). In addition, there was a positive effect of salience |D| (<italic>β</italic>=0.152, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=3.253, <italic>p</italic>=0.002) and a positive effect of (HV-LV)|D| (<italic>β</italic>=0.219, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=3.448, <italic>p</italic>=0.001). Next, we examined closely the value-based and salience-based effect in different parts of decision space.</p><p>As in the analysis for Experiments 1-6 in Figure 6E, we split the data (which included both gain and loss trials) according to the median HV-LV, such that the distractor effects can be examined on hard and easy trials separately. We applied GLM6b that first partialled out the effects of HV-LV, HV+LV and GainTrial from the accuracy data and then tested the overall effect of value D across the gain and loss trials. Similar to Experiments 1-6, a positive value D effect was identified on hard trials (<italic>β</italic>=0.008, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=2.463, <italic>p</italic>=0.017; Figure 6e, left) and a negative value D effect was identified on easy trials (<italic>β</italic>=-0.011, <italic>t</italic><sub>38</sub>=-3.807, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-3</sup>; note that one participant was excluded due to the lack of variance in the accuracy data). Then we applied GLM6c which was similar to GLM6b but the value D term was replaced by the salience |D| term. The results showed that there were positive salience |D| effects on both hard (<italic>β</italic>=0.011, <italic>t</italic><sub>39</sub>=2.119, <italic>p</italic>=0.041; Figure 6E, right) and easy trials (<italic>β</italic>=0.009, <italic>t</italic><sub>38</sub>=2.338, <italic>p</italic>=0.025).</p><p>Taken together, in Experiments 1-6 a positive distractor effect predicted by the mutual inhibition model and a negative distractor effect predicted by the divisive normalization model were found on hard and easy trials respectively. The results of Experiments 3 and 7 suggest that these effects are value-based and that the effects are continuous across the gain and loss value space. In addition, however, there was also a positive distractor effect that was salience-based that appeared on both hard and easy trials, suggesting that the effects driven by the mutual inhibition decision making component can be both value-based and salience-based.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There is now some history between the authors and Gluth et al. This shows in multiple places in the paper. For the sake of de-escalation, the authors are encouraged to tone down their language. Specific examples include (but are not limited to) subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to maintain a neutral tone throughout the manuscript. We have attempted to do this while acting in accord with the request made in comment 2 for clarity about the difference between the two different analysis approaches. We have paid particular attention to the paragraphs highlighted by the reviewer but are happy to change other paragraphs too. For example, the paragraphs highlighted by the reviewer have been changed as follows:</p><p>Figure 3A and C show the data from the fMRI experiment (Experiment 1 <italic>fMRI2014; n=21</italic>) reported by Chau et al., 2014 and Gluth et al., 2018 experiment 4 (Experiment 2 Gluth4; n=44) respectively. It is important to consider these two experiments first because they employ an identical schedule. Specifically, Chau et al., reported both divisive normalization effects and positive distractor effects, while Gluth et al., claimed they were unable to replicate these effects in their own data and when they analyzed this data set from Chau et al.,. Here we found that both data sets show a positive D-HV distractor effect. In both data sets, when decisions are difficult (HV-LV is small) then high value D-HV is associated with higher relative accuracy in choices between HV and LV; for example, the bottom rows of Figure 3A and c turn from black/dark red to yellow moving from left to right, indicating decisions are more accurate. However, when decisions were easy (HV-LV is large) then the effect is much less prominent or even reverses as would be predicted if divisive normalization becomes more important in this part of the decision space. As in the predictions of the dual route model (Figure 1J,K), on easy trials although there was an overall decreasing trend in accuracy as a function of D-HV, there was an increasing trend at very low D-HV levels. Overall, a combination of positive and negative D-HV effects on hard and easy trials respectively suggests that there should be a negative (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect on choice accuracy. (Subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”)</p><p>Another possible reason for the discrepancy in the interpretation concerns the other three experiments reported by Gluth et al. We turn to these next. (Subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”)</p><p>We have tried to make related changes elsewhere. For example the revised manuscript is changed as follows:</p><p>“It is clear thatdata collected under the same conditions in 105 participants at all three sites are very similar and that a positive distractor effect consistently recurs when decisions are difficult. Next, we aggregated the data collected from the three sites and repeated the same GLM to confirm that the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction (<italic>β</italic>=-0.101, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub>=-4.366, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-4</sup>), D-HV (<italic>β</italic>=0.223, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub>=6.400, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-8</sup>) and HV-LV (<italic>β</italic>=0.529, <italic>t</italic><sub>104</sub>=20.775, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-38</sup>) effects were all collectively significant. Additional control analyses suggest that these effects were unlikely due to any statistical artefact (see subsection “Distractor effects are not driven by statistical artefact” for details).” (subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In many places, statistical interactions are not interpreted using &quot;simple effects&quot;. When an interaction (e.g., X*Y) is significant it is unclear whether the main effects (e.g. of X) is meaningful or whether the simple effects change sign depending on the other variable (e.g., Y). It would be important to conduct follow-up simple effect analyses. Some of the analyses even contain triple interactions. If these are not interpreted it is difficult to understand what the patterns of results mean.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has made a very important point about how to clearly illustrate the pattern of interaction effects. We agree that testing the simple effects is critical and indeed we followed this procedure in the initial submission of our manuscript. For example, GLM1a (formerly GLM1; see below for the GLM) mainly tested any presence of (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction and that was followed by GLM2a that split the trials into small HV-LV (i.e. hard trials) and large HV-LV (i.e. easy trials), thereby testing for simple main effects, and tested the effects of D-HV (or D) separately (Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1). In retrospect, however, we realize that we did not categorically state that in conducting this analysis we were examining the simple main effects. In the revised manuscript we make this point clear. In Figure 3, we also plotted how the accuracy varied as a function of D-HV at different levels of HV-LV as an illustration of the interaction effect. Again, in the revised manuscript, we make clear that this figure illustrates the simple main effects. It is also possible that the link between GLM1a and GLM2a was not very clear, since GLM2a has an additional HV+LV term (this is also suggested in comment 2.2). We have now added GLM1b that included also the HV+LV term to fill this gap and this is described in Subsection “Analysis procedures”:</p><p>GLM1a: logit(accuracy) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>(HV-LV) + β<sub>2</sub>(D-HV) + β<sub>3</sub>(HV-LV)(D-HV) + ε</p><p>GLM1b: logit(accuracy) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>(HV-LV) + β<sub>2</sub>(HV+LV) + β<sub>3</sub>(D-HV) + β<sub>4</sub>(HV-LV)(D-HV) + ε</p><p>GLM2a: Step 1, logit(accuracy) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>(HV-LV) + β<sub>2</sub>(HV+LV) + ε<sub>1</sub></p><p>Step 2, ε<sub>1</sub> = β<sub>3</sub> + β<sub>4</sub>(D-HV) + ε<sub>2</sub></p><p>Further, we have made the following revision to improve the link between GLM1a,b and GLM2a (subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”):</p><p>“The next step is to examine whether the (HV-LV)(D-HV) interaction effect from GLM1a and 1b arises because of the presence of a divisive normalization effect (i.e. negative D-HV effect) on easy trials, a positive distractor effect on hard trials, or both effects. In other words, we need to establish which component of the interaction (or in other words, which main effect) is driving the interaction. To establish which is the case, the data were median split as a function of difficulty, defined as HV-LV, so that it is possible to easily visualize the separate predictions of the divisive normalization and positive distractor accounts (Figure 4A; a similar approach was also used by Chau et al., in their supplementary Figure SI.4). Then, to analyze each half of the choice accuracy data we applied GLM2a in a stepwise manner.”</p><p>The legend for Figure 4 now reads as follows:</p><p>Figure 4. Distractors had opposite effects on decision accuracy as a function of difficulty in all experiments. The main effect of the distractor was different depending on decision difficulty. (a) In accordance with the predictions of the dual route model, high value distractors (D-HV is high) facilitated decision making when the decision was hard (blue bars), whereas there was a tendency for high value distractors to impair decision making when the decision was easy (red bars). Data are shown for (b) Experiment 1 fMRI2014, Experiment 2 Gluth4, Experiment 3 Hong Kong. (c) The same is true when data from the other experiments, Experiments 4-6 (i.e. Gluth1-3), are examined in a similar way. However, participants made decisions in these experiments in a different manner: they were less likely to integrate probability and magnitude features of the options in the optimal manner when making decisions and instead were more likely to choose on the basis of a weighted sum of the probability and magnitude components of the options. Thus, in Experiments 4-6 (i.e. Gluth1-3), the difficulty of a trial can be better described by the weighted sum of the magnitude and probability components associated with each option rather than the true objective value difference HV-LV. This may be because these experiments included additional “decoy” trials that were particularly difficult and on which it was especially important to consider the individual attributes of the options rather than just their integrated expected value. Whatever the reason for the difference in behavior, once an appropriate difficulty metric is constructed for these participants, the pattern of results is the same as in panel a. # <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.1, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, *** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001.

GLM5 involves:</p><p>GLM5: logit(accuracy) = β<sub>0</sub> + β<sub>1</sub>(HV-LV) + β<sub>2</sub>(HV+LV) + β<sub>3</sub>D + β<sub>4</sub>(HV-LV)D + β<sub>5</sub>(HV+LV)D + β<sub>6</sub>(HV-LV)(HV+LV) + β<sub>7</sub>(HV-LV)(HV+LV)D + ε</p><p>(Subsection “Analysis procedures”)</p><p>The critical interaction terms were (HV-LV)D and (HV+LV)D. The terms (HV-LV)(HV+LV) and (HV-LV)(HV+LV)D were regressors of no interest, but were added for the sake of completing a full three-way interaction model. To better describe the pattern of the interaction effects, we have now added the following simple effect analysis in Appendix 3:</p><p>“Finally, a follow-up analysis was run to confirm how the D effect varied as a function of HV-LV or HV+LV. These questions related to the (HV-LV)D and (HV+LV)D interaction effects respectively. We applied a mean split by HV-LV and then estimated the effect of D using GLM2b. On hard trials (small HV-LV), larger D values were related to <italic>greater</italic> choice accuracies (<italic>β</italic>=0.056, <italic>t</italic><sub>207</sub>=4.113, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>-4</sup>); whereas on easy trials (large HV-LV), larger D values were related to <italic>poorer</italic> choice accuracies (<italic>β</italic>=-0.007, <italic>t</italic><sub>206</sub>=-2.049, <italic>p</italic>=0.042; note that one participant was excluded from this analysis because of the lack of behavioral variance – there was only one inaccurate choice).

These results are consistent with our predictions that the mutual inhibition model, associated with a positive D effect, was better at predicting behavior on hard trials and when the HV+LV sum was large. The divisive normalization model, associated with a negative D effect, was better at predicting behavior on easy trials and when the HV+LV sum was small.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The dual route model is attractive as a simple conceptual mechanism for a combination of effects, but there were some questions about the precise implementation, model comparison, and whether the models can account for RT data:</p></disp-quote><p>Please refer to our point-by-point replies below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.1) As reported in Chau, 2014, distracter input to the mutual inhibition only occurs for a brief period of time (before it is indicated as unchoosable); is the same format used for the divisive normalization model?</p></disp-quote><p>We aimed to keep the mutual inhibition model as simple as possible, while only keeping some critical features (e.g. a pooled inhibition) of the biophysical model reported in Chau, 2014. As such, the mutual inhibition model involves distractor input for an equal amount of time to that of the HV and LV options. We have revised subsection “Summary of approach” to clarify this:</p><p>“The <italic>mutual inhibition model</italic> is a simplified form of a biophysically plausible model that is reported elsewhere (Chau et al., 2014).

One clear way of showing how well each model fits with the empirical data is to plot how much the models’ predictions deviate from the empirical data across the decision space of HV-LV and D-HV. We have now shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A,C the empirical data in a format identical to Figure 3A,C,E. We then show in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B,D the degree in which the predictions of each model deviate from the empirical data. The results show that the dual route model is better than the mutual inhibition, divisive normalization, and null models in predicting participants’ accuracy and reaction time. These results are now reported in the Results section and Figure 3—figure supplement 2.</p><p>“Interestingly, the dual route model provided the best account of the participants’ behaviour when Experiments 1-3 were considered as a whole (estimated frequency Ef=0.898; exceedance probability Xp=1.000, Figure 3G-H) and when individual experiments were considered separately (Experiment 1: Ef=0.843, Xp=1.000; Experiment 2: Ef=0.924, Xp=1.000; Experiment 3: Ef=0.864, Xp=1.000). Furthermore, the fitted parameters were applied back to each model to predict participants’ behavior (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). The results show that the dual route model is better than the mutual inhibition, divisive normalization, and null models in predicting both choice accuracy and reaction time.” (Subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.4) The authors suggest that the ability of the model to generate both effects is due to the relative speed of each model component in different value conditions. While intuitive, it would be helpful if the authors actually showed this to be the case in the simulation data. Since the two processes act entirely in parallel, it would be simple to perform the simulations for the individual component models (using the dual model parameters) and report average RTs (in the [HV-LV, D-HV] space). In other words, rather than showing solely predictions for accuracy, it would be important to show also predictions for RT. Additionally, in models for RT it is essential to include a &quot;residual, non-decision, time&quot;. This doesn't seem to be the case here but should be.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has provided very helpful suggestions for better understanding the predictions made by the dual route model. We have now plotted the reaction time of the model when the drift rate and noise level are set at zero for one of the two components at a time. These plots are now shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. However, it might not be straightforward to see how the distractor effects of the dual route model are linked to the reaction time of each component because it is necessary to consider not just which model component is likely to produce a response but also how likely it is to be correct. Hence, we suggest that the next analyses, described below, do achieve what we think the reviewer ultimately wants: an intuitive sense of which types of response, both correct and incorrect, that each model causes.</p><p>We analyzed the choices predicted by the dual route model when both components are assigned the non-zero parameters. We examined on each trial whether a choice is made by the mutual inhibition or divisive normalization component. Choices made by the mutual inhibition component show greater accuracy as a function of relative distractor value and choices made by the divisive normalization component show smaller accuracy as a function of relative distractor value (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). These results are broadly similar to those presented in Figure 1A-H in which either the mutual inhibition model or divisive normalization model is run alone. Since the accuracy of the two components are plotted together on the same scale, it is clear, when comparing the slopes, that on hard trials the positive effect of the mutual inhibition component outweighs the negative effect of the divisive normalization component. On easy trials the negative effect of the divisive normalization component outweighs the positive effect of the mutual inhibition component. One key reason for these phenomena is because on easy trials, errors made by the mutual inhibition component are rare and the positive distractor effect on reducing these errors is therefore weaker (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). We have now presented these analyses in our manuscript:</p><p>“In the dual route model positive and negative distractor effects predominate in different parts of the decision space. It is possible to understand the underlying reasons by analyzing the choices made by the mutual inhibition and divisive normalization components separately (Figure 1—figure supplement 1). On hard trials, when the distractor value becomes larger, the errors made by the mutual inhibition component decrease more rapidly in frequency than the increase in errors made by the divisive normalization component, resulting in a net positive distractor effect. In contrast, on easy trials when the distractor value becomes larger the decrease in errors made by the mutual inhibition model is much less than the increase in errors made by the divisive normalization model. Figure 1—figure supplement 2 shows the reaction time of choices made by each component when the other component is switched off.” (Subsection “Divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects should predominate in different parts of the decision space”)</p><p>In addition, we agree with the reviewer that a non-decision time is indeed a very important parameter in the framework of diffusion models. However, because non-decision time has no reason to be different across our models, it would not bring more evidence in favor of one or another model during model comparisons. Nevertheless, we still included a non-decision time [fixed at 300ms Grasman et al., 2009Ratcliff et al., 1999Tuerlinckx, 2004(; ; )] in all the models. This additional procedure is now described in subsection “Computational modelling”.</p><p>“The reaction time is defined as the duration of the evidence accumulation before the decision threshold is reached added by a fixed non-decision time of 300 ms to account for lower-order cognitive processes before choice information reaches the excitatory neurons Grasman et al., 2009Ratcliff et al., 1999Tuerlinckx, 2004(; ; ).”</p><p>The results of the model comparison remain similar – the dual route model best describes participants behaviour.</p><p>“Interestingly, the dual route model provided the best account of the participants’ behaviour when Experiments 1-3 were considered as a whole (estimated frequency Ef=0.898; exceedance probability Xp=1.000, Figure 3G-H) and when individual experiments were considered separately (Experiment 1: Ef=0.843, Xp=1.000; Experiment 2: Ef=0.924, Xp=1.000; Experiment 3: Ef=0.864, Xp=1.000).” (subsection “Both divisive normalization of value and positive distractor effects co-exist in data sets from three sites”).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In comment 6, the reviewers previously raised the issue of interpreting triple interactions (e.g., analyses pertaining to GLM5). The authors focus on interpretations of 2-way interactions (HV+LV)D and (HV-LV)D whose signs are of theoretical importance in their framework. The concern is that these interactions are qualified by a significant triple interaction (HV-LV)(HV+LV)D. This means that the sign of each of the 2-way interactions can change as a function of the third variable. Therefore, a simple effect analysis here should examine simple 2 way interactions as a function of the third variable. This analysis is critical for the interpreting the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now followed these suggestions of testing the three-way (HV-LV)(HV+LV)D by examining how the (HV+LV)D effect or (HV-LV)D effect varied as a function of the third variable. Note, however, that while it is not uncommon to check the interpretation of two-way interactions by examining the simple effects it is less common to see this approach used to examine three way interaction effects. The reason is simple. Examining the simple effects associated with a two way interaction means looking at approximately half of the original data set. Examining the simple effects associated with a three way interaction means looking at approximately a quarter of the original data set which could produce unreliable results. Hence, we took an alternative approach that is recommended in such situations by using the β weights estimated in GLM5 and investigating the three-way interaction effect. In particular, small and large HV-LV (or HV+LV) was defined as the twenty-fifth percentile (<italic>z</italic> score=-0.675) and seventy-fifth percentile (<italic>z</italic> score=0.675) respectively.

Next we examined how the (HV+LV)D effect or (HV-LV)D effect varied as a function of the third variable (HV-LV). One way to examine this is to look at simple effects in sub-sections of the data but because we are now considering a three way interaction, the necessary subsection may be only a quarter in size of the original data, which could produce unreliable results.

Reviewers previously raised the importance of modeling residual time. In response the authors included RT but arbitrarily fixed it to 300ms rather that allowing it to vary freely. They argue in their response letter that &quot;because non-decision time has no reason to be different across our models, it would not bring more evidence in favor of one or another model during model comparisons.&quot;. It may be impossible to determine this a-priori because in each model residual-RT might trade-off differently with the other parameters. It would be important to re-fit the model with free residual time parameters to see which model is best. It is important to rule out that the results of model-comparison are due to arbitrary assumptions about residual rt.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestion. We have now allowed the non-decision time (Tnd) and inhibition level f (in response to comment 2.2) to vary freely. We have also applied these models to fit the data of Experiments 4-6, in addition to those of Experiments 1-3 that were fitted before (in response to comment 2.4). Critically, the results of the model comparison remain largely similar – in all six experiments the dual route model was a better fit compared to the other three alternative models. In addition, we have run another comparison between all models that we performed – the four new models (with free Tnd and free inhibition f level), the four old mdels (with Tnd fixed at 0.3 sec and f fixed at 0.5) and another four models (with Tnd fixed at 0.3 sec and free f level). The results show that the dual route model with fixed Tnd and f provide the best fit. To summarize, among the four models (dual route, mutual inhibition, divisive normalization, and null) the dual route model provides the best account of participants’ behaviour and it is especially the case when the Tnd and f parameters are fixed.</p><p>We have now included these additional models in the Results section:</p><p>Additional models were run to confirm that the dual route model is a better model. The above models involve assigning fixed values for the non-decision time <italic>Tnd</italic> (at 0.3 s) and inhibition level <italic>f</italic>. In one set of analysis the <italic>f</italic> is fitted as a free parameter (Figure 3—figure supplement 3B) and in another set of analysis both <italic>Tnd</italic> and <italic>f</italic> are fitted as free parameters (Figure 3—figure supplement 3C).

Please refer to the responses to comment 2.1 for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3) It is still unclear whether in fitting the dual-channel model, each channel had its own free parameters or whether they were identical for both channels.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment. We agree that it was unclear whether the two components of the dual route model involved separate sets of free parameters or not and in fact they are separated. We have now clarified this in subsection “Model fitting and comparison”:</p><p><italic><bold>“</bold></italic>The d and σ parameters of each model were fitted separately at the individual level to the choices and RTs of each participant in Experiments 1-6, using the VBA-toolbox (http://mbb-team.github.io/VBA-toolbox/). In the dual route model, the mutual inhibition and divisive normalization components involved separate d and σ parameters during the fitting. The other model parameters (i.e. f, Tnd, V<sub>i</sub> and k) were fixed at the values mentioned above, except for some models reported in Figure 3—figure supplement 3.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.4) Why are models comparisons reported only for Experiments 1-3 but not for the other experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have presented model comparisons for Experiments 1-3 because the data from these experiments are relatively straightforward and therefore there is little debate about how they might be modelled. It is difficult to apply these models to the data of Experiments 7-8 because of differences in tasks were designed (see responses to Comments 3.1 and 3.2). It is, however, also possible to apply these models to fit the data of Experiments 4-6 because they involve tasks that are very similar to those in Experiments 1-3. The results showed that among the four models, as in Experiments 1-3, the dual route model provided the best account of participants’ behaviour in Experiments 4-6. These results are now included in the Results section and Figure 4—figure supplement 2:</p><p>“Finally, the four models (dual-route, mutual inhibition, divisive normalization and null) were applied to fit the data of Experiments 4-6. Again, the dual-route model provided the best account of participants’ behaviour when individual experiments were considered separately (Experiment 4: Ef=0.806, Xp=0.999; Experiment 5: Ef=0.649, Xp=1.000; Experiment 6: Ef=0.946, Xp=1.000; Figure 4—figure supplement 2) or when Experiments 1-6 were considered as a whole (Ef=0.846, Xp=1.000). ” (subsection “Examining distractor effects in further experiments”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In comment 4 the reviewers previously raised questions about the loss trials. The revised version does not fully address these questions.</p><p>3.1) There are still questions pertaining to how to model loss trials. According to the current equations, it seems that drift rates can be negative for the mutual inhibition model, and in the normalization model, the drift will be strongest for the highest loss option. Clearly, if this is correct, the model will require adjustments to account for loss trials and these have to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>It is indeed an important to ask about how best to model loss trials in Experiment 7. We agree with the reviewer that one possibility is to have a negative drift rate in the models that are applied to Experiments 1-3. This also implies that the decisions should then be about which option to avoid rather than which option to choose, because options that are more negative in value will reach the decision threshold more quickly. It is unclear whether participants used an avoidance approach in Experiment 7. Hence, we consider that in Experiment 7 (loss experiment) the focus should be on participants’ empirical behavior and the fact that the experiments constitutes a test of whether the distractor affected choices by its value or salience. We think that more detailed modelling is an interesting question but because it requires a new series of arguments about whether it is appropriate to think of avoiding or “ruling out” options we think that it would detract from the discussion of all the other points, which is comprehensive. If, however, we were to add a section relating to whether model loss trials with negative drift rates, which is a whole topic unto itself then we would inevitably deal with this issue in a way that some readers might consider partial. We have, however, added some text to the revised manuscript that notes that it might be possible in the future to extend the model to look at this loss trials but that we have refrained from a detailed modelling of loss trials because of the number of other issues that need to be debated whenever a model of this type is constructed. We have therefore added the following paragraph to the end of subsection “Experiment 7: Loss experiment” reporting the results of Experiment 7:</p><p>In the future it might be possible to extend the models outlined in Figure 1 and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 to provide a more quantitative descriptions of behavior. While this topic is of great interest it will require modelers to agree on how loss trials might be modelled. For example, one possibility is to have a negative drift rate in the models that we have used. This implies that the decisions will then be about which option to avoid rather than which option to choose, because options that are more negative in value will reach the decision threshold more quickly. It is unclear, however, whether participants used such an avoidance approach in Experiment 7. Hence, we have refrained from modelling the results of Experiment 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.2) There are also questions pertaining to whether and how the model can account for differences between gain and loss trials. These are important issues because the results seem quite different for gain and loss trials. It would be important to perform a model comparison for the loss trial to determine the best model for these trials. It is not clear if the dual route model, or one of the simpler models, is best for loss trials. Additionally- looking at Figure 6 and the results of the regression (panel d) it seems that when D is positive (i.e., D = abs(D)) corresponding regression effects for these two terms offset each other but when D is negative (D = -abs(D)) they compound. So this could simply mean that the distractor effects are stronger for losses than for gains. Is this true? This can be seen, by including in the regression, interactions terms with trial identity (what the authors call GainTrial) instead of terms with abs(D). Furthermore, if distractors effects are indeed stronger for losses then these stronger effects could presumably be caused by adjusting model parameters (e.g., inhibition strength or other parameters). It is important to examine this. In sum, the authors should consider fitting models to loss trials to see (1) which model provides the best account for loss trials, (2) what account do the mechanistic models provide loss trials and for differences between gain and loss trials. This will provide a much more informative understanding of the gain-loss issue as compared to the current reliance on the regression model. Currently the authors argue that there are 2 separate effects in play, one for distractor value and one for distractor saliency. But a more informative way to understand the data might be that the context (gain/loss) modulated the distractor value effect, and to query the mechanistic models to identify the locus of this modulations.</p></disp-quote><p>Again we thank the reviewer for this interesting point but once again we feel that detailed modelling of the loss trials is beyond the scope of the current manuscript because of the number of other issues that need to be dealt with in order to consider how loss trials might be modelled with precision. We have dealt with the major points that were raised by the reviewers in the first round of review and we have moved large parts of the manuscript to the supplementary materials to make way for the many new sections that the reviewers have requested but detailed modelling of the loss trials really is beyond the scope of the current manuscript because it would require us to address several other, distinct areas of research. We feel that this is likely to detract from the main message our manuscript is conveying.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Reviewers were still unclear about the meaning of terms in the GLMs. This needs to be clarified so that the models are better understood and evaluated. Just for example consider GLM1:</p><p>logit(accuracy) = β0 + β1(HV-LV) + β2(D-HV) + β3(HV-LV)(D-HV) + ε</p><p>The authors state that &quot;All interaction terms in all GLMs are calculated after the component terms are z-scored&quot;. Does this mean that the terms are z-scored only for the purpose of calculating the interaction, or are they z-scored for the main effects as well? Reviewers think they should be z-scored in all terms not just in interaction terms. Additionally, just to be sure- did the authors z-score HV and LV separately or z-score the difference (HV-LV)? A clearer way to write the model to avoid confusions could be:</p><p>logit(accuracy) = β0 + β1 z_(HV-LV) + β2z_(D-HV) + β3z_(HV-LV)*z_(D-HV) + ε (underscore indicates subscript).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that there is still some potential ambiguity of how the GLMs are described.
