Distributed networks of brain regions exhibit coordinated activity of neural populations both within and between networks, known as functional connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fox et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Raichle et al., 2001</xref>). Analytical approaches to functional connectivity can be broadly split into voxel-based methods (deriving map-based connectivity estimates to study the spatial organisation of networks) and node-based methods (approaches based on network-science that describe connectivity in terms of ‘edges’ between functional brain regions) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bijsterbosch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rubinov and Sporns, 2010</xref>). Here, we focus on node-based methods and ask how complex aspects of spatial organisation may influence estimated node-based functional connectivity.</p><p>There is growing interest in interindividual differences in these node-based functional connectivity patterns and their potential use as markers for health and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>). We previously showed that interindividual variability in estimated functional connectivity between brain regions is, to a large extent, driven by variability in the spatial organisation (i.e., the precise shape and location) of large-scale brain networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>). Specifically, our previous results revealed that node-based functional connectivity as normally estimated from rfMRI data is influenced by a mixture of spatial and temporal factors, with spatial information explaining up to 62% of interindividual variance. This is unexpected and arguably undesirable, because temporal correlation-based functional connectivity estimates are often considered as an accurate representation of temporal coupling strength between neural populations. Therefore, there is a need to better separate interindividual variability in spatial and temporal domains in analytical approaches to rfMRI data, in order to gain a better understanding of interindividual connectivity profiles and derive more interpretable associations with behaviour. To identify connectivity measures with the strongest unique association with behaviour (i.e., potential measures for clinical biomarkers), we need to understand and address the reason for the previously reported conflation of temporal and spatial sources of interindividual variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In our earlier work we tested a number of parcellation methods (i.e., voxel-based methods used to parcellate the brain into a small set of large-scale functional networks that consists of brain regions that exhibit similarities in their BOLD timeseries, or into a larger set of contiguous regions that consist of interconnected voxels). We tested a group-level functionally-defined hard parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), an individualised multimodal hard parcellation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>), and both high and low dimensional soft parcellations estimated with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beckmann and Smith, 2004</xref>). We found that the cross-subject variability in spatial organisation strongly influenced node-based functional connectivity estimates regardless of the parcellation type/method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>). There are a number of possible explanations for this previously observed influence of spatial organisation on functional connectivity estimates, as discussed below.</p><p>Firstly, it is possible that our previous findings were driven by misalignment between the spatial boundaries of functional regions (‘nodes’) estimated at the group-level, and the true spatial organisation in an individual subject. This type of misalignment refers to the lack of voxel-to-voxel correspondence across individuals that remains even after applying standard alignment approaches (here surface-based multimodal alignment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>]). A direct result of such misalignment, if not accounted for in the methodological approach used to estimate node timeseries, is that those timeseries will incorrectly contain a mixture of multiple ‘true’ node timeseries. The effect of such mixed timeseries is potentially profound, leading to a sharp reduction in the accuracy of subsequently estimated temporal correlations (‘edges’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Parcellations are typically defined at the group level in order to ensure correspondence between nodes across subject, although some parcellation approaches described above include steps to account for misalignment (e.g. using a classifier for the multimodal parcellation, and dual regression for ICA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hacker et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nickerson et al., 2017</xref>]). While these approaches are expected to appropriately account for misalignment, our previous findings suggested that spatial information strongly influenced estimated temporal correlations despite the use of dual regression or classifier steps to obtain subject specific maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Secondly, it is expected that different parcellation methods preferentially represent connectivity information in either the temporal or spatial domain. For example, ‘nodes’ in a low dimensional soft parcellation take the form of spatially extended networks of brain regions, and therefore the connectivity between functional regions that are included in the same network are described in the spatial map. Conversely, these functional regions would be split into separate nodes when using a high-dimensional (contiguous) hard parcellation, and consequently the same connectivity between functional regions must be described in the edges. In our earlier work, we tested to what extent our findings were explained by this type of within-network connectivity information that may be represented in low-dimensional spatial maps. The findings showed that the direct mapping between low-dimensional extended networks and high-dimensional node edges does not explain the influence of cross-subject variability in spatial organisation on cross-subject variability in edge estimates (see Supplementary file 1e in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Thirdly, it is possible that the assumptions that underlie the estimation of the group-level parcellation are incorrect (e.g. the spatial independence constraint in spatial ICA). If the assumption of spatial independence is incorrect, this would result in mis-estimated group maps, which may affect how functional connectivity is represented in downstream dual regression estimates. Breaking the spatial independence assumption implies the presence of relatively extensive amounts of spatial overlap between nodes, such that spatial correlations between node maps are present. While this type of complex, overlapping spatial structure does not easily fit with the intuitive notion of nodes (and is precluded, by definition, in hard parcellations), the example of overlapping receptive fields with selectivity for stimulus orientation, length, width, or colour in V1 demonstrates the possibility for hierarchically overlapping functional systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Essen and Maunsell, 1983</xref>). Indeed, task-based functional activation patterns can be more accurately captured based on soft-parcellations with inherent scope for overlap, compared with hard parcellations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bzdok et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that spatial ICA may underestimate spatial overlap between nodes (as a result of enforcing spatial independence in the estimated maps), although previous work has shown that, in the presence of noise, this overlap can be recovered using thresholding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>An alternative parcellation method, designed to avoid the spatial independence constraint, is PROFUMO. This adopts a hierarchical Bayesian framework that includes spatial priors (for map sparsity and group map regularisation) and temporal priors (consistent with the hemodynamic response function) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>). The Probabilistic Functional Mode (PFM) maps obtained from PROFUMO commonly show relatively extensive amounts of spatial overlap (and hence spatial correlation) between nodes. These overlap regions may contain a spatial representation of complex between-node patterns of functional connectivity. Therefore, it is possible that the presence of these spatial correlations in PFM maps, which are not present in un-thresholded group spatial ICA maps (by design, as a result of spatial independence), may explain our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The aim of this work is to disambiguate functional connectivity information in the temporal and spatial domains, and to determine the influence of different algorithms used for parcellation and connectivity estimation. Specifically, we focus on soft parcellations to determine the interaction between complex functional brain organisation and the estimation of spatial nodes and temporal edges. We adopt simulation approaches that allow direct control and knowledge of the ground truth, provide mathematical explanations, show examples observed in real data, and test associations with behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Dual regression performance in the presence of misalignment</title><p>One potential explanation for our previously reported findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>), is spatial misalignment between the exact location of node boundaries in individual subjects compared with group maps. In a typical ICA pipeline, group ICA (using the temporal concatenation approach) is followed by dual regression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nickerson et al., 2017</xref>). Dual regression aims to estimate subject-specific spatial maps that accurately capture spatial organisation, accounting for any misalignment with the group maps. We will refer to group ICA followed by dual regression as the ‘ICA-DR’ pipeline throughout.</p><p>To assess the degree to which the ICA-DR pipeline is affected by spatial misalignment, we make use of the fact that data from the Human Connectome Project are available using two different surface-based versions of multimodal surface matching (MSM) spatial alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Robinson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), and as volumetrically aligned data. Cortical alignment using ‘MSMSulc’ is driven by gyral folding patterns alone, whereas cortical alignment using ‘MSMAll’ incorporates multiple spatial features including folding patterns, myelin maps, functional resting state networks, and visuotopic maps for alignment. Previous work has shown substantial improvements in alignment when using MSMAll compared with MSMSulc, and both types of surface alignment are superior compared with volumetric alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coalson et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Here, we directly compare spatial alignment using MSMAll, MSMSulc, and volumetric data at the single subject level. Firstly, we perform single-subject ICA independently on each dataset (temporally concatenated across four runs; dimensionality = 25). Given that the data are identical apart from the alignment procedure, any differences in the spatial network boundaries extracted with ICA from the MSMAll or MSMSulc data should be driven exclusively by misalignment (although note that for volumetric data other tissue types such as white matter and CSF may influence the network decomposition). Furthermore, these single-subject ICA results are not influenced by other subjects or by the group, and can therefore be viewed as the ‘ground truth’ spatial organisation in this subject for each respective alignment type. Secondly, we perform dual regression against group maps obtained from 1004 subjects aligned using MSMAll (dimensionality = 25). Matching group maps in volumetric space were obtained by regressing each subject’s MSMAll stage one dual regression timeseries into that subject’s volumetric data, these maps were then averaged across all subjects and entered into a spatial ICA with the same dimensionality (to ensure spatial independence, which may not be fully preserved in the regression and averaging steps). These group maps are expected to better represent the subject-specific MSMAll-aligned data compared with the subject-specific MSMSulc and volumetrically aligned data. Therefore, we can directly test how well dual regression captures the ‘ground truth’ spatial organisation obtained using single-subject ICA for each respective alignment type. This procedure was repeated separately in a subset of N = 22 subjects.</p><p>Firstly, we perform spatial correlations between group maps and single-subject spatial ICA maps to determine how well the group maps represent the subject-specific organisation. Correlations are transformed using Fisher’s R-to-Z and entered into a one-way ANOVA with a factor for alignment (3 levels corresponding to MSMAll, MSMSulc, and volumetric). The main effect was significant (F(2,1098)=673.2, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>), and all post-hoc paired tests were significant after Bonferroni correction (MSMAll-MSMSulc ΔZ=0.045, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>; MSMSulc-volumetric ΔZ=0.152, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure Supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44890.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Comparison between MSMAll and MSMSulc alignment on dual regression results from an individual subject.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Single-subject ICA result from MSMAll data acts as ‘ground truth’.

Results from a one-way ANOVA with a factor for alignment (3 levels corresponding to MSMAll, MSMSulc, and volumetric), showed a significant main effect, F(2,1098)=842.2, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>. This effect was driven by a significantly lower correlation between dual regression and “ground truth” maps in volumetric data (MSMSulc-volumetric ΔZ=0.242, p&lt;10<sup>−10</sup>). Conversely, the difference in this correlation between MSMAll and MSMSulc did not reach significance (ΔZ=0.013, p=0.061; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure Supplement 1B</xref>).These results show that, despite misalignment between MSMSulc subject data and MSMAll group maps, dual regression was largely able to overcome this misalignment to estimate the subject-specific spatial organisation. However, dual regression was not able to correct for the more substantial amounts of misalignment observed in volumetrically aligned data.</p><p>An example of an individual ICA component is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. These results qualitatively illustrate the extent to which dual regression corrected for minor misalignment between MSMAll and MSMSulc. There was a clear shift in the parietal node of the default mode network in MSMSulc data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) compared with MSMAll data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Nevertheless, dual regression against the identical set of group maps is able to accurately estimate the shifted versions of the subject maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Cross-subject relationship between temporal and spatial connectivity</title><p>As discussed in the introduction, there are multiple potential reasons for the previously observed influence of spatial information on estimated node-based functional connectivity, including spatial misalignment and inappropriate parcellation assumptions. In the previous section we show that the contribution of spatial misalignment is likely to be relatively minor provided that surface-based alignment is used in conjunction with the ICA-DR pipeline. Next, we aim to test the role of inappropriate parcellation assumptions.</p><p>Previous rfMRI research has utilised the spatial shape and amplitude of intrinsic networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Filippini et al., 2009</xref>), or temporal correlation patterns between timeseries extracted from nodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). However, correlations between network/node spatial maps (“spatial edges”) are not commonly studied. A potential reason for this is that many parcellation approaches (by design) result in binary, non-overlapping node maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gordon et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>).

Previous work has shown that thresholding can be used in the presence of noise to recover spatial overlap between group spatial ICA node maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, using thresholded maps to extract timeseries may be an appropriate technique to provide more accurate measures of spatial overlap and temporal network matrices for the ICA-DR pipeline. This thresholding approach is discussed and tested in detail below in the section entitled ‘Using mixture-model thresholding to improve ICA dual regression estimates’.</p><p>To show the effects of the theory described above, we performed a two dimensional simulation that includes two correlated maps (25% overlap; each map occupying 1 percent of total voxels). We generated data for 50 subjects by taking the outer product of the maps with two correlated timeseries, and entered simulated data from all 50 subjects into a spatial ICA using the temporal concatenation approach. Random noise was added to each map in each subject, but there was no systematic misalignment across simulated subject data. The full simulation was repeated across 10 instances to obtain robust results. Example group maps estimated using spatial ICA show somewhat weaker weights in the overlapping region, consistent with the independence constraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and insert). The group maps are used in a dual regression pipeline to obtain estimated subject timecourses (and derived temporal correlations), and estimated subject maps (and derived spatial correlations). As described in the theory above and consistent with the results shown in real data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, the derived spatial overlap and temporal network matrices are inversely correlated with each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Nevertheless, the individual maps and timecourses estimated with ICA-DR are highly correlated with the ground truth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Hence, even though the first-order map and timecourse estimates from ICA-DR may have good accuracy, second-order spatial and temporal edge estimates can be more strongly affected by systematic shifts if the assumption of spatial independence is not met.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44890.006</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Simulation results showing the effects of assuming spatial independence when there is spatial overlap between nodes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial ICA leads to an underestimation of map weights in the overlapping area and an introduction of negative weights to meet the assumption of spatial independence.

Subject-specific maps are first normalised (separately per node) to a maximum of 1 and thresholded such that voxel weights between −0.2 and 0.2 are set to zero to remove background noise. These steps are needed to avoid the resulting summary overlap maps being driven by either node maps with strong weights or by contributions from background weights. For each subject, a summary map is obtained by summing the absolute values at each grayordinate across all node maps. These summary maps are subsequently averaged across all subjects. The results of this simple approach reveal areas of overlap in the temporo-parietal-occipital junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

PROFUMO does not enforce the spatial independence constraint and is therefore well suited to capture overlap. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> shows a direct comparison of the overlap between two matching group-level components obtained from PROFUMO and ICA. The spatial correlation between un-thresholded ICA and PFM maps is high (r = 0.84 between the red maps and r = 0.80 between the green maps). However, the spatial correlation between the two un-thresholded PFM maps is strong (r = 0.46), whereas there is no correlation between the two un-thresholded ICA maps. While the thresholded maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> on the right show that ICA captures some of the overlapping regions, the extent of these is qualitatively reduced compared to PFM maps on the left.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Using mixture-model thresholding to improve ICA dual regression estimates</title><p>We have demonstrated that if the assumption of spatial independence is incorrect, then this induces negative correlations between node spatial maps, which in turn can contaminate functional connectivity through dual regression. We now consider an alteration to traditional ICA dual regression to alleviate this contamination. The proposed method works by reducing the problematic negative spatial correlations present in the node/component spatial maps following spatial ICA. This is known as thesholded dual regression, in which a Gaussian/Gamma mixture model can be fitted to the histogram of an ICA component map to determine a threshold used to zero the background. This allows better recovery of ground truth spatial correlations in simple simulations (see Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In order to estimate timecourses such that the temporal network matrices more accurately match the ground truth, we propose to perform thresholding of the subject-specific spatial maps obtained from dual regression stage two using Gaussian/Gamma mixture modelling.

The mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian background distribution are used to shift and rescale the map weights and a threshold of 2 is applied to set the background to zero.</p><p>Dual regression can be performed as part of two different analysis pipelines with relatively separate goals and interpretations. Firstly, dual regression can be performed in order to draw inferences regarding the spatial shape and local amplitude of networks. This analysis procedure is best performed on the un-thresholded stage two spatial maps, because subject-specific thresholding may introduce unwanted biases in the subsequent voxel-wise inference performed on the maps. Secondly, dual regression can be performed in order to extract timecourses used to estimate temporal network matrices (and hence downstream inferences based on network-matrix edge comparisons across subjects). For this second analysis pipeline we show here that using stage four timeseries instead of stage one timeseries is beneficial in order to more clearly separate spatial and temporal information (at least in the typical case of whole-brain analyses; spatial ICA performed within a small region of interest may behave differently if the number of background voxels is reduced relative to the number of ‘active’ voxels, such that the mixture model may not be valid). A third potential use of dual regression is to study spatial overlap matrices. While spatial relationships between networks are not typically studied, there is increasing interest in cross-subject differences in spatial network organisation. Spatial overlap matrices (which should be studied using stage three thresholded maps) reflect a relatively simple metric related to overlapping organisation and may become of increasing interest, particularly when studying associations with behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Direct comparisons of PROFUMO and ICA accuracy using simulations</title><p>To test the accuracy of estimates obtained from PROFUMO, traditional ICA-DR, and thresholded ICA-DR (described in the previous section), we simulated an rfMRI dataset containing a ground truth set of nodes. To generate the simulations, we followed the general framework described in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al. (2019)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al. (2015)</xref>, with slight changes to some of the parameters. Briefly, the simulated data contained 10,000 voxels, 30 subjects, two runs per subject, and 600 timepoints per run. This full simulation is repeated 10 times in order to obtain well-sampled results.</p><p>In the spatial domain, a binary atlas of 100 non-overlapping contiguous parcels was generated, and random subject-specific warps were applied as a simplified representation of misalignment (with the maximum possible voxelwise displacement equal to the average parcel size). Then, 15 non-binary spatial node maps were generated by specifying weights for each atlas parcel determining how strongly it contributes to each spatial node. While the parcel identities were fixed, the strength of the weights varied from subject-to-subject. In the temporal domain, sparse and correlated ‘neural’ timecourses were generated and convolved with subject-specific haemodynamic response functions.</p><p>Following the generation of subject data, the full PROFUMO, traditional ICA-DR, and thresholded ICA-DR pipelines are performed to obtain group maps, subject-specific maps, and subject-specific timeseries. To test the performance of each of these approaches, we calculate (at a subject level): (i) the correlation between estimated and ground truth timeseries, (ii) the correlation between estimated and ground truth spatial maps, (iii) the correlation between estimated and ground truth results for each temporal network matrix edge (across subjects), and (iv) the correlation between estimated and ground truth results for each spatial overlap matrix edge (across subjects).</p><p>In addition, we focus on a specific subset of the edges (across all repeats of the simulation) with significantly positive ground truth spatial correlation based on a one-tailed t-test against zero (after Bonferroni correction for multiple comparison across 15*14/2 edges * 10 iterations = 1050 comparisons). A total of 126 edges (out of 1050) showed significant ground truth positive spatial correlation. The simulations are designed to have reasonable, but not excessive, amounts of spatial overlap (consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), and therefore the spatial correlations are relatively weak, despite being significantly different from zero. We investigate these specific edges further because the tests described above are correlation-based and it is possible that interindividual variance is captured well (leading to good results in correlation-based tests) even in the presence of a considerable bias in absolute network matrix values. We aim to test whether there is any absolute bias away from ground truth network matrix values (as measured with the positive-edge comparisons), and how well each method captures relative differences between individuals (as measured using the correlation-based tests).</p><p>The results show that the accuracy of estimated timeseries is relatively good in all of the analysis pipelines tested here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). The accuracy of spatial map estimation is superior in PROFUMO compared to both variations of the ICA-DR pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). As expected, the accuracy of spatial map estimates was improved using the thresholded ICA-DR pipeline compared to the traditional ICA-DR pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Similar overall results are found for the accuracy of spatial overlap matrices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). These biases in secondary estimates for spatial and temporal edges are also found in the absence of any between-subject spatial misalignment, confirming that this effect is independent of any potential misalignment problems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). When focusing on edges with significantly positive ground truth spatial correlation, PROFUMO outperformed both ICA-DR pipelines for estimating spatial edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>), whereas thresholded ICA-DR results were closest to the ground truth for estimating temporal edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44890.009</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Simulation results to compare traditional ICA-DR, thresholded ICA-DR, and PROFUMO performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Correlations between ground truth and estimated subject timeseries is high across all three methods.

Results show similar biases in spatial and temporal edge estimates from standard dual regression in the full and no misalignment simulations, indicating that this effect is observed irrespective of spatial misalignment. The no overlap simulation also shows improvement of thresholded dual regression over standard dual regression, likely as a result of the effective reduction of noise that is achieved when thresholding the maps.

Here, we repeat the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) on 1,001 HCP subjects to estimate multivariate relationships between a set of behavioural variables and a set of edges. For the edges, we test both spatial overlap and temporal network matrices obtained from one of the pipelines described above. Temporal network matrices are classically used as a proxy for neural coupling, and are commonly studied in the literature. On the other hand, spatial overlap matrices reflect spatial overlap between resting state networks, which is an aspect of functional connectivity that has not yet received attention in the existing literature. Here, we aim to test which of these different aspects of functional connectivity is most strongly and uniquely associated with individual differences in behaviour.</p><p>Details of the CCA procedure can be found in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>). Briefly, CCA takes a set of behavioural measures and a set of edges as inputs and determines a linear combination of each such that the resulting scores are maximally correlated between the two sets of input variables. Following earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), we use a total of 158 behavioural variables available in the Human Connectome Projects broadly covering demographic (e.g. education level), psychometric (e.g. IQ), lifestyle (e.g. substance use), and psychosocial (e.g. rule-breaking behaviour) measures. Previous work has shown a strong relationship between a behavioural population mode of variation that includes positive measures (such as IQ and self-reported life satisfaction) and negative measures (such as drug and alcohol use) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine the unique variance contained in spatial overlap and temporal network matrices respectively, we adopted the same partial CCA approach that was used previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). We regress spatial edges onto temporal edges within each method (after dimensionality reduction), and enter the residuals into a standard CCA against behavioural measures. Hence, the partial CCA results remove any shared behaviourally-relevant variance that is present in both spatial overlap and temporal network matrices within the overall method (i.e., within PROFUMO/standard ICA-DR/thresholded ICA-DR).</p><p>All of the spatial overlap and temporal network matrix results obtained with any of the three pipelines show significant associations with behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, blue bars).

This finding is closely linked to our earlier work, where we reported a strong CCA result for PFM spatial maps, but there are key differences in the way brain-based inputs to the CCA were calculated between these two findings.

The resulting movie (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig8video1">Figure 8—video 1</xref>) shows that spatial overlap systematically varies along with the network-specific spatial variation that we showed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, these results show that spatial overlap (and resulting correlation) is a key behaviourally-relevant aspect of spatial information.</p><p>Out of the results that reach significance in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, subject behavioural weights are significantly correlated with the previously reported positive-negative population mode of behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Smith et al., 2015</xref>) for all results except for PFM temporal netmats. The PFM temporal netmats are instead linked to variables such as blood pressure (diastolic and systolic), hematocrit values, and alcohol use, therefore representing a more physiological population mode. Correlation with the positive-negative mode was reduced for all partial CCA results compared with full CCA results (R<sub>full</sub> = 0.14 to R<sub>partial</sub> = 0.01 for ICA-DR thresholded temporal network matrices; R<sub>full</sub> = 0.42 to R<sub>partial</sub> = 0.21 for ICA-DR original temporal network matrices; R<sub>full</sub> = 0.39 to R<sub>partial</sub> = 0.16 for PFM spatial overlap matrices). Hence, the partial results were less similar to the positive-negative behavioural mode than the full CCA results, indicative of shared behaviourally-relevant information between spatial overlap and temporal network matrices in all of the approaches that were tested. Specifically, the amount of overall shared variance between temporal network and spatial overlap matrices was 29.6% for original ICA-DR, 26.8% for thresholded ICA-DR, and 24.5% for PROFUMO. Hence, these results show reduced conflation of temporal and spatial information in both thresholded ICA-DR and PROFUMO compared with traditional ICA-DR. Interestingly, the partial CCA result for the ICA-DR thresholded temporal network matrix was no longer significantly linked to the positive-negative behavioural mode (R<sub>partial</sub> = 0.01, p<sub>Bonferroni</sub> = 1), supporting the interpretation that cross-subject behavioural variability in temporal network matrices is largely driven by spatial information.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We previously showed that the spatial topographical organisation of functional networks is most strongly predictive of cross-subject variability in behaviour, and that functional connectivity (temporal) network matrices contain little unique trait-level cross-subject information that is not also reflected in spatial maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we aimed to determine and address the reason for this conflation of temporal and spatial sources of interindividual variability, focussing on the pipeline that uses ICA for parcellation and dual regression for the estimation of subject maps and timeseries. Our results reveal that functional networks are often spatially overlapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), and that individual differences in the amount of spatial overlap (and resulting spatial correlation) is likely to explain our previous results. These findings support the main results from our earlier article that estimated temporal correlations are (in part) driven by spatial information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>). However, our new findings show that these results should not be interpreted as spatial misalignment (as we suggested in our earlier work), but are rather the result of spatially overlapping functional organization. Spatial overlap is underestimated in spatial ICA (due to the statistical independence constraint; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), systematically affecting downstream dual regression steps, such that the resulting temporal network matrices are negatively weighted by any spatial correlations present in the underlying true networks. These effects, discussed mathematically in section ‘Temporal network and spatial overlap matrix estimation in ICA followed by dual regression’, and shown in simulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and real data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), directly explain our previous dual regression-based results. Importantly, these methodological aspects are highly relevant for research into brain-behaviour relationships for two reasons. Firstly, they influence the interpretation of existing research using temporal network matrices (which likely reflect a combination of spatial and temporal information). Secondly, our findings suggest that patterns of spatial overlap may be highly sensitive to individual differences in behaviour and warrant further research.</p><p>As discussed in the introduction, one potential reason for our earlier findings could have been linked to residual spatial misalignment between group and subject maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bozek et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demirtas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kong et al., 2019</xref>). The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> reveal that dual regression obtains relatively accurate estimates in the presence of minor misalignment (as modelled with MSMAll compared with MSMSulc), suggesting that spatial misalignment may not contribute strongly when care is taken to adopt surface-based alignment methods and subject-specific node-definition approaches. Therefore, our earlier findings (in HCP data) are more likely explained by the biases introduced as a result of spatial overlap, and not by residual spatial misalignment. However, dual regression was not able to account for more extensive misalignment which is seen when using volume-based alignment procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coalson et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that misalignment may influence functional connectivity estimates for analyses performed in volumetric space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Similarly, misalignment is likely to play a larger role when using anatomically-derived hard parcellations that are unlikely to match the subject-specific functional organisation well.</p><p>In this work we have broadly considered spatial edges as a distinct form of functional connectivity (to be differentiated from temporal edges; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the correct interpretation of spatial edges is an important new research question that requires further investigation. On the level of neural circuitry, neural organisations that may give rise to observed spatial overlap in fMRI include: (i) independent co-located (at fMRI resolution) neural populations, (ii) fast dynamic switching between network membership, (iii) multiplicity of hierarchically organised functional representations, (iv) concurrent contributions to multiple networks (i.e., integration). Determining the neural basis of spatial overlap will inform the correct interpretation of spatial edges by addressing questions such as: ‘is spatial overlap indicative of coupling?”, and ‘do spatial edges fall within the definition of functional connectivity?”.</p><p>The detailed explanation of our previous findings presented here only applies to the results that were obtained using a dual regression pipeline. Mathematical differences in timeseries estimation imply that the theory described here cannot explain our earlier findings obtained using a masking procedure with hard parcellations (i.e., Yeo and HCP_MMP1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glasser et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>). We are currently undertaking similarly detailed investigations to further understand our previous results in these hard parcellations. Early qualitative observations suggest the presence of complex patterns of partial overlap between multiple extended networks. This complex overlap may not easily be modelled by increasing the dimensionality to allow separation of previously overlapping voxels into one new parcel, and non-overlapping voxels into other parcel(s) (which would allow results to be unbiased, particularly at a sufficiently high dimensionality). As such, our preliminary results suggest that hard parcellations are affected by overlapping functional organisation due to the mis-estimation of spatial nodes and resulting mixing of extracted timeseries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). Further work is needed to test this hypothesis and to develop parcellation methods that address this issue.</p><p>The biases described in this work can be addressed using a relatively straightforward extension to the existing dual regression pipeline. Specifically, we suggest a further regression step after standard dual regression, that uses thresholded subject maps to estimate timeseries. It has previously been shown that thresholded maps (using Gamma-Gaussian mixture modelling) better capture spatial overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bielczyk et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we explicitly test this approach and report greater accuracy in the estimation of timeseries, spatial maps, and both temporal and spatial overlap matrices when compared with traditional dual regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). When dual regression is performed with the aim of extracting timeseries and estimating temporal network matrices (as opposed to statistical tests of spatial map shape and amplitude), we recommend adopting this thresholded dual regression extension in order to accurately estimate node timeseries. While this approach may lead to somewhat lower associations with behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), it is driven more purely by uniquely temporal connectivity information, rather than conflating both temporal and spatial connectivity. Thresholded dual regression will be implemented in the next version of FSL dual_regression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/DualRegression">https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/DualRegression</ext-link>).</p><p>Our results show that spatial correlations obtained from PROFUMO are most strongly linked to behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This finding is an indirect replication of our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>), but here it is driven purely by correlations between spatial maps, while we previously entered the cross-subject covariance matrix of the full weighted spatial maps. Hence, this result indicates that cross-subject variance in spatial correlations (rather than in more complex aspects of spatial organisation) are behaviourally-relevant. Unfortunately, spatial correlations obtained from thresholded dual regression are not as strongly associated with behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), which is likely linked to the fact that PROFUMO outperforms thresholded dual regression in the accuracy of estimated spatial maps and correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><p>The methodological challenge of accurately modelling spatial overlap in network organisation that is addressed here has important implications for a number of key neuroscientific questions. Our findings show that spatial overlap was prominent in the temporo-parietal-occipital junction and within higher visual areas along the lateral wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The hierarchical functional organisation of V1 is relatively well-understood to represent overlapping receptive fields with selectivity for stimulus orientation, length, width, or colour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Van Essen and Maunsell, 1983</xref>). On the other hand, the complex functional organisation in the inferior parietal lobule, and its involvement in wide-ranging perceptual and cognitive functions, is the topic of ongoing research and debate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter and Huettel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Igelström and Graziano, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mars et al., 2012</xref>). Further evidence of the highly complex spatial nature of functional organisation can also be found in recent gradient-based analyses of cortical topography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marquand et al., 2017</xref>). These spatial complexities are largely ignored in most current connectomics approaches, where the use of group-based anatomical hard atlases (such as the AAL) is still highly pervasive. This likely limits the ability to gain further insights into the organisation and function of cortical regions such as the temporo-parietal-occipital junction. As such, the results presented here and elsewhere emphasise the need for modern connectomics research to acknowledge and appropriately account for the presence of highly complex, hierarchically overlapping functional organisation.</p><p>It is possible that the overlapping organisation identified here may be linked to complex patterns of inter-digitation between large-scale networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Braga and Buckner, 2017</xref>). We did not find any evidence for inter-digitated patterns here, although the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> (and similar observations at the individual subject level) do show adjacency of two separate networks in a number of distinct cortical zones, consistent with the findings of Braga et al. A larger number of data points per subject may be needed to estimate further detailed patterns of inter-digitation in regions that we refer to here as ‘overlapping’ (e.g. there is a roughly three-fold increase in the Braga et al dataset compared to HCP data). Alternatively, a truly overlapping hierarchical spatial organisation may be represented as inter-digitation in seed-based correlation results (as opposed to multivariate decomposition methods), because correlations may effectively be reduced in regions of overlap relative to neighbouring non-overlapping regions, creating inter-digitated patterns. A further possibility is that individual differences in cortical folding associated with brain volume may influence both observed spatial overlap and inter-digitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Toro et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, we previously showed a strong brain-behaviour relationship for fractional surface area (Supplementary file 1B in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijsterbosch et al., 2018</xref>), and recent work has reported broad associations between structural brain measures and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arenas et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, further work is needed to understand the relationship between structural morphology and overlapping or inter-digitated functional organization.</p><p>In conclusion, we replicate our previous work showing that spatial topographical network organisation is most strongly linked to behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), and additionally show that cross-subject variability in spatial overlap between complex cortical networks is a key source of behaviourally-relevant information. Furthermore, we show that this spatially overlapping network structure is underestimated when using a common parcellation technique (ICA), resulting in the conflation of temporal and spatial connectivity information in derived temporal network matrices (from dual regression). We present a solution that obtains more accurate estimates of temporal and spatial overlap matrices based on thresholded spatial maps.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Dataset</title><p>Data from the Human Connectome Project S1200 release were used including 1004 subjects with 4800 resting state timepoints (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Van Essen et al., 2013</xref>).

A total of 50 subjects with 200 timepoints each were simulated, and the full simulation was repeated 10 times.

Each spatial node included 100 voxels (out of 10,000), with 25% overlap between the two spatial nodes to ensure ground truth spatial correlation. Normally distributed timeseries were generated for each node, and a shared normally distributed timeseries was added to both to ensure ground truth temporal correlation. Simulated data for each subject was generated by taking the outer product between simulated timeseries and spatial maps, resulting in a 10,000 x 200 dataset. For each repeat, these datasets were concatenated across all 50 subjects before running group ICA, following by dual regression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Simulation 2</title><p>A second simulation was performed to enable a direct comparison between the results from original ICA-DR, thresholded ICA-DR, and PROFUMO. The key differences between simulation 1 and simulation two are: (a) a spatial model that builds complex modes from an atlas of contiguous parcels, and (b) a temporal model of the ‘neural’ timeseries that is convolved with a hemodynamic response function. Simulation two was based on previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Harrison et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison et al., 2015</xref>), and is described in more detail below:</p><sec id="s4-3-1"><title>Atlas generation</title><p>The 10,000 voxels were split into 100 contiguous parcels, with the parcel widths drawn from a Dirichlet distribution. The parcel weights were then drawn from a Gamma distribution.

The number of regions followed a Poisson distribution, the total number of parcels followed a beta distribution, and the number of parcels per region followed a Dirichlet distribution.

The parcel weights again followed a gamma distribution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Time course generation</title><p>‘Neural’ time courses were simulated at 0.1 Hz.

In the presence of additive Gaussian noise, we can therefore model the distribution of spatial weights in any single ICA components using a mixture of one Gaussian distribution (for the background) and two Gamma distributions (for the positive and negative aspects of the ICA networks). Subsequently, the mean and standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution (background) are used to shift and rescale the distribution of spatial weights for each map, and a threshold of ±2 is used to threshold the spatial map such that background voxels are set to zero. Previous work has shown that this threshold procedure can accurately capture ground truth spatial correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2005</xref>). Here, we adopt mixture model thresholding in a proposed extension to dual regression designed to estimate ICA timeseries and derived correlations with improved accuracy.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Data and code availability</title><p>HCP data are distributed from the Connectome Coordination Facility (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.humanconnectome.org/">https://www.humanconnectome.org/</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by Daniel S Margulies (Reviewer #1) and Jakob Seidlitz (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Chris Honey, the Reviewing Editor, and Richard Ivry as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary</p><p>This manuscript by Bijsterbosch and colleagues extends their prior work describing the impact of spatial confounds on the variation in functional connectivity across individuals, and its connection to variation in behavior. Here, the authors test several specific hypotheses to account for their prior findings. They do this by examining two axes of potential bias: i) algorithms to derive spatial and temporal functional connectivity domains, and ii) methods for generating &quot;soft&quot; (data-driven) and &quot;hard&quot; (a priori) parcellations. Furthermore, they provide both empirical evidence and quantitative support via simulations in support of these investigations. Ultimately, the authors conclude that inter-individual behavioral variability is best explained by the spatial overlap between networks, which affects the extraction of soft parcellations. The manuscript is clearly written, and the analyses and results are presented in a manner that makes the logic of the study straightforward.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers were impressed by the rigor and logical progression of the manuscript, and the effort to include results from different surface alignment algorithms as well as a comparison with volumetric registration. The reviewers also appreciated the discussion and comparison of dual regression methodologies versus PROFUMO, and the clear differences in assumptions that are made with each.</p><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1A) The maps of network overlap, presented in Figure 4A, appear spatially consistent with prior findings of the relative degree of cortical folding (Toro et al., 2008). As cortical morphology may impact on functional connectivity (for example, differences between adjacent sulci and gyri), is it possible that the network overlap results are driven in part by cortical morphology? This issue is distinct from the point raised in the discussion regarding network interdigitation, but the impact of morphology on the results could be the same. A post hoc test of whether measures of cortical surface area and volume account for the brain-behavior relationship observed in the CCA analysis might be sufficient to assess whether this concern is relevant.</p><p>1B) Another possible interpretation of the topography in Figure 4: the areas of most overlap appear to be in areas that have been shown to be prone to problems in cortical reconstruction (mostly due to excess head motion). In light of the lack of influence of surface registration method (as discussed above and in the manuscript), can the authors speculate/discuss this pattern of overlap?</p><p>2) The Discussion mentions 'primary visual cortex' (V1) as being an area of high overlap (Figure 4). However the regions appear to be located predominantly within higher visual areas along the lateral wall (rather than within the calcarine sulcus). Please justify or correct this claim.</p><p>3) As the core brain-behavior finding from the CCA analysis is from Snet PFM, would there be any way to visualize the pattern of spatial overlap associated with the components (along the lines of the figures shown in Figure 4A)? This might help in interpreting the results in the context of prior findings.</p><p>4) The Discussion mentions that ongoing work explores why the brain-behavior relationships are also observed when hard parcellations are used (e.g. the Yeo et al. and Glasser et al. parcellations). The authors speculated that: &quot;it is possible that [hard] parcellation methods are therefore unable to isolate overlap into a distinct parcel (which would allow results to be unbiased, particularly at a sufficiently high dimensionality), and instead parcel boundaries in regions of overlap are determined by the network with the strongest amplitude (or lowest cross-subject variance), leading to mixing of extracted timeseries&quot;. Are the authors now able to confirm this speculation? More generally, can the authors explain why the brain-behavior variance explained is so similar when using hard parcellations and when using dual regression approaches (Figure 1A of Bijsterbosch et al., 2018)? Should this be the case if the dual regression methods are subject to these spatial overlap / spatial independence effects, while hard parcellations are not?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.44890.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions</p><p>1A) The maps of network overlap, presented in Figure 4A, appear spatially consistent with prior findings of the relative degree of cortical folding (Toro et al., 2008).

We previously assessed the brain-behavior relationship for cortical surface area using CCA as part our earlier paper (Supplementary File 1B: <underline>https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.32992.028</underline>). The findings showed that there is indeed a significant brain-behaviour relationship for Fractional Surface Area (based on the HCP_MMP1.0 parcellation), which is further supported by recent preprint findings showing brain-behaviour associations for multiple structural measures (Arenas, et al., 2018). Further research will be needed to directly relate morphometry and functional organisation in order to establish the relationship between functional overlap and cortical folding. These considerations are included in the Discussion:</p><p>“A further possibility is that individual differences in cortical folding associated with brain volume may influence both observed spatial overlap and inter-digitation (Toro et al., 2008). Indeed, we previously showed a strong brain-behaviour relationship for fractional surface area (Supplementary File 1B in (Bijsterbosch et al., 2018)), and recent work has reported broad associations between structural brain measures and behaviour (Arenas et al., 2018). Hence, further work is needed to understand the relationship between structural morphology and overlapping or inter-digitated functional organization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1B) Another possible interpretation of the topography in Figure 4: the areas of most overlap appear to be in areas that have been shown to be prone to problems in cortical reconstruction (mostly due to excess head motion). In light of the lack of influence of surface registration method (as discussed above and in the manuscript), can the authors speculate/discuss this pattern of overlap?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer points out, research has shown relatively widespread correlations between cortical thickness estimates from Freesurfer and head motion (Reuter et al., 2015), including in some of the overlap areas reported in our manuscript. However, these effects are highly unlikely to play a role in the findings we report here. For HCP data, the quality of the structural data and of the Freesurfer pipelines is tightly controlled and checked manually for all subjects, and poor quality structural scans were flagged and repeated to achieve optimal data quality (Glasser et al., 2013; Marcus et al., 2013), leading to very high quality surface projections. The MSMAll alignment procedure incorporates functional information in addition to surface folding patterns, and is therefore expected to be minimally affected by errors in cortical projection. While there are substantial improvements in MSMAll alignment compared to MSMSulc alignment (Coalson, Van Essen, and Glasser, 2018), we observe highly similar CCA results against behaviour regardless of the alignment procedure and we show here that dual regression performs robustly in both types of surface-based alignment. These findings are in line with the state-of-the-art quality of HCP surface projections, suggesting that cortical reconstruction errors do not contribute to the findings reported in this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The Discussion mentions 'primary visual cortex' (V1) as being an area of high overlap (Figure 4). However the regions appear to be located predominantly within higher visual areas along the lateral wall (rather than within the calcarine sulcus). Please justify or correct this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting this, we have corrected this in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Our findings show that spatial overlap was prominent in the temporo-parietal-occipital junction and within higher visual areas along the lateral wall (Figure 4).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As the core brain-behavior finding from the CCA analysis is from Snet PFM, would there be any way to visualize the pattern of spatial overlap associated with the components (along the lines of the figures shown in Figure 4A)? This might help in interpreting the results in the context of prior findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this excellent suggestion. In the revised manuscript we include a video of overlap associated with the main positive-negative CCA mode (Figure 8—video 1). This video maps directly onto the videos included in our earlier work, and shows the change in overlap as a function of behaviour. We have included these results in the revised manuscript:</p><p>“To facilitate the interpretation of these findings in light of our earlier work (Bijsterbosch et al., 2018), we include a video of spatial overlap as a function of the most significant behavioural CCA mode (Figure 8—video 1). Here, we followed the same procedure described previously to generate interpolated video frames for each of the 50 PFM maps, and subsequently summed the grayordinate-wise weights across all 50 maps following normalisation (as for Figure 5A). The resulting video (Figure 8—video 1) shows that spatial overlap systematically varies along with the network-specific spatial variation that we showed previously (Bijsterbosch et al., 2018). Hence, these results show that spatial overlap (and resulting correlation) is a key behaviourally-relevant aspect of spatial information.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Discussion mentions that ongoing work explores why the brain-behavior relationships are also observed when hard parcellations are used (e.g. the Yeo et al. and Glasser et al. parcellations).

Are the authors now able to confirm this speculation? More generally, can the authors explain why the brain-behavior variance explained is so similar when using hard parcellations and when using dual regression approaches (Figure 1A of Bijsterbosch et al., 2018)? Should this be the case if the dual regression methods are subject to these spatial overlap / spatial independence effects, while hard parcellations are not?</p></disp-quote><p>Our ongoing work to assess the effect of overlapping functional organization on hard parcellations suggests that the accuracy of temporal network matrix estimates is reduced in the presence of overlap, similarly to standard dual regression approaches. Hence, temporal network matrices obtained from both dual regression and hard parcellation methods are affected by spatial overlap, explaining their comparable associations with behaviour. On a mathematical level, the mechanisms by which spatial overlap influences the temporal network matrix estimates differs fundamentally between the two categories of methods. As shown in this current paper, the ICA-DR approach captures the spatial organisation with good accuracy, but minor errors in spatial estimation (resulting from spatial independence) introduce systematic biases when calculating temporal correlations between extracted timeseries. On the other hand, our preliminary findings show that hard parcellations likely mis-estimate the spatial organisation in the presence of spatial overlap. This affects the network matrices as a result of averaging together timeseries from different functional systems (timeseries mixing). While these are important methodological differences in terms of the mechanisms by which overlap influences network matrix estimation, the effects on brain-behaviour investigations are likely to be very similar. We have revised the wording of the re-submitted manuscript to clarify our preliminary findings:</p><p>“Early qualitative observations suggest the presence of complex patterns of partial overlap between multiple extended networks, that cannot easily be modelled by increasing the dimensionality, to allow separation of previously overlapping voxels into one new parcel, and non-overlapping voxels into other parcel(s) (which would allow results to be unbiased, particularly at a sufficiently high dimensionality). As such, our preliminary results suggest that hard parcellations are affected by overlapping functional organisation due to the mis-estimation of spatial nodes and resulting mixing of extracted timeseries (Smith et al., 2011). Further work is needed to test this hypothesis and to develop parcellation methods that address this issue.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
