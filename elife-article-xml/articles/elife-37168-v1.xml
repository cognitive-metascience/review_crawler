endoplasmic reticulum (ER) becomes excessive, cells respond to this ER stress or imbalance in protein homeostasis (or ‘proteostasis’) by activating the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), a three-armed stress-responsive signaling pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hetz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plate and Wiseman, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). Signaling within these arms is initiated by the ER stress-sensing transmembrane proteins, ATF6, IRE1 and PERK, for which the arms are named. A key role of the UPR is to restore ER proteostasis in response to pathologic insults that induce ER stress, through a combination of transcriptional and translational mechanisms. IRE1 and ATF6 activate the stress-responsive transcription factors, spliced XBP1 (XBP1s, a spliced variant of XBP1) and ATF6 (a cleaved product of full-length ATF6), respectively, that induce the expression of overlapping, and distinct subsets of ER chaperones, folding enzymes, and degradation factors involved in maintaining ER proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yamamoto et al., 2004</xref>). PERK activation induces a transient attenuation of new protein synthesis and activation of transcription factors, such as ATF4 that induce stress-responsive genes involved in both ER proteostasis maintenance and other aspects of cellular physiology, including redox regulation and amino acid synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harding et al., 2003</xref>). Through these adaptive signaling mechanisms, the UPR functions to promote ER proteostasis and alleviate ER stress.</p><p>The capacity of the UPR signaling arms to distinctly influence ER proteostasis and function suggests that selective activation of these pathways has significant potential to alleviate pathologic imbalances in ER proteostasis associated with etiologically diverse human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hetz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plate and Wiseman, 2017</xref>). In particular, activation of the ATF6 signaling arm has been shown to be useful for ameliorating disease-associated imbalances in ER proteostasis and function. We previously showed that stress-independent activation of the ATF6 transcription factor using a chemical genetic approach induces protective remodeling of ER proteostasis pathways to selectively reduce secretion and extracellular aggregation of destabilized, amyloid disease-associated proteins, such as transthyretin and immunoglobulin light chain, without significantly impacting the secretion of the endogenous proteome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Shoulders et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). Overexpression of the active ATF6 transcription factor in the heart also has been shown to improve cardiac performance in mouse models of ischemic heart disease, through a mechanism involving ATF6-dependent regulation of the antioxidant gene, catalase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of the active ATF6 transcription factor in the liver improves insulin sensitivity in obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ozcan et al., 2016</xref>). These results indicate that ATF6 activation offers a unique therapeutic opportunity to ameliorate ER proteostasis defects implicated in diverse diseases.</p><p>The potential for ATF6 activation as a therapeutic approach is further demonstrated by human genetic studies. These show that patients harboring <italic>ATF6α</italic> mutations that render this pathway constitutively active present with the retinal development disorder, achromatopsia, but notably do not show defects in other organs or systemic tissues resulting from constitutive ATF6 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">University of Washington Center for Mendelian Genomics et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kohl et al., 2015</xref>). This indicates that pharmacologic activation of ATF6 in adults is also likely to be well tolerated and not lead to systemic defects. The therapeutic potential for ATF6 activation demonstrated by these genetic results combined with the potential to correct imbalances in ER proteostasis associated with diverse diseases through ATF6 activation has led to a significant effort to identify small molecule pharmacologic activators of ATF6 that similarly correct pathologic imbalances in ER proteostasis implicated in disease.</p><p>We recently reported the discovery of several small molecules that preferentially activate the ATF6 arm of the UPR, which were identified using a cell-based-reporter high-throughput screening (HTS) strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). One of the more promising of these compounds, <italic>N-</italic>(2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-phenylpropanamide (<bold>147</bold>), was further characterized by whole cell RNAseq and proteomic profiling to confirm preferential activation of the ATF6 transcriptional program. Importantly, <bold>147</bold> phenocopied protective benefits associated with genetic ATF6 activation. For example, treatment with <bold>147</bold> reduced the secretion and extracellular aggregation of destabilized, amyloidogenic variants of transthyretin and immunoglobulin light chain in amyloid disease relevant cell models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). And notably, <bold>147</bold> did not influence secretion of the endogenous secretory proteome. Furthermore, <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation was recently shown to promote stem cell differentiation of embryonic stem cells to mesodermal lineages, revealing a previously unknown role for ATF6 in dictating stem cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, <bold>147</bold> has emerged as a promising compound for further development as a pharmacologic ATF6 activator that can be employed to enhance ER proteostasis in the context of human disease.</p><p>Despite this promise, the mechanism of how <bold>147</bold> preferentially activates the ATF6 arm of the UPR is unclear. In response to ER stress, ATF6 is activated through a process involving reduction of inter- and intra-molecular disulfides that results in formation of a reduced ATF6 monomer that is trafficking competent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nadanaka et al., 2006</xref>). This reduced monomer then traffics to the Golgi where it is processed by the Site 1 and Site 2 proteases (S1P and S2P, respectively), releasing the N-terminal, active ATF6 transcription factor responsible for upregulation of the ATF6 transcriptional program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ye et al., 2000</xref>). Previously, we showed that treatment with <bold>147</bold> activates endogenous ATF6 through a similar mechanism involving increased processing by S1P and S2P to release the active ATF6 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). However, the protein target(s) and molecular mechanism(s) responsible for the <bold>147</bold>-dependent increases in ATF6 activation are currently unknown. The ATF6 protein has no known small molecule binding sites that could serve to allosterically activate this protein, so it seems likely that <bold>147</bold> initiates signaling by interacting with proteins critical for regulating ATF6 activity. However, this hypothesis remains untested.</p><p>Here, we report our efforts focused on defining the molecular mechanism of <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation. We find that the acylated 2-amino-<italic>p-</italic>cresol substructure of <bold>147</bold>, which is shared by several other pharmacologic ATF6 activators identified in our HTS screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>), is required for pharmacologic ATF6 activation by this compound. Given that chemicals comprising <italic>p-</italic>alkyl phenol substructures are oxidized in cells by cytochrome P450s to yield highly reactive <italic>p-</italic>quinone methides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton, 2014</xref>), the dependence of <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation on the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol moiety suggested that metabolic oxidation could be involved in the activity of <bold>147</bold>. We find that <bold>147</bold> is metabolically activated in a process sensitive to the P450 inhibitor, resveratrol. This activation results in the formation of an electrophile that reacts with multiple proteins to form covalent conjugates. A key observation is that the proteins modified by <bold>147</bold> are primarily localized to the ER, which is not a general property of reactive electrophiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trott et al., 2008</xref>), and is consistent with the metabolic activation of this compound by an ER-localized cytochrome P450(s). Interestingly, ER protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs), a class of proteins involved in regulating and catalyzing disulfide formation and breakage within the ER, are enriched among the proteins modified by <bold>147</bold>. PDIs have been previously implicated in regulating the formation and dissolution of ATF6 disulfides critical for initiating ATF6 trafficking and subsequent ATF6 transcription factor activation during ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higa et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests that <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation is mediated by targeting PDI activity. Consistent with this notion, shRNA-mediated knockdown of select PDIs impairs <bold>147</bold>-dependent induction of the ATF6-target gene, <italic>BiP</italic>. Our results indicate that <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation proceeds through a mechanism requiring metabolic activation close to or within the ER to produce a reactive electrophile that selectively modifies a subset of ER proteins, including multiple PDIs, that enhances ATF6 activity by increasing the ER population of the reduced, trafficking-competent ATF6 monomer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The 2-amino-p-cresol substructure of 147 is necessary for compound-dependent ATF6 activation</title><p>Compound <bold>147</bold> consists of a 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol substructure (i.e. the A-ring) connected to a second aromatic ring (the B-ring) via a carbon-based chain (the linker; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We prepared analogs of <bold>147</bold> where the A-ring was varied by converting 3-phenylpropanoic acid to 3-phenylpropionyl chloride using oxalyl chloride and then coupling it to a variety of aromatic amines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The activities of these compounds were determined by measuring their ability to activate a previously described ATF6 transcriptional reporter that consists of a fragment of the ATF6-regulated <italic>BiP</italic> promoter driving expression of firefly luciferase (referred to as ERSE.FLuc) in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>). Interestingly, removal of the phenolic hydroxyl group in the A-ring (<bold>147-1</bold>) or replacement of it with a fluoro group (<bold>147-2</bold>) yields compounds that do not activate this ATF6 reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Compounds where the methyl group of <bold>147</bold> is removed (<bold>147-3</bold>) or where the methyl is replaced with a trifluoromethyl group (<bold>147-4</bold>) also do not activate this reporter. Compound <bold>147–4</bold> also does not induce ATF6 target genes such as <italic>BiP</italic> in human embryonic stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, moving the hydroxyl group to the <italic>ortho</italic> or <italic>meta</italic> positions of the cresol moiety (<bold>147–5</bold> and <bold>147–6</bold>) also results in compounds that do not activate the ATF6 reporter. These results indicate that the 2-amino-<italic>p-</italic>cresol substructure of <bold>147</bold>, in its entirety, is required for compound-dependent ATF6 activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37168.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Activities of <bold>147</bold> analogs toward ATF6 activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of <bold>147</bold> with its three components – the A-ring, B-ring, and linker – indicated.

This observation can be quantified using the PANTHER Overrepresentation Test to identify significantly overrepresented Gene Ontology (GO) terms from the ‘biological process’ domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mi et al., 2017</xref>). We find that the seven redox proteins noted above are all annotated with the GO term ‘cell redox homeostasis’ (GO:0045454), corresponding to a &gt; 100 fold enrichment (False Discovery Rate (FDR) = 6.6 × 10<sup>−9</sup>) relative to the expected number of occurrences of this annotation in a random sample of 19 genes. The cysteine residues in proteins of this class can react with electrophiles like the <italic>p</italic>-quinone methide predicted to be formed upon metabolic oxidation of <bold>147</bold> and <bold>147–20</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Other enriched GO terms include ‘response to ER stress’ (GO:0034976; 31-fold enriched, FDR = 7.9 × 10<sup>−6</sup>) and ‘protein folding’ (GO:0006457; 33-fold enriched, FDR = 8.2 × 10<sup>−6</sup>). In both cases, the enrichment is largely due to the presence of the protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs) in the list of 19 proteins identified in our TMT-MuDPIT proteomic analysis.</p><p>It is worth noting that many of the proteins in the list not involved in cellular redox homeostasis are nevertheless known to be regulated by the oxidation states of reactive cysteine residues. HMOX2 (heme oxygenase 2), unlike its paralog HMOX1 (which we did not find to be labeled by oxidized <bold>147</bold>), has two Cys-Pro sequences near its C-terminus. When these cysteines are oxidized, the C-terminus is unstructured and HMOX2 binds a single heme in its catalytic site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleischhacker et al., 2015</xref>). However, this region becomes helical when the cysteines are reduced to allow binding of a second heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bagai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleischhacker et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, CLIC1 adopts two substantially different folded structures depending on the oxidation state of two of its cysteine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Littler et al., 2004</xref>). When the cysteine residues are reduced, it is a soluble monomer with a structure homologous to glutathione S-transferase. When the cysteines are oxidized to form a disulfide bond, CLIC1 undergoes a drastic structural transition, becoming a helical dimer that can insert into membranes and form chloride ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Littler et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goodchild et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Twelve of the nineteen proteins (63%) in the target list are annotated as ER proteins (GO:0005783, 7.4-fold enriched, FDR = 2.0 × 10<sup>−6</sup>), demonstrating that <bold>147–20</bold> preferentially reacts with ER-localized proteins. These include the six PDIs noted above, along with HMOX2, HM13 (histocompatibility minor 13, also known as signal peptide peptidase or SPP; a peptidase that degrades signal peptides after they have been released from pre-proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Voss et al., 2013</xref>]), CKAP4 (cytoskeleton associated protein 4, also known as CLIMP-63; a transmembrane protein involved in the regulation of ER morphology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sandoz and van der Goot, 2015</xref>]), RRBP1 (ribosome binding protein 1; a ribosome-binding protein on the rough ER [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Savitz and Meyer, 1990</xref>]), RPN1 (ribophorin 1; a component of oligosaccharyl transferase, an enzyme complex that catalyzes protein N-glycosylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wilson et al., 2008</xref>]), and ERP29 (ER protein 29; a structural homolog of PDIs that lacks an active thioredoxin domain but retains chaperone activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mkrtchian and Sandalova, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suaud et al., 2011</xref>]).

For example, celastrol—a triterpenoid natural product that harbors a quinone methide—activates many stress-responsive signaling pathways, including the heat shock response and the antioxidant response, both of which are largely cytosolic stress responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Trott et al., 2008</xref>). Notably, celastrol does not activate the UPR ERSE.Fluc reporter in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cooley et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, other compounds known to form reactive quinone methides such as eugenol, also did not significantly activate the ERSE.Fluc reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the reaction preference of <bold>147</bold> for protein targets in the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and subsequent selective activation of the ATF6 UPR signaling pathway is a singular feature of the reactivity and specificity of this compound.</p><p>To further explore the origins of the selectivity of <bold>147</bold> and its analogs for modifying ER proteins, we sought to determine whether <bold>147</bold> preferentially partitions to the ER. We treated HEK293T cells with <bold>147</bold> for 15 min and separated membranous organelles including the ER from the cytosol by digitonin extraction (we validated that the digitonin extraction separated the ER and cytosol by blotting the fractions for the ER-localized ERdj3 and cytosolic HSC70; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We then used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify the amounts of <bold>147</bold> in the cytosol- and ER-containing fractions based on their peak areas by comparison with a standard curve. We found 2.1 ± 0.2 ng of <bold>147</bold> per million cells in the cytosol fraction compared to 5.6 ± 0.9 ng in the ER fraction (mean ± standard error; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>), corresponding to a ratio of 2.7 ± 0.5. Given that membranous organelles likely constitute a smaller fraction of the total volume of HEK293T cells than the cytosol (even in hepatocytes, membranous organelles are about only 40% of the total cell volume compared to 55% for the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Weibel et al., 1969</xref>]), this likely represents a lower limit for this ratio. This preference is likely due to the hydrophobicity of <bold>147</bold>, which would lead to its sequestration in the membranes that surround organelles like the ER.</p><p>This result suggests that the bias of <bold>147</bold> for reacting with ER-resident proteins is at least in part the result of its higher concentration in the ER and ER membrane. It is additionally worth noting that the cytochrome P450s that most likely convert <bold>147</bold> to <bold>147-QM</bold> (the quinone methide) primarily reside in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guengerich, 2015</xref>). Moreover, the reducing environment of the cytosol would tend to decrease the lifetime of <bold>147-QM</bold> (e.g. through reaction with glutathione) relative to the lifetime of <bold>147</bold> in the oxidizing environment of the ER, thereby diminishing the extent of protein modification in the cytosol. The combination of these factors likely drives the preference of <bold>147</bold> to selectively react with ER-resident proteins.</p><p>Interestingly, despite preferential labeling of ER-localized PDIs by <bold>147–20</bold>, previous work has shown that treatment with <bold>147</bold> does not influence secretion of the endogenous secreted proteome or disulfide-bonded proteins dependent on PDIs for ER folding, such as energetically normal immunoglobulin light chains or fully-assembled immunoglobulins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that <bold>147</bold> may label only a fraction of the ER PDIs, allowing the remaining PDI population to be available for facilitating the folding of disulfide-bonded proteins within the ER lumen. To test this, we defined the fraction of PDIA4 labeled with <bold>147–20</bold> in HEK293T cells. We incubated HEK293T cells with <bold>147–20</bold> in the absence or presence of a 5-fold excess of the competitive ATF6 activator <bold>147</bold> or the inactive <bold>147–4</bold> (both lacking the means to attach an affinity handle) and then compared the recovery of PDIA4 in each purification to the total amount of PDIA4 in cell lysates. Only 24% of PDIA4 is covalently modified with <bold>147–20</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Conjugate formation by <bold>147–20</bold> is nearly eliminated when a 5-fold excess of the parent compound <bold>147</bold> is co-added, but not when the inactive compound <bold>147–4</bold> is co-added in excess. This suggests that while <bold>147</bold> prefers ER PDIs, it does not covalently modify the entire PDI population in the ER, providing an explanation for why treatment with <bold>147</bold> does not influence secretion of the endogenous secreted proteome or specific proteins dependent on PDIs for their efficient folding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>shRNA-depletion of PDIs perturbs 147-dependent ATF6 activation</title><p>In the absence of stress, ATF6 is maintained in transport-incompetent monomeric and oligomeric conformations by intra- and intermolecular disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nadanaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higa et al., 2014</xref>). ER stress promotes the reduction of ATF6 disulfides, resulting in the formation of a reduced ATF6 monomer that traffics to the Golgi for proteolytic activation by the S1 and S2 proteases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nadanaka et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higa et al., 2014</xref>). Since the maintenance of disulfides in the ER requires PDI activity, the disulfide-mediated regulation of ATF6 also likely involves PDIs. Consistent with this hypothesis, previous results have shown that PDIA5 has a critical role in regulating ER stress-dependent ATF6 activation in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higa et al., 2014</xref>). These results suggest that <bold>147</bold>-dependent covalent modification of PDIs could promote ATF6 reduction and subsequent trafficking to the Golgi for activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Oxidized and reduced <sup>FT</sup>ATF6 were separated by non-reducing and reducing SDS-PAGE/immunoblotting, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of small molecule treatment, <sup>FT</sup>ATF6 migrates faster in non-reducing gels, consistent with its primarily oxidized status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Treatment with <bold>147</bold> alters the migration of <sup>FT</sup>ATF6 in non-reducing gels (upward gel shift), consistent with a net reduction of the disulfides in ATF6. Similar results were observed upon Tm treatment, which activates all 3 arms of the UPR. These experiments support the hypothesis that <bold>147</bold>-dependent covalent conjugation to PDIs promotes the reduction of ATF6 to increase populations of the reduced ATF6 monomers associated with transcription factor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A set of small molecules called Ceapins were previously identified to inhibit ER stress-dependent ATF6 activation by stabilizing ATF6 oligomers in the ER and preventing their trafficking to the Golgi for proteolytic activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallagher and Walter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>). Based on the proposed model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, we predict that stabilization of ATF6 oligomers by Ceapins should impede <bold>147-</bold>dependent ATF6 activation by preventing the disruption of the ATF6 oligomers into the reduced monomers required for trafficking. Consistent with this, <bold>147</bold>-dependent activation of the ATF6-selective ERSE.Fluc reporter was inhibited by co-addition of increasing concentrations of the active Ceapin, <bold>CP7</bold> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; blue dotted line indicates level of <bold>147</bold> activation achieved in the absence of <bold>CP7</bold>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gallagher and Walter, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>). This indicates that stabilization of ATF6 oligomers disrupts <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation, consistent with <bold>147</bold> having an important role in promoting ATF6 disulfide reduction and ATF6 dissociation prior to trafficking to the Golgi for proteolytic activation.</p><p>Next, we used a genetic approach to define the dependence of <bold>147</bold>-mediated ATF6 activation on specific PDIs identified in our quantitative mass spectrometry experiment. We prepared stable pools of HEK293T cells wherein <italic>PDIA1</italic>, <italic>PDIA3</italic>, <italic>PDIA4</italic>, or <italic>PDIA6</italic> was shRNA-depleted to extents analogous to the population of PDIAs covalently labeled by <bold>147</bold> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also prepared a stable pool of HEK293T cells shRNA-depleted of <italic>PDIA5</italic>, which was identified as modified by <bold>147–20</bold> in 2 out of 3 cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="table1sdata2">Table 1—source data 2</xref>) and has previously been shown to be important for ATF6 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Higa et al., 2014</xref>). PDI knockdown in these cells varied from 25–50%, as measured by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), consistent with the population of each PDI predicted to be labeled by <bold>147</bold> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Knockdown of <italic>PDIA4</italic> increased expression of the ATF6 target gene <italic>BiP</italic> in untreated cells, indicating that reduced PDIA4 activity activates ATF6 independently of compound addition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). However, knockdown of other PDIs did not significantly influence <italic>BiP</italic> expression. The addition of <bold>147</bold> did not increase expression of the ATF6-regulated gene <italic>BiP</italic>, relative to matched untreated controls, in cells in which <italic>PDIA3</italic>, <italic>PDIA4</italic>, or <italic>PDIA5</italic> were depleted by shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>; unnormalized data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, Tg-dependent induction of <italic>BiP</italic> was not significantly impaired in these cells upon PDI knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>; unnormalized data are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Interestingly, shRNA-depletion of <italic>PDIA6</italic> did not perturb <italic>BiP</italic> expression in <bold>147</bold>- or Tg-treated cells, suggesting that covalent modification of this PDI is not required for ATF6 activation in these cells. Similarly, <italic>PDIA1</italic> depletion only modestly reduced <bold>147</bold>-dependent <italic>BiP</italic> expression, indicating that covalent modification of PDIA1 also does not significantly influence ATF6 activation in these cells. Collectively, these results show that modest depletion (25–50%) of a subset of PDIs selectively inhibits <bold>147</bold>-dependent activation of ATF6, suggesting that covalent modification of PDIA3, PDIA4, and/or PDIA5 contribute to <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation.</p><p>The notion that <bold>147</bold> acts through modification of PDIs, some of which are in turn upregulated by <bold>147</bold>-mediated ATF6 activation (especially PDIA4, and to a lesser extent PDIA1 and PDIA3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>) raises the question of whether the increased levels of PDIs could diminish the efficacy of <bold>147</bold> as time goes on. ATF6 activity induced by <bold>147</bold> was previously shown to diminish 12 hr after a single treatment of compound in HEK293 cells, suggesting a potential negative feedback loop associated with ATF6 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). However, <bold>147</bold> has been used in experiments where it was shown that daily dosing of <bold>147</bold> over weeks could suppress stem cell pluripotency, enhance differentiation, and direct mesodermal cell fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kroeger et al., 2018</xref>), suggesting that the induction of PDIs does not lead to a substantial feedback attenuation of <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation when constantly administered. Thus, while the potential for increased PDI levels to suppress <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation offers an interesting mechanism to modulate <bold>147</bold> activity, further studies will be required to elucidate whether such a negative feedback mechanism is operating.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we hypothesize that ATF6 activation by <bold>147</bold> proceeds through a mechanism involving metabolic oxidation of <bold>147</bold> to form a reactive compound, likely a <italic>p</italic>-quinone methide, that covalently modifies a subset of ER-localized proteins, including PDIs. This targeting of PDIs by <bold>147</bold> appears to disrupt the maintenance of ATF6 disulfides, enabling reduction of disulfides within ATF6, increasing the populations of reduced, trafficking-competent ATF6 monomers. Previous results show that ATF6 reduction is not sufficient to promote the complete trafficking of ATF6 to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nadanaka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nadanaka et al., 2006</xref>). However, increasing populations of reduced, monomeric ATF6 would enhance sensitivity of this transcriptional signaling pathway to normal, homeostatic changes in ER proteostasis, thus increasing basal activity of ATF6 transcriptional signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This mechanism would explain the 30–40% activation of ATF6 afforded by <bold>147</bold> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>) and highlights the potential for targeting ATF6 redox to allow for the moderate levels of ATF6 signaling necessary to therapeutically modulate ER proteostasis without impacting global ER function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plate and Wiseman, 2017</xref>).</p><p>A remarkable aspect of this mechanism of pharmacologic ATF6 activation is the preferential covalent modification of proteins localized to the ER by <bold>147</bold>. This preference likely results from the biased partitioning of <bold>147</bold> to the ER and other membranous compartments of the cell due to its hydrophobic nature as well as the oxidation of <bold>147</bold> by cytochrome P450s localized to the ER membrane. The conversion of <bold>147</bold> to reactive compounds such as a <italic>p</italic>-quinone methide at the ER membrane limits the ‘sphere of activity’ for this compound, allowing it to selectively modify ER proteins, like PDIs acting on ATF6, similarly localized to the ER membrane. In this scenario, the reactive <bold>147-QM</bold> cannot diffuse far from the ER before it hydrolyzes or reacts with small molecule cellular nucleophiles (e.g. glutathione) that prevent the broad modification of cellular proteins localized to other compartments. This is especially true in the cytosol, in which <bold>147-QM</bold> likely has a shorter lifetime than in the ER because of the cytosol’s more reducing environment.</p><p>This mechanism of activity for <bold>147</bold> is enabled by a coincidence of several structural features of the small molecule. First, the 2-amino-<italic>p-</italic>cresol substructure of <bold>147</bold> can be oxidized to a <italic>p</italic>-quinone methide, a highly efficient electrophile for covalent modification of proteins. Second, each of the three primary substructures of <bold>147</bold>, the A-ring, B-ring, and three carbon linker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), are largely required for compound activity. The 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol substructure of the A-ring is required for <bold>147</bold> oxidation, for example quinone methide formation. However, the dependence on the B-ring and linker for ATF6 activation remains unclear. These substructures could be important for targeting the compound to a specific subset of cytochrome P450s at the ER membrane for metabolic activation and/or directing the reactive, oxidized <bold>147-QM</bold> to PDIs for covalent modification, or both. While we continue to define the dependence of <bold>147</bold> activity on these substructures, our results show that the B-ring and linker confer the selectivity of <bold>147</bold> required for compound-dependent ATF6 activation. The third feature of <bold>147</bold> important for ATF6 activation is the unique reactivity of the resulting oxidized product. The reactivity of the metabolically activated <bold>147</bold> is not so high that it is instantly quenched by hydrolysis, nor so low that it can diffuse away from the immediate ER environment and react widely with proteins localized throughout the cell.</p><p>Collectively, these features combine to make <bold>147</bold> a precision electrophile that preferentially activates the ATF6 signaling pathway without triggering other pathways activated by similar stimuli, such as the IRE1 and PERK UPR signaling pathways, the heat shock response, or the NRF2 oxidative stress response as we have shown previously by multiplex gene expression profiling, as well as by RNAseq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). ER localization enabling localized generation of electrophiles by P450s and related enzymes that selectively modify protein(s) is a potentially interesting drug development strategy. However, it is important to note that in our previous work we also found that some compounds with similar structures, notably including the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol warhead, are substantially less selective towards activating stress-responsive signaling. The small molecule <bold>132</bold>, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, activates ATF6, XBP1, and PERK stress sensors to similar extents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). Given their structural similarity, it is reasonable to expect that <bold>132</bold> is oxidized to a quinone methide followed by proteome reactivity like <bold>147</bold>. Thus, it appears that pushing reactivity too far and/or quinone methide concentration too high can result in a broader stress-responsive signaling pathway activation beyond ATF6. The PDIs that <bold>147</bold> modifies could interact with other components of the ER proteostasis network, in addition to ATF6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ryno et al., 2014</xref>). The selectivity of <bold>147</bold> likely arises from it having a lower propensity to modify the Cys-containing proteome than <bold>132</bold>, either because <bold>147</bold> is not as reactive toward protein nucleophiles, or because its quinone methide is at lower concentration, or because it is more rapidly quenched.</p><p>Pharmacologic ATF6 activation has substantial potential for ameliorating tissue-specific defects in ER proteostasis implicated in diverse diseases including systemic amyloid diseases, ischemic heart disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hetz et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Plate and Wiseman, 2017</xref>). The mechanism of action for our top pharmacologic activator <bold>147</bold> (as defined herein) suggests new potential opportunities to optimize the activity of pharmacologic ATF6 activators for specific tissues. For example, designing <bold>147</bold> analogs with selectivity for a subset of P450s provides a potential opportunity to improve compound activity in tissues specifically expressing this subset of P450s. Similarly, different tissues have different PDI compositions. Thus, improving targeting of reactive compounds for specific PDIs could improve ATF6 activating activity in tissues expressing these PDIs. Interestingly, this type of selectivity for P450s or PDIs provides a potential explanation for how other compounds identified in our original HTS that can be similarly metabolically activated to reactive compounds (e.g. <bold>263</bold>) efficiently activate ATF6 in some cell lines (e.g. HEK293T), but not in others (e.g. light chain amyloidosis patient-derived ALMC2 cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Plate et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the mechanism defined herein suggests new opportunities to selectively promote ATF6 activation in tissues of interest by further development of these compounds through medicinal chemistry efforts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Chemicals</title><p>All compounds and reagents were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Acros, Alfa Aesar, and EMD Millipore unless otherwise noted and were used without further purification.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors present an excellent follow up study to their previous <italic>eLife</italic> report (Plate et al., 2016) of a novel small molecule compound that specifically upregulates the ATF6 pathway, one of the three arms of the unfolded protein response. Because pharmacological modulation of stress pathways is a promising avenue of intervention for numerous diseases, the molecule called <bold>147</bold>, was proposed to have potential therapeutic value. However, the mechanism of activation was unclear in the previous study. In the current study, the authors took an exhaustive approach to understand how <bold>147</bold> activates the pathway. The mechanism involves the modification of <bold>147</bold> via enzymatic oxidation by cytochrome P450. Quite surprisingly, activated <bold>147</bold> then preferentially reacts with ER proteins, particularly protein disulfide isomerases (PDIs). Because PDIs are targets of the UPR and can play a role in stress regulation, the finding was intriguing but potentially troubling if <bold>147</bold> or a similar derivative is to be used as a therapeutic. However, previous work suggests that <bold>147</bold> does not cause detrimental effects to the assembly and secretion of molecules examined.</p><p>In summary, it is the consensus view of reviewers that this manuscript represents an important advancement to the previous study. The experimental designs are well conceived and experiments well performed and presented. The text is well written and remarkably approachable for a topic that might otherwise be challenging to the broad readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewer recommendation is accept with minor revisions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One of the big remaining mysteries is why <bold>147</bold> labels primarily ER proteins. This is interesting because other efforts have generated molecules that localize to the mitochondria (from P. Wipf, S. Kelley, etc.), but there is less known about ER localization. A few quick experiments might be warranted here, using existing tools. First, does <bold>147-20</bold> actually localize to the ER or is it just preferentially activated there? The experiment is a centrifugation separation of the ER compartment and a comparison of the levels of <bold>147-20</bold> in the ER and cytoplasm to measure relative enrichment. If this experiment was performed early after treatment, little covalent modification will have taken place and the ratio of enrichment might be determined. The other experiment is to understand if the P450-mediated activation to the quinone takes place under reducing conditions in vitro? One simple model is that the <bold>147</bold>reactivity is quenched by other reducing agents (glutathione) in other compartments (cytoplasm, nucleus), but the unique oxidizing environment of the ER (Birk et al., 2013, J. Cell Sci. 126:1604) allows reactivity.</p><p>2) The other interesting question is whether <bold>147</bold> treatment elevates PDIA levels through ATF6 activation over time? In other words, does the ATF6 activation lead to a shut-off of the compound activity by increasing the receptor level? In the author's previous work, I think they found that ATF6 activates PDIA4 and PDIA6 (Shoulders et al., 2013). This part of the mechanism is potentially important for the use of <bold>147</bold> in longer term treatment regimes and it might explain the relatively low toxicity.</p><p>3) The evidence for apparent selectivity of ER proteins and specifically 6 PDIs by <bold>147</bold> is convincing, and further supported by the genetic evidence using shRNA knockdown that PDIA3, PDIA4, and PDIA5 affect the <bold>147</bold>-dependent regulation of ATF6. The basis for specificity of these oxidized PDIs and perhaps other identified targets on regulation of ATF6 is not examined or much discussed. Presumably the effect of <bold>147</bold> is not due to conformational effects, i.e. causing protein damage and generation of misfolded proteins in the ER, however some of these PDIs are known to interact with calreticulin and other components of the lumen chaperone machinery. This needs to be addressed, either experimentally or minimally by a more thorough discussion as the stress signals for XBP1 and HSF1 are directly linked to increased flux of misfolded proteins. Alternatively, these data might suggest a regulatory process involving electrophile stress similar to Nrf2/Keap1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This work is an extension of studies to identify arm-selective activators of the UPR. In the prior work, a series of high throughout screens and secondary assays was used to identify compounds, including <bold>147</bold>, that activate the ATF6 pathway. Here, the authors take the next step – identifying the target and mechanism-of-action (MoA) of compound <bold>147</bold>. This is an important step because any phenotypic screen will provide active molecules, but knowledge of the target(s) and MoA is critical to utility and advancement as a chemical probe.</p><p>In this work, the authors start with an analog effort that is designed to reveal the pharmacophore. Through ~20 molecules, they quickly find that the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol is absolutely required for activity in an ATF6 reporter cell line. The NMR and full chemical characterization is included in supporting information, and the purity and identity look appropriate. One of the key findings of the SAR study was the requirement for the methyl group opposite the 2-amino phenol, which strongly suggests a quinone tautamerization (as in eugenol and acetaminophen, Figure 2—figure supplement.1). Indeed, many pieces of evidence supported this idea, including co-treatment with a P450 inhibitor or BME (Figure 2). The authors take advantage of this mechanism and the prior SAR to create an alkyne-containing Click probe (<bold>147-20</bold>) that could be used to covalently modify the relevant cellular targets (Figure 3). The authors use all the right controls in this tricky proteomics experiment, including using 5-fold excess of <bold>147</bold> as a competitor and <bold>147-4</bold> as a negative control. This effort pointed to PDIs as likely targets, among a handful of other proteins (Table 1). The enrichment of ER proteins was a big surprise to this reviewer, as there did not seem to be any structural feature of <bold>147</bold> that might cause it to localize in the ER (see below). Next, the authors perform important studies using knockdown of PDIs to show that PDIA3, PDIA4 and PDIA5 seems to be especially important in ATF6 activation (Figure 5D) and for <bold>147</bold> activity (Figure 5E), suggesting how <bold>147</bold> works through these proteins. Again, these studies are comprehensive, with transcriptional support for the mechanism.</p><p>This is an interesting study that represents a mountain of difficult work. It advances the first well-characterized inhibitors of PDIs and some of the first ATF6 activators. Finally, it is the logical next step from the previous <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript. I support publication with a handful of clarifications (below).</p><p>1) One of the big remaining mysteries is why <bold>147</bold> labels primarily ER proteins.

The authors show that <bold>147</bold> is oxidized by cytochrome P450s to generate an ER localized electrophile that reacts preferentially with a set of mostly ER-localized proteins including protein disulfide isomerases that are proposed to regulate ATF6 activity.</p><p>This is a clearly presented paper and the chemistry for specificity of <bold>147</bold> on activation of ATF6 appears thorough and well executed. The underlying chemistry of <bold>147</bold> and its use as a chemical probe is intriguing. The data show that the effects of <bold>147</bold> are essentially ER compartment specific; that other cell stress responses such as the HSR are not induced and from the proteomics data that mostly ER localized proteins are targets of <bold>147</bold>. While the logic makes sense, there is a gap in the story to understand how oxidation of specific PDIs by <bold>147</bold> leads to activation ATF6. Nevertheless, there are many aspects of this paper that are worthy of publication.</p><p>The evidence for apparent selectivity of ER proteins and specifically 6 PDIs by <bold>147</bold> is convincing, and further supported by the genetic evidence using shRNA knockdown that PDIA3, PDIA4, and PDIA5 affect the <bold>147</bold>-dependent regulation of ATF6.

We treated HEK293T cells with <bold>147</bold> for 15 minutes and separated the ER and other membranous organelles from the cytosol by using a digitonin extraction (we validated that the digitonin extraction for the most part separated the ER and cytosol by blotting the fractions for ERdj3 and HSC70. As expected, ERdj3 and Hsc70 were enriched in the membranous and cytosolic fractions of the cell, respectively; this is now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). We then used liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to quantify the amounts of <bold>147</bold> in the cytosol- and ER-containing fractions based on their peak areas by comparison with a standard curve. We found 2.1 ± 0.2 ng of <bold>147</bold> per million cells in the cytosol fraction compared to 5.6 ± 0.9 ng in the ER fraction (this is now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2B), corresponding to a ratio of 2.7 ± 0.5. Given that membranous organelles likely constitute a smaller fraction of the total volume of HEK293T cells than the cytosol (even in hepatocytes, membranous organelles are about only 40% of the total cell volume compared to 55% for the cytosol), this likely represents a lower limit for this ratio. This preference is likely due to the hydrophobicity of <bold>147</bold> (estimated logP = 3.35, where “P” is the octanol/water partition coefficient; see Plate et al., 2016), which would lead to its sequestration in the membranes that surround organelles like the ER.</p><p>This result suggests that the selectivity of <bold>147</bold> for ER-resident proteins is at least in part the result of its higher concentration in the ER. It is additionally true that the cytochrome P450s that most likely convert <bold>147</bold> to <bold>147-QM</bold> (the quinone methide) reside in the ER membrane. Moreover, as the reviewer notes, the reducing environment of the cytosol would tend to decrease the lifetime of <bold>147-QM</bold> relative to its lifetime in the oxidizing environment of the ER, thereby diminishing the extent of protein modification in the cytosol. We believe that all of these factors probably contribute to the preference of <bold>147</bold> to modify ER-resident proteins.</p><p>We have added the following paragraphs to the Results section to reflect these findings:</p><p>“To further explore the origins of the selectivity of <bold>147</bold> and its analogs for modifying ER proteins, we sought to determine whether <bold>147</bold> preferentially partitions to the ER. […] The combination of these factors likely drives the preference of <bold>147</bold> to selectively react with ER-resident proteins.”</p><p>In addition, we have edited the Discussion section to read as follows:</p><p>“A remarkable aspect of this mechanism of pharmacologic ATF6 activation is the preferential covalent modification of proteins localized to the ER by <bold>147</bold>. […] This is especially true in the cytosol, in which <bold>147-QM</bold> likely has a shorter lifetime than in the ER because of the cytosol’s more reducing environment.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The other interesting question is whether <bold>147</bold> treatment elevates PDIA levels through ATF6 activation over time? In other words, does the ATF6 activation lead to a shut-off of the compound activity by increasing the receptor level? In the author's previous work, I think they found that ATF6 activates PDIA4 and PDIA6 (Shoulders et al., 2013). This part of the mechanism is potentially important for the use of <bold>147</bold> in longer term treatment regimes and it might explain the relatively low toxicity.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the duration of ATF6 induction by <bold>147</bold> is an interesting question. As the reviewer notes, several of the targets of <bold>147</bold> are also induced by <bold>147</bold>-mediated ATF6 activation. However, <bold>147</bold> has been used in experiments in which it was shown that <bold>147</bold>-mediated ATF6 activation could suppress stem cell pluripotency, enhance differentiation, and direct mesodermal cell fate (Kroeger et al., 2018). These results required dosing cells daily with <bold>147</bold> over a period of weeks, suggesting that the induction of PDIs does not lead to a shut-off of the activity of <bold>147</bold>. In unpublished murine studies with dosing at 48 h intervals, we also did not observe attenuation of the activity of <bold>147</bold>.</p><p>We have added the following paragraph to the Results subsection “shRNA-depletion of PDIs perturbs <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation” to raise this issue and describe our results:</p><p>“The notion that <bold>147</bold> acts through modification of PDIs, some of which are in turn upregulated by <bold>147</bold>-mediated ATF6 activation (especially PDIA4, and to a lesser extent PDIA1 and PDIA3) (Plate et al., 2016) raises the question of whether the increased levels of PDIs could diminish the efficacy of <bold>147</bold> as time goes on. […] Thus, while the potential for increased PDI levels to suppress <bold>147</bold>-dependent ATF6 activation offers an interesting mechanism to modulate <bold>147</bold> activity, further studies will be required to elucidate whether such a negative feedback mechanism is operating.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The evidence for apparent selectivity of ER proteins and specifically 6 PDIs by <bold>147</bold> is convincing, and further supported by the genetic evidence using shRNA knockdown that PDIA3, PDIA4, and PDIA5 affect the <bold>147</bold>-dependent regulation of ATF6. The basis for specificity of these oxidized PDIs and perhaps other identified targets on regulation of ATF6 is not examined or much discussed. Presumably the effect of <bold>147</bold> is not due to conformational effects, i.e. causing protein damage and generation of misfolded proteins in the ER, however some of these PDIs are known to interact with calreticulin and other components of the lumen chaperone machinery. This needs to be addressed, either experimentally or minimally by a more thorough discussion as the stress signals for XBP1 and HSF1 are directly linked to increased flux of misfolded proteins. Alternatively, these data might suggest a regulatory process involving electrophile stress similar to Nrf2/Keap1.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s point is well taken. While we have shown by multiplex gene expression profiling, as well as by RNA-seq, that <bold>147</bold> does not broadly induce stress-responsive signaling by the stress sensors XBP1, HSF1 or NRF2, we have also found some compounds with structures similar to <bold>147</bold>, notably including the 2-amino-<italic>p</italic>-cresol warhead, that are substantially less selective. The small molecule <bold>132</bold>, shown in Figure 5—figure supplement 2, activates ATF6, XBP1, and PERK targets to similar extents. Given their structural similarity, it is reasonable to expect that <bold>132</bold> acts by a similar mechanism as <bold>147</bold>; that is, by oxidation to a quinone methide followed by covalent protein modification. Thus, it appears that pushing reactivity too far and/or QM concentration too high can result in a broader stress-responsive signaling pathway activation beyond ATF6. As the reviewer suggests, the PDIs that <bold>147</bold> modifies could interact with other components of the ER proteostasis network in addition to ATF6. The selectivity of <bold>147</bold> likely arises from it having a lower propensity to modify the Cys-containing proteome than <bold>132</bold>, either because <bold>147</bold> is not as reactive toward protein nucleophiles, or because its QM is at lower concentration, or because it is more rapidly quenched.</p><p>We have modified the Discussion on as follows to address this issue:</p><p>“Collectively, these features combine to make <bold>147</bold> a precision electrophile that preferentially activates the ATF6 signaling pathway without triggering other pathways activated by similar stimuli, such as the IRE1 and PERK UPR signaling pathways, the heat shock response, or the NRF2 oxidative stress response as we have shown previously by multiplex gene expression profiling, as well as by RNA-seq (Plate et al., 2016). […] The selectivity of <bold>147</bold> likely arises from it having a lower propensity to modify the Cys-containing proteome than <bold>132</bold>, either because <bold>147</bold> is not as reactive toward protein nucleophiles, or because its quinone methide is at lower concentration, or because it is more rapidly quenched.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
