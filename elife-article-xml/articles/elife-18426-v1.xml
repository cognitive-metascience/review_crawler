Previous experiments revealed input-specific differences in α1 and α2 subunit densities in perisomatic synapses, suggesting distinct IPSC decay kinetics. However, IPSC decays evoked by axo-axonic, parvalbumin- or cholecystokinin-expressing basket cells were found to be similar. Using replica immunogold labeling, here we show that all CA1 PC somatic and AIS synapses contain the α1, α2, β1, β2, β3 and γ2 subunits. In CA3 PCs, 90% of the perisomatic synapses are immunopositive for the α1 subunit and all synapses are positive for the remaining five subunits. Somatic synapses form unimodal distributions based on their immunoreactivity for these subunits. The α2 subunit densities in somatic synapses facing Cav2.1 (i.e. parvalbumin) or Cav2.2 (cholecystokinin) positive presynaptic active zones are comparable. We conclude that perisomatic synapses made by three distinct interneuron types have similar GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit content.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18426.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18426.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>replica labeling</kwd><kwd>immunohistochemistry</kwd><kwd>GABA</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>293681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003825</institution-id><institution>Magyar Tudományos Akadémia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LP2012-29</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nusser</surname><given-names>Zoltan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>All perisomatic GABAergic synpases on hippocampal pyramidal cells have a similar GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunit composition.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A salient feature of cortical microcircuits is the presence of distinct types of GABA-releasing interneurons (INs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Freund and Buzsáki, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Somogyi and Klausberger, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ascoli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krook-Magnuson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">DeFelipe et al., 2013</xref>). Decades of extensive research revealed dozens of different IN types based on their developmental origin, dendritic and axonal arborization, postsynaptic targets and gene expression profiles. Recent in vivo electrophysiological, imaging and optogenetic studies demonstrated that distinct IN types play unique roles in memory formation and retrieval, network oscillations and sensory perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lovett-Barron et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varga et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kepecs and Fishell, 2014</xref>). It is not surprising that a distal dendrite-innervating IN has a different role compared to one with axons synapsing on pyramidal cell (PC) somata. However, there are multiple types of INs that innervate the perisomatic region of PCs (axo-axonic cell (AAC), parvalbumin- (PV<sup>+</sup>) and cholecystokinin-expressing (CCK<sup>+</sup>) basket cells), yet participate in distinct network computations as inferred from their differential firing during oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klausberger et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Varga et al., 2012</xref>). For example, hippocampal PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells receive similar excitatory inputs and provide their output to the same subcellular domains of PCs (somata and proximal dendrites), but fire in different phases of theta oscillations, and only PV<sup>+</sup> cells are active during sharp wave-associated ripples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klausberger et al., 2005</xref>). To achieve this, they must utilize different molecular machinery for integrating their synaptic inputs, generating their action potential outputs and releasing GABA. An elegant example of their molecular specialization is that the release of GABA from the axon terminals of CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells is mediated by Cav2.2 voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and is under the control of CB1 cannabinoid receptors. In contrast, the release of GABA from PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells is exclusively mediated by Cav2.1 channels and is regulated by m2 muscarinic and μ opiate receptors (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Freund and Katona, 2007</xref>). An even more intriguing molecular specialization was suggested based on high-resolution postembedding immunogold localization of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). It was shown that PC somatic synapses facing PV<sup>+</sup> axon terminals contain mainly α1 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klausberger et al., 2002</xref>) whereas somatic synapses opposite to CCK<sup>+</sup> boutons and AIS synapses predominantly contain GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs incorporating the α2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fritschy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nyiri et al., 2001</xref>). Such a presynaptic input-specific distribution of distinct postsynaptic receptor types held a great potential for the selective pharmacological manipulation of cortical networks in various psychiatric disorders (e.g. schizophrenia or anxiety; reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rudolph and Mohler, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with distinct subunit compositions confer different decay kinetics to the postsynaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verdoorn et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tia et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lavoie et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vicini, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bianchi et al., 2001</xref>). The decay time of IPSCs mediated by α2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is 3–4-times slower compared to that of IPSCs mediated by α1 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eyre et al., 2012</xref>). These results predict that AAC and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cell-evoked IPSCs should have decay times several fold slower compared to the ones evoked by PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells. However, this is in contrast with the rather uniform decays of fast rising (likely perisomatic) spontaneous IPSCs recorded from PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nusser et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabo et al. (2010)</xref> provided direct evidence for the similar decays of unitary IPSCs evoked by AAC, PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells in CA3 PCs. In addition, using genetically modified animals, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heistek et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that fast-spiking, PV<sup>+</sup> basket cells activate α2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in CA3 PCs. It is not only these functional studies that have indicated the lack of segregation of α1 and α2 subunit-dominant GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to distinct somatic synapses, as two recent studies using highly sensitive immunohistochemical approaches have also shown the presence of α1 and α2 subunits in all perisomatic synapses without any indication of multiple synapse populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasugai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panzanelli et al., 2011</xref>). However, from the presence of two unimodal distributions, a negative correlation between these two α subunits cannot be excluded; i.e. synapses that contain many α1 subunits could have few α2 subunits, and vice versa. Furthermore, almost nothing is known about the quantitative relationship between different β subunits in PC somatic and AIS synapses, although different β subunit isoforms were shown to be responsible for the polarized distribution of recombinant GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Connolly et al., 1996</xref>). Furthermore, the β2 subunit has a critical role in a form of inhibitory synaptic plasticity observed at a cerebellar synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">He et al., 2015</xref>), demonstrating its crucial involvement in setting the synaptic strength.</p><p>Using the highly sensitive, electron microscopy (EM) face-matched sodium dodecyl sulphate-digested freeze-fracture replica immunolabeling technique (SDS-FRL; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hagiwara et al., 2005</xref>), here we quantitatively analyzed the relative abundance of two α, three β and a γ subunit isoforms in hippocampal CA1 and CA3 PC AIS and somatic synapses to reveal the subunit composition of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in three types of perisomatic region-targeting IN synapses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs fracture to both faces of the plasma membrane</title><p>The basic principle of SDS-FRL is that following random fracturing of frozen tissue, the fracturing plane often crosses the lipid bilayer of plasma membranes with transmembrane proteins remaining either in the protoplasmic (P-face) or extracellular (E-face) half of the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fujimoto, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rash et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Masugi-Tokita and Shigemoto, 2007</xref>). Carbon-platinum-carbon coating of the surfaces stabilizes the phospholipids and transmembrane proteins in the replica, allowing their visualization with specific antibodies. If an antibody recognizes intracellular epitope(s), specific immunolabeling will be detected in the P-face of the membrane, whereas extracellular epitopes will be visualized on the E-face. The most widely used application of SDS-FRL is to perform quantitative comparisons between distinct subcellular compartments. However, the most straightforward interpretation of the results (i.e. twice as many gold particles reflects twice as many proteins) is based on an assumption that has not been tested: If one compartment (e.g. synapse ‘X’) contains twice as many gold particles than another one (e.g. synapse ‘Y’), the possibility that this is the consequence of a larger fraction of the protein fracturing to the appropriate membrane, and not a difference in the density of the protein, has not been excluded. For example, two synapses could have an identical receptor density, but if 80% of the synaptic receptors fractured to the P-face in synapse ‘X’, but only 40% in synapse ‘Y’, SDS-FRL would result in twice as many gold particles in the P-face of synapse ‘X’, leading to an erroneous interpretation that synapse ‘X’ has more receptors. However, at the same time, an antibody that recognizes an epitope on the opposite side (E-face) would label the synapse ‘Y’ with 3-times as many gold particles as synapse ‘X’ (60% versus 20%), resulting in a negative correlation between the labels obtained in E- and P-faces.</p><p>As a prelude to our main experiments, we assessed the fracturing properties of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R γ2 subunit in hippocampal CA1 PC somatic synapses using the face-matched mirror replica labeling method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). Somatic P-face membrane areas with high intramembrane particle (IMP) densities contained a large number of gold particles labeled with an anti-γ2<sub>(Rb; aa319-366)</sub> antibody. The complementary E-face membranes also contained many gold particles labeled with an anti-γ2 antibody recognizing an extracellular epitope (γ2<sub>(Rb; aa39-67)</sub>). Gold particle numbers on both faces strongly and significantly correlated with the synaptic areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), consistent with the results of many previous studies. Importantly, we found a strong positive correlation between P- and E-face gold particle numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), demonstrating that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs fracture to both faces of the plasma membrane and the synapse-to-synapse variability in gold particle number is not the consequence of synapse-to-synapse variability in fracturing to E- and P-faces. Thus, for proteins where antibodies against both intra- and extracellular epitopes are not available (i.e. the vast majority of proteins), quantitative comparisons between different subcellular compartments can be reliably made with a single antibody.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18426.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors fracture to both sides of the plasma membrane.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Face-matched mirror replica image of a CA1 pyramidal cell (PC) soma containing two GABAergic synapses identified on the P-face by an antibody directed against an intracellular epitope (<bold>A</bold>) and on the E-face by an antibody recognizing an extracellular epitope (<bold>B</bold>) of the γ2 subunit.

PC somata can be easily identified in replicas as large triangular cell bodies located in a band corresponding to the <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>. In contrast, fractured plasma membranes of AISs cannot be recognized based on their position within the replicas or on morphological criteria, requiring their molecular identification. Thus, throughout the study, we used immunoreactions for Nav1.6 or Kv1.1 subunits and defined a membrane as an AIS if it was either Nav1.6 or Kv1.1 immunopositive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kirizs et al., 2014</xref>). To avoid complications arising from potential competition between different antibodies on the same replica, the mirror replica method was used for the co-localization of the γ2 subunit and neuroligin-2 (NL-2), a GABAergic synapse-specific cell adhesion molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Immunogold particles for NL-2 were clustered over small areas of somatic and AIS P-face membranes that contained a high density of IMPs, characteristic of GABAergic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasugai et al., 2010</xref>). The complementary E-face membrane areas always contained many gold particles labeling for the γ2 subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–D</xref>). When the γ2 subunit-immunoreacted replica was searched and somatic and AIS areas with strong γ2 subunit labeling were found, the corresponding areas on the opposite replica were always immunopositive for NL-2. The distributions of somatic and AIS synapses of both CA3 and CA1 PCs are unimodal based on their NL-2 and γ2 subunit content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2H,I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3H,I</xref>), indicating the lack of multiple synapse populations. The number of gold particles for both NL-2 and the γ2 subunit in AIS and somatic synapses shows a positive correlation with the synaptic area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E,F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3E,F</xref>), demonstrating that the main source of variability in the postsynaptic receptor number is the variance in the synaptic area. There was large variability in the area of AIS and somatic synapses (CA3 AIS: CV = 0.6, n = 161; CA1 AIS: CV = 0.4, n = 164; CA3 soma: CV = 0.7, n = 1105; CA1 soma: CV = 0.7, n = 767). Statistical comparisons of the four compartments revealed that CA1 AIS synapses are significantly smaller than CA1 somatic and CA3 AIS synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L</xref>). Finally, we found positive correlations between the number of gold particles for the γ2 subunit and NL-2 in individual AIS and somatic synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3G</xref>). Comparisons of NL-2 densities between CA3 and CA1 PC AIS and somatic synapses showed no significant differences (for normalization see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). In contrast, we found that normalized γ2 subunit densities were significantly higher in CA3 and CA1 AIS synapses than in somatic synapses of both regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>). These results demonstrate that all GABAergic synapses on the soma and AIS of both CA1 and CA3 PCs contain the γ2 subunit and NL-2, enabling their use as GABAergic synapse-specific markers.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18426.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Identification of axon initial segment (AIS) and somatic GABAergic synapses in CA3 PCs using replica immunolabeling.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mirror replica image of an AIS identified by immungold labeling for the Nav1.6 subunit (15 nm gold) on the P-face.

Tissue prepared from very mildly-fixed rat brains showed robust and punctate immunolabeling for both NL-2 and the γ2 subunit in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> illustrates reactions in the CA3 region). Strongly immunoreactive puncta surrounded PC somata and ankyrin-G-labeled AISs. Qualitative evaluation of our reactions revealed that apparently all clusters were immunopositive for both NL-2 and the γ2 subunit, consistent with our SDS-FRL results. AISs were strongly and dominantly demarcated by immunoreactive puncta for both of these molecules, allowing their use for identifying AISs. Co-localization of the α1 and γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>) and α2 and γ2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>) subunits revealed that both PC somata and AISs are surrounded by relatively weak immunopositive puncta for the α1 subunit and much stronger puncta for the α2 subunit. We noted that despite the very robust demarcation of PC AISs by α2 subunit-immunopositive clusters, all perisomatic synapses were also labeled for the α2 subunit. Antibodies against the β1, β2 and β3 subunits in low-pH fixed tissue visualized strongly immunopositive clusters that delineated the AISs and surrounded the somata of PCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D–F</xref>). These clusters were extensively co-localized with the γ2 subunit or NL-2, indicating their synaptic nature. Immunofluorescent labeling of the six major GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits with a low-pH-based fixation protocol revealed the presence of α1, α2, β1, β2, β3, and γ2 subunits in virtually all AIS and somatic synapses of the CA3 region, consistent with the EM SDS-FRL results.

Our results demonstrate that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs fracture to both P- and E-face membrane halves, allowing the quantitative comparison of immunogold signals obtained with a single antibody that labels on either side of the membrane. We found that all CA1 PC somatic and AIS synapses contain the α1, α2, β1, β2, β3 and γ2 subunits along with NL-2. More than 90% of CA3 PC perisomatic synapses are immunopositive for the α1 subunit, and all somatic and AIS synapses are positive for all other subunits examined. Somatic synapses formed unimodal distributions based on their GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit and NL-2 content, suggesting the lack of two distinct somatic synapse populations. Finally, we have provided direct evidence for similar α2 subunit densities in synaptic membrane fragments facing Cav2.1<sup>+</sup> (PV) or Cav2.2<sup>+</sup> (CCK) AZs in PC somata.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Similar GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit composition of AIS and somatic synapses of hippocampal PCs</title><p>Our quantitative SDS-FRL experiments revealed that the subunit composition of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in somatic and AIS synapses is very similar in both CA1 and CA3 PCs. In agreement with our ultrastructural data, LM immunofluorescent localization of the six GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in low-pH-fixed tissue also revealed that all examined subunits form clusters around PC somata and delineate the AISs. This is consistent with the results of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Panzanelli et al. (2011)</xref> showing the presence of α1 and α2 subunits in both AIS and somatic synapses. However, the presence of every examined subunit in both somatic and AIS synapses does not mean that all synapses contain these subunits at the same density. The relative abundance of a synaptic receptor cannot be easily determined using diffraction-limited LM, and therefore we refrained from quantitative analysis of our fluorescent reactions. In contrast, the SDS-FRL allows the direct quantitative comparison of surface densities between different subcellular compartments. Our quantitative results revealed very similar densities of NL-2 and α1 subunit in somatic and AIS synapses of both CA3 and CA1 regions, but higher α2 and γ2 subunit densities in AIS compared to somatic synapses of CA1 PCs.</p><p>Why did several studies conclude that AIS synapses primarily harbor the α2 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fritschy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Loup et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cruz et al., 2003</xref>)? Prominent demarcation of AISs with α2 subunit-immunopositive clusters is found in many brain regions, including the CA3 area of the hippocampus and in layer 2/3 and 5 PCs of several cortical areas. The demarcation of the AISs in a fluorescent reaction is the consequence of the density of GABAergic synapses on AISs; the larger the synapse density is, the more delineated the AISs will appear. In addition, the strength of a fluorescent synaptic cluster is determined by the density of the receptors and the size of the synapse. The fact that CA3 AISs appear strongly demarcated for the α2 subunit, which has similar densities in somatic and AIS synapses, indicates that the larger synaptic size and the large synaptic coverage of AISs are primarily responsible for their apparent predominance for α2 subunit labeling. Our results presented here also show that the prominent demarcation of CA3 PC AISs is not a unique feature of the α2 subunit, but is also evident for NL-2, β1, β3 and γ2 subunits.</p><p>The similar postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunits in AIS and somatic synapses indicate that AAC- and basket cell-evoked IPSCs should have similar decay kinetics. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabo et al. (2010)</xref> compared the decay times of IPSCs evoked by PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells and AACs and found that the AAC-evoked postsynaptic response had a slower decay. However, based on the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Overstreet and Westbrook (2003)</xref>, demonstrating extensive spillover between the axon terminals of AACs that slows IPSCs, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabo et al. (2010)</xref> examined the decay of AAC-evoked IPSCs under low release probability conditions where no spillover is expected and found similar decay times of AAC- and basket cell-evoked IPSCs. All of these results are consistent with the notion that AAC and basket cell activate GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with similar subunit composition on their postsynaptic PCs, predicting similar postsynaptic regulation and pharmacological properties.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Similar α2 subunit densities in somatic synapses established by PV<sup>+</sup> or CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells</title><p>The presynaptic partners of GABAergic synapses on PC somata are either PV<sup>+</sup> or CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cell axon terminals. The proposed segregation of α1 and α2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs to synapses established by PV<sup>+</sup> and CCK<sup>+</sup> basket cells, respectively, comprises one of the most remarkable molecular specializations of synapses that are within the same subcellular compartment separated by only a few microns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nyiri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klausberger et al., 2002</xref>). Such a segregation would imply different decay kinetics to the IPSCs, which were not seen using paired recordings between identified basket cells and CA3 PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Szabo et al., 2010</xref>). Using transgenic animals with a point mutation rendering the α2 subunit insensitive to benzodiazepines, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heistek et al. (2013)</xref> demonstrated that fast-spiking (PV<sup>+</sup>) basket cells activate α2 subunit-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in CA3 PCs. These results, taken together with our quantitative EM data showing similar α2 subunit densities in the two basket cell synapse populations, point towards a similar subunit composition of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in these functionally distinct somatic synapse populations.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Variability in the ratio of GABA<sub>A</sub>R α subunit isoforms in different neurons</title><p>Most central neurons express multiple GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pirker et al., 2000</xref>) and their individual synapses contain many different subunits. A study from our laboratory demonstrated that external tufted cells of the main olfactory bulb express the α1 and α3 subunits and display small synapse-to-synapse, but large cell-to-cell variability in the α1:α3 ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eyre et al., 2012</xref>). Consistent with this, the decay kinetics of IPSCs recorded from tufted cells have small within-cell, but large cell-to-cell variability. Here, we found that hippocampal PCs exhibit moderate synapse-to-synapse, but small cell-to-cell variability in the α1:α2. This is in agreement with the very small cell-to-cell variability in mIPSC decay times recorded from PCs. Thus, our analysis of the ratios of two α subunits in two cell types demonstrate that distinct neuronal types use unique strategies for expressing multiple synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R α subunit isoforms with either a variable or constant ratio from synapse-to-synapse and cell-to-cell, allowing them to fulfill individual cellular requirements in network dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Technical considerations</title><p>The discrepancy between results acquired with postembedding immunogold localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nusser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nyiri et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klausberger et al., 2002</xref>) and those obtained with SDS-FRL (this study and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasugai et al., 2010</xref>) might lie in the difference in the sensitivity of the two methods. The highest labeling efficiency of the postembedding immunogold method for AMPA and GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs localization was estimated to be around 30–40% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nusser et al., 1997</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">1998</xref>), but it could be as high as 90–100% with SDS-FRL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tanaka et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lorincz and Nusser, 2010</xref>). The density of functional GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs was estimated to be ~1200 receptors per µm<sup>2</sup> in cerebellar stellate cell synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nusser et al., 1997</xref>). Our face-matched mirror replica labeling for the γ2 subunit revealed around 800 gold / μm<sup>2</sup> on the E- and 250 gold / μm<sup>2</sup> on the P-face, resulting in ~1050 gold in every μm<sup>2</sup> of postsynaptic membrane. If a similar GABA<sub>A</sub>R density characterizes hippocampal perisomatic synapses to that found in cerebellar stellate cells, an almost 90% labeling efficiency can be calculated in our best reactions. Thus, SDS-FRL has a superior sensitivity compared to postembedding labeling, the only other localization technique that allows the visualization of receptors and ion channels embedded in dense protein matrices found in e.g. postsynaptic membranes or AISs. Increasing the sensitivity of a localization method results in the disappearance of negative synapses if their negativity was the consequence of a low protein content and not the lack of the protein. It is important to emphasize that even with SDS-FRL, some of the synapses could remain immunonegative (e.g. some of the CA3 PC perisomatic synapses were apparently negative for the α1 subunit) and it is erroneous to conclude that their negativity means the lack of the examined protein just because this technique with certain antibodies yields a labeling efficiency close to 100%. The fact that &gt;99% of synapses are immunopositive in CA1 PCs, where the overall density of the α1 subunit is &gt;2 fold larger than in CA3 PCs, indicates that the 10% immunonegativity of the CA3 synapses is probably due to low subunit densities and not the lack of the subunit. Concluding the lack of a protein in a subcellular compartment with any immunolocalization technique requires a labeling efficiency close to 100% and this needs to be determined for each antibody.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with the Hungarian Act of Animal Care and Experimentation (1998, XXVIII, section 243/1998) and with the ethical guidelines of the Institute of Experimental Medicine Protection of Research Subjects Committee.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fluorescent immunohistochemistry</title><p>Three adult male Wistar rats were anaesthetized with isoflurane and ketamine, then transcardially perfused with a fixative containing 1% paraformaldehyde (PFA) in 0.1 M Na-acetate buffer for 13 min. 70 µm coronal section were cut with a Vibratome and were washed in phosphate buffer (PB).

Raw density values are shown whenever quantification was made only in one rat (immunogold labeling for β subunits), or when the reactions were not different between rats, and hence they could be pooled for statistical comparisons (i.e. α2 density measurement in identified synapses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; p&gt;0.0125, after Bonferroni correction following Mann-Whitney tests for pair-wise comparison of α2 density values in four compartments for two rats: identified (Cav2.1<sup>+</sup> and Cav2.2<sup>+</sup>) and unidentified synapses, and E-face background labeling). The α1 versus α2 density ratios (α1:α2) were calculated by dividing normalized α1 and α2 density values of individual synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>All statistical comparisons were made with Statistica11 software (Scientific Computing). Normality of sample distribution was assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. For correlation analyses the Spearman’s rank order correlation was used as most of the samples were not normally distributed. Statistical significance was assessed with the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni correction, or the Kruskal-Wallis test followed by <italic>post hoc</italic> multiple comparisons of mean ranks for all groups. Significance was taken at p&lt;0.05 (*), p&lt;0.01 (**) or p&lt;0.001 (***). Medians and lower (Q<sub>1</sub>) and upper quartiles (Q<sub>3</sub>) were used to describe distributions throughout the manuscript.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Specificity of the immunoreactions</title><p>Specificity of immunogold labeling for the α1, α2 and γ2 subunits was verified by using two antibodies directed against different epitopes of the same protein. Similar labeling patterns were obtained with a rabbit anti-α1 (α1<sub>(Rb; aa1-9)</sub>) and a mouse anti-α1 (α1<sub>(Mo; aa28-43)</sub>) antibody, indicating the specificity of the reaction. Mirror replica labeling was used to assess the specificity of our α2 and γ2 labeling, by using antibodies directed against an extracellular and an intracellular epitope. We observe similar gold particle labeling patterns with a rabbit anti-α2 antibody (α2<sub>(Rb; aa322-357)</sub>) on the P-face compared to that obtained with a guinea-pig anti-α2 antibody (α2<sub>(Gp; aa1-9)</sub>) on the E-face. Our γ2 labeling on the E-face, obtained with a rabbit antibody (γ2<sub>(Rb, aa39-67)</sub>), was very similar to the immunogold labeling seen on the P-face with a rabbit anti-γ2 antibody (γ2<sub>(Rb, aa319-366)</sub>), recognizing an intracellular epitope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>). We could not purchase anti-β subunit antibodies raised against different epitopes, and therefore we could not test the specificity of the labeling using two antibodies. However, we performed SDS-FRL immunogold labeling for the β1 and β2 subunits in brain areas and nerve cells where the genes of these subunits are not expressed (e.g. cerebellar Purkinje cells, and medial habenula neurons), and observe very few gold particles labeling for β1 or β2 subunits in GABAergic synapses (zero or 1–3 gold particles / synapse; data not shown). These results indicate that our immunogold labeling for the β1 (β1<sub>(Gp; aa342-430)</sub>) and β2 (β2<sub>(Gp; aa343-430)</sub>) subunits in hippocampal perisomatic synapses is probably due to specific antibody-protein interactions. We observed a similar labeling pattern with our guinea-pig anti-β3 antibody (β3<sub>(Gp; aa344-429)</sub>) to that published by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasugai et al. (2010)</xref> with a different antibody against the β3 subunit, the specificity of which was proven in β3<sup>-/-</sup> mice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>ZN is the recipient of a Hungarian Academy of Sciences Momentum Grant (Lendület, LP2012-29) and a European Research Council Advanced Grant (293681).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom, Marlene Bartos, is a member of our Board or reviewing Editors, and another is Huibert D. Mansvelder (Reviewer #2). The evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The Reviewing Editor and two reviewers considered your work as a thorough and high quality quantification of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subunits expressed at synapses on soma and axon initial segments of hippocampal pyramidal cells, which provides a decisive answer to the apparent controversy reported in previous studies. The data were judged as highly convincing and the conclusions are supported by the data. However, the reviewers raised several concerns that require your attention.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A-D</xref>: from the images displayed it appears there are many more particles (IMP) in the p-face than in the e-face images, which is particularly apparent in C and D. What the nature of these particles is, is not clear, but a subset of them are GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. Given the unequal distribution of particles between p-face and e-face, GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs could hypothetically also be unequally distributed between the two faces. If the two antibodies used to recognize the intracellular and the extracellular epitopes have different efficacy in labeling GABA-R γ2 subunits, e.g. different affinities, this could results in a unequal number of gold particles visible in both images. This would jeopardize the validity of the conclusion that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs equally end up in the p-face and e-face. What evidence do the authors have to show that the two antibodies have similar labeling efficacy?</p><p>2) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that CA3 synapses are more often devoid of α1 subunits, whereas CΑ1 synapses always contain α1 subunits. Are these α2 dominated synapses without α1 subunits on CA3 pyramidal cells preferentially in synpases made by PV+ interneurons, as is suggested in the literature (e.g. Heistek et al., 2013)? Why was the synapse-type analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> using Cav2.1+ (PV) or Cav2.2+ (CCK) only done in CA1 and not in CA3?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: From the distributions in panel E it seems there could be a difference in distribution of the α1:α2 ratios between CA1 and CA3 synapses.

The variance around an imaginative regression line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> is likely to be the consequence of some randomness in fracturing.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> we show that there are twice as many gold particles in the E- compared to the P-face of the synapses. This could be the consequence of a similar labeling efficacy and twice as many GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs on the E-face of the synapses, or similar number of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs on both faces with a higher labeling efficacy with our antibody that labels the E-face, or the combination of both. There is no way we can distinguish between these possibilities. It would be interesting to know this, but we believe that this is not the most important point. The most important point is the positive correlation between the signals obtained on E- and P-faces, demonstrating that if there are lots of gold particles on one side, then there will be many gold particles on the other side as well.</p><p> <italic>2) The data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that CA3 synapses are more often devoid of α1 subunits, whereas CA1 synapses always contain α1 subunits.

From these experiments, it is impossible to tell whether these low α1-containing synapses face PV<sup>+</sup> or CCK<sup>+</sup> axon terminals. In our original version, we restricted our detailed analysis of the α2 subunit in Cav2.1- or Cav2.2-positive synapses to the CA1 area because the previous studies were all performed in this subregion (Nyiri et al., 2001; Klausberger et al., 2002) and because collecting such synapses is extremely challenging. Based on the suggestion of the reviewers, we have performed the same analysis now in the CA3 area and included our data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>. The results in the CA3 area are consistent with our data obtained in the CA1 area. We have described our new results in the Results section, subsection “Somatic synapses established by PV+ and CCK<sup>+</sup> axon terminals have similar α2 subunit densities”.</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>: From the distributions in panel E it seems there could be a difference in distribution of the α1:α2 ratios between CA1 and CA3 synapses. From the text on page 12 describing the results of these data, it was not clear what exactly was compared. It reads &quot;However, our analysis revealed a lack of significant difference between the α1:α2 in AIS and somatic synapses in the CA1 (p = 0.347, Kruskal-Wallis test, followed by multiple comparisons of mean ranks) and CA3 (p = 0.053) regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>)&quot;. This suggests that soma and AIS were compared in the areas separately. Were the α1:α2 ratio distributions statistically different between CA1 and CA3 synapses (similar to the analysis done for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4G</xref>)?</italic> </p><p>We regret that description of our results was not clear. The α1:α2 density ratios in AIS and somatic synapses in both CA1 and CA3 regions were compared using the non-parametric Kruskall-Wallis test (p &lt; 0.001), followed by multiple comparisons of mean ranks <italic>post-hoc</italic> test of the four compartments. The α1:α2 ratio was significantly lower in CA3 AIS compared to CA1 somatic synapses (p = 0.026), and in CA3 somatic synapses compared to CA1 AIS (p = 0.001) and CA1 somatic synapses (p &lt; 0.001). But no significant difference was found in the α1:α2 ratios in AIS vs. somatic synapses in both CA1 (p = 0.347) and CA3 regions (p = 0.053).</p><p>In this paragraph we aimed at providing a comparison of somatic vs. AIS synapses, therefore we refrained from the detailed description of the statistical results obtained after multiple comparisons between compartments of different hippocampal areas. This would not add additional information to the main argument of the paragraph showing the lack of significant difference in α1:α2 ratios between AIS and somatic synapses (i.e. similar α1:α2 variability).</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>: there is a strong difference in the pattern of α1 and α2 subunits expression in panel C and D. The conclusion from these light microscopy data could be that the EM data may not resemble the light microscopy data, in particular for the α1 and α2 subunits. The lack of quantification of these data does not facilitate interpretation. Perhaps if similar immunostaining at the light microscopy level for CA1 were shown as well, they would be more convincing and show a similar distribution for α1 and α2 subunits.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers are correct in pointing out that the results of the LM immunofluorescent reactions are difficult to compare to the quantitative data obtained with replica labeling. However, we believe that our LM data is qualitatively consistent with the EM quantification. For example, AIS synapses are all immunopositive for the α1 subunit, although the intensity of the clusters are substantially weaker compared to those labeled for the α2, β1, β3 or γ2 subunits. This is also true for most somatic synapses. There are many reasons why we refrain from performing quantification of the LM reactions. One of the main reasons is the variability in the results depending on the fine details of the tissue preparation (e.g. antigen retrieval, the used fixative).</p><p> <italic>5) How confident are the authors that all immunogold-labeled GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs subunits are part of functional receptors? This should be discussed.</italic> </p><p>This is a fundamental question that generally applies to all immunolocalization experiments. The possibility can never be excluded that some of the proteins are in an ‘inactive’ state and they contribute to the immunosignal without adding to the function. There are studies (Nusser, Neuron, 1997; Tanaka, J Neurosci, 2005; Lorincz, Science, 2010), however, showing correlations between the number of channels/receptors as determined with EM immunogold methods and with functional approaches. Such correlations would only occur if either all receptors/channels were active or a fix proportion of them were inactive. In either case, the results of the immunolocalization experiments showing relative differences in receptor densities between distinct synapses would hold predictive power to function.</p><p> <italic>6) The abstract does not reflect all major findings.
