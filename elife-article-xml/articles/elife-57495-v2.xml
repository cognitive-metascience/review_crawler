Utilizing autofluorescence (AF) as a discriminating parameter, we identified two novel microglia subsets in both mice and non-human primates, termed autofluorescence-positive (AF<sup>+</sup>) and negative (AF<sup>−</sup>). While their proportion remained constant throughout most adult life, the AF signal linearly and specifically increased in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia with age and correlated with a commensurate increase in size and complexity of lysosomal storage bodies, as detected by transmission electron microscopy and LAMP1 levels. Post-depletion repopulation kinetics revealed AF<sup>−</sup> cells as likely precursors of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia. At the molecular level, the proteome of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia showed overrepresentation of endolysosomal, autophagic, catabolic, and mTOR-related proteins. Mimicking the effect of advanced aging, genetic disruption of lysosomal function accelerated the accumulation of storage bodies in AF<sup>+</sup> cells and led to impaired microglia physiology and cell death, suggestive of a mechanistic convergence between aging and lysosomal storage disorders.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Microglia are a unique type of immune cell found in the brain and spinal cord. Their job is to support neurons, defend against invading microbes, clear debris and remove dying neurons by engulfing them. Despite these diverse roles, scientists have long believed that there is only a single type of microglial cell, which adapts to perform whatever task is required. But more recent evidence suggests that this is not the whole story.</p><p>Burns et al. now show that we can distinguish two subtypes of microglia based on a property called autofluorescence. This is the tendency of cells and tissues to emit light of one color after they have absorbed light of another. Burns et al. show that about 70% of microglia in healthy mouse and monkey brains display autofluorescence. However, about 30% of microglia show no autofluorescence at all. This suggests that there are two subtypes of microglia: autofluorescence-positive and autofluorescence-negative.</p><p>But does this difference have any implications for how the microglia behave? Autofluorescence occurs because specific substances inside the cells absorb light. In the case of microglia, electron microscopy revealed that autofluorescence was caused by structures within the cell called lysosomal storage bodies accumulating certain materials. The stored material included fat molecules, cholesterol crystals and other substances that are typical of disorders that affect these compartments. Burns et al. show that autofluorescent microglia contain larger amounts of proteins involved in storing and digesting waste materials than their non-autofluorescent counterparts. Moreover, as the brain ages, lysosomal storage material builds up inside autofluorescent microglia, which increase their autofluorescence as a result. Unfortunately, this accumulation of cellular debris also makes it harder for the microglia to perform their tasks.</p><p>Increasing evidence suggests that the accumulation of waste materials inside the brain contributes to diseases of aging. Future work should examine how autofluorescent microglia behave in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. If these cells do help protect the brain from the effects of aging, targeting them could be a new strategy for treating aging-related diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>autofluorescence</kwd><kwd>microglia</kwd><kwd>lysosomal storage disorder</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>CLN3</kwd><kwd>TREM2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Batten Disease Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cotman</surname><given-names>Susan L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Two novel subsets of microglia identified by their unique autofluorescence profiles differ in their subcellular organization, proteomic signatures and in their response to aging and lysosomal dysfunction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microglia are a unique population of tissue resident macrophages residing in the central nervous system (CNS) accounting for 10% to 15% of all cells within the CNS.

The disease-associated microglia (DAM) and the closely-related microglia subset expressing a neurodegenerative phenotype (MGnD) were reported to arise in response to the accumulation of β-amyloid plaques in Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) transgenic mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kamphuis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Keren-Shaul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Krasemann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mrdjen et al., 2018</xref>), as well as in other models of neurodegeneration and aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chiu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holtman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Spiller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Wlodarczyk et al., 2014</xref>). Mirroring the gene signature and function of DAM and MGnD subsets in disease conditions, the proliferative-region-associated microglia (PAM) subset was associated with the phagocytosis of newly formed and dying oligodendrocytes during normal post-natal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Felsky et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hagemeyer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Dark microglia, a subset identified by their condensed, electron-dense cytoplasm visible by transmission electron microscopy, are frequently observed during pathologic states and believed to actively associate with neuronal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisht et al., 2016</xref>). Beyond conditions of neuronal or oligodendrocyte cell death, microglia heterogeneity was also observed within the adult steady-state CNS. In particular, regional variations in cellular density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lawson et al., 1990</xref>), but also in microglia gene expression profiles were reported, pointing to region-specific microglia functions and possibly subsets in healthy brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ayata et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grabert et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>While these emerging transcriptomic findings suggest that steady-state microglia subsets are likely present, they remain to be identified and characterized. By using cellular autofluorescence (AF) as a novel photophysical parameter to explore microglia heterogeneity in unperturbed conditions, we report that steady-state microglia exist in two discrete states at a regulated ratio throughout the entire lifespan of rodent and non-human primate species. Leveraging this physical property, we devised a novel probe-free method to isolate and characterize these subsets and established that AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup> microglia differed in their ultrastructural features, homeostatic dynamics, proteomic content and physiological properties.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cellular autofluorescence identifies two discrete microglia subsets</title><p>Based on the observation that certain peripheral myeloid populations are highly autofluorescent, we initially included an empty fluorescence channel in our microglia flow cytometry analyses. Doing so revealed an unexpected bimodal distribution of autofluorescence (AF) intensity in CD45<sup>dim</sup>CD11B<sup>+</sup> microglia isolated from 6-month-old naïve C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This bimodal distribution identified two subsets of microglia: an AF-positive (AF<sup>+</sup>) subset showing a strong AF signal, and an AF-negative (AF<sup>−</sup>) subset which displayed no or minimal levels of AF. The two subsets appeared at a highly reproducible ratio of 1:2.5 (AF<sup>−</sup>:AF<sup>+</sup>), with an average frequency of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia of 71 ± 1.2% (n = 13; CV = 1.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further characterize the spectral properties of the AF signal, we included additional empty fluorescence channels. The AF signal showed maximal intensity in the 660–735 nm emission range upon excitation with a 488 nm (Blue) laser but was also detected across multiple combinations of laser excitation wavelengths and emission filter ranges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Extraction of single cell-level data from flow cytometry analyses revealed that the majority of microglia that were either positive or negative for AF in the Blue-710 nm AF channel were also positive or negative across most other AF channels tested, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In a few channels such as Red-780 nm for instance, 10% to 20% of the cells that were positive in Blue-710 nm appeared low or negative, which likely resulted from a differential sensitivity of the channels used to detect AF as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> by the differential brightness of the AF<sup>+</sup> population in those two channels. Both AF microglia subsets were detected across different regions of the brain and while there were minor differences in the frequency of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia between regions, AF<sup>+</sup> cells displayed similar levels of AF signal in cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Both AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup> subsets of microglia were positive for microglia homeostatic markers, including CX3CR1, P2RY12 and TMEM119 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Finally, there were no gender differences observed in the frequency of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia nor the intensity of AF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,G</xref>). This observation was conserved across species as microglia isolated from the brains of 3- to 4-year-old Cynomolgus monkeys showed a very consistent bimodal pattern of AF in the Blue-710 nm channel with 80 ± 3.6% of microglia that were AF<sup>+</sup> on average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Altogether, these analyses identified cellular AF as a novel photophysical property for discriminating two discrete subsets of microglia present at steady-state and conserved between rodents and non-human primates.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Cellular autofluorescence identifies two discrete and novel microglia subsets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative flow cytometry scatterplot showing CD45 and CD11B surface levels in a brain single cell suspension and histogram of autofluorescence (AF) signal in DAPI<sup>−</sup> CD45<sup>dim</sup> CD11B<sup>+</sup> microglia detected with a blue laser and 710 nm detector.

The frequency of microglia positive for AnnexinV increased in aged mice (4.0 ± 0.9%, n = 8) as compared to adult mice (1.9 ± 0.2%, n = 7) and was mostly attributed to AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> cells, which showed a 2-fold increase in the cell death rate at 24 months of age as compared to 12 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>). By contrast, the cell death rate seen in AF<sup>−</sup> cells did not significantly increase between 12 and 24 months of age. When quantifying specifically early-apoptotic (AnnexinV<sup>+</sup> DAPI<sup>−</sup>) cells, AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> microglia exhibited similar relative increases in early-apoptotic rates between 12 and 24 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), altogether suggesting that increased rates in apoptotic and necrotic death were both contributing to the overall 2-fold higher cell death rate seen in AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> microglia with aging. Unlike cell death rates, homeostatic proliferation rates at 12 months of age were generally higher in AF<sup>−</sup> microglia than in AF<sup>dim</sup> (by 2-fold on average) and AF<sup>hi</sup> cells (by 7-fold on average) and did not change with aging, with the exception of AF<sup>hi</sup> microglia which showed a 2.6-fold increase in proliferative rate between 12- and 24 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>).</p><p>Because microglia from <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>KI/KI</sup> mice accumulated higher levels of AF in the AF<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), we reasoned that accelerated accumulation of AF material may exacerbate the differences in AF subset survival. Accordingly, as early as at 9 months of age and more prominently at 18 months of age, we observed a marked decrease in the frequency of the AF<sup>hi</sup> subset, using channels that either showed increased AF signal at 5 months of age (e.g., Blue-525 nm) or channels that showed no increase in AF signal at this age (e.g., Blue-710 nm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). This decreased proportion also correlated with AF dose-dependent reductions in microglia cell numbers (by 30% and 85%, respectively, for AF<sup>dim</sup> and AF<sup>hi</sup> microglia, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>) and increases in overall cell death and early-apoptotic rates in AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> microglia, but not AF<sup>−</sup> cells from <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>KI/KI</sup> mice as compared to control mice (by 3.0- and 2.0-fold, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Altogether, these observations supported a model where the age-associated progressive accumulation of AF material directly caused increased cell death rates, thereby leading to the selective decline of the AF<sup>+</sup> subset observed during natural aging and the premature collapse of this subset upon accelerated accumulation of AF caused by genetic manipulation of the <italic>Cln3</italic> pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>The AF<sup>+</sup> subset is associated with an increased production of reactive oxygen species</title><p>Based on proteomic analyses, we hypothesized that the higher apoptotic rates observed in AF<sup>+</sup> cells could result from mitochondrial dysfunction, the highly catabolic metabolism of AF<sup>+</sup> cells or their reliance on fatty acid β-oxidation as a source of energy, all metabolic processes which are known to generate high levels of ROS. As measured by a ROS-sensitive cellular dye, AF<sup>+</sup> microglia from 3- and 24-month-old mice displayed baseline ROS levels that were on average 2-fold and 2.4-fold higher than those observed in AF<sup>−</sup> microglia, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>).

It has therefore been suggested that true microglial subsets should be defined in unchallenged conditions by their intrinsic properties which translate into unique physiological functions during development or aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Stratoulias et al., 2019</xref>). This report describes novel microglia subsets that precisely satisfy each criteria of this definition: (1) Cellular autofluorescence constitutes a cell-intrinsic photophysical parameter that unexpectedly distributed in a bimodal fashion in microglia; (2) The distinct subsets of microglia identified by this parameter were found in healthy, non-challenged conditions in both mice and non-human primates, irrespective of brain region or local microenvironment (<italic>e.g.</italic>, various levels of myelin content such as in Shiverer mice) and independently of any specific stimulus or age (<italic>e.g.</italic>, these subsets were present in young healthy brain as well as in aged animals); (3) AF<sup>+</sup> cells selectively accumulated lysosomal storage bodies, therefore identifying the subset of microglial cells endowed with clearance functions in the brain and suggesting that this intrinsic AF property reflected unique physiological functions; (4) These subsets were detected longitudinally at a fixed ratio throughout most of adult life, implying the existence of homeostatic mechanisms maintaining a strict abundance ratio between them. Microglia that were negative for autofluorescence were detected even in advanced aging conditions, excluding the possibility that these subsets could be simple cellular phenotypes.

The novel subsets described here, which we propose to name AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup>, are predicted to have distinct functions and potentially represent the first defined subsets of microglia in the unchallenged healthy brain.</p><p>Lines of evidence point to a model where AF<sup>+</sup> microglia derive from the gradual and synchronous conversion of a subset of AF<sup>−</sup> cells: (1) AF was found to linearly increase from 3 months to 12 months of age, indicative of a progressive and cumulative biological process during aging; (2) Microglia proliferation following depletion was largely restricted to the AF<sup>−</sup> subset which fully replenished within 14 days; (3) The post-depletion re-emergence of the AF<sup>+</sup> subset was delayed until after proliferation had subsided. One limitation of these repopulation experiments is that we were unable to exclude the possibility that a small number of surviving AF<sup>+</sup> cells were responsible for repopulating the AF<sup>+</sup> niche over a longer period of time. Only future lineage tracing experiments or the adoptive-transfer of congenically-labeled AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup> microglia into neonatal hosts as recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hasselmann et al., 2019</xref>) will definitely establish the ontogenic relationship between these microglia subsets. Our repopulation results are in agreement with the reported decrease in both lipofuscin content and CD68<sup>+</sup> lysosomal volume described by O’Neil and colleagues at 21 days following PLX5622-induced microglia depletion and repopulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">O’Neil et al., 2018</xref>). While the authors concluded that enforced microglia turnover reversed age-related lipofuscin accumulation, our data indicate that a discrete AF<sup>+</sup> microglia population re-emerges post depletion and that repopulating AF<sup>+</sup> microglia progressively accumulate AF with time, further establishing that AF accumulation is a progressive physiological process directly linked to aging. However, several important questions remain to be addressed in future studies, among which are: (1) the formal demonstration of the irreversibility of AF accumulation with aging; (2) the identification of the molecular cues responsible for the conversion from AF<sup>−</sup> to AF<sup>+</sup>; and (3) the elucidation of the mechanisms maintaining AF subset ratios.</p><p>Historically, the gradual increase of AF in the brain with aging has been attributed to the accumulation of lipofuscin within postmitotic neurons and glial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakanishi and Wu, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seehafer and Pearce, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). Lipofuscin is characterized by a distinctive cytoplasmic accumulation of non-degradable fluorescent storage material comprised of highly crosslinked, polymeric and oxidized macromolecules as well as metal cations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunk and Terman, 2002</xref>). While lipofuscin typically displays spectral excitation and emission maxima in the range of 320–480 nm and 460–630 nm, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreno-García et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Warburton et al., 2007</xref>), the exact composition is known to vary between brain regions and cell types, likely impacting its precise spectral properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gilissen and Staneva-Dobrovski, 2013</xref>). In contrast, several exciting laser wavelengths (405, 488, 561, 640 nm) led to the emission of AF in microglia while the AF emission spectrum was also characterized by an equally wide range of wavelengths (450–780 nm) observed on a per cell basis. The latter property suggests that the AF signal detected within each AF<sup>+</sup> microglia originates from complex subcellular content that may only partially overlap with traditional lipofuscin detected in other cell types. For example, while ceroid and lipofuscin exhibit some overlapping characteristics, these storage materials have unique compositions that in turn display subtle spectral differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Seehafer and Pearce, 2006</xref>). The possibility that microglia AF observed by flow cytometry is detecting a wide range of storage material is further supported by the genotype-dependent spectral differences observed in <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>KI/KI</sup> microglia, which displayed increased fluorescence intensity in select channel wavelengths, likely reflecting the specific accumulation of ceroid and not all possible subtypes of autofluorescence-emitting storage materials that may accumulate in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia with normal aging. One limitation of this study is that the identification of AF subsets currently requires analysis of a single cell suspension by flow cytometry. Efforts leveraging proteomics-generated DEPs are currently ongoing to understand the spatial distribution in situ of AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup> microglia in the context of different CNS regions and in relation to other cell types or subcellular structures such as synapses or apoptotic bodies. Understanding how aging and lysosomal dysfunction modify the spatial distribution of these two microglia subsets within the CNS should ultimately improve our understanding of the differential origin and composition of storage bodies accumulating in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia. When imaged by TEM, several types of storage compartments were detected in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia, among which were: lipid-based storage material which was reminiscent of the lipid droplets recently described in lipid droplet-accumulating microglia (LDAM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Marschallinger et al., 2020</xref>; crystalline deposits which resembled cholesterol crystals previously described in foamy macrophages, lipid laden microglia and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baumer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Klinkner et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tangirala et al., 1994</xref>); and finally, curvilinear and fingerprint-like pattern depositions, which are hallmark features of storage disorders such as NCL and progranulin haploinsufficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cotman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Ward et al., 2017</xref>) and suggested a mechanistic convergence between lipofuscinosis/ceroid pathologies and microglia dysfunction associated with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Spittau, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to differences in subcellular content and population dynamics, AF<sup>+</sup> microglia showed distinct differences at the proteome level, characterized by increased representation of endolysosomal and autophagic pathways as well as proteins involved in oxidative phosphorylation, catabolic metabolism and fatty acid β-oxidation. These proteomic differences are reminiscent of previously reported effects of aging on the microglia proteome, which consisted of a bioenergetic shift towards fatty-acid utilization, perturbations in the regulation of gene expression and an upregulation of proteins suggestive of mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Flowers et al., 2017</xref>). However, while those changes were observed in microglia from 24-month-old mice, we detected these differences in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia from mice as young as 12-month-old, suggesting that this aging signature may be primarily driven by the AF<sup>+</sup> subset. GO term enrichment and IPA analyses also identified dysregulation of mTOR-related proteins and pathways in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia. mTORC1, which integrates upstream pathways sensing nutrient availability, cellular energy and growth factors, regulates cell growth through its control of metabolism, autophagy, protein translation and organelle biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). The activity of mTORC1 is tightly controlled by its recruitment to the lysosomal surface by the Rag-Ragulator complex, where is it brought into close proximity to the activating GTPase Rheb. The elevated levels of Ragulator components (LAMTOR1, 2, 4, 5) and Rag members RRAGA/B and RRAGC in AF<sup>+</sup> cells are likely reflective of the increased lysosomal content present in these cells. The oxidative and catabolic metabolic profile of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia along with their overrepresentation of autophagic proteins points to an impaired activation of mTOR in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia and suggests that pharmacological modulation of mTOR may restore AF<sup>+</sup> microglia physiology, a hypothesis that remains to be tested. Intriguingly, recent work exploring the effects of elevated mTORC1 signaling in <italic>Tsc1</italic>-deficient microglia described increased lysosomal biogenesis and phagocytosis that was coincident with decreased synaptic density and a more reactive microglial morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In prior studies which analyzed lipofuscin in microglia during aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mendes-Jorge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreno-García et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakanishi and Wu, 2009</xref>), the assumption was that the accumulation occurred equivalently across all microglial cells. Instead, we have established that the progressive increase of AF material and associated accumulation of LAMP1<sup>+</sup> storage bodies are occurring exclusively within AF<sup>+</sup> microglia, highly suggestive of functional differences between subsets. In contrast, AF<sup>−</sup> microglia remained devoid of AF signal during natural aging and even when lysosomal function was impaired by the <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>Δex7-8</sup> mutation. The persistence of the AF<sup>−</sup> subset in those perturbed conditions suggests specific mechanisms or regional cues governing the distinct functions unique to each AF subset that will be the object of future investigation. Interestingly, aging-related myelin degradation, shedding and subsequent phagocytosis by microglia were proposed to be the primary contributors to the accumulation of lipofuscin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Safaiyan et al., 2016</xref>). However, our observations in the MBP-mutant Shiverer mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Molineaux et al., 1986</xref>), which exhibit CNS hypomyelination and myelin sheath instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bird et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kirschner and Ganser, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Privat et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Safaiyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Weil et al., 2016</xref>), do not fully support this model as the bimodal AF distribution was largely unaltered in <italic>Mbp</italic><sup>shi/shi</sup> microglia despite their upregulation of CLEC7A/DECTIN1, which likely reflected their active phagocytosis of apoptotic bodies and cellular debris caused by myelin instability. Therefore, myelin phagocytosis and degradation are unlikely to be the primary contributor to the microglia AF signal. This conclusion is compatible with observations made in the subretinal layers of the eye where the increased lipofuscin signal observed in microglia with aging or age-related macular degeneration was not linked to myelin phagocytosis, but to the phagocytosis of rod outer segments and apoptotic retinal pigment epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Santos et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Xu et al., 2008</xref>). While the lack of alterations in AF with the loss of Fc-receptor- or TREM2-mediated phagocytosis indicates that those particular pathways are not key contributors, AF accumulation may still be impacted by alternative phagocytic pathways active in microglia that were not tested in this study, such as TAM (Tyro3, Axl, Mer) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fourgeaud et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tufail et al., 2017</xref>), SIRPα-CD47 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hutter et al., 2019</xref>) and C3-CD11b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schafer et al., 2012</xref>).

Although the disruption of <italic>Cln3</italic> expression was present in both AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup> cells in <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>Δex7-8</sup> mice, the latter subset was unaffected by the perturbation of the lysosomal pathway, suggesting that CLN3-dependent lysosomal degradation is dispensable in AF<sup>−</sup> microglia, which further highlights the molecular differences between AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>−</sup> microglia.</p><p>While lipofuscin accumulation has been linked to age-related neuronal and microglial functional decline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">von Bernhardi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunk and Terman, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Höhn and Grune, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kurz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Safaiyan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sierra et al., 2007</xref>), the ability to precisely characterize its functional impact was impeded by the inability to isolate microglia which accumulated AF storage material from those which did not. Here, we overcame this limitation by developing a method permitting the isolation of these microglia subsets and established that the age-dependent accumulation of AF storage material was associated with increased mitochondrial mass and ROS production, decreased homeostatic proliferation and increased cell death rates in AF<sup>+</sup> cells. Increased ROS production by aging AF<sup>+</sup> microglia could be a direct consequence of the accumulation of AF material as lipofuscin can incorporate transition metals such as copper and iron, which form a redox-active surface catalyzing the Fenton reaction and promote mitochondria-independent cytotoxic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Höhn et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, the increased generation of ROS in AF<sup>+</sup> could result from mitochondrial dysfunction, a pathway that was enriched in the AF<sup>+</sup> proteome or the highly catabolic metabolism of AF<sup>+</sup> cells and their reliance on fatty acid β-oxidation which is another major a source of ROS. In addition to ROS, the accumulation of undegraded macromolecules within lysosomes, which is known to inhibit key catabolic enzymes and permeases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lamanna et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Prinetti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Walkley and Vanier, 2009</xref>), could further propel the lysosomal system into complete dysfunction. The subsequent overaccumulation of storage material may also physically damage the lysosomal membranes, causing dispersal of storage contents into the cytosol or the extracellular space and subsequent inflammasome activation and neuronal cell death, as it was shown recently in a genetic model for acid sphingomyelinase deficiency and in a demyelination model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cantuti-Castelvetri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gabandé Rodríguez et al., 2018</xref>). Foam cell macrophages, which are generated by the overaccumulation of oxidized low-density lipid protein and cholesterol in atherosclerotic plaques, have been shown to contribute to vascular pathology via these precise mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Childs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duewell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gibson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hakala et al., 2003</xref>). Interestingly, foam cell macrophages exhibit many of the ultrastructural features observed in aged AF<sup>+</sup> microglia and thus may share common pathways precipitating cellular dysfunction and tissue pathology. Lastly, another possible mechanism by which AF material could trigger microglia dysfunction and cytotoxic effects is via its binding and inhibition of the proteasome and the associated perturbation of cellular proteolytic functions, as it was previously reported for lipofuscin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Höhn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sitte et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Szweda et al., 2003</xref>). Despite the striking stability of the AF subset ratio throughout most adult mice, cumulative and age-dependent AF accumulation ultimately resulted in the collapse of the ratio of AF<sup>+</sup> to AF<sup>−</sup> microglia in advanced aging, likely due to one of the aforementioned mechanisms. The accelerated accumulation of AF material in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia from <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>Δex7-8</sup> mice phenocopied the effect of advanced aging on microglia by selectively increasing apoptotic rates of AF<sup>+</sup> cells and resulting in an early and precipitous decline of the AF<sup>+</sup> subset. Altogether, these results suggest a convergence of mechanisms operating during aging and in lysosomal storage disorders whereby the accumulation of storage bodies in AF<sup>+</sup> cells drives microglia dysfunction, possibly contributing to neurodegeneration known to be associated with both conditions.</p><p>Together, these results provide novel insight into microglia physiology by identifying two previously unknown subsets which exist at steady-state in the murine and non-human primate CNS. The ability to identify and isolate distinct microglia subsets via a cell-intrinsic, label-free method presents future opportunities to further characterize any additional functions that may shed light on their subset-specific roles in maintaining the delicate balance between CNS homeostasis and neurodegeneration. The significance of these subsets is clearly highlighted by a model of juvenile neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis in which lysosomal dysfunction was born solely by AF<sup>+</sup> microglia, whereas AF<sup>−</sup> microglia appeared unaffected. Lastly, the finding that the progressive depletion of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia occurred as function of natural brain aging raises the possibility that this subset may be functionally protective and warrants further investigation into the biological factors regulating their survival.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

The suspensions were mixed and stored frozen until used. Lysates were thawed and treated with a E220 focused beam ultrasonicator (Covaris) 20 times at 2 s each with 150W output. Lysates were clarified by centrifugation, reduced with 10 mM final concentration of DTT for 20 min and subsequently alkylated with 30 mM 2-iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature. After a two-fold dilution in water, samples were digested overnight with 0.05 μg LysC (Wako) and 0.2 μg modified trypsin (Promega). Peptides were acidified to a final concentration 0.5% (v/v) trifluoroacetic acid and desalted using C18 StageTips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rappsilber et al., 2007</xref>). 50% of resulting peptides were separated on a 50 cm, 75 μm inner diameter EasySpray column packed with 2 μm PepMap C18 RSLC material (ThermoFisher) over 120 min using an EASY-nLC 1200 system (ThermoFisher). Peptides were analyzed online with an Orbitrap Fusion-Lumos mass spectrometer (ThermoFisher) in data-dependent acquisition mode. Full scans were acquired at a resolution of 240,000 in the Orbitrap analyzer and the most abundant precursors were selected in a 1 s scan cycle for higher-energy dissociation (HCD) with a 0.7 Th isolation window, a target of 10,000 ions and a maximum injection time of 25 ms, followed by detection fragment ion in the ion trap.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Proteomics data analysis</title><p>Raw data were processed in MaxQuant Version 1.6.0.16 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cox and Mann, 2008</xref>) and searched with Andromeda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cox et al., 2011</xref>) against a comprehensive SwissProt release for mouse with a false discovery rate of 1% at the peptide and protein level. Identifications of MS1 features were transferred between samples using the Match Between Runs option with a 0.2 min matching tolerance. Label-free protein quantification was performed using the MaxLFQ algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). Data analysis was performed in Perseus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). After log transformation and applying a filter for proteins quantified in at least 50% of samples in either group, missing values were imputed with a normal distribution with a mean shifted down by 1.8-fold and a width of 0.3-fold in relation to the standard distribution of measured values of the respective sample. <italic>p</italic> values were calculated using Student’s t-test and the false discovery rate was controlled with the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Proteins were determined to be differentially expressed if they met an adjusted <italic>p</italic> value threshold of &lt;0.01 and an absolute fold change difference threshold of &gt;1.3. Human orthologs of identified mouse proteins were assigned using Panther and GO term enrichment of differentially expressed proteins was calculated with the Panther Overpresentation Test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mi et al., 2019</xref>).

Fixed cells were pelleted and post-fixed in 1.0% osmium tetroxide in cacodylate buffer for 1 hr at RT, rinsed in cacodylate buffer, and stabilized using 2% agarose in PBS. Agarose-embedded pellets were dehydrated through a graded series of ethanols to 100%, then dehydrated briefly in 100% propylene oxide. Specimens were infiltrated in a mix of 2:1 propylene oxide/Eponate resin (Ted Pella, Redding, CA) 2 hr at room temperature on a gentle rotator, then switched into a 1:1 mix of propylene oxide/Eponate resin and allowed to infiltrate overnight on a gentle rotator. 24 hr later, specimens were placed into fresh 100% Eponate resin and allowed to infiltrate for several hours, then embedded in flat molds with fresh 100% Eponate. Polymerization occurred within 24–48 hr at 60°C. Thin (70 nm) sections were cut using a Leica EM UC7 ultramicrotome, collected onto formvar-coated grids, contrast-stained with uranyl acetate and Reynold's lead citrate and examined in a JEOL JEM 1011 transmission electron microscope at 80 kV. Images were collected using an AMT digital imaging system with proprietary image capture software (Advanced Microscopy Techniques, Danvers, MA). TEM image analysis and area determinations for subcellular features were calculated in FIJI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor and three reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While we normally highlight the specific actions needed to revise the story, I instead include the detailed reviewer comments as many of the comments relate to the presentation of the data rather than serving as a list of needed experiments. Because there is no functional characterization, this would either need to be completed, or comments pertaining to function would need to be amended and a section outlining these caveats and future steps included. Also, data for other brain regions which was alluded to should be included; integration with the body of literature on lipofuscin would also be helpful.</p><p>We hope you will find the comments constructive in preparing a revised manuscript that we believe should be considered in the category of RESOURCE article.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they may with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.<italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In &quot;Storage body accumulating microglia, a novel subset in healthy brain selectively impacted by aging&quot;, the authors identify two subsets of microglia based on the presence or absence of autofluorescence (termed AF+ and AF-). The authors used young and aged mice to characterize changes in the AF+ microglial population during normal aging, including in knockout mice for phagocytic and lysosomal pathway genes. The authors conclude that (1) increased intensity of autofluorescence in AF+ microglia occurs during normal aging and is associated with increased storage body accumulation and proteomic changes, (2) AF intensity can be regulated by lysosomal pathways and autophagy, and (3) in advanced aging the accumulation of AF leads to increased microglial apoptosis and ROS production.</p><p>This study provides a novel description of microglial heterogeneity during the process of aging, with careful characterization of a helpful and easily accessible biomarker. It is an appealing topic to neuroimmunology and aging fields. Although the manuscript does not delineate the mechanisms regulating autofluorescence, nor its consequences on physiology, these topics represent exciting future directions. There are several points that, if addressed, would broaden appeal, increase interpretability, and/or strengthen conclusions.</p><p>1) All presented data examines single cell suspensions of microglia. Identification of AF+ microglia requires flow cytometry, the specific mechanisms regulating microglial autofluorescence are not known, and AF+ microglia have a range of different cellular inclusions. It is therefore challenging to know how to identify AF+ versus AF- microglia in tissue sections, but this would greatly enhance our ability to gauge their relevance. If the authors have any data or thoughts about how to identify AF+ microglia in situ, they would be highly useful to the field. If not, it could be helpful to mention this understandable limitation.</p><p>2) Subsection “Cellular autofluorescence identifies two discrete microglia subsets”: &quot;AF microglia subsets were detected across different regions of the brain when isolated from cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus (data not shown).&quot; Given ongoing debates around regional microglial heterogeneity, this is an interesting and important statement. If data are already in hand pertaining to regional differences in the frequency of AF+ and AF- microglia (or lack thereof), this would be of great appeal. If not, this sentence could be removed, as it is currently provocative but difficult to interpret.</p><p>3) Subsection “Microglia AF subsets exhibit differential population dynamics upon depletion and replenishment of the microglia niche”: &quot;Because AF+ microglia were virtually absent during this early repopulation phase (Figure 4B), these proliferation kinetics implied that the AF- subset of microglia was the predominant subset responsible for the repopulation of the microglia compartment following depletion and that AF+ microglia were derived from the conversion over time of a subset of AF- microglia.&quot; The authors lack direct evidence that AF- cells progress into AF+ cells, and it is possible that a small number of remaining AF+ microglia can directly repopulate the AF+ niche, just with slower proliferation kinetics. New experimental data is not needed, but alternative hypotheses should be discussed.</p><p>4) Regarding Figure 7: To identify true, early apoptotic cells DAPI-AnnexinV+ cells should be the only ones counted. Cells stained for both AnnexinV and DAPI are not necessarily apoptotic, since membrane permeability permits Annexin V binding to the inner membrane leaflet. Cells may have a permeable membrane due to other pathways of cell death i.e. necroptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis. Presenting data on only DAPI-AnnexinV+ cells would increase interpretability of these results and strengthen the conclusion that AFhigh microglia are more prone to apoptotic cell death. Alternatively, the authors could change their language to include the possibility of other types of cell death occurring in AF+ microglia, or note these limitations in the Discussion section.<italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript describes a new classification system for microglia in the rodent and non-human primate brain that is based on autofluorescence. These AF+ and AF- microglia are equally distributed across brain regions (though this is not shown and would be a nice addition as the data is stated as being generated), does not differ according to sex, and maintains similar percentages following repopulation after depletion of microglia. Unlike other classifications of microglia in the disease state (e.g. disease-associated microglia, DAMs), AF+/AF- cells are present across species, and the proteomic analysis that suggests that have lysosomal instead of phagocytic differences is very interesting (this was validated using Trem2-/- and Fcer1g-/- mice). Overall, this is an interesting hypothesis, and provides a new avenue for characterizing microglia for future functional investigation.</p><p>My concerns are based largely on this function characterization – as while the authors state they have provided an improvement on other recently published transcriptomic studies by assessing function of these AF+/AF- microglia, they have not. What they have provided is a proteomic analysis of these cells – as no functional assays are provided in the manuscript. This does not detract from the overall hypothesis of the manuscript, but it would benefit from some taming of the language.</p><p>As there has been much controversy in the microglia field about binary nomenclature, perhaps some caution here is prudent. If the cells can be shown to have a functional difference, this would go a long way to dispel concerns in the field (otherwise more appropriate descriptions and removal of statements that suggest functional testing has been completed here would suffice).</p><p>The authors state that they have measured similar AF+/AF- cells in the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus. Given this statement is provided as proof of continuity of the subsets at several places throughout the manuscript – these data should be shown.</p><p>The data presented in Figure 1C is great, and the percentages seem more or less correct for the B-710 group of cells, but appears more 50/50 for R-780 cells. These are presumably lowly abundant? Can some quantification of these subtypes be extracted from these data?</p><p>The authors spend considerable time describing morphological changes in Figure 3 (panels A) – suggesting that AF- cells are more regularly shaped that AF+ cells, however the representative images in Figure 3A appears to show a different story – with AF- microglia having many 'ruffled' edges, while AF+ microglia are smooth. This is particularly noticeable in the 18 month cells. This highlights a real problem in the field of describing cell subsets using morphology – it can be misleading and biased. Considering the clear AF phenotypes, the morphology of the cells is not a strong addition here. Differences in cellular inclusions remain clear, though this might only be true at 3 months. This remains a weak section of the manuscript (which on the whole is strong and exciting). Similarly, in panels B the only described component here that is clearly visible is the crystal inclusions (white arrows). The curvilinear and fingerprint like profiles are not visible. This may be a resolution problem in review images, but this should be carefully checked and amended if necessary. This is also highlighted at the bottom of Page 16 where it is suggested that these 'crystal deposits resemble cholesterol crystals found in atherosclerotic plaues'. This is highly interesting, but this statement should be qualified or measured/validated in some way. Perhaps some careful review and rewriting could address this.</p><p>The AF+ dim/lo section of the manuscript is the weakest section of the manuscript and is not well-defined or incorporated into the remainder of the very compelling story. The dim/hi populations are not defined, and it feels like a move back to CD45hi/low populations that have caused problems in the field before. Indeed, the split of these cells in Figure 6, panel G, is arbitrary and very unclear how this was chosen. In Figure 7 dim and hi populations only appear visible on FACS plots in the 24 month animals, but the split in younger animals is still unclear, and seems arbitrary to gate them as such at earlier ages as the AF is a smooth transition from lower to higher levels<italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript unveils the presence of two distinct microglial populations defined by the presence or absence of autofluorescent (AF) material. Surprisingly, the proportion of AF+ and AF- cells is constant across animals, species (mouse and a non-human primate), and ages, while AF intensity grows linearly with aging in AF+ cells. In AF+ cells, the autofluorescence localizes in intracellular organelles. Ultrastructurally, AF+ cells exhibited large and complex storage bodies whose size markedly increases with aging, along with the signals of LAMP1 and CD68 (lysosomal membrane proteins) in AF+ (but not AF-) cells. Proteomics experiments revealed upregulation of proteins of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in AF+ cells.</p><p>The authors also show that AF+ and AF- cells exhibit dramatically different dynamics in post-microglia-depletion brain repopulation, with AF- cells repopulating the niche first, and then partially converting to AF+ cells.</p><p>Analysis of mouse lines with defective genes for myelination and phagocytosis indicated that these two pathways do not contribute to the generation of AF+ microglia. Conversely, KO of an autophagy gene decreased, whereas KO of a lysosomal gene increased, autofluorescence in AF+ microglia, revealing intersections with these pathways. Advanced aging was accompanied by a striking and selective loss of microglia with highest AF levels, which was accelerated in a genetic model of lysosomal dysfunction and was paralleled by an increase in ROS production and mitochondrial content.</p><p>The story is novel, well developed, and significant. The experiments are well controlled and largely supports the main conclusions of the work. The identification of a subpopulation of microglial cells that is likely responsible for managing catabolic challenges in aging and neurodegenerative disease is significant because it defines potential targets of treatments. More generally, the finding that microglial cells are divided in two distinct populations of fairly constant proportions is intriguing and raises several questions, including (1) How the conversion from AF- to AF+ cells is trigged at the molecular level? (2) Is this conversion irreversible? (3) What keeps the proportion of the two populations constant? These questions, however, are better addressed in follow-up studies, and I am mentioning them here only to underline how this work raises innovative questions in the field.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Storage body accumulating microglia, a novel subset detected in the healthy brain and selectively impacted by aging&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors used young and aged mice to characterize changes in the AF+ microglial population during normal aging, including in knockout mice for phagocytic and lysosomal pathway genes. The authors conclude that (1) increased intensity of autofluorescence in AF+ microglia occurs during normal aging and is associated with increased storage body accumulation and proteomic changes, (2) AF intensity can be regulated by lysosomal pathways and autophagy, and (3) in advanced aging the accumulation of AF leads to increased microglial apoptosis and ROS production.</p><p>This study provides a novel description of microglial heterogeneity during the process of aging, with careful characterization of a helpful and easily accessible biomarker. It is an appealing topic to neuroimmunology and aging fields. Although the manuscript does not delineate the mechanisms regulating autofluorescence, nor its consequences on physiology, these topics represent exciting future directions.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors would like to thank reviewer #1 for this in-depth review and appreciation of our findings as well as for highlighting the novelty and utility of microglia autofluorescence as a biomarker of microglia heterogeneity during aging. While we agree that we did not identify the exact biochemical nature of the storage bodies associated with the AF signal nor the functional consequences of AF accumulation on microglia physiology at the organismal level, we would like to emphasize two findings which partially answer these limitations:</p><p>a) Genetic analyses shown in Figure 6 identified autophagy and lysosomal functions as key mechanisms regulating autofluorescence accumulation.</p><p>b) Characterization of the effect of advanced aging and lysosomal dysfunction on the physiology of AF<sup>-</sup> and AF<sup>+</sup> microglia (Figure 7) allowed us to define functional consequences of early and accelerated AF accumulation at the cellular level, including increased apoptosis, higher ROS production and selective loss of the AF<sup>+</sup> cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several points that, if addressed, would broaden appeal, increase interpretability, and/or strengthen conclusions.</p><p>1) All presented data examines single cell suspensions of microglia. Identification of AF+ microglia requires flow cytometry, the specific mechanisms regulating microglial autofluorescence are not known, and AF+ microglia have a range of different cellular inclusions. It is therefore challenging to know how to identify AF+ versus AF- microglia in tissue sections, but this would greatly enhance our ability to gauge their relevance. If the authors have any data or thoughts about how to identify AF+ microglia in situ, they would be highly useful to the field. If not, it could be helpful to mention this understandable limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors fully agree with reviewer #1 that developing a microscopy method to identify AF<sup>-</sup> and AF<sup>+</sup> microglia subsets <italic>in situ</italic> would further our understanding of these microglia subsets in the context of CNS tissue regions and their interactions with other cell types or subcellular structures (e.g., synapse or apoptotic bodies). Efforts for developing IHC/IF methods to localize AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>-</sup> microglia <italic>in situ</italic> are currently ongoing and leveraging our proteomic dataset to define suitable markers. We have now updated the Discussion section to highlight this limitation of our findings and ongoing efforts to develop methods to identify these subsets <italic>in situ</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Subsection “Cellular autofluorescence identifies two discrete microglia subsets”: &quot;AF microglia subsets were detected across different regions of the brain when isolated from cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus (data not shown).&quot; Given ongoing debates around regional microglial heterogeneity, this is an interesting and important statement. If data are already in hand pertaining to regional differences in the frequency of AF+ and AF- microglia (or lack thereof), this would be of great appeal. If not, this sentence could be removed, as it is currently provocative but difficult to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with reviewer #1 that the detection of AF subsets across different anatomical regions of the brain is an important finding. We have now included the corresponding data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D) which establishes the presence of both AF<sup>-</sup> and AF<sup>+</sup> microglia in cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus. This figure panel is now described in the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Subsection “Microglia AF subsets exhibit differential population dynamics upon depletion and replenishment of the microglia niche”: &quot;Because AF+ microglia were virtually absent during this early repopulation phase (Figure 4B), these proliferation kinetics implied that the AF- subset of microglia was the predominant subset responsible for the repopulation of the microglia compartment following depletion and that AF+ microglia were derived from the conversion over time of a subset of AF- microglia.&quot; The authors lack direct evidence that AF- cells progress into AF+ cells, and it is possible that a small number of remaining AF+ microglia can directly repopulate the AF+ niche, just with slower proliferation kinetics. New experimental data is not needed, but alternative hypotheses should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors agree that without additional lineage tracing experiments, it is technically possible that a small number of surviving AF<sup>+</sup> cells were responsible for repopulating the AF<sup>+</sup> niche over a longer period of time. We have now highlighted this alternative hypothesis in the revised version of the manuscript (Discussion section). While we can’t directly exclude this alternative hypothesis, we had included several lines of evidence that argued against that possibility (Discussion section). In the absence of lineage tracing capabilities available to us at this time to label and trace AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>-</sup> microglia, we are currently exploring alternative strategies to tackle this question, such as the transplantation of FACS-sorted microglia AF subsets from congenic donors into neonate recipients (PMID: 31375314). This future avenue of investigation is now highlighted in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Regarding Figure 7: To identify true, early apoptotic cells DAPI-AnnexinV+ cells should be the only ones counted. Cells stained for both AnnexinV and DAPI are not necessarily apoptotic, since membrane permeability permits Annexin V binding to the inner membrane leaflet. Cells may have a permeable membrane due to other pathways of cell death i.e. necroptosis, necrosis, pyroptosis. Presenting data on only DAPI-AnnexinV+ cells would increase interpretability of these results and strengthen the conclusion that AFhigh microglia are more prone to apoptotic cell death. Alternatively, the authors could change their language to include the possibility of other types of cell death occurring in AF+ microglia, or note these limitations in the discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank reviewer #1 for highlighting this lack of precision and accuracy in how we presented cell death data in Figure 7. The initial data presented were indeed inclusive of multiple modes of cell death and did not strictly reflect apoptotic rates, but overall cell death rates. The text has been modified accordingly in the Results section. We also reanalyzed the data to separately quantify apoptotic (AnnexinV+, DAPI-) and necrotic cells (AnnexinV+, DAPI+). We found that AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> microglia exhibited a 2-fold increase in both apoptotic and necrotic death rates between 12 and 24 months of age (Figure 7—figure supplement 1A), altogether suggesting that both increased apoptotic and necrotic death are contributing to the higher overall cell death rates of these subsets relatively to AF<sup>-</sup> microglia. In addition to Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, we performed a similar analysis in Cln3<sup>KI/KI</sup> mice and these results are now presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 1D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript describes a new classification system for microglia in the rodent and non-human primate brain that is based on autofluorescence. These AF+ and AF- microglia are equally distributed across brain regions (though this is not shown and would be a nice addition as the data is stated as being generated), does not differ according to sex, and maintains similar percentages following repopulation after depletion of microglia. Unlike other classifications of microglia in the disease state (e.g. disease-associated microglia, DAMs), AF+/AF- cells are present across species, and the proteomic analysis that suggests that have lysosomal instead of phagocytic differences is very interesting (this was validated using Trem2-/- and Fcer1g-/- mice). Overall, this is an interesting hypothesis, and provides a new avenue for characterizing microglia for future functional investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors would like to thank reviewer #2 for their positive feedback on our work and appreciation that microglia AF subsets are present across species, something which is not true (or at least being debated) for other subsets of microglia described previously. As per reviewer #2 suggestion, we have now included in the revised manuscript the characterization of AF subsets across different anatomical regions of the brain (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D). This figure establishes the presence of AF<sup>-</sup> and AF<sup>+</sup> microglia in cerebellum, cortex and hippocampus. Description of these observations is included in subsection” Cellular autofluorescence identifies two discrete microglia subsets”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My concerns are based largely on this function characterization – as while the authors state they have provided an improvement on other recently published transcriptomic studies by assessing function of these AF+/AF- microglia, they have not. What they have provided is a proteomic analysis of these cells – as no functional assays are provided in the manuscript. This does not detract from the overall hypothesis of the manuscript, but it would benefit from some taming of the language.</p><p>As there has been much controversy in the microglia field about binary nomenclature, perhaps some caution here is prudent. If the cells can be shown to have a functional difference, this would go a long way to dispel concerns in the field (otherwise more appropriate descriptions and removal of statements that suggest functional testing has been completed here would suffice).</p></disp-quote><p>We are in agreement with reviewer#2 that we did not perform assays to directly assess functional differences between microglia subsets and moderated the functional claims throughout the manuscript. The principle reasons for the decision to eschew in vitro functional assays is the well-documented, rapid loss of homeostatic microglia identity that occurs upon culture on a plastic dish (PMID:28521131, PMID:30108586) in addition to the limited physiological relevance of the corresponding in vitro assays. Instead, we chose to provide several lines of indirect in vivo and ex vivo evidence in support of functional differences between AF subsets. These observations include:</p><p>- The steady, age-dependent increases in AF signal, LAMP1 levels and storage bodies observed selectively in AF<sup>+</sup> microglia (Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3) which are wholly reflective of a difference in the functional abilities of these microglia subsets in either the ingestion or the degradation of extracellular material. Of note, none of these readouts increased with aging in AF<sup>-</sup> microglia, thus pointing to a functional divergence in the lysosomal / degradative activity of the two subsets with aging.</p><p>- Further supporting these observations, proteins that are typically associated with oligodendrocytes (MOBP, SYNE2) or neurons (SNAP25, CBLN1, CBLN4) were detected in our proteomics dataset at significantly higher levels within AF<sup>+</sup> microglia than AF<sup>-</sup>, providing further indirect evidence of increased phagocytic capacity of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia, differences in the material they ultimately ingested, or differences in the degradative capacity of these subsets. We have now included these observations in subsection “ Myelin, Fc receptor-mediated and TREM2-mediated phagocytosis are not dominant mechanisms contributing to microglia AF accumulation” to highlight the differential detection of these neuronal/oligodendrocyte proteins.</p><p>- The differential ability of AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>-</sup> microglia to repopulate the brain upon depletion (Figure 4), pointing to another functional difference between those subsets that is also reflected in the differential levels of homeostatic proliferation, ROS production and cell death seen in AF<sup>+</sup> and AF<sup>-</sup> cells (Figure 7).</p><p>-The differential genetic regulation of those subsets was highlighted by the lack of impact of <italic>Cln3</italic> mutation on AF<sup>-</sup> microglia whereas the same mutation led to early cell death and loss of AF<sup>+</sup> cells, indicating that AF<sup>+</sup>, but not AF<sup>-</sup> microglia, rely on lysosomal-related functions and indirectly demonstrating that these subsets are endowed with distinct functions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state that they have measured similar AF+/AF- cells in the cerebellum, cortex, and hippocampus. Given this statement is provided as proof of continuity of the subsets at several places throughout the manuscript – these data should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in our response to reviewer #1, we agree that the detection of AF subsets across different anatomical regions of the brain is an important finding. As such, we have now included the data as part of Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data presented in Figure 1C is great, and the percentages seem more or less correct for the B-710 group of cells, but appears more 50/50 for R-780 cells. These are presumably lowly abundant? Can some quantification of these subtypes be extracted from these data?</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer#2’s observation is correct in that in Figure 1C where each row represents a single analyzed cell, the proportion of single cells positive for AF in the B-710 channel is roughly 70%. In contrast, this proportion is different in R-780 channel where it is roughly 50%. We believe that this difference is only apparent and is not necessarily reflecting a different subtype of AF microglia. Instead, we favor the hypothesis that these differences are more likely caused by the higher sensitivity of the B-710 channel compared to R-780. This distinct sensitivity in AF detection is very clear in Figure 1B when considering the brightness of the AF<sup>+</sup> population in those two channels. We have included scatterplots below to better illustrate the differences in sensitivity between B-710 and R-780 in detecting AF<sup>+</sup> microglia at different ages. Using alternate high-sensitivity channels to detect AF, such as YG-610 or YG-670, one can identify a similar proportion of AF<sup>+</sup> microglia (~70%) whereas weaker channels such as R-730 and R-670 yield lower proportions similar to the R-780 channel. These important considerations have now been added in subsection “Cellular autofluorescence identifies two discrete microglia subset”.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57495-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors spend considerable time describing morphological changes in Figure 3 (panels A) – suggesting that AF- cells are more regularly shaped that AF+ cells, however the representative images in Figure 3A appears to show a different story – with AF- microglia having many 'ruffled' edges, while AF+ microglia are smooth. This is particularly noticeable in the 18 month cells. This highlights a real problem in the field of describing cell subsets using morphology – it can be misleading and biased. Considering the clear AF phenotypes, the morphology of the cells is not a strong addition here. Differences in cellular inclusions remain clear, though this might only be true at 3 months. This remains a weak section of the manuscript (which on the whole is strong and exciting). Similarly, in panels B the only described component here that is clearly visible is the crystal inclusions (white arrows). The curvilinear and fingerprint like profiles are not visible. This may be a resolution problem in review images, but this should be carefully checked and amended if necessary. This is also highlighted at the bottom of Page 16 where it is suggested that these 'crystal deposits resemble cholesterol crystals found in atherosclerotic plaues'. This is highly interesting, but this statement should be qualified or measured/validated in some way. Perhaps some careful review and rewriting could address this.</p></disp-quote><p>The morphological characterization in subsection “AF+ microglia selectively accumulate intracellular storage bodies with age” was referring to intracellular storage bodies, not to the entire cell. This statement has been modified to minimize ambiguity. We apologize that the curvilinear fingerprint inclusions were not visible in the initial version of the manuscript that we submitted and will verify that the resolution is sufficient upon final submission. In the meantime, we have included below a high-resolution version of the image that was included in the initial submission.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-57495-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Cholesterol crystallization is a well-characterized phenomenon in lipid-laden macrophages. The TEM image we included in the manuscript matches well with previous reports of intracellular cholesterol crystals. For example, Klinkner et al., imaged macrophages incubated in vitro with oxidized-LDL by TEM (Klinkner et al., 1995) and described extensive lysosomal lipoid bodies, many in the process of conversion from the fluid to crystalline state. Fully developed crystal profiles were often enveloped by phospholipid lamellae that outlined the crystal contours and were observed in one of two distinct shapes: a short bar shape or a long thin arc. We have included a clearer description of the TEM cholesterol crystal observation in subsection “AF+ microglia selectively accumulate intracellular storage bodies with age” as well as additional references where this finding has been previously characterized by TEM are now included in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The AF+ dim/lo section of the manuscript is the weakest section of the manuscript and is not well-defined or incorporated into the remainder of the very compelling story. The dim/hi populations are not defined, and it feels like a move back to CD45hi/low populations that have caused problems in the field before. Indeed, the split of these cells in Figure 6, panel G, is arbitrary and very unclear how this was chosen. In Figure 7 dim and hi populations only appear visible on FACS plots in the 24 month animals, but the split in younger animals is still unclear, and seems arbitrary to gate them as such at earlier ages as the AF is a smooth transition from lower to higher levels</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank reviewer #2 for their overall description of this manuscript as a compelling story, but also for highlighting this weaker section of the manuscript. We do agree that the introduction of AF<sup>dim</sup> and AF<sup>hi</sup> subsets may be confusing, especially in Figure 6. We believe however that subdividing the AF<sup>+</sup> subset into AF<sup>dim</sup> and AF<sup>hi</sup> subpopulations is important in quantifying the change in AF distribution within the AF<sup>+</sup> subset observed with advanced aging and in conditions of lysosomal or autophagy dysfunction. We have therefore made a number of changes to address reviewer#2’s comment:</p><p>- In Figure 7A, the histogram distribution of AF intensity in microglia from 24-month old mice (i.e., in conditions of advanced aging) shows a very different AF distribution compared to microglia from 12-month animals, with the clear alteration of the bimodal distribution and emergence of cells with intermediate levels of AF. In order to account for this significant change in distribution, we subdivided the AF<sup>+</sup> population into 2 groups, AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> in the same manner performed in Figure 6G. Initially, non-autofluorescent peripheral immune cells were used as negative controls to determine the initial bifurcating gate to identify AF<sup>-</sup> and AF<sup>+</sup> microglia subsets. To subdivide the AF<sup>+</sup> subset, a gate encompassing AF<sup>hi</sup> microglia was drawn to capture the AF<sup>+</sup> gaussian peak. The AF<sup>dim</sup> gate was drawn between the edge of the AF<sup>-</sup> population and the base of the AF<sup>+</sup> gaussian peak (lower boundary of AF<sup>hi</sup> gate). To confirm the validity of this additional gating scheme, we leveraged the <italic>Cln3</italic> data. While the AF<sup>hi</sup> cells normally formed a sharp gaussian peak in the B-710 channel, the peak completely dissipated at 18 months in <italic>Cln3</italic><sup>KI/KI</sup> animals (Figure 7H, I), with only AF<sup>-</sup> cells and the intermediate AF<sup>dim</sup> cells remaining. The justification for this gating strategy is now included in the subsection “Mice”.</p><p>- We also amended Figure 6G to remain consistent with the neighboring panels while also introducing the subdivision of the AF<sup>+</sup> population with gating used outlined in Figure 6G. We have also included a panel with the accompanying quantification of the AF<sup>hi</sup> and AF<sup>dim</sup> populations (Figure 6H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This manuscript unveils the presence of two distinct microglial populations defined by the presence or absence of autofluorescent (AF) material. Surprisingly, the proportion of AF+ and AF- cells is constant across animals, species (mouse and a non-human primate), and ages, while AF intensity grows linearly with aging in AF+ cells. In AF+ cells, the autofluorescence localizes in intracellular organelles. Ultrastructurally, AF+ cells exhibited large and complex storage bodies whose size markedly increases with aging, along with the signals of LAMP1 and CD68 (lysosomal membrane proteins) in AF+ (but not AF-) cells. Proteomics experiments revealed upregulation of proteins of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in AF+ cells.</p><p>The authors also show that AF+ and AF- cells exhibit dramatically different dynamics in post-microglia-depletion brain repopulation, with AF- cells repopulating the niche first, and then partially converting to AF+ cells.</p><p>Analysis of mouse lines with defective genes for myelination and phagocytosis indicated that these two pathways do not contribute to the generation of AF+ microglia. Conversely, KO of an autophagy gene decreased, whereas KO of a lysosomal gene increased, autofluorescence in AF+ microglia, revealing intersections with these pathways. Advanced aging was accompanied by a striking and selective loss of microglia with highest AF levels, which was accelerated in a genetic model of lysosomal dysfunction and was paralleled by an increase in ROS production and mitochondrial content.</p><p>The story is novel, well developed, and significant. The experiments are well controlled and largely supports the main conclusions of the work. The identification of a subpopulation of microglial cells that is likely responsible for managing catabolic challenges in aging and neurodegenerative disease is significant because it defines potential targets of treatments. More generally, the finding that microglial cells are divided in two distinct populations of fairly constant proportions is intriguing and raises several questions, including (1) How the conversion from AF- to AF+ cells is trigged at the molecular level? (2) Is this conversion irreversible? (3) What keeps the proportion of the two populations constant? These questions, however, are better addressed in follow-up studies, and I am mentioning them here only to underline how this work raises innovative questions in the field.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors would like to thank reviewer #3 for this very positive feedback on our submission and highlighting the novelty and potential of our findings to develop future therapeutics in the context of aging and neurodegeneration.
