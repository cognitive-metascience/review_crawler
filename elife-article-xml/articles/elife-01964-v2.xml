cellular systems, including hematopoietic cells. miR-142 is one of the most prevalently expressed miRNAs within the hematopoietic lineage. To address the <italic>in vivo</italic> functions of miR-142, we utilized a novel reporter and a loss-of-function mouse allele that we have recently generated. In this study, we show that miR-142 is broadly expressed in the adult hematopoietic system. Our data further reveal that miR-142 is critical for megakaryopoiesis. Genetic ablation of miR-142 caused impaired megakaryocyte maturation, inhibition of polyploidization, abnormal proplatelet formation, and thrombocytopenia. Finally, we characterized a network of miR-142-3p targets which collectively control actin filament homeostasis, thereby ensuring proper execution of actin-dependent proplatelet formation. Our study reveals a pivotal role for miR-142 activity in megakaryocyte maturation and function, and demonstrates a critical contribution of a single miRNA in orchestrating cytoskeletal dynamics and normal hemostasis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01964.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01964.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01964.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA carries all the information needed for life. This includes the codes required for making proteins, as well as instructions on when, where, and how much of these proteins need to be produced. There are a number of ways by which cells control protein manufacturing, one of which is based on small RNAs called microRNAs. Before proteins are assembled, the DNA molecule is copied into a temporary replica dubbed messenger RNA. microRNAs are able to recognize specific messenger RNA molecules and block protein production.</p><p>microRNAs serve a very important regulatory role in our bodies and are involved in virtually all cellular processes, including the production of all classes of blood and immune cells. Platelets seal injuries and prevent excessive bleeding by creating a clot at the location of a wound. Platelets are produced in huge cellular factories called megakaryocytes, which need to have a flexible and dynamic internal skeleton or cytoskeleton to produce the platelets.</p><p>Chapnik et al. focus on one specific microRNA gene, which is vital for the production and the function of several classes of blood and immune cells. Chapnik et al. created a mouse model that does not produce one specific microRNA—miR-142—and found that mutant mice produced fewer platelets than normal mice. Although one possible explanation for this is that the mutant mice also had fewer megakaryocytes than normal, Chapnik et al. unexpectedly found that the number of megakaryocytes was in fact higher. However, these megakaryocytes do not reach functional maturity, which is required for platelet production. Many of the megakaryocytes made by the mutant mice were also smaller than normal and had an unusual cytoskeleton.</p><p>Using a genomic approach and molecular tools, Chapnik et al. show that miR-142 affects the production of several of the proteins responsible for the dynamic flexibility of the cytoskeleton in mature megakaryocytes. Therefore, a single microRNA can target multiple different proteins that coordinate the same pathway in the cells that are critical for clotting and hence for human health.</p><p>miR-142 has also been suggested to have important functions in blood stem cells and in blood cancer (leukemia). Therefore, the new mouse model could be used to investigate many other facets of the blood and immune system. Further research could also focus on whether the same cytoskeletal network is in charge of miR-142 activity in other blood cells, or if miR-142 silences different targets in different cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01964.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01964.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

Megakaryocytes (MKs) display a distinctive miRNA expression pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garzon et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Opalinska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). However, functional genetic studies dissecting the role of miRNA in megakaryopoiesis are still limited.</p><p>In the present work, we focused on miR-142, a hematopoietic-specific miRNA, which resides in a genomic locus that was previously associated with t(8;17) translocation in B-cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauwerky et al., 1989</xref>). Pioneering experimental evidence has suggested miR-142 involvement in lymphocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2004</xref>) and recently, miR-142 was also shown to play a role in the specification of definitive hemangioblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nimmo et al., 2013</xref>), and in lymphoid and myeloid lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauwerky et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Belz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lagrange et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nimmo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sonda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sun et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, miR-142 is involved in the compound immune response to North American eastern equine encephalitis virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trobaugh et al., 2014</xref>) and our work uncovered a key role for miR-142 in the maintenance of CD4<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mildner et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>MK maturation is an intricate process that involves DNA replication in the absence of cytoplasmic division, termed endomitosis. Polyploid MKs also exhibit distinctive cytoskeletal rearrangements that enable the biosynthesis of platelets (also known as thrombocytes). The elaborated actin cytoskeleton of MKs is uniquely organized in a way that allows cytoplasmic proplatelet protrusions to bend and bifurcate into multiple tips, from which platelets are subsequently released to the bloodstream. Dysregulation of the actin cytoskeleton impairs the generation of mature platelets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartwig and Italiano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bender et al., 2010</xref>). Accordingly, actin-modulating genes were shown to be crucial for MK maturation and have been implicated in the etiology of platelet-related disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Villa et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kajiwara et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>We characterize miR-142-deficient mice that display an array of hematological defects, including pronounced thrombocytopenia. We show that miR-142 controls multiple facets of MK differentiation including control of cell size, ploidy, and proplatelet elaboration. Furthermore, we demonstrate that miR-142-3p controls platelet biosynthesis by orchestrating the coordinated expression of several distinct nodes in a network of actin cytoskeleton regulators. Our study reveals a novel miRNA-dependent circuit that maintains cytoskeletal integrity, and suggests that a single miRNA may broadly regulate cell function by controlling a coherent set of effectors in a given pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>miR-142 controls thrombopoiesis</title><p>A miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> allele was created by insertion of an exogenous gene trap sequence ∼50 bp upstream of the murine pre-miR-142.

We next re-introduced miR-142-3p into differentiated MKs, using dsRNA mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The introduction of miR-142-3p was sufficient to recapitulate WT PPF levels in cells that are genetically miR-142-deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of miR-142-3p mimics in WT MKs did not yield any significant increase in PPF levels. Thus, miR-142-3p activity is essential for proper MK maturation and its loss results in defective platelet biogenesis. Furthermore, since re-introduction of miR-142-3p into miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> differentiated MKs restored functional identity, we conclude that there might be a continuous requirement for miR-142-3p activity to maintain MK maturity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Disturbed actin cytoskeletal dynamics in the absence of miR-142</title><p>Dynamic rearrangement and organization of MK cytoskeletal structures is essential for normal megakaryopoiesis, endomitosis, and platelet production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartwig and Italiano, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lordier et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thon and Italiano, 2012</xref>).

To enhance the power of our analysis, we next focused on targets that were commonly up-regulated in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs as well as in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> CD24<sup>+</sup> and CD24<sup>-</sup> in vitro-derived DCs that we previously characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mildner et al., 2013</xref>). Forty genes were found to be commonly up-regulated in all three miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> hematopoietic cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Figure 5—source data 2</xref>). This list is highly enriched with direct miR-142-3p putative targets (12 out of 40 genes). Subsequent DAVID analysis performed on these genes uncovered a significant enrichment for actin- and cytoskeleton-related functional GO categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Indeed, half of the dozen predicted miR-142-3p targets encode for pivotal actin cytoskeleton-associated proteins, including Cofilin-2 (Cfl2), Glucocorticoid receptor DNA binding factor 1 (Grlf1), Biorientation of chromosomes in cell division 1 (Bod1), Integrin alpha V (Itgav), Twinfilin-1 (Twf1), and Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome-like (Wasl). Intriguingly, the latter was recently suggested as a potential target of miR-142-3p in the process of actin-mediated mycobacterial infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bettencourt et al., 2013</xref>). The up-regulation of these six miR-142-3p targets in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs, was further confirmed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Among these targets, Cfl2 expression was also found to be up-regulated in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MkPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Introducing of miR-142-3p into differentiated MKs, using dsRNA mimetics, was sufficient to normalize the expression levels of representative miR-142-3p targets, Wasl and Cfl2 in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Western blot analysis revealed up-regulation of the protein products of Wasl and Cfl2 in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs, further substantiating them as bona fide miR-142-3p targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). Using luciferase reporter assays, we showed that the mRNAs of Wasl, Cfl2, Grlf1, Itgav and Twf1 are directly targeted by miR-142-3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4</xref>). Furthermore, the quantitative contributions of individual binding sites within the target 3′ UTR was revealed by stepwise loss of miR-142 regulation, when miR-142-3p binding sites were sequentially mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3 fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplements 3 and 4</xref>). Taken together, we discovered that the expression of a compound set of actin cytoskeleton regulators is post-transcriptionally controlled by miR-142-3p.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>miR-142-3p targets a battery of actin cytoskeleton regulators to facilitate proplatelet formation</title><p>miR-142-deficient MKs displayed perturbed actin filament dynamics and diminished proplatelet formation. This is presumably due to de-repression of several actin cytoskeleton components, including Wasl, Cfl2, Twf1, Itgav or Grlf1, which are all direct miR-142-3p targets. Thus, we hypothesized that knocking down these miR-142-3p targets may relieve the PPF defect in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs. For this purpose, we transduced FL-derived MKs with short hairpin RNA (shRNA)-expressing lentiviral vectors that effectively knocked-down targets with more than three miR-142-3p binding sites, namely Wasl, Cfl2 or Grlf1 (shWasl, shCfl2 and shGrlf1, respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). A lentivirus encoding a shRNA directed against RFP (shRFP) was employed as a control. Following transduction, differentiation of MKs was induced and PPF was quantified 3 days later. The PPF defect was clearly evident in miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs transduced with shRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In contrast, miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs that were transduced with shRNA directed against Cfl2, Wasl, Grlf1, displayed a prominent elevation of PPF levels, and approximated levels observed in control WT MKs transduced with shRFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>). This strong elevation in PPF levels was limited to miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> MKs, whereas in WT MKs, knockdown of miR-142-3p targets did not significantly alter PPF levels, except for Wasl-targeting shRNA that exhibited a modest increase in PPF efficacy following transduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Additional pairwise target comparison revealed compound relationships between miR-142-3p targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Remarkably, knockdown of both Cfl2 and Wasl, which carry out opposing functions within the actin regulatory network, did not yield any significant increase in PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Conversely, concomitant Cfl2 and Grlf1 knockdown, two proteins that are important for destabilizing actin polymers, enhanced PPF in miR-142 null MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Lastly, a pool of shRNA against miR-142-3p targets was able to fully restore PPF capacity to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>).

Our analysis unveils the critical functions of miR-142 in the MK lineage. Using a recently-established mouse model, we show that deletion of the miR-142 allele results in pronounced thrombocytopenia. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies and culture assays reveal that proper miR-142 function is essential, in a cell-intrinsic manner, for MK maturation, including control of cell size, polyploidization and proplatelet elaboration.</p><p>Furthermore, MKs require sustained miR-142-3p expression, as re-introduction of synthetic miR-142-3p mimetics, even onto differentiated MKs, was sufficient to restore functional maturity.</p><p>Mechanistically, we demonstrate that miR-142-3p mediates the repression of an interconnected set of actin cytoskeleton regulators. These collectively contribute to MK maturation and their dysregulation is responsible for incomplete maturation observed in miR-142-deficient MKs. Very often, the sets of target genes that are predicted to be regulated by a particular miRNAs do not coalesce into coherent networks with distinct biological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stark et al., 2005</xref>). However, our work provides a clear example of an individual miRNA that co-regulates a network of functionally-associated targets. Indeed, the ability of a miRNA to modulate the expression of multiple targets within the same pathway simultaneously was previously suggested in other cellular contexts. For instance, the bicistronic miR-143/145 miRNA gene cluster dictates smooth-muscle cell phenotypic switching by orchestrating the expression of a cadre of cytoskeletal remodeling regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Xin et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, miR-125 family members control hematopoietic stem cell pool size by targeting a cohort of proapoptotic genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ooi et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore, a single miRNA that cumulatively targets several nodes within the same biological circuit may serve as an effective means to control cellular behavior.</p><p>The actin cytoskeleton participates in a wide array of cellular functions, and the dynamic turnover between its F-actin and monomeric G-actin forms is regulated by a large number of actin-binding proteins. Within this cytoskeletal regulatory network, the set of genes targeted by miR-142-3p contains components with divergent functions. For example, Cfl2 and Twf1 participate in disassembly of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bamburg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moseley et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, Grlf1 is a GTPase activating protein that has been implicated in disruption of the organized actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGlade et al., 1993</xref>). Wasl, on the other hand, promotes actin polymerization by catalyzing filament branching together with the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rotty et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, miR-142 deficiency destabilizes feedback loops required for actin filament homeostasis, stress fiber formation, and actin remodeling. This in turn impairs proplatelet generation and plausibly other MK-intrinsic cellular functions, such as endomitosis. It is also likely that additional miR-142-3p targets participate in the regulation of MK differentiation. For example, the over-representation of miR-142-deficient MkPs might result from a dysregulation of a distinct set of targets that are not necessarily related to actin regulation.</p><p>Repression of miR-142-3p actin-associated targets was found to be sufficient for restoring PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs. Interestingly, knocking down the same targets in WT MKs did not result in significant increase in PPF capacity over WT baseline levels. This might be related to a certain threshold in PPF levels that cannot be crossed, even when regulation of miR-142-3p is mimicked.</p><p>In summary, our analysis suggests a cardinal role for miR-142 in maturation of MKs, and in particular in controlling a network of chief actin regulators to facilitate MK terminal differentiation. The data challenges the prevailing paradigm, that miRNAs exert only subtle effects, often elicited by specific stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebert and Sharp, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mendell and Olson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pelaez and Carthew, 2012</xref>), by providing <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that genetic manipulation of a single miRNA may have a significant impact on cellular commitment and differentiation.</p><p>Several platelet disorders have been associated with mutations in genes involved in actin organization, including Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (WASP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Massaad et al., 2013</xref>) and Actinin alpha 1 (ACTN1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kunishima et al., 2013</xref>). Because miR-142 locus is involved in B-cell leukemogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauwerky et al., 1989</xref>) and since miR-142 is necessary for CD4+ DCs development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mildner et al., 2013</xref>) and MK differentiation, miR-142 may function as a broad hematopoietic pro-differentiation factor. Thus, changes in miR-142 levels or activity may lead to platelet disorders or to hematopoietic malignancies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of miR-142<sup>−/−</sup> mice</title><p>Mice strains were housed and handled in accordance with protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of WIS.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Elaine Fuchs (Reviewing editor); David Baltimore (peer reviewer). The other reviewer is remaining anonymous.</p><p>Your manuscript has now been seen by three experts in the field. As you can see from the reviews included at the end of this email, the comments are largely favorable and all agree that your work is potentially important and well-suited for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. They indicate that for the most part, your evidence demonstrates that miR-142 is required for megakaryopoiesis and MK maturation into platelets, and that it functions by modeling cytoskeleton. That said, there are some significant concerns that will need to be addressed prior to moving forward with this paper.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) Reviewers 1 and 2 raise issues regarding the extent to which you've documented that miR-142-3p is truly responsible for the phenotypes you describe. This seems especially critical given that the knockout was made through a gene trap strategy. Reviewer 1 points out that to argue the point that the observed megakaryopoiesis phenotype is solely due to miR-142‐3p loss, you should demonstrate that by introducing the 3p into the KO, you can fully restore functional MK maturation and platelet biogenesis. Along these lines, it also seems important to at least address whether miR-142b-5p on the other strand is expressed in your cells, whether the gene trap also disrupts its expression, and if so, whether it contributes to the observed megakaryopoiesis phenotype. Finally, reviewer 2 points out that even though you demonstrate the complete loss of miR-142, it is not clear whether the gene trap interferes with e.g. the noncoding RNA that is immediately downstream of the miR-142 coding region. While full rescues in vivo may be beyond the scope of the present study, you should at least confirm the phenotypes and address these points by re-introducing miR-142, 3p, and if relevant, 5p and Brzp1, into your sorted cells for in vitro rescue validations that the phenotypic consequences are indeed due to miR-142-3p loss.</p><p>2) Reviewers 2 and 3 persuasively point out the weakness in the data that allows you to conclude that up-regulation of actin-and cytoskeleton-related genes in miR-142 KO cells are responsible for their decreased platelet phenotype. Reviewer 3 suggests relatively straightforward in vitro experiments to bolster your data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-I</xref>. Reviewer 2 asks for Western quantification in addition to qPCR and luciferase assays, and this seems reasonable. Again, with in vitro studies, which should not take so long to perform, further dissection could be done of how the derepression of actin targets contributes to the observed actin defects.

Several lines pointed to the mechanism that efficient megakaryopoiesis is achieved through regulating a cohort of actin cytoskeleton regulators. This finding is of significant importance. Most of the conclusions are drawn based on well-presented evidence. However, there are a few points as suggested below need to be further addressed before being considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>: 1) miR-142b-3p resides on the (+) strand while there is another miRNA that resides within the same locus transcribed from the (-) strand; is miR-142b-5p expressed in this system? Does the gene trap also disrupt its expression? If so, does it contribute to the observed megakaryopoiesis phenotype?</p><p>2) The authors show that knocking down of miR-142's targets in miR-142-depleted MKs rescues PPF formation; how about earlier stages of megakaryopoiesis including MkP production and endomitosis where miR-142-/- MKs already reveals pronounced defects?</p><p>3) To help argue the point that the observed megakaryopoiesis phenotype is solely due to miR-142-3p loss, the authors should demonstrate that by supplementing miR-142-/- MK with miR-142-3p, they can fully restore functional MK maturation and platelet biogenesis.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Chapnik et al., describes differentiation defects in a miR-142 KO mouse during megakaryopoiesis. They demonstrated that miR-142, a miRNA highly expressed in hematopoietic lineages, is required for megakaryocyte maturation, in part through regulation of actin dynamics. The work represents an important contribution to understanding miRNA functions in the hematopoietic system and further supports miRNA networks as an important layer of regulation in diverse biological processes. I have several major concerns that should be addressed by the authors.</p><p>Major issues:</p><p>1) The KO mouse model was generated by a gene-trap strategy instead of a targeted approach. Although the authors demonstrated the complete loss of miR-142, it is not clear whether the insertion of the lacZ cassette interferes with other gene expression e.g. a noncoding RNA Bzrap1 is immediately downstream of the miR-142 coding region. The authors should confirm the phenotypes by re-introducing miR-142 to their sorted cells for at least in vitro validation.</p><p>2) miR-142 appears to widely express in hematopoietic lineages. Recent studies from zebrafish indicate important functions of miR-142 in HSC specification and differentiation (Lu X et al, Cell Research 2013; Nimmo et al., Dev Cell 2013). Although the current work focuses on megakaryopoiesis, the authors should at least discuss whether potential HSC defects could contribute to the observed defects in megakaryocytes. In particular, recent clonal analysis of HSCs indicates individual HSCs may contribute differently to distinct lineages (Lu R et al., Nature Biotech 2011). Since miR-142 is broadly expressed in almost all hematopoietic cells, these additional studies could provide critical insights for whether this miRNA has megakaryocyte-specific functions or more broadly involved in multiple cell types.</p><p>3) The authors have identified a number of miR-142 targets regulating the actin network through experimental and bioinformatic analyses. For target validation, they should provide Western quantification in addition to qPCR and luciferase assays. Furthermore, although multiple targets are all involved in regulating the actin dynamics, they have divergent functions as pointed out by the authors. For example, Cfl2, Twf1 and Grlf1 function in disassembly of actin filaments whereas Was1 promotes actin polymerization. Thus, it is critical to further dissect how the derepression of these targets contributes to the observed actin defects. Since the authors already knocked down individual targets with shRNA and, surprisingly, observed similar rescue between Grlf1/Cfl1 (disassembly factors) and Was1 (polymerization factor), they should address the issue how the dosage of these competing factors regulated by miR-142 plays important roles in the MK differentiation.</p><p>4) miRNA-mediated regulation is often subtle. However, Cfl1 mRNA is upregulated more than 8-fold in the KO (5D) despite the luc assay shows modest regulation (5F). Does the level of Cfl1 mRNA also indirectly regulated by the loss of miR-142?</p><p>5) The knockdown of individual targets by shRNA appears to be quite strong (Figure S4) e.g. 70-90% downregulation in the mRNA level. However, the upregulation of these mRNAs in miR-142 is generally modest except for Cfl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Thus, it's surprising that the knockdown of these targets only showed impact in the KO cells but not in the WT cells. I would assume the levels of these genes are probably similarly downregulated by these potent shRNAs in both WT and KO cells. Can the authors provide any further explanation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this report, Chapnik et al. used miR-142 deleted mice to explore its role in hematopoiesis and found that it plays a role in platelet development. Accompanying this phenotype, they also reported that the megakaryocyte progenitor population was increased in the miR-142 null mice in the bone marrow and spleen. This effect was attributed to a cell intrinsic mechanism through the use of CD45.1/CD45.2 bone marrow chimera experiments. In complement with additional in vitro experiments, the authors conclude that miR-142 is important for maturation of megakaryocytes. The data presented in the manuscript supports this conclusion. Using genomic approaches, the authors identified a set of actin-related genes that were up-regulated upon miR-142 deletion. They suggest through 3'UTR reporter assays that these genes are direct targets of miR-142. Using RNAi techniques, the authors knocked down the expression of the actin-related genes in miR-142-/- cells and found that it rescued the ability of MKs to generate proplatelets using an in vitro proplatelet formation assay.</p><p>Overall, this manuscript is well written and their data in general supports their conclusion. The manuscript reveals a new function of miR-142 and puts miR-142 as a partial regulator of megakaryocytic maturation. However, their conclusion that up-regulation of actin- and cytoskeleton-related genes in miR-142-/- cells is responsible for their decreased platelet phenotype could be strengthened with additional experiments. The ultimate experiments would be to show that RNAi of these genes could increase platelet generation and decrease MkP population in the miR-142-/- mice. However, this requires additional long and laborious experiments. Thus, the authors could alternatively provide further in vitro evidence along with the experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H-I</xref> (see comment #8 among the minor points). In summary, there are no major problems with this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01964.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Reviewers 1 and 2 raise issues regarding the extent to which you've documented that miR-142-3p is truly responsible for the phenotypes you describe. This seems especially critical given that the knockout was made through a gene trap strategy. Reviewer 1 points out that to argue the point that the observed megakaryopoiesis phenotype is solely due to miR-142‐3p loss, you should demonstrate that by introducing the 3p into the KO, you can fully restore functional MK maturation and platelet biogenesis</italic>.</p><p>We have reintroduced miR-142-3p into the null model and ameliorated the megakaryocyte (MK) maturity defects, providing persuasive evidence that mature miR-142-3p is responsible for the observed phenotypes reported in our manuscript. The task was a major challenge because primary MKs are notoriously resilient to transfection. After being unsuccessful with commercially-available reagents, we tested a reagent that was recently developed in the labs of Shula Michaeli and Jean-Paul Lellouche at Bar Ilan University. This previously-unpublished reagent was critical for re-introduction of miR-142-3p into MKs and is a robust tool that will be probably utilized by many others in the field. It drove us to add the new tool into the Methods section and 4 additional authors that developed the reagent.</p><p>The cellular and molecular signature observed by re-gaining miR-142-3p function is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig5">Figures 3 and 5</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref> reports that the re-introduction of miR-142-3p using dsRNA mimetics was sufficient to restore WT PPF levels to miR-142-deficient differentiated MKs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, which focuses on targets of miR-142 upstream of a panel of cytoskeletal regulatory genes, we added a new panel 5E showing that dsRNA overexpression on the background of the genetic null allele recovers the molecular fingerprints of regulation. Thus, re-introduction of miR-142-3p using dsRNA mimetics was sufficient to restore Wasl and Cfl2 expression levels in miR-142-deficient differentiated MKs.</p><p>The relevant Results section reads: “Proplatelet formation (PPF) represents the final phase of MK maturation, culminating in platelet release into the bloodstream (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Machlus and Italiano, 2013</xref>). To analyze whether miR-142 is involved in this process we performed an ex vivo PPF study on FL-derived MKs. Remarkably, we observed a striking 3-fold reduction in miR-142–/– MKs that were extending proplatelets, relative to control MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). We next re-introduced miR-142-3p into differentiated MKs, using dsRNA mimetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>). The introduction of miR-142-3p was sufficient to recapitulate WT PPF levels in cells that are genetically miR-142-deficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Conversely, overexpression of miR-142-3p mimics in WT MKs did not yield any significant increase in PPF levels. Thus, miR-142-3p activity is essential for proper MK maturation and its loss results in defective platelet biogenesis.”</p><p>Importantly, the new sets of experiments allowed to make a new and important conclusion in the Results section: ”Furthermore, since re-introduction of miR-142-3p into miR-142-/- differentiated MKs restored functional identity, we conclude that there might be a continuous requirement for miR-142-3p activity to maintain MK maturity.” And in the Discussion: “…MKs require sustained miR-142-3p expression, as re-introduction of synthetic miR-142-3p mimetics, even onto differentiated MKs, was sufficient to restore functional maturity.”</p><p><italic>Along these lines, it also seems important to at least address whether miR-142b-5p on the other strand is expressed in your cells, whether the gene trap also disrupts its expression, and if so, whether it contributes to the observed megakaryopoiesis phenotype. Finally, reviewer 2 points out that even though you demonstrate the complete loss of miR-142, it is not clear whether the gene trap interferes with e.g. the noncoding RNA that is immediately downstream of the miR-142 coding region. While full rescues in vivo may be beyond the scope of the present study, you should at least confirm the phenotypes and address these points by re-introducing miR-142, 3p, and if relevant, 5p and Brzp1, into your sorted cells for in vitro rescue validations that the phenotypic consequences are indeed due to miR-142-3p loss</italic>.</p><p>We added data that resolve concerns for both miR-142-5p and Brzp1 in a satisfactory manner. Our measurements reveal that miR-142-5p is expressed hundreds of folds less than miR-142-3p in megakarycyte and practically behaves like a typical ‘passenger’ strand and is discarded during the assembly process of the guide strand (miR-142-3p) into the RISC. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. To the relevant text we added another reference that clearly views miR-142-5p as a passenger (non-functional) strand: “miR-142-3p is the guide strand from the miR-142 hairpin, whereas the sister ‘passenger’ miR-142-5p strand is expressed in negligible levels ((<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nimmo et al., 2013</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Reviewer 3 suggests relatively straightforward in vitro experiments to bolster your data shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5H-I</italic></xref><italic>. Reviewer 2 asks for Western quantification in addition to qPCR and luciferase assays, and this seems reasonable. Again, with in vitro studies, which should not take so long to perform, further dissection could be done of how the derepression of actin targets contributes to the observed actin defects</italic>.</p><p>Measuring mRNA levels is an accepted practice in the miRNA field and some leading groups in the field suggest that in fact ‘mammalian microRNAs predominantly act to decrease target mRNA levels’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2010</xref> Nature. 466(7308):835-40). However, to comply with the reviewers’ request, we now provide on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> panels F-G assessment of target protein levels for representative miR-142-3p target genes, which substantiate our analysis. For the Western blot analysis, lysates from WT and miR-142–/– FL–derived MKs were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. WASL (F) and COFILIN-2 (G) were immunodetected and assessed by densitometry. The results section on page 10 reads: “Western blot analysis revealed upregulation of the protein products of Wasl and Cfl2 in miR-142–/– MKs, further substantiating them as bona fide miR-142-3p targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F-G</xref>)”. We were unsuccessful in getting a purchased antibody against mouse Grlf1, another target of miR-142-3p, to work.</p><p><italic>Determining how the dosage affects your competing factors Grlf1/Cfl1 versus Was 1 again will help to discern miR142 functions in this regard</italic>.</p><p>We performed additional experiments to further test the impact of different actin factors, which were described in the original submission. In a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> we organized data supporting the claim that miR-142-3p targets a battery of actin cytoskeleton regulators to facilitate proplatelet formation. Panels 6B and 6C reveal the impact of miR-142<sup>–/–</sup> MKs that were further transduced with shRNAs targeting individual (B), paired (C), or a combined set (B-C) of targets in restoring PPF levels.</p><p>As envisioned by the reviewers, more detailed analysis provided additional information. For example: Either Wasl or Cofilin knockdown restored PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs (i.e., recovered the wild-type phenotype). However, the knockdown of both targets simultaneously did not rescue the phenotype, presumably because of the opposing activity of Cofilin and Wasl on actin filamentous state. Another observation is that concomitant Cfl2 and Grlf1 knockdown, two proteins that are important for destabilizing actin polymers, enhanced PPF in miR-142 null MKs. The relevant Results section reads: “Additional pairwise target comparison revealed compound relationships between miR-142-3p targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6–figure supplement 2B</xref>). Remarkably, knockdown of both Cfl2 and Wasl, which carry out opposing functions within the actin regulatory network, did not yielded any significant increase in PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Conversely, concomitant Cfl2 and Grlf1 knockdown, two proteins that are important for destabilizing actin polymers, enhanced PPF in miR-142 null MKs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Lastly, a pool of shRNA against miR-142-3p targets was able to fully restore PPF capacity to WT levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>). These data demonstrate that the expression of a set of actin cytoskeleton regulators should be tightly orchestrated by miR-142-3p in order to effectively promote platelet biogenesis.”</p><p>We further discuss how competing factors regulated by miR-142 may play important roles in the MK differentiation, while staying focused and sincere to the main claim of the work: “The actin cytoskeleton participates in a wide array of cellular functions, and the dynamic turnover between its F-actin and monomeric G-actin forms is regulated by a large number of actin-binding proteins. Within this cytoskeletal regulatory network, the set of genes targeted by miR-142-3p contains components with divergent functions. For example, Cfl2 and Twf1 participate in disassembly of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bamburg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moseley et al., 2006</xref>). Likewise, Grlf1 is a GTPase activating protein that has been implicated in disruption of the organized actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGlade et al., 1993</xref>). Wasl, on the other hand, promotes actin polymerization by catalyzing filament branching together with the Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rotty et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, miR-142 deficiency destabilizes feedback loops required for actin filament homeostasis, stress fiber formation and actin remodeling. This in turn impairs proplatelet generation and plausibly other MK-intrinsic cellular functions.”</p><p><italic>And explanations/discussions of whether the knockdown of your targets truly only show impact in KO and not WT cells are merited</italic>.</p><p>We discuss why shRNA knockdown of targets impacted the KO cells more than WT cells: “Repression of miR-142-3p actin-associated targets was found to be sufficient in restoring PPF levels in miR-142-deficient MKs. Interestingly, knocking down the same targets in WT MKs did not result in significant increase in PPF capacity over WT baseline levels. This might be related to a certain threshold in PPF levels that cannot be crossed, even when regulation of miR-142-3p is mimicked.”</p><p><italic>3) Reviewer 1 suggests that it will be valuable in aiding interpretation to analyze earlier stages of megakaryopoiesis where miR-142 KO MKs already show pronounced defects</italic>.</p><p>In the revisions we measured several molecular markers of megakaryopoiesis to further characterize the affected steps in megakaryocyte differentiation in bipotent MK–erythroid precursors (PreMegEs) and downstream unipotent MK-progenitors (MkPs). We incorporated these new data into the work in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2 C,D</xref> and Results: “To gain insight into the impact of miR-142 nullification on early MK development, we performed a high–resolution flow cytometry assay for the characterization of myeloerythroid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pronk and Bryder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pronk et al., 2007</xref>)… Intriguingly, the expression levels of regulatory markers of MK development […namely Gata1 Gata2, Zfpm1, Klf1, Spi1, Fli1, Runx1, Tal1] remained largely unchanged in miR-142–/– PreMegEs and MkPs, relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).”</p><p>In the Discussion we state: “miR-142 is dispensable for development of PreMegE, the bi-potent precursors of erythrocytes and MKs and the defects associated with miR-142 deficiency mostly relate to various facets of MK maturity, including increase in cell size, polyploidization and proplatelet elaboration.”</p><p>We further clarify in the revised manuscript that actin regulation is probably not the sole pathway downstream of miR-142 and other targets may be involved in regulating MkP proliferation and/or endomitosis. We also state: “It is also likely that additional miR-142 targets participate in the regulation of MK differentiation. For example, the over-representation of miR-142-deficient MkPs might result from a dysregulation of a distinct set of targets that are not necessarily related to actin regulation.”</p><p><italic>4) On the textual side, Reviewer 2 points out that miR-142 appears to widely express in hematopoietic lineages, and there are several key published papers that indicate important functions of miR-142 in HSC specification and differentiation. These should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We revised the Introduction and Discussion as requested and refer to other recently-published papers related to miR-142 activity in the hematopoietic lineage: “In the present work, we focused on miR-142, a hematopoietic-specific miRNA, which resides in a genomic locus that was previously associated with t(8;17) translocation in B–cell leukemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gauwerky et al., 1989</xref>).

Furthermore, the expression levels of several regulatory markers of MK development, including Gata1 Gata2, Zfpm1, Klf1, Spi1, Fli1, Runx1, Tal1, all remained unchanged in miR-142–/– PreMegEs. Even downstream at MK progenitors, most markers are unchanged and only Spi1, Fli1 are slightly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>).
