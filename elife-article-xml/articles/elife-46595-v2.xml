Ceapins specifically inhibit the UPR sensor ATF6α, an ER-tethered transcription factor, by retaining it at the ER through an unknown mechanism. Our genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen reveals that Ceapins function is completely dependent on the ABCD3 peroxisomal transporter. Proteomics studies establish that ABCD3 physically associates with ER-resident ATF6α in cells and in vitro in a Ceapin-dependent manner. Ceapins induce the neomorphic association of ER and peroxisomes by directly tethering the cytosolic domain of ATF6α to ABCD3’s transmembrane regions without inhibiting or depending on ABCD3 transporter activity. Thus, our studies reveal that Ceapins function by chemical-induced misdirection which explains their remarkable specificity and opens up new mechanistic routes for drug development and synthetic biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>unfolded protein response</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>small molecule inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name><name><surname>Walter</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM111126</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stroud</surname><given-names>Robert M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2 OD021007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kampmann</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ceapins specifically inhibit the unfolded protein sensor ATF6α by directly tethering the cytosolic domain of ATF6α to ABCD3 in cells and in vitro.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of folding and assembly of secreted and transmembrane proteins. When ER homeostasis is disturbed, misfolded proteins accumulate and activate the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). One of the ER-resident UPR sensors, ATF6α, is an ER-tethered transcription factor that is cytoprotective and necessary for cell survival when cells experience ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yamamoto et al., 2007</xref>). Under stress conditions, ATF6α traffics to the Golgi apparatus, where it undergoes intramembrane proteolysis, releasing a bZIP transcription factor domain that moves to the nucleus and activates transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Haze et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yoshida et al., 1998</xref>). The events leading to ATF6α activation and trafficking remain poorly understood, but require the Golgi-resident proteases S1P and S2P and general components involved in COPII trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nadanaka et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Okada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schindler and Schekman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ye et al., 2000</xref>) that are not specific to ATF6α.</p><p>Using a cell-based high-throughput screen, we recently identified a series of selective small-molecule inhibitors of ATF6α signaling, termed Ceapins (from the Irish verb ‘ceap’ meaning ‘to trap’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>). Ceapins act on the most upstream step of ATF6α activation by retaining ATF6α at the ER and excluding it from ER exit sites during ER stress. When this trafficking requirement is removed by collapsing the Golgi apparatus into the ER, making ATF6α accessible to S1P and S2P, ATF6α is still cleavable by the proteases in the presence of Ceapin. Upon Ceapin treatment, ATF6α rapidly and reversibly forms foci without requiring new protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gallagher et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gallagher and Walter, 2016</xref>). The molecular target(s) of Ceapins, let alone how Ceapins specifically inhibit ATF6α, especially in light of the fact that activation depends on components that are shared by other cellular process, have remained an enigma.</p><p>To identify the molecular target of Ceapin, we carried out an unbiased genome-wide screen and proteomic analysis. Our approaches converged on a single target, the peroxisomal transporter ABCD3. ATF6α and ABCD3 normally do not interact and, indeed, localize to different parts of the cell. Ceapins induce these novel physical associations between ATF6α and ABCD3 in cells and in vitro. Our results indicate that Ceapins achieve their remarkable specificity through an unprecedented mechanism of small molecule induced inter-organelle tethering.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ABCD3 KD desensitizes cells to Ceapin-A7</title><p>To decipher the molecular mechanism of Ceapins, we carried out a genome-wide CRISPR interference (CRISPRi) screen to identify genes whose knockdown (KD) resulted in reduced or enhanced sensitivity to the drug.

We knocked down these candidates individually and performed ERSE-mCherry dose response assays using Tm.

This result was surprising because newly synthesized ABCD3 is inserted directly into the peroxisomal membrane using PEX19 as import receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Imanaka et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biermanns and Gärtner, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashiwayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kashiwayama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>).

Since both ABCD3 and PEX19 scored as hits in our screen, it seemed plausible that Ceapin induces ATF6α colocalization with peroxisomal ABCD3. We next tested whether ATF6α also colocalized with other peroxisomal markers, peroxisomal membrane protein PEX14 and peroxisomal matrix protein Thiolase (a maker for mature import competent peroxisomes). In the absence of Ceapin, ATF6α and PEX14 or Thiolase did not colocalize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

Furthermore, in ABCD3 KD cells treated with Ceapin, ATF6α no longer formed foci or colocalized with peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). This result was consistent in PEX19 KD cells, where peroxisome biogenesis is affected and ABCD3 is no longer chaperoned and targeted to the peroxisome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kashiwayama et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kashiwayama et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sacksteder et al., 2000</xref>), ATF6α no longer formed foci in the presence of Ceapin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Elizabeth A Miller as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from the Walter and Weissman labs aims to understand the mechanism of action of a UPR modulator, Ceapin, which acts on ATF6 to prevent its transport to the Golgi and subsequent activation. Using genome-wide KO approaches, the authors identify components that abrogate Ceapin-mediated UPR inhibition, identifying the peroxisomal ABC transporter, ABCD3, as a primary target. Through a subsequent set of thorough experiments, the authors establish that Ceapin triggers an interaction between ATF6 and ABCD3, which tethers peroxisomes to the ER and precludes traffic of AFT6 to the Golgi, presumably by steric effects. The conclusions are well-supported and uncover a novel mechanism of action for a UPR modulator, as well as suggest a new anchor-away method that will be of interest to the broader research community.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewers had significant enthusiasm for the study, and overall the experiments were convincing and the conclusions largely well-supported. There are several important points raised by reviewers that don't change the conclusions of the paper, but that we agree are important to address before publication. Of particular importance is the question of the foci that ATF6 becomes anchored to upon Ceapin treatment – given that some peroxisomal membrane proteins are first inserted into the ER, it seems a formal possibility that the foci are pre-peroxisomal vesicles rather than peroxisomes. Although this doesn't change the conclusion of how Ceapin impacts ATF6 ER retention, it does affect the specific model invoked and thus is an important question. Related questions about stoichiometry and ATF6 activation are also important and speak to the model.</p><p>Thus essential revisions include: (i) address the potential question of whether ABCD3 recruits ATF6 to a bona fide peroxisome, or whether an ER subdomain or pre-peroxisomal vesicle might be the anchor; (ii) address the related question of stoichiometry to determine whether sufficient ABCD3 is expressed to quantitatively retain ATF6; (iii) check activation of ATF6 directly by immunoblot rather than reporter assay; (iv) address the questions about other candidates that were not explored further.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>My only major point would be that the authors don't formally demonstrate that Golgi localization and/or processing of ATF6 is restored in the ABCD3 KO + stress + Ceapin condition. It seems to be assumed that traffic and processing is restored, but this is not shown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a very interesting piece of work. The data presented are comprehensive and greatly improve our understanding of how Ceapins specifically inhibit ATF6α. The manuscript is well-written, clear, and easy to understand. I recommend publication of this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> after considering one major point that could have a major impact on the validity of the exciting model for Ceapin action that the authors propose (induction of a neomorphic inter-organelle tether).</p><p>Specifically, from my understanding of the literature there is a difference of opinion regarding how peroxisomal membrane proteins (PMPs such as PMP70, also known as ABCD3) end up in the peroxisome: (1) PMPs are synthesized in the cytosol and recruited into peroxisomes or (2) PMPs are first inserted into the ER membrane and then the PMP-containing pre-peroxisomal vesicle is pinched off from ER membrane. The issue of alternative models for peroxisome biogenesis is discussed in detail in Smith et al., 2013.</p><p>The authors make great use of the first option to propose a model for Ceapin-induced ATF6α inhibition (Figure 7). However, my understanding is that it is debatable whether ABCD3 is inserted directly into the peroxisomal membrane from the cytosol (as mentioned in subsection “ABCD3 is required for Ceapin-induced ATF6α foci” of this manuscript). Therefore, I am currently not convinced by the reasoning of the authors in subsection “ABCD3 is required for Ceapin-induced ATF6α foci”, and thus am not convinced by the proposed model in Figure 7 or, for that matter, that the manuscript title is appropriate. In fact, if I give credence to the model that PMPs are first inserted into ER membrane and then the PMP-containing pre-peroxisomal vesicles are pinched off from ER membrane, I could propose another model for Ceapin action that I believe is fully consistent with all the data provided in this manuscript (including work on the cytosolic domain of ATF6α). That is, Ceapin initiates the recruitment of ATF6α to the ER-derived pre-peroxisomal vesicle through ABCD3.</p><p>Citations that motivate my suggestion of the alternative model for Ceapin function are the following: Although commonly used as a reliable marker for peroxisomes, there appears to be evidence that PMP70 (or ABCD3) also presents in specialized subdomains of the ER that are continuous with a peroxisomal reticulum from which mature peroxisomes arose (Geuze et al., 2003; Smith et al., 2013. Similarly, PEX14 (found to be colocalized with ATF6α in the presence of Ceapin) is also found in these pre-peroxisomal vesicles (Joshi et al., 2016; Joshi et al., 2018). If my interpretation of the literature is right, it could provide an alternative explanation for how Ceapin induces the formation of ATF6α foci. In addition, if ATF6α could partially be translocated to the peroxisomal vesicle, it would explain the reduced activity of ATF6α in the presence of Ceapin.</p><p>I believe that microscopy methods such as conventional immunofluorescent imaging (probing for ER-resident proteins, ATF6s, and ABCD3 or PEX14 (or PEX19?) or immunolabelled electron microscopy could answer whether or not the proposed model in Figure 7 is valid or whether the alternative explanation mentioned above could be relevant. If the alternative model cannot be falsified, at a minimum the title and abstract of the paper should change to account for this fact and the Discussion section should address these issues.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>1) According to the presented data, ATF6α is fixed to the ER membrane due to the interaction with ABCD3 mediated by Ceapin-A7. There is no description about the molecular number of these proteins in the cell. Is ABCD3 quantitatively expressed enough numbers more than ATF6α in the cell? I am very concerned with the stoichiometry of these molecules. In IF studies (ex. Figure 2D), green colored ATF6α looks more expressed than ABCD3.</p><p>2) Although the authors obtained 20 candidates, they focused on ABCD3 and PEX19 without further explanation.

We focus on ABCD3 and do not generalize to all PMPs since there is detailed work characterizing the trafficking of newly synthesized ABCD3.</p><p>To answer the question posed of whether ABCD3 is directly inserted into the peroxisome, we have added an additional citation (Imanaka et al., 1996), showing ABCD3 inserts directly into peroxisomes in vivo and in vitro. In their in vitro reconstitution system they show ABCD3 is inserted into peroxisomes and not mitochondria. The peroxisomal membrane protein targeting signal (mPTS) for ABCD3 has also been defined (Kashiwayama et al., 2007). We previously cited proximity specific ribosome profiling experiments in HEK293 cells where proteins co-translationally translocated into the ER were globally identified. We have added a new supplemental figure (Figure 2—figure supplement 1) with these data (Jan et al., 2014), indicating ABCD3 is not co-translationally translocated into the ER. As a positive control we highlight PEX16, which has been shown to be co-translationally translocated into the ER in mammalian cells (Smith et al., 2013) and is co-translationally translocated in this dataset.</p><p>In (Stroobants et al., 2001, Geuze et al., 2013), they propose a model where peroxisome biogenesis begins at specialized ER sites that separate into a reticular lamella and then transition into globular peroxisomes.

When Ceapin is washed out, ATF6α in foci quickly redistribute into the ER.
