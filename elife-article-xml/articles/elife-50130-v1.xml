The PCM expands dramatically as cells prepare to enter mitosis (a process termed centrosome maturation), but it is unclear how this expansion is achieved. In flies, Spd-2 and Cnn are thought to form a scaffold around the mother centriole that recruits other components of the mitotic PCM, and the Polo-dependent phosphorylation of Cnn at the centrosome is crucial for scaffold assembly. Here, we show that, like Cnn, Spd-2 is specifically phosphorylated at centrosomes. This phosphorylation appears to create multiple phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs that allow Spd-2 to recruit Polo to the expanding scaffold. If the ability of Spd-2 to recruit Polo is impaired, the scaffold is initially assembled around the mother centriole, but it cannot expand outwards, and centrosome maturation fails. Our findings suggest that interactions between Spd-2, Polo and Cnn form a positive feedback loop that drives the dramatic expansion of the mitotic PCM in fly embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>pericentriolar material</kwd><kwd>polo kinase</kwd><kwd>Spd-2</kwd><kwd>feedback loop</kwd><kwd>centriole</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome Trust Senior Investigator Award, 104575</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steinacker</surname><given-names>Thomas L</given-names></name><name><surname>Saurya</surname><given-names>Saroj</given-names></name><name><surname>Conduit</surname><given-names>Paul T</given-names></name><name><surname>Novak</surname><given-names>Zsofia A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wainman</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name><name><surname>Raff</surname><given-names>Jordan W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome Trust PhD studentship, 109096</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alvarez-Rodrigo</surname><given-names>Ines</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome Trust Strategic Award, 107457 (partially supported)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wainman</surname><given-names>Alan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edward Penley Abraham Scholarship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Baumbach</surname><given-names>Janina</given-names></name><name><surname>Aydogan</surname><given-names>Mustafa G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Polo kinase recruitment by the protein Spd-2 to the pericentriolar scaffold is a key element of the positive feedback loop which drives the expansion of the mitotic centrosomes in flies.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Centrosomes play an important part in many aspects of cell organisation, and they form when a mother centriole recruits pericentriolar material (PCM) around itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>). The PCM contains several hundred proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alves-Cruzeiro et al., 2014</xref>), allowing the centrosome to function as a major microtubule (MT) organising centre, and also as an important coordination centre and signalling hub (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chavali et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vertii et al., 2016</xref>). Centrosome dysfunction has been linked to several human diseases and developmental disorders, including cancer, microcephaly and dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bettencourt-Dias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nigg and Raff, 2009</xref>).</p><p>During interphase, the mother centriole recruits a small amount of PCM that is highly organised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lawo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mennella et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sonnen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>). As cells prepare to enter mitosis, however, the PCM expands dramatically around the mother centriole in a process termed centrosome maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palazzo et al., 2000</xref>). Electron microscopy (EM) studies suggest that centrioles organise an extensive ‘scaffold’ structure during mitosis that surrounds the mother centriole and recruits other PCM components such as the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Moritz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schnackenberg et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>In the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, a relatively simple pathway seems to govern the assembly of this mitotic PCM scaffold. The conserved centriole/centrosome protein Spd-2/SPD-2 (fly/worm nomenclature) cooperates with a large, predominantly predicted-coiled-coil, protein (Cnn in flies, SPD-5 in worms) to form a scaffold whose assembly is stimulated by the phosphorylation of Cnn/SPD-5 by the mitotic protein kinase Polo/PLK-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woodruff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wueseke et al., 2016</xref>). Mitotic centrosome maturation is abolished in the absence of this pathway, and some aspects of Cnn and SPD-5 scaffold assembly have recently been reconstituted in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Woodruff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>).

In vertebrate cells another centriole and PCM protein, Pericentrin, also has an important role in mitotic centrosome assembly that is dependent upon its phosphorylation by Plk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lee and Rhee, 2011</xref>). Pericentrin can interact with Cep215/Cnn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buchman et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kim and Rhee, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lerit et al., 2015</xref>), but in flies the Pericentrin-like-protein (Plp) has a clear, but relatively minor, role in mitotic PCM assembly when compared to Spd-2 and Cnn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lerit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martinez-Campos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Richens et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Although most of the main players in mitotic centrosome-scaffold assembly appear to have been identified, several fundamental aspects of the assembly process remain mysterious. Cells entering mitosis, for example, contain two mother centrioles that assemble two mitotic centrosomes of equal size. It is unclear how this is achieved, as even a slight difference in the initial size of the two growing centrosomes would be expected to lead to asymmetric centrosome growth—as the larger centrosome would more efficiently compete for scaffolding subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zwicker et al., 2014</xref>). The centrioles in fly embryos appear to overcome this problem by constructing the PCM scaffold from the ‘inside-out’: Spd-2 and Cnn are only incorporated into the scaffold close to the mother centriole, and they then flux outwards to form an expanded scaffold around the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>). In this way, the growing PCM scaffold could ultimately attain a consistent steady-state size—where incorporation around the mother centriole is balanced by loss of the scaffold at the centrosome periphery—irrespective of any initial size difference in the PCM prior to mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raff, 2019</xref>).</p><p>A potential problem with this ‘inside-out’ mode of assembly is that the rate of centrosome growth is limited by the very small size of the centriole. Mathematical modelling indicates that the incorporation of a crucial PCM scaffolding component only around the mother centriole cannot easily account for the high rates of mitotic centrosome growth observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zwicker et al., 2014</xref>). To overcome this problem, it has been proposed that centrosome growth is ‘autocatalytic’, with the centriole initially recruiting a key scaffolding component that can subsequently promote its own recruitment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Woodruff et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zwicker et al., 2014</xref>). It has been proposed that Spd-2 and Cnn could form a positive feedback loop that might serve such an autocatalytic function: Spd-2 helps recruit Cnn into the scaffold, and Cnn then helps to maintain Spd-2 within the scaffold, thus allowing higher levels of Spd-2 to accumulate around the mother centriole, which in turn drives higher rates of Cnn incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raff, 2019</xref>).</p><p>In worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Decker et al., 2011</xref>) and vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joukov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meng et al., 2015</xref>), SPD-2/Cep192 can help recruit PLK1/Plk1 to centrosomes and Cep192 also activates Plk1 in vertebrates, in part through recruiting and activating Aurora A, another mitotic protein kinase implicated in centrosome maturation. We suspected, therefore, that in flies Spd-2 might recruit Polo into the centrosome-scaffold to phosphorylate Cnn and so help to generate a positive feedback loop that drives the expansion of the mitotic PCM. In flies, however, no interaction between Polo and Spd-2 has been reported. Indeed, an extensive Y2H screen for interactions between key centriole and centrosome proteins identified interactions between Spd-2 and the mitotic kinases Aurora A and Nek2, and between Polo and the centriole proteins Sas-4, Ana1 and Ana2, but not between Polo and Spd-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galletta et al., 2016</xref>). A possible explanation for this result is that Polo/Plk1 is believed to be largely recruited to its many different locations in the cell, including centrosomes, through its Polo-Box-Domain (PBD), which binds to phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Elia et al., 2003a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elia et al., 2003b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reynolds and Ohkura, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Seong et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Song et al., 2000</xref>). Perhaps any such Polo binding sites in fly Spd-2 were simply not phosphorylated in the Y2H experiments. In support of this possibility, phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs in SPD-2/Cep192 have previously been shown to help recruit PLK1/Plk1 to centrosomes in worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Decker et al., 2011</xref>), frogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joukov et al., 2010</xref>) and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meng et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we examine the potential role of Spd-2 in recruiting Polo to centrosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. We find that, like Cnn, Spd-2 is largely unphosphorylated in the cytosol, but is highly phosphorylated at centrosomes, where Spd-2 and Polo extensively co-localise within the pericentriolar scaffold. We show that a Spd-2 fragment containing 19 S-S/T motifs exhibits enhanced binding to the PBD in vitro when it has been phosphorylated by Plk1, but no enhancement is seen if these S-S/T motifs are mutated to T-S/T—a mutation that strongly perturbs PBD binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elia et al., 2003b</xref>). We express forms of Spd-2 in vivo in which either all 34 S-S/T motifs, or the 16 most conserved S-S/T motifs, have been mutated to T-S/T to perturb PBD-binding. These mutant Spd-2 proteins are still recruited to mother centrioles, as are Polo and Cnn, and these proteins assemble a PCM scaffold around the mother centriole. Strikingly, however, this PCM scaffold can no longer expand outwards, and centrosome maturation fails. These observations provide strong support for the hypothesis that Spd-2, Polo and Cnn cooperate to form a positive feedback loop that is required to drive the rapid expansion of the mitotic PCM in fly embryos.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spd-2 is phosphorylated specifically at centrosomes</title><p>We showed previously that Cnn is specifically phosphorylated at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2014a</xref>), so we wondered if this was also the case for Spd-2. We partially purified centrosomes from embryo extracts by sucrose step-gradient centrifugation and compared the electrophoretic mobility of Spd-2 on western blots of the gradient fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). As was the case for Cnn, we observed a prominent slower migrating form of Spd-2 in the heavier centrosomal fractions that was largely absent in the lighter cytosolic fractions. However, unlike Cnn, a faster migrating form of Spd-2 was also present in the centrosomal fractions. Treatment of the centrosomal fractions with phosphatase revealed that the reduced mobility of Spd-2 in the centrosomal fractions could be attributed to phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, like Cnn, Spd-2 is specifically phosphorylated at centrosomes, although not all the Spd-2 at the centrosome appears to be phosphorylated.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50130.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Spd-2 is phosphorylated at centrosomes and can bind the PBD in vitro in a manner that is enhanced by phoshorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot of a sucrose step-gradient purification of centrosomes from embryo extracts probed with anti-Cnn, Spd-2, γ-tubulin and Actin antibodies, as indicated.

Enhanced binding of GST-PBD to the phosphorylated WT protein was observed in all three experiments, but was somewhat variable. Due to the variation and the small sample size (n = 3), we were unable to determine whether the data was normally distributed, so we could not apply parametric tests for statistical significance. Non-parametric tests did not indicate a significant increase in binding to the phosphorylated protein (p&lt;0.05), but these tests do not work well with such a low number of repeats.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1sdata1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50130.004</object-id><label>Figure 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> source data, quantification of GST-PBD signal.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-50130-fig1-data1-v1.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50130-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig1s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50130.003</object-id><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Mutation of several centrosomal phosphosites in Spd-2 appears to have only a small effect on the centrosomal function of Spd-2 in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot analysis of WT or <italic>Spd-2</italic> mutant larval brain cells expressing either Spd-2-GFP or Spd-2-11A-GFP (as indicated).

Full-length Spd-2 fusion proteins were unstable when expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic>, so we purified an MBP-fusion containing approximately the middle 1/3 of Spd-2 (aa352-758, <bold>MBP-Spd-2-WT</bold>), a fusion that we had previously purified and raised antibodies against (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dix and Raff, 2007</xref>). This fusion protein contained 19 S-S/T motifs and, when phosphorylated by recombinant human Plk1 in vitro, it exhibited an enhanced ability to co-immunoprecipitate (IP) with recombinant GST-PBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Importantly, this phosphorylation-enhanced binding to GST-PBD was abolished when these 19 S-S/T motifs were mutated to T-S/T (<bold>MBP-Spd-2–19T</bold>)—a conservative substitution that has nevertheless been shown to perturb PBD-binding to these motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Elia et al., 2003b</xref>). Thus, a fragment of Spd-2 can bind directly to the PBD in a manner that is enhanced when the fragment is phosphorylated by Plk1, and this enhanced binding is prevented when the S-S/T motifs are mutated to T-S/T. Interestingly, this suggests that, in vitro at least, Plk1 can phosphorylate Spd-2 to ‘prime’ its own binding to Spd-2.</p><p>To test the potential role of Spd-2 in recruiting Polo to the mitotic PCM in vivo, we generated transgenic lines expressing a Spd-2-GFP fusion in which all 34 S-S/T motifs in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> Spd-2 were mutated to T-S/T (<bold>Spd-2-ALL-GFP</bold>) (<italic>blue</italic> and <italic>red</italic> lines, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Syncytial <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos rapidly cycle between S- and M-phases without any Gap phases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Foe and Alberts, 1983</xref>). When the embryos exit mitosis they immediately enter S-phase and the centrosomes start to mature in preparation for the next round of mitosis; thus, the centrosomes in these syncytial embryos organise a relatively robust, mitotic-like, PCM at all stages. WT Spd-2-GFP localised strongly to centrosomes, and the centrosomes organised robust astral and spindle MT arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, left panels). The mutant proteins were less abundant at centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>) and the astral MT arrays organised by the centrosomes were less robust (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,C</xref>) (see ‘Analysis of centrosome and MT fluorescence intensities’ section in the Materials and methods for a full explanation of quantification methods); as a result, centrosomes were often detached from the spindle poles (<italic>arrowheads</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Note that the reduced centrosomal levels of the Spd-2 mutant proteins are unlikely to be due to their lower expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), as the Spd-2-GFP-11A mutant protein was also present at reduced levels, but localised to centrosomes nearly normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We conclude that the mutant Spd-2-GFP fusions allow the assembly of a centrosome that can support pronuclear fusion, but these centrosomes cannot properly support the rapid syncytial divisions—and so the embryos accumulate mitotic defects and die during early development.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50130.016</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Centrosomes in Spd-2-CONS and Spd-2-ALL embryos recruit less Spd-2 and organise fewer MTs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Micrographs show stills of living <italic>Spd-2</italic> mutant embryos expressing the MT-marker Jupiter-mCherry (<italic>red</italic>) and either WT Spd-2-GFP, Spd-2-CONS-GFP or Spd-2-ALL-GFP (<italic>green</italic>, as indicated).

A potential caveat to this interpretation is that Spd-2 proteins could form homo-oligomers, potentially allowing a largely misfolded mutant protein to oligomerise with a WT partner that then localises the mutant protein correctly.

The co-expression of Polo-GFP with the mutant Spd-2-mCherry proteins led to mitotic defects in embryos that were more severe than those observed when mutant GFP- or mCherry-fusions were expressed in the absence of Polo-GFP, suggesting that the GFP-tagged Polo sensitises the embryos to the expression of the mutant Spd-2-fusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We therefore independently mutated the 17 S-S/T motifs in the N-terminal and C-terminal regions of Spd-2 to T-S/T (Spd-2-NT-mKate2 and Spd-2-CT-mKate2, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Perhaps these mutations prevent PCM expansion for some other reason, and so Polo cannot be recruited to the expanded mitotic PCM because it simply does not exist in these embryos. Our mRNA injection assay potentially allowed us to address this issue. We looked for embryos injected with mRNA encoding Spd-2-CONS-mKate2 where the loss of Polo-GFP from the centrosome was just becoming apparent. We then used 3D-SIM to compare the centrosomal recruitment of mutant Spd-2-mKate2 and Polo-GFP to similarly staged controls injected with WT Spd-2-mKate2 mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). We found that Spd-2-CONS-mKate2 could often still be detected in an expanded PCM even when the amount of Polo recruited to the scaffold was severely reduced. Thus, in these centrosomes at least, an expanded PCM is still present (presumably because some unlabelled endogenous Spd-2 is still present), but the recruitment of Polo is severely reduced (presumably because the Spd-2-CONS-mKate2 in the scaffold cannot recruit Polo efficiently).

Although many of the key proteins required for centrosome maturation have been identified, how these proteins drive this process is unclear. We have previously proposed that three proteins—Spd-2, Polo and Cnn—together form a scaffold that expands around the mother centriole to recruit other PCM components to the mitotic centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>).

Solid black lines indicate recruitment, solid orange line indicates phosphorylation, dashed line indicates that Cnn does not <italic>recruit</italic> Spd-2, but rather helps to <italic>stabilise</italic> the Spd-2 scaffold that has been recruited to the mother centriole and is fluxing outwards. Polo may phosphorylate Spd-2 to create additional S-S/T(p) motifs that can then recruit more Polo, but this is not depicted here. This circuit is a classical positive feedback loop; ultimately, however, it relies on the mother centriole as a source of Spd-2, because Cnn itself cannot recruit more Spd-2 or Polo into the scaffold. (<bold>B,C</bold>) Schematics illustrate the process of centrosome maturation in a WT cell (B), and a cell in which Spd-2 cannot recruit Polo (C). During interphase (i), Spd-2, Polo and Cnn are all recruited to the mother centriole. Polo is inactive, Spd-2 and Cnn are not phosphorylated, so no scaffold forms. As cells prepare to enter mitosis (ii), Polo is activated, and the centrosomal Spd-2 and Cnn are phosphorylated, allowing them to initially assemble into a ‘mini-scaffold’ around the mother centriole. The phosphorylated Spd-2 scaffold then starts to flux away from the mother centriole (<italic>red arrows</italic>). In normal cells (B[iii]), the expanding Spd-2 scaffold recruits more Cnn and more Polo, allowing more Cnn scaffold to assemble. The Cnn scaffold cannot recruit more Spd-2 or Polo, but it stabilises the expanding Spd-2 scaffold; this allows the Spd-2 scaffold to accumulate around the mother centriole. This creates a positive feedback loop that drives an increasing rate of expansion of the Spd-2 and Cnn scaffolds around the mother centriole. If the expanding Spd-2 scaffold cannot recruit Polo (C[iii]), the Cnn recruited to the expanding Spd-2 scaffold is too far away from the centriole to get phosphorylated by Polo so it cannot form a scaffold and rapidly dissipates into the cytosol (<italic>orange</italic> arrows). The positive feedback loop is broken, and centrosome maturation fails.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50130-fig11-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We propose the following model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). In interphase cells, Spd-2, Polo and Cnn are recruited around the surface of the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fu and Glover, 2012</xref>), but Polo is inactive and Spd-2 and Cnn are not phosphorylated—so no scaffold is assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Bi</xref>). As cells prepare to enter mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Bii</xref>), centrosomal Spd-2 becomes phosphorylated. Our in vitro data suggests that Polo is involved in this phosphorylation (via a ‘self-priming and binding’ mechanism), but other mitotic kinases may also be involved. Phosphorylation allows Spd-2 to form a scaffold (<italic>red</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Bii</xref>) that fluxes outwards (<italic>red arrows</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Bii</xref>) and that can recruit both Polo (via phosphorylated S-S/T(p) motifs) and Cnn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>). The active Polo (<italic>blue</italic> dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Bii</xref>) phosphorylates Cnn (orange arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>), allowing it to also form a scaffold (<italic>green</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Bii</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Conduit et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). The Spd-2 scaffold is inherently unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>), so it can only accumulate around the mother centriole if it is stabilised by the Cnn scaffold (<italic>dotted arrow</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). The Cnn scaffold therefore allows the Spd-2 scaffold to expand outward, increasing Spd-2 levels within the PCM scaffold and allowing Spd-2 to recruit more Cnn and more Polo into the scaffold. This is a classical positive feedback loop in which the Output (the PCM scaffold <italic>in toto</italic>) directly increases the Input (the Spd-2 scaffold).</p><p>If Spd-2 cannot efficiently recruit Polo, as appears to be the case with the Spd-2-ALL and Spd-2-CONS mutants, it can still recruit Cnn, and this is, at least initially, phosphorylated by the pool of Polo that is still present around the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Our data suggests that this centriolar pool of Polo is not recruited by Spd-2 (at least not via the PBD), and we suspect that S-S/T(p) motifs in other centriole proteins, such as Sas-4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Novak et al., 2016</xref>), normally recruit Polo to centrioles. As a result, mutant Spd-2 proteins can still support the assembly of a ‘mini-scaffold’ around the mother centriole, and this can recruit some PCM and organise some MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Cii</xref>). The mutant Spd-2 scaffold that fluxes outwards from the mother centriole, however, cannot recruit Polo. Therefore the Cnn recruited by the expanding Spd-2 network cannot be phosphorylated, and it cannot form a scaffold to support the expanding Spd-2 network. As a result, the expanding mitotic PCM scaffold rapidly dissipates into the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11Ciii</xref>).</p><p>Although this mechanism is autocatalytic—as the expanding Spd-2 scaffold allows Polo and Cnn to be recruited into the PCM at an increasing rate—crucially, the mother centriole remains the only source of Spd-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). This potentially explains the conundrum of how mitotic PCM growth is autocatalytic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zwicker et al., 2014</xref>), but at the same time requires the mother centriole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basto et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabral et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirkham et al., 2003</xref>). This requirement for centrioles can also potentially explain how two spatially separated centrosomes usually grow their mitotic PCM to the same size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raff, 2019</xref>), as PCM size may ultimately be determined by how much Spd-2 can be provided by the centrioles, rather than how much PCM was present in the centrosome when maturation was initiated.</p><p>A key feature of this proposed mechanism is that Cnn cannot recruit itself or Spd-2 or Polo into the scaffold (although it helps to maintain the Spd-2 scaffold recruited by the centriole; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). If it could do so, mitotic PCM growth would no longer be constrained by the centriole as Cnn could catalyse its own recruitment. Interestingly, although Spd-2 and Cnn are of similar size in flies (1146aa and 1148aa, respectively) Spd-2 has &gt;5X more conserved potential PBD-binding S-S/T motifs than Cnn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, a similar ratio of conserved sites is found when comparing human Cep192 (1941aa) to human Cep215/Cdk5Rap2 (1893aa) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), even though the human and fly homologues of both proteins share only limited amino acid identity. Perhaps, these two protein families have evolved to ensure that phosphorylated Spd-2/Cep192 can efficiently recruit Polo/Plk1, whereas phosphorylated Cnn/Cep215 cannot.</p><p>Our data indicates that multiple S-S/T(p) motifs in Spd-2 may be involved in Polo recruitment to the PCM. When only the most conserved motifs are mutated, other motifs in Spd-2 appear to be able to help recruit Polo, as evidenced by the additive effect of the Spd-2-ALL mutant compared to the Spd-2-CONS mutant. This mechanism of multi-site phosphorylation and recruitment could help amplify the maturation process (as the additional Polo recruited would allow Cnn to be phosphorylated at a higher rate) and so contribute to the establishment of the positive feedback loop.</p><p>Another important feature of this proposed mechanism is that Spd-2 is incorporated into the mitotic PCM at the centriole surface and then fluxes outwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>). This Spd-2-flux has so far only been observed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and mitotic brain cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Conduit et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>). In fly embryos, Cnn also fluxes outwards but, unlike Spd-2, this flux requires MTs and is only observed in embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Conduit and Raff, 2015</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos, SPD-5 behaves like Cnn in somatic cells: it does not flux outwards and is incorporated isotropically throughout the volume of the PCM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laos et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, a very recent study found no evidence for an outward centrosomal flux of SPD-2 in worm embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabral et al., 2019</xref>). Clearly, it will be important to determine whether Spd-2/Cep192 homologues flux outwards in other species and, if so, whether this flux provides the primary mechanism by which the mother centriole influences the growth of the expanding mitotic PCM.</p><p>In vertebrates, Cep192 serves as a scaffold for Plk1 and also Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Joukov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joukov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meng et al., 2015</xref>)—another mitotic protein kinase that plays an important part in centrosome maturation in many species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barr and Gergely, 2007</xref>). There appears to be a complex interplay between Cep192, Plk-1 and Aurora A in vertebrates, with Cep192 acting as a scaffold that allows these two important regulators of mitosis to influence each other’s activity and centrosomal localisation. Spd-2 clearly plays an important part in recruiting Aurora A to centrosomes in fly cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dobbelaere et al., 2008</xref>)—although it is unclear if this is direct, as fly and worm Spd-2/SPD-2 both lack the N-terminal region in vertebrate Cep192 that recruits Aurora A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Meng et al., 2015</xref>). How Aurora A might influence the assembly of the Spd-2, Polo/PLK-1 and Cnn/SPD-5 scaffold remains to be determined, although in worms AIR-1 (the Aurora A homologue) is required to initiate centrosome maturation, but is not required for subsequent PCM growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cabral et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Finally, there has been great interest recently in the idea that many non-membrane bound organelles like the centrosome may assemble as ‘condensates’ formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Boeynaems et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Raff, 2019</xref>). In support of this possibility for the centrosome, purified recombinant SPD-5 can assemble into condensates in vitro that have transient liquid-like properties, although they rapidly harden into a more viscous gel- or solid-like phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Woodruff et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, a mathematical model that describes centrosome maturation in the early worm embryo treats the centrosome as a liquid, and it is from this model that the importance of autocatalysis was first recognised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zwicker et al., 2014</xref>). In vivo, however, the Cnn and SPD-5 scaffolds do not appear to be very liquid-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conduit et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conduit et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Laos et al., 2015</xref>) and fragments of Cnn can assemble into micron-scale assemblies in vitro that are clearly solid- or very viscous-gel-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Feng et al., 2017</xref>). Our data suggests that the incorporation of Spd-2 into the PCM only at the surface of the centriole, coupled to an amplifying Spd-2/Polo/Cnn positive feedback loop, could provide an ‘autocatalytic’ mechanism that functions within the conceptual framework of a non-liquid-like scaffold that emanates from the mother centriole.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Key resources table</title><p>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Fly husbandry, stocks and handling</title><p>Flies were kept at 25°C or 18°C on <italic>Drosophila</italic> culture medium (0.77% agar, 6.9% maize, 0.8% soya, 1.4% yeast, 6.9% malt, 1.9% molasses, 0.5% propionic acid, 0.03% ortho-phosphoric acid and 0.3% nipagin).

Each individual centrosome profile was then normalised to the average peak intensity for all the centrosomes of the control condition (WT Spd-2-GFP embryos). Each profile was then mirrored to produce a full centrosome profile. The final radial profiles shown are an average of all the full centrosomal profiles per condition. In some graphs, we show a ‘normalised’ profile, where each individual centrosome profile was normalised to the average peak intensity of its corresponding condition (rather than to the WT Spd-2-GFP embryo control).

They felt that proving this point is not necessarily straightforward in the scope of a simple revision (leaving the possibility open that those experiments disprove the model, or it might be not straightforward to design the experiments to prove this point).</p><p>With that said, all reviewers are enthusiastic about this study overall: although we cannot consider publication of your manuscript at this point per <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy to invite revision only if the revision experiments are straightforward and the results are unlikely to change the major conclusions, we would be happy to reconsider your work as a new submission, if you're able to address the major points of reviewers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;A positive feedback loop drives centrosome maturation in flies&quot; by Alvarez-Rodrigo et al. investigates the regulation of centrosome maturation when cells prepare for mitosis, by focusing on the expansion of the pericentriolar material (PCM). In particular, the authors analyze the involvement of Spd-2 and Polo in this process and study potential phosphorylation sites in Spd-2 that may help recruit Polo and that seem to be important for pericentriolar scaffold assembly and expansion, including the recruitment of other essential PCM proteins such as γ-tubulin to the expanded scaffold. They propose that Spd-2 is an essential component of a feedback mechanism that involves recruitment of Polo to drive incorporation and phosphorylation of Cnn near centrioles and subsequent outward movement of Cnn-Spd-2, thereby contributing to assembly of an expanded PCM. This process is driven by continuous Spd-2-Polo-dependent incorporation of additional Cnn near centrioles and its outward flux.</p><p>Overall this is a very nice story that puts together various previous and new observations into an appealing model to explain the mechanism by which centrosomes mature, at least in flies.</p><p>The paper is very well written and the data are presented clearly.</p><p>However, I found one major issue with this work that needs to be addressed. In my opinion the authors do not provide convincing evidence for a core element of their model: the role of Spd-2 in Polo recruitment.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) The authors state &quot;Based on our observations below, we refer to these mutant proteins as being unable to recruit Polo.&quot; However, the recruitment of Polo to Spd-2 is never demonstrated in the first place. I understand that the interaction is supposed to happen specifically at the centrosome, so immunoprecipitation from soluble extract is most likely not an option, but can the author provide any evidence for a direct interaction of Polo with Spd-2?</p><p>2) The observations that follow the authors' statement do not demonstrate the inability of the mutants to recruit Polo: it is shown that the mutants partially rescue embryos lacking Spd-2, that mutants are less concentrated at centrosomes, that these centrosomes have less MTs, and that mutants and Polo localize around centrioles but do not assemble into an expanded pericentriolar scaffold. This latter finding is the only piece of data in support of the proposed role of Spd-2 in Polo binding. However, as the authors also state, in these experiments the scaffold may simply not assemble. In this case the reduced Polo signal could simply be the result of the absence of an expanded scaffold and not necessarily due to lack of binding to Spd-2.</p><p>3) The demonstration that Spd-2 is phosphorylated at centrosomes is very convincing (Figure 1). However, it was not tested whether this phosphorylation is at least partially Polo-dependent. This could indicate interaction with Polo at centrosomes.</p><p>4) Figure 2: Are the mutants still phosphorylated at centrosomes? This should be revealed by an analysis as in Figure 1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In the manuscript by Alvarez-Rodrigo et al. entitled &quot;A positive feedback loop drives centrosome maturation in flies&quot; the authors aim to show that the interactions between Spd2-Polo-Cnn drive an autocatalytic expansion of the PCM to ensure synchronized growth of sister centrosomes. Based on a minimal Polo box binding consensus sequence, the authors mutated Spd2 to prevent Polo binding and then characterized the effects on fly viability, Spd2 localization, and PCM expansion. They found that increasing the mutational burden on Spd2 reduces PCM expansion and localization of centrosome components during centrosome maturation. If the authors were able to show the mechanism in Figure 10, this would constitute a major contribution to the centrosome field. Unfortunately, the lack of justification or biological relevance behind the authors' approach prevent them from achieving this goal. Therefore, I do not believe the manuscript should be published without extensive changes to the approach or substantial work to justify and validate their approach.</p><p>The authors perform initial MS/MS to identify the phosphorylated residues on Spd2 which may be a prerequisite for Polo binding. They then mutated these residues and found mild Spd2 defects that did not recapitulate the phenotypes found in the CONS or ALL mutants. From these data, it appears that mutating the biologically relevant sites was not sufficient to produce a phenotype, so the authors moved on to mutating a substantial number of serine residues in Spd2 only because it appears in a minimal consensus sequence. This approach led to studying the effects of a massively mutated protein without regard to the biology of the system.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors do not provide evidence that the Spd2 mutants result in an inability of Polo to bind Spd2. Perhaps Polo can bind Spd2 through non-canonical sites? That may be the case because the authors present evidence that Polo is still recruited to the centriole and functions properly, as Cnn is phosphorylated and centrioles are still able to disengage properly. Are the Spd2 mutants still being phosphorylated, as in Figure 1? This can be answered with their established method in Figure 1 and by mass spectrometry. Is mutant Spd2 still able to homodimerize and interact with Cnn? The lab has previously established a yeast 2-hybrid assay and has used SEC-MALS, both of which could be used to test this. Spd2 also interacts with Asterless and PLP. Do the Spd CONS or ALL mutants disrupt these interactions, which may explain the mutant phenotypes? Further biochemical analysis of mutant Spd2 should be performed to show that the mutants do not cause protein misfolding.</p><p>Although their discussion and conclusions are intriguing and could provide insight into how centrosome maturation may be regulated, I do not feel they have provided sufficient evidence to support these conclusions. Additionally, while there is a striking phenotype in the manuscript, the authors have only shown that this is caused by mutating Spd2. They have not shown that this is due to disrupting the interaction with Polo, let alone disrupting a potential positive feedback loop, as implied by the title of their manuscript, which is misleading.</p><p>Additional concerns:</p><p>1) All experiments are performed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, whereas the authors claim that the mechanism is universal to the entire fly &quot;in vivo&quot;. This should be toned down.</p><p>2) The manuscript would benefit from more details of the mitotic defects in Figure 2A.</p><p>3) Are Spd2ALL, Spd2<sup>-/-</sup> heterozygotes viable or can reduced dosage explain the phenotypes in Figure 5—figure supplement 1?</p><p>4) The images of centrosomes in Figures 4-6 appear to be S-phase centrosomes with flares, not mitotic centrosomes. The authors reference mitosis and maturation when, in fact, they show images of interphase (S-phase) centrosomes. The authors should show low magnification images of mitotic spindles and then high magnification insets of centrosomes to demonstrate that they are, in fact, examining mitotic centrosomes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>In this manuscript, the authors show that Spd-2 is partially phosphorylated at centrosomes, allowing the recruitment of Polo to the centrosomes. Disabling the recruitment leads to outward pericentriolar scaffold expansion failure, and prevents centrosome maturation. The authors also demonstrate that Polo, Spd-2 and Cnn together can drives mitotic centrosome expansion by forming a positive feed-back loop. This is an interesting paper with data of high quality. I note the following issue the authors need to consider:</p><p>1) The authors should provide direct evidence about how much Spd-2-CONS and Spd-2-ALL are affects their binding with the Polo PBD compared to WT, which is critical for most of their conclusions. I'm concerned that mutating all 34 Serine sites may affect protein structure and this needs to be ruled out.</p><p>2) Do the authors now if the phosphorylation status is altered during the cell cycle?</p><p>3) Figure 4: authors conclude that the inability of mutant proteins to recruit Polo reduces the assembly and/or maintenance of this mixed scaffold, but the data shown can't exclude the possibility that mutant proteins are efficiently incorporated into the scaffold. The author should show a comparison of endogenous Spd-2 scaffold in all three conditions.</p><p>4) Figure 5: I'm not convinced by the authors' conclusion that the pericentriolar scaffold cannot expand because Spd-2-CON can't recruit Polo. First, they co-localize at the mother centriole, and second, Spd-2-CON itself is affecting scaffold formation in Spd-2 mutant background (Figure 4), so how can they be certain it's a Polo recruitment issue? I would potentially suggest a FRAP experiment to showcase the recruitment of Polo to the scaffold. In addition, apart from co-expressing with Polo-GFP, what's the difference between Figure 5B and Figure 4A (middle lane)? Why is there's a huge difference between the ratios (64/36 vs 9/91)? This was confusing to me.</p><p>5) Figure 7: what is the component of the scaffold? If the scaffold is made of Spd-2, when Spd-2 CONS is unable to form the scaffold, you won't be able to see other proteins there no matter how they are recruited. Is there any other marker for the scaffold?</p><p>6) Figure 9: The C-terminus of Spd-2 contains most of the conserved Serine sites, but the authors show that mutation N-terminal sites have the biggest effect? What do the authors think the molecular basis for this is?</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Evidence that a positive feedback loop drives centrosome maturation in fly embryos&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

I feel that the authors have addressed my original concerns with one remaining issue. Regarding the immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments between the MBP-phospho-Spd2 fragment and GST-PBD (new Figure 1C), the resolution of these immunoblots appear low and the brightness/contrast altered such that it is difficult to gauge the load between the samples. It appears that there is more GST-PBD in the MBP-Spd-2 WT immunoprecipitate, but how much more? Replacing these with higher resolution blots with accompanying quantitation would be appropriate. This is an important experiment/result because it demonstrates that the authors have in fact generated a Spd-2 Polo-binding mutant. Also, is the kinase being used human Plk1, whereas the Spd-2 and PBD proteins are fly? Whatever the species, the fact that the authors used proteins from different organisms should be stated in the Results section.</p><p>I also recommend a couple of text changes in this section. The authors state that binding of the 19T mutant was reduced to background levels. How do they know this is background? This could be real binding and, therefore, would remain at WT levels, not a reduced level. The authors end this section stating, &quot;Thus, a fragment of Spd-2 can bind directly to the PBD when phosphorylated, and this binding is prevented when the S-S/T motifs are mutated to T-S/T&quot;. Based on the data, it looks to me that binding is not prevented. Instead, they should say that phosphorylation of Spd-2 increases PDB binding which, in my opinion, is what the data shows. The data also suggest that Polo activity primes it's binding to Spd-2 (as they state in the Discussion) but this important finding should also be emphasized here at the end of this Results section.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In their revised manuscript the authors have addressed my concerns by providing new experiments and additional discussion/explanation.</p><p>My main concerns were the lack of evidence for interaction between Spd-2 and Polo and the conundrum that the reduced Polo signal at centrosomes containing Spd-2 mutants may be due to specific loss of interaction with Polo or simply due to the lack of any scaffold where Polo could be recruited.</p><p>The first concern was dealt with by providing in vitro biochemical interaction data (Figure 1C) and the second by performing a new type of quantification of the centrosomal Polo signal in cells expressing a mix of WT and mutant Spd-2, at a time point when Polo signal is just starting to become reduced (Figure 10). This approach allowed the authors to demonstrate reduced Polo signal even in cells where a Spd-2 PCM scaffold is still present. Although the data supports the authors' conclusion that Spd-2 mutants cause a specific loss of PCM associated Polo, the quantification would be more convincing if actual intensities would have been quantified for the Spd-2 scaffold and Polo signals rather than subjective classification into &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;. This is because in contrast to a similar quantification in Figure 6, where an &quot;all or nothing&quot; effect is observed, here the relative intensities of PCM scaffold-associated Spd-2 vs Polo are crucial for the result. I would suggest to also adding quantification of intensities to the figure.</p><p>My other concerns were also addressed, not in all cases with experiments, but I recognize the technical challenges that have led to this decision.</p><p>I would now support publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The revised version of the paper is much improved and the authors have addressed most of the issues raised in my initial review to the best of their abilities.

This fragment contains 19 S-S/T residues and we show that it can bind to recombinant GST-PBD, but only when it has first been phosphorylated by recombinant Plk1 (New Figure 1C). Mutating the 19 S-S/T residues in this Spd-2 fragment to T-S/T abolishes PBD-binding. These findings provide strong support for our hypothesis that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spd-2 can directly bind to the Polo-PBD when phosphorylated, and that this binding is prevented when the S-S/T sites are mutated to T-S/T.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The observations that follow the authors' statement do not demonstrate the inability of the mutants to recruit Polo: it is shown that the mutants partially rescue embryos lacking Spd-2, that mutants are less concentrated at centrosomes, that these centrosomes have less MTs, and that mutants and Polo localize around centrioles but do not assemble into an expanded pericentriolar scaffold. This latter finding is the only piece of data in support of the proposed role of Spd-2 in Polo binding. However, as the authors also state, in these experiments the scaffold may simply not assemble. In this case the reduced Polo signal could simply be the result of the absence of an expanded scaffold and not necessarily due to lack of binding to Spd-2.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this problem we have now injected mRNA encoding either WT or mutant forms of <italic>Spd-2-mKate2</italic> into embryos expressing Polo-GFP. The mRNA is gradually translated, and so the Spd-2-mKate2 fusions gradually overwhelm the endogenous untagged Spd-2. We then looked for embryos injected with the mutant mRNA where the loss of Polo from the centrosome was first becoming apparent, and compared the centrosomal recruitment of the mutant Spd-2-mKate2 and Polo-GFP to similarly staged controls (injected with WT Spd-2-mKate2 mRNA). This analysis, scored blind, revealed that mutant Spd-2-mKate2 could still be detected in an expanded PCM even when the amount of Polo recruited to the scaffold was severely reduced (New Figure 10). This is presumably because there is enough WT Spd-2 present in these embryos to form a scaffold, but the mutant Spd-2 protein present in the scaffold cannot recruit Polo. This strongly supports our conclusion that the mutant Spd-2 proteins cannot recruit Polo to the expanded PCM. Nevertheless, we agree that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that the mutant Spd-2 proteins can still bind Polo in some way, and we have toned down our statements on this point throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The demonstration that Spd-2 is phosphorylated at centrosomes is very convincing (Figure 1). However, it was not tested whether this phosphorylation is at least partially Polo-dependent.

We do now provide evidence that Polo can phosphorylate a fragment of Spd-2 in vitro to create PBD binding sites (New Figure 1C), consistent with the possibility that at least some of the phosphorylation of Spd-2 at centrosomes is Polo-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2: Are the mutants still phosphorylated at centrosomes?

We disagree that these experiments were performed “without regard to the biology”. First, it is widely accepted that MS approaches may not identify <italic>all</italic> of the relevant phosphorylation sites in a protein, and this is demonstrably the case for Spd-2, where 4 independent MS screens (3 from embryos) have identified 41 phosphorylation sites in fly Spd-2, some of which were identified in multiple screens, but many of which were not (as summarised only for the sites that are potential PBD binding motifs in Table 2). Second, we considered a large body of evidence when devising this strategy: (1) The S-S/T(P) motif is widely accepted as a PBD-binding motif and the PBD is widely considered to be essential for targeting Polo/Plk1 to centrosomes<sup>1-7</sup>; (2) All of the previously identified sites in worm, human and frog SPD-2/Cep192 that recruit Plk1 to centrosomes conform to this consensus<sup>8-11</sup>; (3) The S-S/T to T-S/T substitution is widely accepted to prevent PBD binding<sup>5,6</sup>; (4) Ser-to-Thr substitutions are considered to be very conservative in nature, and so unlikely to lead to protein misfolding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors do not provide evidence that the Spd2 mutants result in an inability of Polo to bind Spd2.

Further biochemical analysis of mutant Spd2 should be performed to show that the mutants do not cause protein misfolding.</p></disp-quote><p>In the third paragraph the reviewer raises several points. First, they ask for evidence that the Spd-2 mutants cannot bind Polo. As discussed in point 1 of our response to reviewer #1, we now provide compelling evidence that Spd-2 interacts directly with the PBD when phosphorylated, and this interaction is abolished when the putative PBD-binding motifs are mutated (New Figure 1C). Second, the reviewer highlights that the Spd-2 mutant proteins still colocalise with Polo at centrioles, suggesting that the mutant proteins are still recruiting Polo to centrioles. We now clarify that we believe Spd-2 is only required to recruit Polo to the PCM, not to the centrioles. There is strong evidence that Polo can be recruited to centrioles independently of Spd-2 by phosphorylated S-S/T(P) motifs in centriole proteins such as Sas-4<sup>12</sup>. Third, the reviewer asks whether the Spd-2 mutant proteins are still phosphorylated. Please see point 4 in our response to reviewer #1.</p><p>We have taken two approaches to address this point. First, we tested whether Spd-2 is a homodimer in fly embryos. This is crucial as, if so, a largely misfolded mutant protein might still localise to centrioles and centrosomes if it can still homodimerize with the WT protein. Using Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS), we show that cytoplasmic Spd-2 is monomeric (New Figure 5—figure supplement 1)—as was also recently shown for SPD-2 in worm embryos<sup>13</sup>. Second, with this information in hand, we examined how WT and mutant Spd-2-GFP fusion-proteins are recruited to centrioles in the presence of WT Spd-2-mCherry (which serves as a marker for the WT scaffold and also allows a scaffold to assemble even in the presence of the mutant proteins). The recruitment of the WT and mutant Spd-2-GFP fusions to the WT Spd-2-mCherry scaffold (scored blind) was essentially indistinguishable (New Figure 5). Thus, the mutant Spd-2 proteins can interact with all the proteins that recruit and maintain Spd-2 at centrioles and centrosomes, and this is unlikely to be because they are simply homodimerizing with the WT protein. Finally, we more clearly explain the significance of the data showing that the mutant Spd-2 proteins can rescue the defect in pronuclear fusion in embryos lacking Spd-2 (Figure 2C), but that these embryos still die of mitotic defects during early embryo development. This suggests that the mutant proteins allow centrioles to assemble sufficient PCM to promote the relatively slow process of pronuclear fusion, but not enough PCM to support the very rapid rounds of mitosis that follow. Taken together, these data suggest that the mutant proteins are not misfolded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional concerns:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>1) All experiments are performed in Drosophila embryos, whereas the authors claim that the mechanism is universal to the entire fly &quot;</italic>in vivo<italic>&quot;.

These heterozygous flies are indeed viable, but this is to be expected as <italic>Spd-2</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants are also viable (but female sterile). We suspect the reviewer is suggesting that because there is only one copy of <italic>Spd-2-ALL</italic> in these flies, the phenotypes we observe may be due to lowering the genetic dosage of <italic>Spd-2</italic> rather than to the mutations we introduce into the genes. We think this is unlikely for two reasons: (1) In all the experiments where we assess Spd-2-ALL- or Spd-2-CONS-fusion protein function the control is always the WT Spd-2-fusion tested at the same gene dosage; (2) The Spd-2-11A mutant protein is expressed at much lower levels than the WT protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A), yet it localises to centrosomes nearly as strongly as the WT protein (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-D). Thus, the reduction in the centrosomal levels of Spd-2-ALL and Spd-2-CONS is unlikely to simply be due a general reduction in their protein levels. We now discuss this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The images of centrosomes in Figures 4-6 appear to be S-phase centrosomes with flares, not mitotic centrosomes. The authors reference mitosis and maturation when, in fact, they show images of interphase (S-phase) centrosomes. The authors should show low magnification images of mitotic spindles and then high magnification insets of centrosomes to demonstrate that they are, in fact, examining mitotic centrosomes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer questions whether we are examining centrosomes in interphase or mitosis. We apologise for not explaining this properly. In these rapidly developing embryos the nuclei progress through successive S- and M-phases without intervening Gap-phases. As a result, the centrosomes are essentially always either <italic>in</italic> mitosis, or are <italic>preparing to enter</italic> mitosis—they are never truly in an “interphase” state where they organise only the tiny amounts of PCM one might observe in a fly somatic cell in interphase. Thus, as soon as mitosis finishes the embryos enter S-phase and the centrosomes start to mature in preparation for the next round of mitosis. We now clarify this important point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors should provide direct evidence about how much Spd-2-CONS and Spd-2-ALL are affects their binding with the Polo PBD compared to WT, which is critical for most of their conclusions.

This is entirely consistent with our model: as long as there is <italic>some</italic> WT Spd-2 in the scaffold, it should recruit Polo, which can then phosphorylate Cnn to support the expanding Spd-2 scaffold; thus, there is no requirement that <italic>every</italic> Spd-2 molecule in the scaffold be able to recruit Polo. As requested by the reviewer, we now directly address this issue by expressing either the WT or mutant Spd-2-GFP fusions in the presence of WT Spd-2-mCherry (but in the absence of any endogenous unlabelled Spd-2). This allows us to directly compare the ability of the WT and mutant GFP-fusions to incorporate into the expanding scaffold formed by the WT Spd-2-mCherry (New Figure 5). The incorporation of the WT and mutant Spd-2-GFP fusion proteins into the WT Spd-2-mCherry scaffold is essentially indistinguishable—consistent with our model.</p><p>At a first glance, this new data may appear at odds with the data shown in Figure 4B of our original submission (now superseded by New Figure 5). In this earlier experiment we showed that in the presence of WT unlabelled Spd-2, the scaffold formed by the mutant-GFP fusion proteins appears somewhat weaker than that formed by the WT-GFP fusion protein—suggesting that the presence of the mutant protein may partially inhibit the assembly of the WT scaffold (which is also consistent with our model, as presumably less Polo will be recruited to the PCM in the presence of the mutant proteins). These two experiments, however, are not comparable: in the old experiment, the scaffold is formed from 2 copies of the endogenous unlabelled <italic>Spd-2</italic> gene and two copies of the <italic>Spd-2-GFP</italic> fusion (Old Figure 4B) while in the new experiment it is formed from one copy of <italic>WT-Spd-2-mCherry</italic> and one copy of the <italic>Spd-2-GFP</italic> fusions in the absence of any endogenous (unlabelled) protein (new Figure 5). Thus, there are several possible explanations for this minor discrepancy (for example, unlabelled Spd-2 might more efficiently compete with mutant Spd-2-GFP for incorporation into the scaffold than WT-Spd-2-mCherry, so the ratio of WT/mutant proteins in the scaffolds may be very different).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5: I'm not convinced by the authors' conclusion that the pericentriolar scaffold cannot expand because Spd-2-CON can't recruit Polo. First, they co-localize at the mother centriole, and second, Spd-2-CON itself is affecting scaffold formation in Spd-2 mutant background (Figure 4), so how can they be certain it's a Polo recruitment issue? I would potentially suggest a FRAP experiment to showcase the recruitment of Polo to the scaffold. In addition, apart from co-expressing with Polo-GFP, what's the difference between Figure 5B and Figure 4A (middle lane)? Why is there's a huge difference between the ratios (64/36 vs 9/91)? This was confusing to me.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises two specific reasons for this scepticism. First, the mutant proteins still co-localise with Polo at the centriole (suggesting that they can still recruit Polo). Please see point 2 in our response to reviewer #2where we discuss why we think that Spd-2 is not required to recruit Polo to centrioles. Second, although the Spd-2 mutants effect scaffold assembly we cannot be certain that this is due to a Polo recruitment defect. Please see point 2 of our response to reviewer #1where we describe new experiments that address this problem.</p><p>The reviewer suggests that we use FRAP to measure the dynamics of Polo recruitment to the scaffold. This is a good experiment, but we believe it would be hard to interpret. This is because Polo may have different turnover rates at the centriole and in the PCM and the ratio of Polo in these two structures is very different in embryos expressing WT Spd-2-mCherry (where it is mostly in the PCM) and mutant Spd-2-mCherry (where it is mostly in the centriole).</p><p>The reviewer asks why the PCM recruitment of the mutant Spd-2-CONS protein is so much worse in embryos expressing Polo-GFP (New Figure 6B) than in embryos not expressing Polo-GFP (New Figure 4). We apologise for not explaining this more clearly. The Polo-GFP line we use here is the healthiest available (an exon-trap insertion into the endogenous <italic>Polo</italic> gene), but the GFP tag partially disrupts Polo function and this line is only viable in the presence of an untagged copy of <italic>Polo</italic>. As we now explain more fully, there appears to be a strong genetic interaction between <italic>mutant</italic> Spd-2 proteins and the partially functional Polo-GFP. Embryos lacking endogenous Spd-2 and expressing Polo-GFP are viable in the presence of WT Spd-2-mCherry, but die very early in the presence of Spd-2-ALL-mCherry or Spd-2-CONS-mCherry (and much earlier than embryos expressing just Spd-2-CONS-mCherry or Spd-2-ALL-mCherry without the Polo-GFP). We do not understand the basis for this genetic interaction, but it suggests an intimate link between Spd-2 and Polo that is somehow perturbed when Spd-2 is mutated in this way <italic>and</italic> Polo is GFP-tagged.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 7: what is the component of the scaffold? If the scaffold is made of Spd-2, when Spd-2 CONS is unable to form the scaffold, you won't be able to see other proteins there no matter how they are recruited. Is there any other marker for the scaffold?</p></disp-quote><p>This is correct. However, although we have long proposed that Spd-2, Polo and Cnn cooperate to form the PCM scaffold in flies, we feel that this is not yet an established fact. Hence, we sought to test whether other PCM components might still be recruited to an expanded PCM that might form independently of Spd-2 and Polo. Our data suggest that this is not the case, supporting the view that Spd-2, Polo and Cnn are the major components of the PCM scaffold. The reviewer asks if there is any other marker of the scaffold we can test, but these are the only three markers that we are aware of.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 9: The C-terminus of Spd-2 contains most of the conserved Serine sites, but the authors show that mutation N-terminal sites have the biggest effect? What do the authors think the molecular basis for this is?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for being unclear on this point. The N- and C-terminal halves of Spd-2 that we test here each have 17 S-S/T motifs (see Figure 2A) and we mutated all 17 of these (not just the conserved ones) in the experiments comparing the effect of the mutations in each half of the protein (Figure 9). We have now clarified this point. We do not know why the N-terminal mutations have a larger effect, but suspect that the N-terminal half of Spd-2 normally plays the greater part in recruiting Polo to the PCM in vivo.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Regarding the immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments between the MBP-phospho-Spd2 fragment and GST-PBD (new Figure 1C), the resolution of these immunoblots appear low and the brightness/contrast altered such that it is difficult to gauge the load between the samples. It appears that there is more GST-PBD in the MBP-Spd-2 WT immunoprecipitate, but how much more? Replacing these with higher resolution blots with accompanying quantitation would be appropriate. This is an important experiment/result because it demonstrates that the authors have in fact generated a Spd-2 Polo-binding mutant. Also, is the kinase being used human Plk1, whereas the Spd-2 and PBD proteins are fly? Whatever the species, the fact that the authors used proteins from different organisms should be stated in the Results section.</p><p>I also recommend a couple of text changes in this section. The authors state that binding of the 19T mutant was reduced to background levels. How do they know this is background? This could be real binding and, therefore, would remain at WT levels, not a reduced level. The authors end this section stating, &quot;Thus, a fragment of Spd-2 can bind directly to the PBD when phosphorylated, and this binding is prevented when the S-S/T motifs are mutated to T-S/T&quot;. Based on the data, it looks to me that binding is not prevented. Instead, they should say that phosphorylation of Spd-2 increases PDB binding which, in my opinion, is what the data shows. The data also suggest that Polo activity primes it's binding to Spd-2 (as they state in the Discussion) but this important finding should also be emphasized here at the end of this Results section.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer made a number of points about our presentation and description of the immunoprecipitation experiment showing that phosphorylated Spd-2 fragment can bind recombinant GST-PBD in vitro (Figure 1C). These points were all valid and we have made the following changes:</p><p>1) We now show the quantification from three repeats of the experiment and state in the Results section that we use recombinant human Plk1 and a fragment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Spd-2 in these experiments.</p><p>2) We agree that our original description of this new experiment was unclear in several respects. We have now rewritten this section to focus on the conclusion that the MBP-Spd-2 fragment binds more GST-PBD when phosphorylated by Plk1, and that this increase in binding is not seen when the S-S/T sites have been mutated to T-S/T sites.</p><p>3) We now emphasise the important finding that Polo activity may prime its own binding to Spd-2 in both the Results and Discussion sections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p></disp-quote><p><italic>[…] The first concern was dealt with by providing</italic> in vitro <italic>biochemical interaction data (Figure 1C) and the second by performing a new type of quantification of the centrosomal Polo signal in cells expressing a mix of WT and mutant Spd-2, at a time point when Polo signal is just starting to become reduced (Figure 10). This approach allowed the authors to demonstrate reduced Polo signal even in cells where a Spd-2 PCM scaffold is still present. Although the data supports the authors' conclusion that Spd-2 mutants cause a specific loss of PCM associated Polo, the quantification would be more convincing if actual intensities would have been quantified for the Spd-2 scaffold and Polo signals rather than subjective classification into &quot;weak&quot; and &quot;strong&quot;. This is because in contrast to a similar quantification in Figure 6, where an &quot;all or nothing&quot; effect is observed, here the relative intensities of PCM scaffold-associated Spd-2 vs Polo are crucial for the result. I would suggest to also adding quantification of intensities to the figure.</italic> </p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My other concerns were also addressed, not in all cases with experiments, but I recognize the technical challenges that have led to this decision.</p><p>I would now support publication.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer requested that we provide some additional quantification of fluorescent intensities for the experiment shown in Figure 10, rather than the more qualitative classification of images into “weak” or “strong” PCM signal. The reason we do not do this (for this experiment and for several others where we use 3D-SIM to assess the localisation of proteins at both the centriole and in the PCM) is that these 3D-SIM images should not really be used for intensity quantification as they are computer-based reconstructions of what the computer “thinks” the original image looks like. Our 3D-SIM experts in the Micron Oxford Advanced Bioimaging Facility tell us that this makes it unreliable to compare absolute intensity levels from such images, particularly if they have been collected from different samples. This is why in all figures like this we show several representative images to cover the range of phenotypes we observe and quantify in our classification of the reconstructed images. As all scoring is performed blind, we are confident that this “semi-quantitative” scoring system provides a reproducible and accurate reflection of the underlying data.</p><p>In addition we have made a few minor textual clarifications, corrected a few typos, and inserted an extra reference to a very recently published paper by Cabral et al., 2019, that is relevant to this work.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
