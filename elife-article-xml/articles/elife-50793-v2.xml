to dimerisation-dependent activation of the UPR transducer IRE1 is incompletely understood. Whilst the luminal co-chaperone ERdj4 promotes a complex between the Hsp70 BiP and IRE1’s stress-sensing luminal domain (IRE1<sup>LD</sup>) that favours the latter’s monomeric inactive state and loss of ERdj4 de-represses IRE1, evidence linking these cellular and in vitro observations is presently lacking. We report that enforced loading of endogenous BiP onto endogenous IRE1α repressed UPR signalling in CHO cells and deletions in the IRE1α locus that de-repressed the UPR in cells, encode flexible regions of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> that mediated BiP-induced monomerisation in vitro. Changes in the hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry profile of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> induced by ERdj4 and BiP confirmed monomerisation and were consistent with active destabilisation of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer. Together, these observations support a competition model whereby waning ER stress passively partitions ERdj4 and BiP to IRE1<sup>LD</sup> to initiate active repression of UPR signalling.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells produce many protein molecules. These are made of chains of building blocks called amino acids that then fold into three-dimensional shapes. Specialist proteins known as chaperones assist this folding process. For example, the chaperone BiP helps other proteins fold in a compartment within the cell called the endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>To match the supply of chaperones to the demand of unfolded proteins, cells have stress receptors, such as IRE1 in the endoplasmic reticulum. IRE1 responds to changing levels of unfolded proteins by generating signals that tell cells whether they need more chaperones. Previous studies in a test tube suggest that when levels of unfolded proteins are low, BiP represses IRE1 signalling. However, when the levels of unfolded proteins increase, the unfolded proteins compete with IRE1 for BiP, releasing the brake BiP imposes on IRE1 signalling. It remained unclear if BiP regulates IRE1 in the same way in living cells.</p><p>To address this question, Amin-Wetzel, Neidhardt et al. studied IRE1 signalling in mammalian cells grown in the laboratory. The experiments revealed that cells containing a modified version of IRE1 to which BiP binds more strongly had less IRE1 signalling. On the other hand, cells containing versions of IRE1 that BiP binds less well had more active IRE1 signalling. These findings suggest that in cells, as in the test tube, unfolded proteins and IRE1 compete for BiP binding. This relationship comprises a simple mechanism allowing cells to sense and respond to the burden of unfolded proteins in their endoplasmic reticulum.</p><p>Over time, the amount of unfolded proteins in the cell likely contributes to the development of aging-related diseases such as adult-onset diabetes. A better understanding of how cells handle unfolded proteins may lead to more effective treatments for these diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>IRE1</kwd><kwd>BiP/Grp78</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum (ER)</kwd><kwd>unfolded protein response (UPR)</kwd><kwd>ERdj4/DNAJB9</kwd><kwd>Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Amin-Wetzel</surname><given-names>Niko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Neidhardt</surname><given-names>Lisa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB1036 TP9</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>Matthias P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 996 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Wellcome 200848/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MA 1278/4-3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayer</surname><given-names>Matthias P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Client protein-driven reversal of endoplasmic reticulum chaperone (BiP) mediated-repression is revealed as a principal component of the regulation of the unfolded protein response transducer IRE1 in cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In eukaryotes, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the central organelle for the synthesis of proteins destined for secretion and membrane insertion. The ER lumen harbours a specialised protein folding and processing machinery that constitutes the protein folding capacity of the ER. To ensure that the environment for productive protein maturation is maintained, both folding capacity and the inward flux of newly synthesised proteins are regulated by a pervasive negative feedback signalling pathway, the unfolded protein response (UPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kozutsumi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox et al., 1997</xref>). In mammalian cells, this pathway involves three known signaling branches each directed by a unique signal transducer resident in the ER membrane, IRE1, PERK and ATF6. An imbalance between folding load and capacity (ER stress) activates these sensors initiating a rectifying transcriptional and translational response to defend protein-folding homeostasis in the compartment (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Walter and Ron, 2011</xref>). While details of downstream events and their physiological significance are relatively well characterised (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang and Kaufman, 2016</xref>), the molecular mechanisms of the earliest events in UPR activation remain incompletely understood.</p><p>IRE1, conserved in all eukaryotes and therefore the best-studied UPR transducer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cox et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mori et al., 1993</xref>), detects ER stress via its luminal domain (IRE1<sup>LD</sup>), initiating dimerisation-dependent autophosphorylation of its cytosolic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shamu and Walter, 1996</xref>). The subsequent allosteric activation of the cytosolic endoribonuclease domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2008</xref>) leads to unconventional splicing of the mRNA encoding the XBP1/HAC1 transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cox and Walter, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Calfon et al., 2002</xref>), thereby promoting translation of an effector that drives a conserved gene-expression program.</p><p>Two models have been put forth to describe how IRE1<sup>LD</sup> senses ER stress. A direct binding model posits that unfolded proteins act as ligands stabilising IRE1’s dimeric/oligomeric state thereby promoting its activation. This model is supported by the crystal structure of the core luminal domain from <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> IRE1, showing an IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer interface traversed by a groove with architectural similarity to the major histocompatibility peptide-binding complexes (MHCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Credle et al., 2005</xref>). Peptide ligands of the yeast IRE1<sup>LD</sup> have been identified and their addition to dilute solutions of yeast IRE1<sup>LD</sup> enhances the population of higher order species, although a clear shift from monomers to dimers was not readily observable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gardner and Walter, 2011</xref>).</p><p>The luminal domain of the broadly expressed alpha isoform of human IRE1 (hIRE1α<sup>LD</sup>) also crystallises as a dimer, with an overall architecture similar to the yeast protein, however, barring conformational changes, the MHC-like groove is too narrow to accommodate a peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, peptides have been identified that bind hIRE1<sup>LD</sup> and affect its oligomeric state, as assessed by analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). Moreover, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) reported on peptide-induced structural rearrangements within the hIRE1α<sup>LD</sup> that also affected residues near the MHC-like groove. Hence, it has been proposed that the structure of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhou et al. (2006)</xref> represents a ‘closed’ conformation of the peptide-binding groove that can shift towards an ‘open’ state to allow peptide binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>). However, a co-crystal structure of the ligand-bound yeast or human IRE1<sup>LD</sup> is not available and it remains unclear if and how peptide ligands affect hIRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimerisation, the first crucial step of its activation.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis posits that IRE1 is repressed by interacting with a major component of the ER folding machinery, the heat-shock protein (Hsp70) chaperone BiP. It is proposed that upon stress, unfolded proteins accumulate and compete for BiP interaction, thereby kinetically disrupting the inhibitory IRE1-BiP complex. This chaperone inhibition model draws parallels between the regulation of the UPR and its cytosolic counterpart, the heat-shock response, in which chaperones associate with the transcription factor Hsf1, in eukaryotes, and σ<sup>32</sup>, in bacteria, to interfere with their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abravaya et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Shi et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tomoyasu et al., 1998</xref>). This model is supported by an inverse correlation between ER stress-induced IRE1 activity and the amount of ER-localised BiP recovered in complex with it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Further molecular insight into the chaperone inhibition mechanism was gained recently by the discovery of ERdj4 as an ER-localised J-domain protein that selectively represses IRE1 activity in vivo and loads BiP onto the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, thereby promoting monomerisation in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). Whilst other modes of BiP binding to the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carrara et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kopp et al., 2018</xref>) the aforementioned observations suggest a mechanism in which BiP engages the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> as an Hsp70 substrate: ATP-bound BiP initially interacts with the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> with high k<sub>on</sub> and high k<sub>off</sub> rates and only captures IRE1<sup>LD</sup> as a substrate (in the ADP bound state, with low k<sub>off</sub> rates) after ERdj4 co-chaperone-instructed ATP hydrolysis. This model draws on the conventional view whereby J-domain proteins act as adaptors that enable efficient substrate recognition via their divergent targeting domains and subsequent binding of Hsp70s, promoted by their conserved J-domain that stimulates Hsp70’s ATPase activity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kampinga and Craig, 2010</xref>). J-domain co-chaperones act in concert with nucleotide exchange factors (NEFs, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behnke et al., 2015</xref>) to accelerate Hsp70s’ cycles of substrate binding and release, resulting in substrate-selective ultra-affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Misselwitz et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Los Rios and Barducci, 2014</xref>), which is the basis for the assembly of Hsp70-substrate complexes.</p><p>Whilst ERdj4’s repressive action on IRE1 signalling in cells and its ability to promote a complex between IRE1<sup>LD</sup> and BiP that favours the former’s monomeric state in vitro fit the chaperone inhibition model, they remain correlative findings and may be causally unrelated. For example, it is possible that ERdj4’s repressive action in cells arises from its role in eliminating IRE1<sup>LD</sup> activating ligands and not from catalysing the repressed, monomeric IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-BiP complex observed in vitro. Here, in support of the chaperone inhibition model, we report that enforced targeting of endogenous BiP to endogenously-expressed IRE1<sup>LD</sup> represses UPR signalling in cells, thereby establishing that BiP can directly repress IRE1 in vivo and that features of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> that specify its repression in cells also specify its ability to undergo actively-driven monomerisation by ERdj4 and BiP in vitro.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BiP binding to IRE1<sup>LD</sup> represses IRE1 activity in cells</title><p>An inverse correlation between ER stress-induced IRE1 activity and the amount of BiP recovered in complex with it has been previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>) but a causal link between BiP binding and IRE1 activity status had never been conclusively established. To assess the effect of BiP binding on the activity of IRE1 in vivo, we modified the endogenous <italic>Ern1</italic> locus to encode an ER targeted J-IRE1 fusion protein consisting of IRE1α’s endogenous signal peptide, an N-terminally fused J-domain (derived from ERdj4) followed by the endogenous IRE1α coding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The alpha isoform accounts for all measurable activity in CHO cells and is referred to as IRE1 hereafter. By employing this fusion protein, we expected to stimulate BiP’s ATPase activity in close proximity to the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> thereby promoting formation of an IRE1-BiP complex. As control, a point mutant ERdj4 J-domain was used that had the histidine of the highly conserved HPD motif replaced by glutamine (J<sup>QPD</sup>) compromising the stimulation of BiP‘s ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wall et al., 1994</xref>). The glycine-phenylalanine-rich (G/F) region of ERdj4 was included as a flexible linker, to allow the J-domain to explore the entire surface of IRE1<sup>LD</sup>. We deemed that low level expression of endogenous IRE1 (and hence J-IRE1) would minimise IRE1-independent effects of this chimeric J-domain protein on the ER folding environment, effects that could not be excluded as having contributed to the previously-noted repressive effect of ERdj4 over-expression on the UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using an <italic>Ern1</italic> null cell line with a genomic deletion encompassing the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-encoding exons 2–12 (ΔIRE1, previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kono et al., 2017</xref>), we reconstituted the endogenous locus with either wild-type IRE1, J-IRE1 or J<sup>QPD</sup>-IRE1 fusion. Additionally, the cell lines stably expressed XBP1s::Turquoise and CHOP::GFP reporters that are controlled by the IRE1 and PERK UPR branches, respectively. Flow cytometry analysis showed that reconstitution of the locus with wild-type IRE1 rescues the non-responsive XBP1s::Turquoise phenotype of the ΔIRE1 cells towards stress induced by tunicamycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In comparison, cells expressing the J-IRE1 fusion showed low XBP1::Turquoise reporter levels, indicating repressed IRE1 activity, even under stress. Repression was dependent on the integrity of the J-domain as ΔIRE1 cells reconstituted with the mutant J<sup>QPD</sup>-IRE1 acquired nearly wild-type stress responsiveness. The J-IRE1 protein was not otherwise compromised, as it was still able to respond to the ER stressor SubA, a protease that inactivates BiP by cleaving its interdomain linker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paton et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These findings are consistent with BiP serving as a direct <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor to specify repression mediated by a J-domain presented in cis to the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fusion of ERdj4’s J-domain to IRE1<sup>LD</sup> promotes efficient BiP association thereby repressing IRE1 activity in cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two dimensional plots of CHOP::GFP and XBP1s::Turquoise signals from CHO-K1 dual UPR reporter cells stably expressing the indicated IRE1 variants [IRE1 wild-type (wt), J-IRE1 or J<sup>QPD</sup>-IRE1 fusion; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, for schema of the alleles] from the endogenous <italic>Ern1</italic> locus untreated and treated with the ER stressor tunicamycin (Tm).

The nucleotide-dependent, BiP-induced monomerisation of the J-IRE1<sup>LD</sup> containing heterodimer occurred with an approximately four-fold higher initial velocity and a higher plateau in the pseudo steady state of the reaction.

As in ‘A’, but with two extra spheres centred at Ile186 with diameters of 26 Å (yellow meshes) and 58 Å (grey meshes) to show the possible location of the MPZ peptide in either helical or extended conformation, respectively. Also shown is the 8-residues-long peptide (magenta) present in the yeast IRE1<sup>LD</sup> crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Credle et al., 2005</xref>, PDB: 2BE1, superimposed onto the human model) and a superimposed peptide (cyan) found in the PERK<sup>LD</sup> structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wang et al., 2018</xref>, PDB: 5V1D). Note: There are 16 residues between Cys5 and the C-terminus of the MPZ peptide. If extended, the peptide is free to sample a sphere with a radius of ~48 Å from Cys5. Given that the PRE experiments place Cys5 of the peptide anywhere within 10 Å of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> Ile186, if extended, the peptide is free to explore the entire space encompassed by the grey mesh. Even if constrained to assume a compressed helical conformation, the peptide could be found anywhere within the yellow mesh. The numerous perturbations to the NMR spectrum arising from the presence of unlabelled peptide may reflect either the consequences of a peptide-IRE1<sup>LD</sup> interaction or an induced conformational change in the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (as noted by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, they do not constrain the location of the peptide.

By contrast, the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> monomeric variants exhibited a T<sub>m </sub>5–10 °C lower than the wild-type. These observations established a correlation between the monomer-dimer equilibrium and the T<sub>m</sub> of the protein consistent with dimerisation-mediated stabilisation of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>.

By targeting only unstructured regions within IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, we hoped to preserve the integrity of the core structure whilst favouring mutations that might de-repress IRE1 activity. After introducing a set of guide RNAs targeting the region of interest together with the Cas9 endonuclease into cells, error prone non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) resulted in a series of mutations, ranging from small in-frame indels at a single guide site to larger ones spanning two guide sites. The IRE1 reporter was used to select rare clones exhibiting a de-repressed IRE1 phenotype (XBP1s::Turquoise bright). The CHOP::GFP reporter was used to exclude clones exhibiting a general perturbation of ER protein homeostasis. Iterative rounds of fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) enriched the XBP1s::Turquoise bright population. Clones that had acquired IRE1-independent XBP1s::Turquoise reporter expression were purged based on their unresponsiveness to the IRE1 inhibitor 4µ8c (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2012</xref>). The <italic>Ern1</italic> locus of individual clones with deregulated IRE1 activity found in the final pool was sequenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> left panel).

Despite variation in the total BiP signal intensity in the three independent repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, lower panel), paired analysis revealed that significantly less BiP was associated with the IRE1 ΔΔ mutant. The same was observed in a transient transfection system in which IRE1’s cytosolic effector domains were replaced with glutathione S-transferase (GST). Compared to the wild-type IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-GST bait, the amount of BiP recovered by glutathione affinity chromatography in association with the variants was significantly lower in context of the single deletions and even lower in case of the double-deletion IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup>-GST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Together, the observations described above confirm a role for the flexible regions of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> in maintaining IRE1 in a repressed state in vivo and suggest that such repression may reflect a role for these flexible regions in specifying BiP binding. To follow up on this suggestion, Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) was used to compare BiP’s association with the biotinylated wild-type or double-deleted IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup> immobilised on the sensor. Immersing the sensor into a solution containing ERdj4, BiP and ATP gave rise to an association curve, that was reproducibly attenuated when IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup> was bound as a ligand compared to the wild-type IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, left traces). A similar qualitative defect in BiP binding to IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup> was also observed when the full-length ERdj4 was replaced by its isolated J-domain (that lacks the regions required for specific targeting to the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, right traces).</p><p>This last observation suggested that the defect in J-domain-mediated BiP binding to IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup>, had a component that was independent of recruitment of ERdj4 to IRE1<sup>LD</sup> by the former’s targeting domain and implied that the deleted region of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> had a role in specifying BiP association. This was explored further using J-IRE1<sup>LD</sup> fusion proteins as BLI ligands to enforce ATP hydrolysis by BiP in proximity to the wild-type or double-deleted IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (independent of the role these flexible regions of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> might have in J-domain co-chaperone recruitment). Immersing a BLI sensor loaded either with J-IRE1<sup>LD</sup> or J-IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup> into a solution containing BiP and ATP revealed a reproducible defect of BiP association to J-IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> left panel). No association was observed in presence of the substrate binding-deficient BiP<sup>V461F</sup> mutant.

Given the slow association of BiP-ADP with substrates and the slow dissociation of BiP oligomers a lengthy equilibration (16 hr) was allowed. Almost three-fold less BiP was recovered in complex with IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup>-bio than with IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-bio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). BiP association was concentration-dependent, destabilised by ATP and was not observed with BiP<sup>V461F</sup>.

Therefore, we employed the same FRET-based assay to determine if impaired BiP binding affected monomerisation of IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup> -containing dimers. Wild-type fluorescent donor-labelled IRE1<sup>LD</sup> was allowed to dimerise with acceptor-labelled IRE1<sup>LD</sup> or IRE1<sup>LD ΔΔ</sup> and the rate at which BiP, ERdj4 and ATP promoted dissociation of these dimers was measured by following the increase in donor fluorescence over time.

Hence, these data suggest that the conversion from the low exchanging subpopulation to the high exchanging subpopulation was a feature of the monomeric state.</p><p>HX is a quasi-irreversible reaction: Once a molecule has transiently assumed a high exchanging conformation (and undergone the exchange) the signature of having transited through a high exchanging conformation remains even if the protein is in a conformational equilibrium (and individual molecules transit back to the low exchanging conformation).

The observation that for wild-type IRE1<sup>LD</sup> the transition from the low (blue) to the high (red) exchanging population occurred with much slower kinetics than for IRE1<sup>LD P108A</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>, compare left panel, monomeric IRE1<sup>LD P108A</sup> with the right panel, wild-type IRE1<sup>LD</sup>) suggests that a higher proportion of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> monomers increased the transition rate, whereas the presence of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimers leads to a reduction of the rate constant.

Therefore, these findings imply that BiP-induced IRE1<sup>LD</sup> monomerisation has a component arising from active destabilisation of the dimer.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The notion that a chaperone machinery with an Hsp70, such as BiP, as its terminal effector might negatively regulate activity of an upstream UPR transducer, such as IRE1, has the appeal of simplicity: Hsp70’s can potently affect the structure and function of their clients. The level of free BiP is kept low by inactivating oligomerisation and AMPylation and is further limited by client titration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Preissler and Ron, 2019</xref>). Therefore, the availability of a BiP-dependent machinery to serve as an active repressor of IRE1 is a plausible inverse measure of the level of ER stress. For years, the inverse relationship between the recovery of BiP in complex with IRE1 and exposure of cells to conditions causing ER stress has provided the only experimental support for this chaperone repression model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Okamura et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>). The recent establishment of an ATP- and co-chaperone-dependent system in which BiP promotes a pool of monomeric, inactive-state IRE1<sup>LD</sup> further supports the model by revealing BiP’s potential to affect a major change in IRE1’s activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we provide much needed further support for the chaperone repression model by demonstrating that directing endogenous BiP to bind endogenous IRE1<sup>LD</sup> as a substrate also attenuates signalling in cells, thus revealing BiP’s potential as a direct IRE1 repressor in vivo.</p><p>A structure-based targeted approach identified regions of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> that impart a repressed state in vivo. The same regions proved important for ATP and co-chaperone-dependent BiP-mediated conversion of active-state IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimers to inactive-state monomers in vitro and their presence accelerated the formation of an ATP and co-chaperone-dependent complex with BiP in vitro. Monomerisation was observed in both a FRET-based assay, involving labelled molecules of IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, and in an HX-MS assay with intact molecules, thus establishing a firm correlation between the determinants of IRE1 that regulate its function in vivo and those that specify its regulation in vitro by a BiP-led machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Cartoon depicting features of BiP-mediated regulation of IRE1 activity.</title><p>In stressed cells unfolded proteins compete for BiP, exposing IRE1<sup>LD</sup> to a default dimeric active state, specified by the kinetics of the monomer-dimer equilibrium (left panel).

Engagement of these regions in the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer may favor active dimer disassembly by entropic pulling or allosterically induced conformational changes (right panel). BiP binding to the same flexible regions of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> monomer, may inactivate IRE1 by disfavoring re-dimerisation (right panel). The dynamic nature of BiP binding, which entails cycles for ATP hydrolysis-driven client engagement and nucleotide exchange-mediated release, ensures that IRE1 activity is kinetically coupled to the balance between unfolded protein load and folding capacity of the cell.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50793-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Correlation between factors involved in BiP regulation of IRE1 in vitro and UPR activity in vivo have been previously noted: Deregulated AMPylation of BiP activates IRE1 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Preissler et al., 2015b</xref>) and BiP AMPylation in vitro blocks IRE1<sup>LD</sup> monomerisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). ERdj4 acts in concert with BiP to monomerise IRE1<sup>LD</sup>in vitro and loss of ERdj4 from cells de-represses IRE1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). However, genetic lesions in trans-acting ER-localised factors also have the potential to broadly alter the state of the ER and thereby unleash processes that affect IRE1 independently (of any direct interaction with BiP). Indirect effects are less likely a consequence when IRE1<sup>LD</sup> is modified in cis. Therefore, whilst it is impossible to rule out contributions from factors other than the BiP machinery to the deregulation of IRE1 that arises from deletion of the unstructured regions of its luminal domain, attenuation of BiP-mediated IRE1 repression in cells emerges as a parsimonious unifying explanation for the findings presented here.</p><p>It is further notable that there is nothing in our observations to speak against the possibility that extended regions of unfolded ER proteins serve as activating ligands of IRE1 by binding across the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer interface and stabilising it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Karagöz et al., 2019</xref>). IRE1 signalling is triggered by an imbalance between unfolded proteins and BiP. The latter results in more potential ligands for IRE1 and fewer molecules of its client-free ATP bound BiP repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vitale et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, the two proposed mechanisms for IRE1 activation, could well co-exist. However, our findings do raise questions regarding the strength of the experimental evidence supporting the current ideas how unfolded proteins may serve as activating ligands of IRE1. The evidence rests prominently on the activity of a peptide, MPZ-N, nominated as a model activating ligand of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karagöz et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings do not support the notion that this peptide specifically engages the MHC-like groove traversing the dimer interface, as a disulphide, crystallographically proven to lie across this groove, thereby locking the helices in a ‘closed’ conformation, had no effect on the binding of MPZ-N to IRE1<sup>LD</sup>. Furthermore, MPZ-N binding to IRE1<sup>LD</sup> did not stabilise it thermodynamically, whereas the aforementioned disulphide, which mimics the proposed dimer-stabilising effect of a bound peptide, increased the melting temperature IRE1<sup>LD</sup> by 10 °C. Nor did MPZ-N promote a shift in the monomer-dimer equilibrium of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> as assessed by SEC. These concerns, along with the lack of crystallographic data supporting engagement of the groove by ligands, suggest the need for further experiments to test the role of unfolded proteins as direct IRE1 activators.</p><p>HX-MS analysis revealed neither an ERdj4-dependent nor BiP and ATP-dependent protection within IRE1<sup>LD</sup> to suggest their binding site. It has been proposed that ERdj4’s bacterial homolog, DnaJ, exploits mostly side chain interactions to bind clients, with a strong preference for aromatic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rüdiger et al., 2001</xref>). Such interactions, were they to serve as the basis for IRE1<sup>LD</sup> recognition by ERdj4, would be only visible to HX-MS if they stabilised the underlying secondary structure. Given the conventional mode of BiP action on IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (ATP and co-chaperone-dependent and abolished by the BiP<sup>V461F</sup> mutation), one would expect protection of 4–5 hydrogen amides by IRE1<sup>LD</sup> engagement in the chaperone’s substrate-binding domain. However, partial occupancy of multiple sites may have diluted any HX-MS signature of BiP binding. This is supported by the observation that at the concentrations of ERdj4 and BiP used in the HX-MS assay, the FRET assay reported peak fluorescence of only ~40% of the unquenched donor (at the kinetically driven pseudo steady state plateau of the reaction, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Thus, the lack of a clear ATP- and ERdj4-dependent BiP binding signature is consistent with the dynamic nature of BiP’s interaction with IRE1<sup>LD</sup>. Interestingly, we observed an ATP-independent protection against deuteron incorporation within IRE1<sup>LD</sup> that was also evident in presence of the substrate binding-defective BiP<sup>V461F</sup>. This might reflect a non-conventional interaction of BiP’s nucleotide binding domain with IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, as proposed by the Ali lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kopp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kopp et al., 2019</xref>). However, this protection is not correlated to the activity-state of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> and its significance thus remains to be established.</p><p>Mechanistically, BiP’s interaction with IRE1<sup>LD</sup> shares features with other situations in which Hsp70s bind to native clients thereby regulating their activity: DnaJ-directed, DnaK-mediated destabilisation of <italic>E. coli</italic> σ<sup>32</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2008</xref>), functional regulation of the glucocorticoid receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kirschke et al., 2014</xref>), regulation of the activity of the tumour suppressor p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boysen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dahiya et al., 2019</xref>), Hsf1 regulated heat shock gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abravaya et al., 1992</xref>) and Hsc70-mediated destabilisation of clathrin coats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sousa et al., 2016</xref>). All these have in common client destabilisation and likely initiate at unstructured regions of the substrate. Thus, it seems reasonable to suggest that an important aspect of BiP’s ability to affect the disposition of IRE1<sup>LD</sup>’s monomer-dimer equilibrium arises from its interaction with the flexible regions identified here.</p><p>Bimodal analysis of the HX-MS data suggested that ERdj4-directed BiP binding can accelerate dimer disassembly. This is consistent with the ability of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer to serve as a ligand for ERdj4 and BiP (here and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). While BiP binding to and stabilisation of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> monomers may also contribute to shifting the monomer-dimer equilibrium towards the former, the HX-MS experiment suggests an (additional) active role for BiP in dimer destabilisation. This may arise from a BiP-binding induced bias of the ensemble of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimers towards conformers preferentially populated in the monomer. A similar mechanism of conformational selection has been proposed for DnaK-mediated destabilisation of <italic>E. coli</italic> σ<sup>32</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rodriguez et al., 2008</xref>). Such ‘allosteric’ action is consistent with the observation that monomerisation has effects on IRE1<sup>LD</sup> structure that are far removed from the dimer interface. Alternatively, BiP binding may destabilise the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer by entropic pulling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">De Los Rios et al., 2006</xref>), as has been suggested in Hsc70-mediated destabilisation of clathrin coats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sousa et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The latter mechanism would be further favoured by assembly of BiP oligomers on the surface of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, a possibility consistent with the &gt;1:1 stoichiometry of BiP:IRE1<sup>LD</sup> complexes observed in some experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>) (although the latter may also reflect multiple BiP binding sites).</p><p>As shown here, flexible regions of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> contribute measurably to its repression in cells and to BiP-driven monomerisation in vitro. This observation is consistent with the idea that these regions serve as initiation points for BiP binding to promote dimer disassembly via entropic pulling, allosterically induced conformational changes or both. Considerable redundancy seems built into the process, as the deregulated IRE1<sup>∆∆</sup> allele retained a measure of stress responsiveness in cells and the IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup> dimer was still slowly undone in a BiP-dependent process in vitro. Such redundancy has been observed previously: in both yeast and human, IRE1 deletion of the tail region connecting the structured core of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> to the transmembrane domain partially deregulated IRE1, whilst retaining partial responsiveness to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oikawa et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Oikawa et al., 2009</xref>). Redundancy in the structural features of the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimer that render it a substrate for BiP-dependent disassembly and the non-equilibrium kinetic nature for BiP’s action could serve as the basis for a smoothly graded response to variation in the levels of ER stress.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The intrinsic chemical exchange rate is indicated by k<sub>ch</sub>.</p><p>There are two extreme cases, distinguishing the so-called EX1 and EX2 exchange regimes. In case of EX1 k<sub>cl</sub> is much smaller than k<sub>ch</sub>. Therefore, all amide protons exchange at once upon unfolding and the observed rate is practically equal to the opening rate k<sub>op</sub> of the structural element. This type of exchange kinetics is characterised by a bimodal distribution of the isotope peaks in peptic mass spectra showing two separate, interconverting subpopulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Notably, the EX1 exchange regime occurs only rarely under native conditions and is more likely to be observed in presence of chemical denaturants as they decrease the closing rate k<sub>cl</sub> without affecting the intrinsic chemical exchange rate k<sub>ch</sub> by interfering with H-bond and hydrophobic core formation. EX2 is most commonly observed, as under native state conditions k<sub>cl</sub> is generally much greater than the intrinsic chemical exchange rate k<sub>ch</sub>. Hence, many opening and closing cycles are necessary in order to exchange all amide protons to deuterons, which is visible by a gradual increase of the average mass in the peptic mass spectra whilst the isotopic distribution remains roughly the same (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rist et al., 2003</xref>). By comparing IRE1<sup>LD</sup> with the monomeric variants we identified regions exhibiting increased deuteron incorporation in the monomeric state of the protein, with some of them revealing bimodal distributions of the isotope clusters. In order to calculate the contribution of each subpopulation to the peak intensities, an equation for two Gaussian distributions was fitted to the isotope peak maxima versus m/z plots using the Prism GraphPad 7.0 software:<disp-formula id="equ4"><label>(4)</label><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>1</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>π</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mover><mml:msub><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>2</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Hereby, A<sub>1/2</sub> represents the area of the two peaks; µ, the m/z values; <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>µ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:math></inline-formula>, the means of the Gaussian distributions, representing the centroid of each of the two subpopulations; and σ, the standard deviation of the Gaussian distributions, corresponding to the width of the isotope peak distribution.

accumulation of unfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by activating a signal transduction cascade referred to as the Unfolded Protein Response (UPR), which aims to restore ER homeostasis. The IRE1 kinase is an ER-localized transmembrane protein, which serves to detect the accumulation of unfolded proteins and to activate downstream elements of the response. Two predominant, although not mutually exclusive, models have emerged to explain the mechanism by which unfolded proteins lead to IRE1 activation. In one, unfolded proteins bind directly to IRE1's lumenal domain, leading to its activation. In the second model, IRE1's activation by unfolded proteins is more indirect and occurs through their ability to compete for the ER chaperone BiP, which maintains IRE1 in a monomeric, inactive state. Here, by engineering the IRE1 locus to encode a fusion protein in which the effector domain of a BiP co-chaperone (ERdj4) is brought in close proximity to the IRE1 luminal domain, the authors were able to evaluate the consequences of BiP loading onto endogenous IRE1, plausibly without otherwise perturbing conditions in the ER. The dramatic shutdown of IRE1 activity brought about by this manipulation and its relief by inactivating BiP, together provide compelling evidence that BiP can repress IRE1 in cells directly. Further evidence that BiP contributes to IRE1 repression directly in cells, was provided by the observation that deletions in the IRE1 luminal domain, that weaken BiP's ability to enforce a monomeric inactive conformation on the protein, in vitro, also deregulate (enhance) IRE1 activity when introduced as mutations into the endogenous IRE1 locus of cells. Whilst the details of BiP's interaction with the IRE1 and the biophysical basis for direct repression are sketched in low resolution, this paper nonetheless advances our understanding of the UPR by providing important evidence for a component of direct repression of IRE1 by BiP in cells.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Unstructured regions in IRE1α specify BiP-mediated destabilisation of the luminal domain dimer and repression of the UPR&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Eelco van Anken (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>While all three reviewers found the manuscript to be technically well-executed, there were concerns about the fact that it does not significantly advance the debate on whether BiP binding is critical to Ire1 regulation, if peptide binding is the more critical aspect of activation, or if some combination of the two more closely describes requirements for activation. Also, none of the reviewers were convinced that the data presented in Figure 2A, which demonstrated that the peptides did not significantly alter the stability of Ire1LD, argued against the peptide binding model. But, we believe your findings are important for the field and will appeal to the readers of life. We will therefore gladly consider a revised manuscript provided you can address the essential revisions listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The discussion should provide a more balanced comparison of the two models for Ire1 activation.</p><p>2) The conclusions drawn from Figure 2A should be moderated, unless you are willing to demonstrate the peptides are not inducing dimerization by AUC or a similar type assay.</p><p>3) In addition, we also request that you attempt to identify a BiP binding sequence in the unstructured loop that is not present in the structure.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50793.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The discussion should provide a more balanced comparison of the two models for Ire1 activation.</p><p>2) The conclusions drawn from Figure 2A should be moderated, unless you are willing to demonstrate the peptides are not inducing dimerization by AUC or a similar type assay.</p><p>3) In addition, we also request that you attempt to identify a BiP binding sequence in the unstructured loop that is not present in the structure.</p></disp-quote><p>By way of overview, we note that critiques fell into two categories. The first relate to the experiments dealing with BiP’s role as an IRE1 repressor. The second relate to the insights we bring to the question of the role of peptide binding to IRE1 activation.</p><p>In regards to the first issue, Essential revision point 3 charged us with “trying to identify a BiP-binding sequence in the unstructured loop”, whose deletion, we have found, contributes to IRE1 de-repression in cells.</p><p>Hsp70 chaperones engage their clients via short extended peptide sequences that interact with the chaperone’s substrate binding domain, an interaction that is greatly stabilised in the chaperone’s ADP-bound conformation. However, the intrinsic affinity of client-derived peptide sequences for the ADP-bound chaperone is but one factor that influences the formation of an Hsp70-client complex. Accessibility of the peptide in the context of the client’s structure and the productive engagement of J-domain protein(s) to promote ATP hydrolysis in a favourable geometry are also important contributors. It is the sum of these components that is relevant to the interaction in vivo. Notably, in this regard, an assay containing IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, a J-domain, BiP and ATP, reveals a role for the flexible region of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> in the strength of the interaction (Figure 5A). Thus, the correlation between a defect in BiP recruitment to the mutant IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup> and the de-repressed phenotype observed in IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup> expressing cells is established. Essential revision point 3, asks if this defect also correlates with an affinity of the flexible region of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> for BiP in its ADP state.</p><p>We began by making use of the scoring system(Blond-Elguindi et al., 1993) that predicts potential BiP binding sites within polypeptides. Applying this algorithm to the entire human IRE1<sup>LD</sup>’s sequence revealed that the highest score (and therefore the highest predicted BiP binding) is represented by the hepta-peptide 309-315 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The IRE1<sup>LD</sup> loop deletion altered this peptide from RGSTLPL, with a score of 20, to RGSTDVK, with a score of -9. If this predicted high affinity peptide accounts for the contribution of the flexible loop to BiP binding in vivo, replacing the wild-type hepta-peptide with a low scoring hepta-peptide (in the context of the otherwise intact IRE1<sup>LD</sup>) should de-repress IRE1 signalling.</p><p>We tested this by homologous recombination, creating IRE1 variants encoded by mutant alleles of the endogenous Ern1 gene in the dual UPR reporter CHO cell line [converting the wild-type 309-315 hepta-peptide, RGSTLPL (score = 20) either to RGSTDVK (score = -9) or RGSTLSA (score = -12)].</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>BiP binding score based on Blond-Elguindi et al.

Thus, the highest scoring peptide of the entire IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, appears to account for only some of the repressive effect of the flexible regions of the molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>).</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Bar diagram of median XBP1::Turquoise and CHOP::GFP signals from untreated and tunicamycin (Tm)-treated CHO-K1 dual UPR reporter cells with Ern1 alleles encoding wild type (wt) or the indicated mutant variants of IRE1 (∆loop, missing residues 313-338).</title><p>Data from two independent experiments is shown (means ± range)..</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-50793-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Inability of mutations in the 309-315 peptide to mimic the full effect of the flexible loop deletion may reflect redundancy in the presence of BiP binding peptides (there are five other hepta-peptides with a score between 6 and 10 in the loop, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Such redundancy is also consistent with hydrogen-<sup>1</sup>H/<sup>2</sup>H-exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS) data which do not point to a prominent, BiP, ATP, ERdj4-dependent protection of any single IRE1<sup>LD</sup> peptic fragment. Together, these findings suggested that pursuing the in vitro binding characteristics of individual peptides derived from the flexible regions of IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, might not be informative. However, we felt it would be helpful to explore a related question, implicitly raised by the reviewers: “Does the flexible region of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> make any measurable contribution to the affinity of BiP-ADP to the IRE1<sup>LD</sup>?”</p><p>To address this question, we set up an experiment in which BiP was combined with C-terminally biotinylated IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (either IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-bio or IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup>-bio) in presence of ADP and absence of J-domain protein. Given the slow association of BiP-ADP with substrates and the slow dissociation of BiP oligomers (in the presence of ADP, Preissler et al., 2015), a lengthy equilibration (16 hours, at 4 °C) was allowed. 2.9-fold less BiP was recovered in complex with IRE1<sup>LD ∆∆</sup>-bio than with IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-bio (new Figure 5B). BiP association was concentration-dependent, destabilised by ATP and was not observed with the substrate-binding mutant BiP<sup>V461F</sup>. Coupling of BiP’s nucleotide binding and substrate binding domains was dispensable for the interaction with IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-bio, as it was also observed with the domain-uncoupled BiP<sup>ADDA</sup> (Petrova et al., 2008; Preissler et al., 2015). Together, these observations point to a role for the flexible regions of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> in specifying BiP association as a conventional substrate of this Hsp70.</p><p>Though deemed a minor point, reviewer 1 noted that “Figure 1D would benefit from including a lane with ERdj4 present with the J-IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-bio construct, as your model would suggest that its inclusion should not significantly increase BiP binding.”</p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have repeated the entire experiment (twice) with the missing condition added. As expected, no increase in the amount of BiP recovered in complex with J-IRE1<sup>LD</sup> was observed by the addition ERdj4 (new Figure 1D).</p><p>In regard to the second issue, covered by Essential revision points 1 and 2, we should like to begin by noting that we do not believe, nor do want our readers to believe, that we have refuted a role for unfolded proteins as activating ligands of IRE1. Furthermore, like reviewer 3 (Eelco van Aanken), we too recognise that there is no inherent conflict between BiP’s role as a repressor of IRE1 and the possible role of unfolded proteins as activating ligands. At his suggestion, we have revised the Discussion to state plainly: “IRE1 signalling is triggered by an imbalance between unfolded proteins and BiP. The latter results in more potential ligands for IRE1 and fewer molecules of its client protein-free ATP-bound BiP repressor (Bakunts et al., 2017; Vitale et al., 2019). Thus, the two proposed mechanisms for IRE1 activation could well co-exist. However, our findings do raise questions regarding the strength of the experimental evidence supporting the current ideas how unfolded proteins may serve as activating ligands of IRE1”. We believe that this new narrative adequately addresses Essential revision point 1 “that the discussion should provide a more balanced comparison of the two models for IRE1 activation”.</p><p>Essential revision point 2 mandates that “the conclusions drawn from Figure 2A should be moderated, unless you are willing to demonstrate the peptides are not inducing dimerisation by AUC or a similar type assay”.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for insisting upon this point. Following their suggestion, we have analysed the effect of MPZ-N on IRE1<sup>LD</sup> dimerisation by size exclusion chromatography (SEC), exploiting the correlation between the distribution of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> in its monomeric and dimeric state and its peak elution time. Using fluorescently-labelled IRE1<sup>LD</sup> we could distinguish between peaks arising from IRE1<sup>LD</sup> and the MPZ-N-peptide itself, greatly simplifying the interpretation of the SEC trace. No effect of MPZ-N peptide (added at concentrations well above the reported K<sub>1/2 max</sub> of binding to IRE1<sup>LD</sup>, 16 µM, Karagoz et al., 2017) was noted on the peak elution time of IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-TMR. The latter was introduced into the assay at 500 nM, a concentration near IRE1<sup>LD</sup>’s K<sub>d</sub> for dimerisation (measured by this assay to be ~800 nM, Figure 5—figure supplement 1D). We reasoned that this concentration is close enough to the concentration required for dimerisation to facilitate the task of any agent capable of promoting dimerisation, yet allows plenty of head room for detecting dimerisation – as reflected by the elution profile of IRE1<sup>LD</sup>-TMR introduced at 2 µM. Despite these measures, no trend towards dimerisation was observed (new Figure 2A and 2B). Together with the differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF, Figure 2—figure supplement 1D) our observations do not support a role for the MPZ-N peptide in influencing IRE1<sup>LD</sup>’s monomer-dimer-equilibrium.</p><p>Whilst not deemed an essential point, reviewer 2 questions the nature of the apparent incompatibility between our conclusion that MPZ-N does not specifically bind IRE1<sup>LD</sup> in the MHC-like groove and the reviewer’s interpretation of the NMR data of Karagoz et al., 2017. The reviewer notes “Karagoz et al. did also do PRE experiments, which are very specific for monitoring distance and allow to distinguish between conformation changes and binding. So it is clear from this that the peptide indeed binds into the groove, and this is incompatible with the interpretation by Amin-Wetzel et al.. These are very hard data, and they are not compatible with the interpretation of the authors”. We welcome the opportunity to try and clarify this point.</p><p>As noted by the reviewer, the numerous perturbations to the NMR spectrum arising from the presence of unlabelled peptide may reflect either the consequences of a peptide-IRE1<sup>LD</sup> interaction or an induced conformational change in the IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (Karagoz et al., 2017). Therefore, they do not constrain the location of the peptide. However a constraint is provided by the paramagnetic relaxation enhancement (PRE) experiments with IRE1<sup>LD</sup> and an MPZ-proxyl-labelled peptide (Figure 5 in Karagoz et al., 2017, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.30700.016">doi.org/10.7554/eLife.30700.016</ext-link>) to which the reviewer is referring. In PRE experiments, the incorporated spin label causes broadening of isoluecine peaks in a range of 10 to 25 Å or entirely erases them within distances of &lt;10 Å (Gottstein et al., 2012). Therefore, the broadening of peaks observed in the NMR spectra of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> serves as a distance constraint. The strongest such event positions the labelled Cys5 of the MPZ peptide (LIRY<bold>C</bold>WLRRQAALQRRISAME) within 10 Å of Ile186 (shown in red in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, with a mesh depicting the outer limits of the location of Cys5). Broadenings of other isoleucine peaks position Cys5 within 25 Å of Ile52, Ile124, Ile128 and Ile263 (coloured yellow in the same).</p><p>There are 16 amino acid residues between Cys5 and the C-terminus of the MPZ peptide. If extended, the peptide is free to sample a sphere with a radius of ~48 Å from Cys5. Given that the PRE experiments place Cys5 of the peptide anywhere within 10 Å of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> Ile186, if extended, the peptide is free to explore the entire space encompassed by the grey mesh in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B. Even if constrained to assume a compressed helical conformation, the peptide could be found anywhere within the yellow mesh.</p><p>Therefore, the results of the PRE experiments are also compatible with binding of the peptide outside the MHC-like groove, as suggested by Figure 2 of our manuscript. In fact, our experiments and those of Karagoz et al. are consistent with the MPZ peptide binding in locations where peptides have previously been observed crystallographically on the surface of the related yeast IRE1<sup>LD</sup> (Credle et al., 2005) or the PERK<sup>LD</sup> (Wang et al., 2018) (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, in magenta and cyan, respectively). We conclude that the mode of MPZ peptide binding to IRE1<sup>LD</sup> remains unknown, that it does not obligatorily involve the MHC-like groove and that even the existence of a unique binding site for the peptide on the surface of IRE1<sup>LD</sup> remains unproven.</p><p>References:</p><p>Blond-Elguindi, S., Cwirla, S.E., Dower, W.J., Lipshutz, R.J., Sprang, S.R., Sambrook, J.F., and Gething, M.J.
