We use genome engineering of <italic>Drosophila</italic> to investigate constraints on the repeated evolution of unrelated herbivorous insects to toxic cardiac glycosides, which primarily occurs via a small subset of possible functionally-relevant substitutions to Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase. Surprisingly, we find that frequently observed adaptive substitutions at two sites, 111 and 122, are lethal when homozygous and adult heterozygotes exhibit dominant neural dysfunction. We identify a phylogenetically correlated substitution, A119S, that partially ameliorates the deleterious effects of substitutions at 111 and 122. Despite contributing little to cardiac glycoside-insensitivity in vitro, A119S, like substitutions at 111 and 122, substantially increases adult survivorship upon cardiac glycoside exposure. Our results demonstrate the importance of epistasis in constraining adaptive paths. Moreover, by revealing distinct effects of substitutions in vitro and in vivo, our results underscore the importance of evaluating the fitness of adaptive substitutions and their interactions in whole organisms.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>adaptation</kwd><kwd>natural selection</kwd><kwd>pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>ecological genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM115523</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andolfatto</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roland</surname><given-names>Bartholomew P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM108073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palladino</surname><given-names>MIchael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AG027453</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palladino</surname><given-names>MIchael J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genome engineering and phenotyping in vivo reveal surprising new features of adaptive amino acid substitutions that were previously inaccessible.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Understanding the factors that limit the rate of adaptation is central to our ability to forecast future adaptive evolutionary trajectories and predict the timescales over which these changes are expected to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Losos, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morris et al., 2018</xref>). In particular, considerable uncertainty surrounds the relative importance of the availability of adaptive mutations, pleiotropy and epistasis in constraining adaptive paths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Stern, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Storz, 2018</xref>). One fruitful approach to addressing this question has been to examine repeated bouts of adaptation in microbial systems subject to a common selective pressure and identical starting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jerison and Desai, 2015</xref>). Unfortunately, such approaches still have limited utility in multicellular eukaryotes and likely do not reveal the full range of constraints operating in nature. An alternative and analogous approach is to examine evolutionary patterns in large, naturally occurring assemblages of species exhibiting parallel adaptations in response to a common selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Meyer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christin et al., 2007</xref>). Evolutionary studies of parallelisms are a powerful complementary approach to deducing the factors constraining adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Stern, 2013</xref>). A well-known example of parallel adaptations is the ability of numerous animals to acquire toxins from their environments and sequester them for use in defense against predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erb and Robert, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we focus on a large group of herbivorous insects with a broad phylogenetic distribution that have independently specialized on toxic host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dobler et al., 2011</xref>). In addition to other defenses against herbivory, the Apocynaceae and other plant species produce a class of toxic secondary compounds called cardiac glycosides (CGs). CGs are highly toxic to animals because they are potent inhibitors of Na<sup>+</sup>,K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (NKA), a ubiquitously expressed enzyme needed in a variety of cellular processes in animals, including neural signal transduction, muscle contraction, and osmoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lingrel, 2010</xref>). Mutations to NKA in invertebrates are typically homozygous lethal and associated with defects in locomotion, neuron development and neural homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ashmore et al., 2009</xref>). In humans, loss-of-function mutations in NKA have been associated with several rare disorders such as dystonia, parkinsonism and hemiplegic migraines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bøttger et al., 2012</xref>). Despite their toxicity, NKAs have long been targeted with CG-based drugs to treat common conditions such as congestive heart failure and cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoner, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Insensitivity to CGs in insects can evolve via several mechanisms including modification of the CG-binding domain of NKA (i.e. target-site insensitivity), restriction of NKA expression to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petschenka et al., 2013b</xref>), the deployment of proteins that ameliorate the toxic effects of CGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Torrie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Petschenka et al., 2013b</xref>) and other physiological factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vaughan and Jungreis, 1977</xref>). Despite this wide variety of potential paths to CG-insensitivity, the evolution of insensitivity in most CG-adapted insects is due, at least in part, to target-site insensitivity. Indeed, in most cases, diet specialization on CG-containing hostplants has been accompanied by recurrent adaptive amino acid substitutions to the CG-binding domain of the alpha-subunit of NKA, ATPα1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dobler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Previous studies have identified up to 35 sites in ATPα1 at which substitutions could contribute to CG-insensitivity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>). However, CG-insensitivity of ATPα1 most often arises via a highly similar pattern of substitution at two sites (111 and 122, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): as an illustration, a survey of 28 CG-adapted insects revealed that 30 of 63 amino acid substitutions observed at sites implicated in CG-sensitivity in ATPα1 occur at sites 111 and 122 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Sites 111 and 122 have also been identified as targets of positive selection in CG-adapted insects using statistical phylogenetic methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding why these two sites, in particular, are so often employed requires a characterization of the effects of these substitutions, individually and in combination, on organismal phenotypes and fitness.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48224.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Deleterious effects of substitutions at positions 111 and 122 are ameliorated by the permissive substitution A119S.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Patterns of amino acid substitution at sites implicated in CG sensitivity near the H1-H2 transmembrane domain of ATPα1 in representative species from six insect orders (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for all species).

Support for this hypothesis comes from the fact that multiple insect species specializing on CG-containing host-plants have independently duplicated and neofunctionalized ATPα1. In all cases examined to date, species with two or more copies retain one minimally altered copy that is more highly expressed in nervous tissue, and have evolved one or more insensitive copies that are more highly expressed in the gut, the site of absorption of CGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Further support for negative pleiotropic effects is provided by the expression of engineered ATPα1 constructs in cell lines, suggesting that some duplicate-specific CG-insensitivity substitutions appear to reduce NKA activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dalla and Dobler, 2016</xref>). Based on these findings, the frequent parallel substitutions observed at sites 111 and 122 in specialists lacking duplicate ATPα1 copies plausibly reflect the fact that substitutions at these sites are minimally pleiotropic.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Common substitutions at positions 111 and 122 exhibit negative pleiotropic effects</title><p>To test the idea that substitutions at positions 111 and 122 lack strong negative pleiotropic effects, we used the transgenesis toolkit of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), a generalist insect that harbors a single ubiquitously expressed copy of a CG-sensitive form of ATPα1.

In addition, we can rule out compensatory changes elsewhere in the genome, or evolved changes in physiology, which are concerned in multi-generation population-level experimental evolution studies. Importantly, by testing substitutions in vivo, we can evaluate their functional effects at multiple phenotypic levels, from the biochemistry of enzyme inhibition to behavior and fitness. We generated six lines that carry substitutions at these two sites of the endogenous ATPα1 locus individually (Q111L, Q111V, Q111T, N122H) and in combination (Q111V+N122H, Q111T+N122H) (see Materials and methods). For comparison, we also created three lines in which we introduced two rare, copy-specific substitutions (C104Y and N122Y and C104Y+N122Y, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) for which we did not have a priori expectations about pleiotropic fitness effects. C104Y is known to confer some degree of insensitivity to CGs, and both C104Y and N122Y occur on a neofunctionalized copy of ATPα1 in the milkweed weevil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>). An additional control line carrying the wild-type <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> allele was generated using the same approach.</p><p>Based on the repeated use of substitutions at positions 111 and 122, we expected these would confer ATPα1 with some degree of insensitivity to CGs and be associated with either no or mild negative pleiotropic effects on fitness. To our surprise, however, each of the nine lines exhibit severely reduced fitness, behaving effectively as recessive lethals. To identify the developmental stage at which lethality occurs, we evaluated hatchability (i.e. the proportion of homozygous larva per embyro) and the probability of individuals surviving to pupae and adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Severe fitness deficits for most engineered substitution lines were apparent as early as the larval hatching stage. Still, for most engineered mutant lines, greater than 50% of individuals hatch into the first instar. Q111V homozygotes exhibit particularly high probabilities of survival until the pupal stage. Nonetheless, survivorship of individuals to adulthood is close to zero for all lines.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The substitution A119S rescues lethality of substitutions at sites 111 and 122</title><p>The unexpected deleterious effects of common substitutions at sites 111 and 122 raises the question of how insects with sensitive ATPα1 isoforms, spanning a broad phylogenetic distribution, can evolve insensitivity to CGs via substitutions to one or both of these sites.

Of the divergent sites between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. subobscura</italic>, only one site (119) is among those having the strongest phylogenetic correlations with both sites 111 and 122 (top 5% of 270 sites) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Considering the orientation of the amino-acid side chain of site 119 with respect to a bound CG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), it is unlikely that it plays a direct role in CG binding. Nonetheless, due to its physical proximity to sites 111 and 122 and the evidence for correlated evolution with these sites, we hypothesized that the A119S substitution may compensate for the deleterious effects of substitutions at positions 111 and 122. To test this hypothesis, we generated a second series of substitution lines that include A119S in isolation, and A119S paired with four substitutions at sites 111 and 122 (i.e. Q111L+A119S, Q111V+A119S, Q111T+A119S and A119S+N122H, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Embryos homozygous for A119S, with and without substitutions at 111 and 122, have levels of hatchability and survival that are close to wild-type levels. Remarkably, we find that A119S rescues the lethality associated with homozygosity for all four substitutions with which we paired it (i.e. compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Ideally, we would like to directly compare activities and inhibition profiles for individual substitutions at positions at 111 and 122 alone and in combination with A119S in vivo by fitting monophasic enzyme-inhibition curves (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petschenka et al., 2013a</xref>). However, homozygous lethality associated with substitutions at positions 111 and 122 in the absence of A119S prevents us from using this approach. Instead, we opted to compare wild-type and mutant forms of NKA in heterozygous (i.e. Mut/+) individuals, where we expect a heterogeneous mixture of two isoforms.

To test this hypothesis, we exposed adult animals to media containing the CG ouabain. While the wild-type strain suffers high levels of mortality upon CG exposure, the lines carrying substitutions at sites 111 and 122 in combination with A119S are all substantially less-sensitive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the survival probability of A119S+N122H (SH/+ and SH/SH) is indistinguishable from control treatments in exposures with up to 10 mM ouabain. Beyond confirming an association between insensitivity to CG-inhibition of enzyme activity in vitro and reduced sensitivity to CG-exposure in vivo, two additional important findings arise from these experiments. First, a substantial measure of insensitivity to CG-exposure is also conferred by A119S alone (S/+ and S/S exhibit ~8.5 fold and ~21 fold lower relative risk, respectively, than wild-type at 5 mM ouabain, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Despite this, A119S alone has only a small effect on NKA sensitivity to CG-inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Further, the substantially improved survival of heterozygous strains relative to the wild-type strain, including to some extent A119S/+, suggests that insensitivity to CG exposure is a partially dominant phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, despite the lethal homozygous effects of Q111V and N122H individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), the dominant effects of these substitutions on insensitivity to CG-exposure imply that they have the potential to confer a fitness advantage as heterozygotes in CG-rich environments.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48224.015</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Adult survival upon 7 day exposure to the CG ouabain.</title><p>Plotted is the log relative risk for treatments (5, 10 or 20 mM ouabain) relative to no treatment controls (no ouabain) for (<bold>A</bold>) heterozygous strains and (<bold>B</bold>) homozygous strains.

At the onset of this study, we expected minimal negative pleiotropic effects associated with adaptive substitutions at sites 111 and 122, given their frequent parallel occurrence across insect orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>). Our findings that these substitutions are associated with negative pleiotropic effects at multiple levels (i.e. enzyme function, neural function and viability) in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> suggests a potentially more complicated explanation. As we show, with few exceptions, adaptive substitutions conferring CG-insensitivity at sites 111 and 122 most often arise on a genetic background that includes a substitution at site 119, a site not previously implicated in CG-sensitivity. We further show that the most commonly observed substitution at site 119, A119S, rescues the lethality and dominant effects on neural function associated with substitutions at sites 111 and 122 in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. A second common substitution, A119N, appears independently in three insect orders and may act similarly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, the repeated use of specific substitutions does not mean that these changes unconditionally lack negative pleiotropic consequences and that their fitness advantage can depend critically on the background on which they arise.</p><p>It is notable that many of the amino acid substitutions associated with CG-adaptation (i.e. Q111L, Q111E, Q111H, A119S, and N122H), can all be reached by single nucleotide substitutions, whereas others (e.g. Q111V, Q111T) require two nucleotide substitutions. Q111V can be reached by single substitutions via intermediates Q111L and Q111E, both of which are observed among multiple CG-adapted insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, Q111T, which has arisen independently at least three times across insect orders, require passing through states Q111P or Q111K via single nucleotide substitutions, but neither are observed among the taxa surveyed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The lack of observed instances of Q111P or Q111K suggests that these states may be particularly deleterious and are either evolutionarily short-lived or circumvented altogether by dinucleotide mutation events. The latter scenario is made more plausible by recent work in <italic>Drosophila</italic> indicating that mutinucleotide mutation events are more frequent than previously appreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assaf et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To the extent that <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> represents a typical CG-sensitive species, it is clear that substitutions at positions 111 and 122 would not be permitted to fix in the species without being preceded by A119S or an equivalent permissive substitution. A119S was not detected in extensive mutagenesis screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>) and has only modest effects on CG-inhibition of NKA in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Given these findings and its position and orientation in the NKA-ouabain co-crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>), one might assume that A119S is a neutral (or nearly-neutral) permissive substitution that renders some species candidates for the adaptation to CGs by chance. However, our ability to examine the effects of A119S, and interacting substitutions, in the context of whole animal phenotypes reveals a remarkably different picture. In particular, we show that homozygosity for A119S results in substantial levels of neural dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Despite these detrimental effects, we also find that A119S, even when heterozygous, confers a substantial survival advantage upon exposure to CGs. Such insights could only be provided by evaluating the effects of mutations in the context of the whole organism. Investigating just one aspect of phenotype, for example biochemistry in vitro, yielded a misleading picture of the fitness advantages, and disadvantages, that likely operate on the individual amino acid substitutions underlying this adaptation.</p><p>Our findings raise the question of how, given its deleterious effects, A119S became established in so many species. Initially, a survival advantage conferred by A119S in CG-rich environments may have outweighed deleterious effects associated with homozygosity for this substitution. This may be especially true for insects that specialized on CG-containing plants, where competition with other species for resources is reduced. In multiple lineages, the substitutions A119S and A119N preceded substitutions to 111 and 122 (Hemiptera, Hymenoptera, Diptera). In Drosophila, where we have the greatest phylogenetic resolution, A119S was established before substitutions to sites 111 and 122 in the evolutionary lineage leading to <italic>D. subobscura</italic>, which appears to be polymorphic with respect to CG-insensitivity. This said, Q111L is sometimes observed in the absence of A119S (as is Q111E, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>: <italic>Bemisa tabaci</italic> and <italic>Lophocarya caryae;</italic> not shown are <italic>Aedes aegypti</italic>, <italic>Mechanitis polymia</italic> and <italic>Empyreuma pugione</italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) implying alternative permissive substitutions in these taxa. More generally, A119S is a common substitution among taxa that do not specialize on CG-containing hostplants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), again implying the existence of additional compensatory substitutions in these species. None of the remaining 20 substitutions distinguishing the <italic>D. subobscura</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> proteins appear among sites most highly correlated with A119S in a phylogenetic analysis, however, leaving us few clues about promising candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>This said, a model invoking serial substitution of A119S and compensatory mutations is not the only plausible scenario. Alternatively, since CG-insensitive haplotypes substitutions including A119S lack strong deleterious effects and may confer a survival advantage upon exposure to CGs when heterozygous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), such haplotypes may be maintained over time by heterozygote advantage and subsequently reach fixation as they accumulate a sufficient number of compensatory substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kimura, 1985</xref>) or by gene duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Spofford, 1969</xref>), which has occurred repeatedly in CG-specialist species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petschenka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>D. subobscura</italic> is polymorphic for substitutions at positions 111 and 122 mediating CG-insensitivity and these haplotypes are associated with polymorphic inversions that may rarely be homozygous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pegueroles et al., 2016</xref>). The evolution of CG-insensitivity in <italic>D. subobscura</italic> may be recent and represent a transient stage in the evolution of this adaptive trait. Another alternative is that protein dysfunction associated with CG-insensitivity substitutions is in some cases compensated by the up-regulation of ATPα1 expression (see for e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loehlin et al., 2019</xref>), which may be an important driver of recurrent ATPα1 duplication and is observed across multiple CG-adapted insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our study adds to a growing body of work linking epistasis to the dynamics of adaptive evolution in contexts where the ecological relevance of the phenotype is well-understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tarvin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McGlothlin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tufts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>). To date, however, epistasis among substitutions in a protein has been evaluated in silico, in vitro, and in microbes along the dimensions of either protein folding stability, ligand specificity, enzyme activity, or cell growth rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Storz, 2016</xref>). While it is tempting to use one axis of the mutation-phenotype map as a convenient proxy for fitness (e.g. in vitro studies of the effects of mutations on protein function), the actual effect of a given mutation on fitness is a convolution over multiple phenotypes, from the levels of enzyme and tissue function to that of whole organism fitness in its environment. By considering phenotypic effects both in vitro and in vivo, we demonstrate how dominance and epistasis of amino acid substitutions can be missed or mischaracterized in the absence of a whole animal model to evaluate these effects. As such, our study reveals surprising new features of adaptive amino acid substitutions that were previously inaccessible.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>ATPalpha1</td><td>NA</td><td>FLYB:FBgn0027548</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>ATPalpha1 △2-6b founder line, w[1118];;ATPa△2-6b attP/TM6B,Tb[1]</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td>15 engineered variants of ATPalpha1</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">y[1], w[67c23], P{y[+mDint2]=Crey}1b;;D[*]/TM3, Sb[1]</td><td>Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:851 FLYB:FBst0000851; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_851">BDSC_851</ext-link></td><td>Source of Cre protein</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="bottom">w[*];;ry[506] Dr[1]/TM6B, P{w[+mC]=Dfd-EYFP}3, Sb[1],Tb[1],ca[1]</td><td>Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center</td><td>BDSC:8704 FLYB:FBst0008704; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/BDSC_8704">BDSC_8704</ext-link></td><td>Balancer, chr 3</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>PCR/sequencing primers, Sanger-based sequencing</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>ATPa1 H1-H2 Forward: AAAACTTGGAGCGCGATGGT; ATPa1 H1-H2 Reverse: ATACGGTCGCCGAACTTCAC</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>PCR/sequencing primers for Illumina-based sequencing</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>ATPa1 H1-H2 Forward 2834: GTCTCGTGGGCTCGGCGCTTTCAGACACATCCCGA; ATPa1 H1-H2 Forward 3185: TCGTCGGCAGCGTCTGAGAAAATGCCCGTCACGA</td></tr><tr><td>Sequence-based reagent</td><td>PCR-added linker primers, Illumina-based sequencing</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>ATPa1 H1-H2 i5: AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACnnnnnnnnTCGTCGGCAGCGTCA; ATPa1 H1-H2 i7: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATnnnnnnnnGTCTCGTGGGCTCGG; where ‘nnnnnnnn’=any sequence index</td></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Ouabain</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat#: O3125</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Porcine sodium potassium ATPase, cerebral cortex</td><td>Millipore-Sigma</td><td>Cat#: A7510</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td valign="bottom"><italic>pGX-attB-ATPa2-6b</italic></td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td>available on request</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>PAML v4.8</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17483113">17483113</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014932">SCR_014932</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html">http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>BayesTraits v3.01</td><td>PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16685633">16685633</ext-link></td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014487">SCR_014487</ext-link></td><td><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV3.0.1/BayesTraitsV3.0.1.html">http://www.evolution.rdg.ac.uk/BayesTraitsV3.0.1/BayesTraitsV3.0.1.html</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>multiple sequence alignment (protein)</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref></td></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>multiple sequence alignment (nucleotide)</td><td>this paper</td><td>N/A</td><td><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sequencing and alignments</title><p>Sources of data used in this study are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

Phylogeny branch lengths were estimated using IQtree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>) on the nucleotide alignment of 174 ATPα1 sequences representing 161 species sampled from eight insect orders (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) using a guide phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) to force species branching order within orders. We carried out a comprehensive search for substitutions at ATPα1 on which substitutions at sites 111 and 122 were dependent using BayesTraits (version 3.01; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pagel and Meade, 2006</xref>). We first reconstructed the ancestral protein sequences of ATPα1 using the codeml(aaml) algorithm of PAML (version 4.8a; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang, 2007</xref>). As inputs, we provided PAML with the phylogeny with branch lengths and the protein sequence alignment for ATPα1. We used the default PAML parameters with the following changes: ‘cleandata’ was set to 0 to preserve sites with missing data; ‘fix_blength’ was set to one to use the branch lengths as the initial values in the ancestral reconstruction; ‘method’ was set to one to use a new algorithm in PAML that updates branch lengths one-by-one. Using the inferred ancestor, we then binarized each amino acid state in the multi-species alignment into ancestral, ‘0’, and derived, ‘1’, and used this, and the phylogeny with branch lengths as the input for BayesTraits. BayesTraits fits a continuous-time Markov model to estimate transition rates between discrete, binary traits and calculates the likelihood of the fitted model. Restricting rate parameters appropriately (see below), we tested whether the transition rates for sites 111 and 122 were dependent on the state at all other variant sites. We excluded 56 sites with just a single substitution (i.e. one instance in 174 sequences in the alignment) due to their low information content.</p><p>In all models, double transition rates (e.g. Q111V and A119S occurring at the same time) were set to zero as double transitions are highly unlikely to occur in a single step and can be modeled as two single transitions, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pagel (1994)</xref>. Additionally, we set all transition rates from the derived state back to the ancestral state to zero as failing to do this resulted in unrealistically high estimates of the reversion rate. After these restrictions were imposed, the null model (i.e. independence) had four transition parameters. To test the dependence between sites, we refit an alternative model with two additional restrictions: one forcing the transition rate at site one to be fixed regardless of the state of site 2, and a second forcing the transition rate at site two to be fixed regardless of the state of site 1. This effectively tests whether the transition rate is affected by the state of either site. Following the BayesTraits manual recommendations, the phylogeny branch lengths were scaled using BayesTraits to have a mean length of 0.1. Additionally, to increase the chance of finding the true maximum likelihood, we set MLTries to 250 which controls the number of times BayesTraits calls the maximum likelihood algorithm, returning the maximum likelihood of the 250 attempts. We ran each substitution pair 25 times and checked that at least half of the runs had equivalent maximum likelihoods (within 0.1) to ensure that the results were stable. Taking the maximum likelihood for each pair, for each model, we calculated p-values using the likelihood ratio test (LRT), where the statistic of merit is: 2 (unrestricted model – restricted model). The LRT statistic is chi-squared distributed with degrees of freedom (df) equal to the number of restrictions imposed on the model (in this case, df = 2).</p><p>A potential concern is that the models employed by PAML codeml(aaml) and BayesTraits ignore hierarchical relationships among codons encoding amino acid substitutions. This is a concern because, under a single nucleotide substitution model, Q111V must be reached by passing through states Q111L or Q111E. Likewise, Q111T must be reached by passing through states Q111P or Q111K. Despite ignoring these relationships, the effect on our analysis is likely to be minimal. First, although it is clear from phylogenetic patterns that Q111V was reached via Q111L in Danaid butterflies and Chrysomelid beetles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aardema et al., 2012</xref>), there is no clear phylogenetic evidence indicating that Q111V or Q111T have passed though intermediate states in other instances. This implies that intermediate states may be short-lived and that modeling these events as single steps may be a reasonable approximation. Second, the occurrence of multi-nucleotide mutations (e.g. generating Q111V or Q111T via a single mutation event) may be more frequent than commonly assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Assaf et al., 2017</xref>), and even PAML’s codon-based model (codonml) does not account for this. Third, ignoring hierarchical relationships among amino acid substitutions is more likely to lead to spurious conclusions about substitution order (which we do not consider) than co-occurrence. Finally, we use BayesTraits as one of several tools to identify key substitutions and guide functional experiments. Our focus on specific correlations does not imply that other correlations are not important, nor that some important functional interactions will be missed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Engineering ATPα amino-acid substitution lines</title><p>To test for phenotypic effects associated with candidate amino-acid substitutions, we developed a genetic engineering approach of the endogenous <italic>ATPα1</italic> (CG5670) locus in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>.

After vortexing, we divided homogenates into three aliquots of 300 µl representing technical replicates. Subsequently, samples were frozen at −80°C and freeze-dried (Christ, Alpha 2–4 LDPlus) overnight. For assessing resistance of NKA to ouabain, we followed the procedure as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Petschenka et al. (2013a)</xref> that is based on the photometric evaluation of phosphate released from enzymatic hydrolysis of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as a measure of NKA activity. Lyophilisates were stored at −80°C until use and reconstituted with 500 µl deionized water. Head extractions were incubated at 12 increasing concentrations of the water-soluble standard cardenolide ouabain (range 10<sup>−8</sup> M to 2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> M, Sigma, Germany, O3125) at 37°C under the following conditions: 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM KCl, 4 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 50 mM imidazol, and 2.5 mM ATP (pH 7.4). We corrected all measurements for a background value that we obtained by incubating the extract under the same conditions as above, except with the addition of 2 × 10<sup>−3</sup> M ouabain and no KCl (i.e., NKA inactive). On each microplate, we included an assay with porcine Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup>-ATPase (Sigma, Germany, A7510-5UN) as an internal standard. In addition, we ran a series of KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> dilutions as a phosphate calibration curve on every plate. We measured absorbances at 700 nm using a CLARIOstar microplate reader (BMG Labtech, Germany). We carried out three biological replicates per line based on different extractions of fly heads. Each biological replicate was the average of three technical replicates, that is measurements based on aliquots from original extracts. For data analysis, we compared all measurements to a non-inhibited control.</p><p>To quantify levels of insensitivity to CG-inhibition, we used least-squares fitting to the bi-phasic curve function,<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>I</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>50</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where IC<sub>50,1</sub> and IC<sub>50,2</sub> represent the inhibitor concentration [I] required for 50% activity <italic>A</italic> of each isoform present in proportions (<italic>1 f</italic>) <italic>and f</italic>, respectively. For heterozygous lines, we expect a biphasic curve reflecting the inhibitor dissociation constants (<italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic>) of the two forms of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). If the two forms of the enzyme contribute equally to the total ouabain-inhibitable activity, we expect <italic>f</italic> = 0.5. For homozygous lines, we estimated a single IC<sub>50</sub> by setting <italic>f</italic> = 0 in the above equation, which assumes a homogenous population of enzyme. Least-squares fitting was performed with the nlsLM function of the minpack.lm library in R. Alternatively, we used OriginPro 2017 (OriginLab, Northampton, MA) with top and bottom asymptotes set to 100 and 0, respectively. The two approaches yielded similar results. Confidence intervals on estimates of IC<sub>50,1</sub>, IC<sub>50,2</sub> and <italic>f</italic> were estimated using parametric bootstrap simulations, assuming that residuals across biological replicates are normally distributed.

Enzyme-inhibition activities were analyzed as above except using six ouabain concentrations (range 10<sup>−8</sup> M to 10<sup>−3</sup> M) and one biological replicate. Parameters for homogenous extracts and mixtures were estimated using the monophasic (<italic>f</italic> = 0) and biphasic models (<italic>f</italic> &gt; 0), respectively. As expected, the pig and Monarch enzymes exhibit monophasic curves whereas the mixtures exhibit biphasic curves with <italic>f</italic> estimates close to those expected based on mixture proportions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Targeted allele-specific expression</title><p>To estimate relative expression of mutant and wild-type alleles in heterozygous strains, we designed a targeted allele-specific expression (ASE) assay. Genomic DNA (gDNA) and total RNA were extracted sequentially using TRIzole Reagent (Invitrogen 15596026 and 15596018) from three replicate pools of 20 males sampled from each of sixteen lines. Extracted RNA was further purified with Qiagen RNAeasy column (Qiagen 74104) and reverse transcribed into cDNA with the use of random primers and ProtoScript II Reverse Transcriptase (NEB M0368S). Two sets of primers for ATPα1 were designed and used in subsequent PCR, multiplexing and sequencing. The first set were designed as exon-primed intron crossing primers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Racle et al., 2017</xref>) and span a short intron separating exons 2 and 3. A second set of primers was used to add standard Illumina-like i5 and i7 barcodes to the PCR amplicons to facilitate multiplexing and subsequent sequencing. These multiplexed amplicons were pooled and sequenced on an Illimina MiSeq (Princeton Microarray Facility) and yielded ~1 million 150 nucleotide paired-end reads. Reads were mapped to gDNA and cDNA reference sequences using bwa-mem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Li, 2013</xref>) and a Variant Calling File (VCF) file was produced using the Naive Variant Caller as implemented in Galaxy (Version 0.0.2). ASE was estimated from allele counts at focal sites (104, 111 and 122) using the Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel framework as implemented in R (mantelhaen.test). Specifically, ASE is estimated as the relative risk of the mutant substitution in the cDNA population using allele counts from gDNA as a reference population.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Behavioral phenotyping</title><p>We quantified ‘bang sensitivity’ which is a measure of susceptibility to seizures and paralysis upon mechanical over-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ganetzky and Wu, 1982</xref>). As such, the bang sensitivity phenotype is a measure of proper neuron function. Individual flies were placed in an empty fly media vial and vortexed at the maximum setting for 20 s. Immediately following mechanical overstimulation, neurologically dysfunctional flies typically experience a period of convulsions and seizures. The recovery time was recorded as the time for each fly to right itself. Male flies were assayed 14 days post-eclosion. Approximate 95% confidence intervals were estimated around means by bootstrap resampling with replacement. An average of 43 flies were assayed (range 37–85). Recovery time distributions were compared using a Wilcoxon two-sample rank sum test with continuity correction as implemented in R (wilcox.test).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>CG exposure assay</title><p>As a measure of the ability to tolerate CGs, we exposed adult flies (1–7 days post-eclosion) to media containing known concentrations of the CG ouabain (Sigma). 1.5 grams of <italic>Drosophila</italic> instant media (Carolina Biological Supply) was reconstituted in a plastic vial with 7 mL of either 0, 5, 10 or 20 mM ouabain. After food solidified (30 min), a small paper wick was added. Three replicates, each with 10 males and 10 females, were kept in separate vials at 25°C and 50% humidity. Mortality was measured after 7 days. The genetically engineered wild-type line was used as a control. The relationship between treatment concentrations and physiologically-relevant concentrations for animals feeding on CG-containing plants is difficult to establish. Compared to values reported for various milkweed species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Züst et al., 2019</xref>), our 10 mM CG treatment corresponds to a per mg dry weight concentration that is ~10 fold higher than the range reported for leaf tissue, but well within those reported for milkweed latex. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenzel test framework (implemented in R) was used to assess significant differences between treatments (i.e. 5/10/20 mM ouabain versus no ouabain), as well as estimates and 95% confidence bounds for the relative risk associated with treatment. Odds Ratios (<italic>OR</italic>) estimated using this framework were converted into relative risk (<italic>RR</italic>) estimates using the formula, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>*</mml:mi><mml:mi>O</mml:mi><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>p</italic> is the risk in the no ouabain control group. A constant (0.5) was added to all cells to allow for calculation of relative risk in cases where mortality or survivors were absent. Thus, the maximum relative risk for this sample size (three replicates of 20 individuals each) is limited to 117. We found no sex differences in survival.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank M Przeworski and M Schumer for comments on the manuscript, D James and A Wilson for sending <italic>Syntomeida epilais</italic> specimens and M Aguadé for providing pre-publication access to the <italic>D guanche</italic> ATPα1 sequence.

This is a rich and well ploughed field of research, but this paper, because it approaches the topic in a deeper and more integrative fashion than usual, makes novel and important observations. In this field, typically a gene for the target - Na+/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase (NKA) - is sequenced, amino acid (AA) substitutions in the protein are inferred, and their ability to confer toxin resistance is tested in vitro by expression and site-directed mutations. This study by Taverner et al. starts out simply enough by testing whether the two most frequent and intensively studied substitutions in NKA that protect against toxin binding are neutral as far as function of NKA in the whole animal. They engineered these AA substitutions into the single NKA of flies and found, surprisingly, that these were recessive lethal. They then undertook a number of logical experiments to understand how these AA substitutions might be selected if they are so detrimental when expressed in the whole animal. They found a previously overlooked substitution at a site that contributes little to toxin resistance but &quot;corrects&quot; the deleterious substitutions, although not completely so that even flies that are heterozygous for this substitution are impacted. They then asked if the AA substitutions that are typically studied in vitro act in vivo. They fed the engineered flies on various concentrations of ouabain in their food and observed that, indeed, the substitutions saved flies from the deleterious effects of this NKA inhibitor. Finally, based on all their observations, the authors pose a model in which NKA with some AA substitutions occurs in heterozygosity in those insects that feed on cardioglycoside-rich plants where, despite the sub-optimal NKA, the advantages of toxin protection outweigh the detriment of suboptimal NKA enzyme activity. Eventually, as a result of further AA substitutions on this enzyme or, as often happens, gene duplication leaving an optimally-functioning but cardioglycoside-unprotected paralog working in the brain and a cardio-glycoside protected analog in the gut, a more evolutionarily stable situation is reached.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raise a number of concerns that must be adequately addressed before the paper can be accepted. These required revisions only require clarifications in the text and do not require further experimentation.</p><p>1) At position 111 and 112 the authors investigated three amino acid changes, Q111V, Q111T and N122H. Whereas N122H can arise via a single nucleotide substitution, the other two amino acid changes require at least two nucleotide substitutions according to the genetic code. Can the authors elaborate a bit on this point? Is this fact taken into account in their statistical phylogenetic analysis using PAML and BayesTraits?

Whereas N122H can arise via a single nucleotide substitution, the other two amino acid changes require at least two nucleotide substitutions according to the genetic code. Can the authors elaborate a bit on this point? Also, did the amino acid changes Q111V and Q111T occur via two successive nucleotide substitutions (i.e. are there intermediate DNA sequences found in natural populations or intermediate species)? If so, what would be the intermediate amino acid? Wouldn't it be important in the future to test the effect of the two successive amino acid changes on fitness?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. We initially excluded discussion of this point to keep the Discussion more focused, but since this has been highlighted by the reviewers, we have added back in a short paragraph discussing this observation and some of its implications (see Discussion, second paragraph). Assuming single nucleotide mutations, Q111V could be reached by intermediate states Q111L or Q111E, both of which are observed in other taxa. The case of Q111T is more interesting as it requires passing through states Q111P or Q111K via single nucleotide substitutions, which are not observed in other taxa. The absence of Q111P and Q111K in other taxa suggests that these states are particularly deleterious, which would definitely be interesting to test. However, an alternative hypothesis is that Q111T could be reached in a single step by dinucleotide mutation events, which are more frequent than previously appreciated (Assaf et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is this fact taken into account in their statistical phylogenetic analysis using PAML and BayesTraits? If not, could it affect the results of the statistical phylogenetic analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>This is valid concern and we agree that it deserves more justification. We have added the following paragraph to the Materials and methods section concerning the use of PAML and BayesTraits: “A potential concern is that the models employed by PAML codeml(aaml) and BayesTraits ignore hierarchical relationships among codons encoding amino acid substitutions. […] Our focus on specific correlations does not imply that other correlations are not important, nor that some important functional interactions will be missed.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) This paper only considers AA substitutions but not levels of expression.

We also added new data and results validating the approach (subsection “Enzyme inhibition assays”, Figure 2—figure supplement 1 B and C).</p></body></sub-article></article>
