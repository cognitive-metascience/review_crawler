Humans with NK cell deficiency are more susceptible to viral infection, especially herpesviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Orange, 2002</xref>). Their natural killing potential makes NK cells an ideal candidate for immunotherapy against various tumors, and NK cell adoptive transfer has been explored as promising adjuvant therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Curti et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Miller et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rubnitz et al., 2010</xref>). Given the importance of NK cells, it is critical to define the essential developmental programs that regulate their homeostasis and maturation.</p><p>NK cells develop in the bone marrow (BM) and progress through distinct differentiation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Santo, 2006</xref>). Expression of IL-15/IL-2 receptor β chain (CD122) defines the commitment of common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) cells to the NK cell lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosmaraki et al., 2001</xref>). Recently, the cell surface markers-defined NK cell progenitors (NKP) have been refined as Lin<sup>−</sup>Flt3<sup>−</sup>CD27<sup>+</sup>2B4<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Carotta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fathman et al., 2011</xref>). Committed NKPs differentiate into immature (iNK; Lin<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>−</sup>) and eventually mature NK cells (mNK; Lin<sup>−</sup>CD122<sup>+</sup>NK1.1<sup>+</sup>DX5<sup>+</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Di Santo, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rosmaraki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Williams et al., 2000</xref>). Development of NK cells following NK1.1 expression is further defined into three groups based on CD27 and CD11b expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayakawa and Smyth, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2002b</xref>). Adoptive transfer experiments have demonstrated that CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>−</sup> (CD27 single positive, SP) NK cells differentiate into CD27<sup>+</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (double positive, DP) cells. DP NK cells down-regulate CD27 to mature into CD27<sup>−</sup>CD11b<sup>+</sup> (CD11b SP) cells, the terminally matured NK cell population which expresses KLRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chiossone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huntington et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>NK cell differentiation is driven by stage-specific transcription factors including Eomesodermin (Eomes) and T-bet which play critical roles in distinct maturation stages of NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daussy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>). Genetic knockout models demonstrated that Eomes is essential in driving maturation of CD27 SP to DP NK cells, while T-bet governs the terminal maturation of the DP to CD11b SP NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Townsend et al., 2004</xref>). Although the transcription factors involved in NK cell development at different maturation stages are established, the intracellular signaling pathways that regulate these transcription factors have not been well-defined.</p><p>mTOR is an evolutionarily conserved serine/threonine kinase that forms two functionally distinct complexes, mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and mTOR complex 2 (mTORC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). Raptor and Rictor are the defining components of mTORC1 and mTORC2, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jacinto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sarbassov et al., 2004</xref>). These complexes regulate cell growth, proliferation, and metabolism and play an indispensable role in immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Powell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Weichhart et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wullschleger et al., 2006</xref>). The activation of mTORC1 involves the canonical PI3K-PDK1-Akt-TSC1/2-mTORC1 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Saxton and Sabatini, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang and Guan, 2007</xref>). Although less is known about the upstream activator of mTORC2, PtdIns(3,4,5)P<sub>3</sub>, which is generated by PI3K (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Whitman et al., 1988</xref>), has been shown to be critical (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). mTORC2 is known to phosphorylate Akt at Serine 473 and increase its kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Guertin et al., 2006</xref>). Whether this increased Akt kinase activity mediated by mTORC2 is critical for mTORC1 activation in physiological content remains unknown.</p><p>Signaling through IL-15 receptors is obligatory for NK cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiSanto et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kennedy et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Suzuki et al., 1997</xref>), and activation of PI3K is one component of IL-15 receptors signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhu et al., 1994</xref>). These imply that both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are essential for NK cell development. Indeed, <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic>-mediated NK-cell-specific ablation of mTOR results in impaired development and effector functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). While this study reveals the requirement of mTOR itself, the independent contributions of mTORC1 or mTORC2 in NK cell development remain undefined. The primary limitation of interpreting mTOR deficiency is the inability to attribute the functional and developmental outcomes to precise signaling pathways and transcription factors that are uniquely regulated by either mTORC1 or mTORC2. Previous studies have demonstrated that PDK1, an upstream activator of mTORC1, regulates early NK cell development by inducing Nfil3 which drives the transcription of <italic>Eomes</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). FoxO1, a downstream effector of mTORC2, negatively regulates the terminal maturation of NK cells through direct inhibition of the transcription of <italic>Tbx21</italic> (the gene encoding T-bet) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these, we hypothesized that mTORC1 and mTORC2 regulate NK cell development through differentially driving the expression of distinct T-box transcription factors.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we conditionally deleted Raptor (<italic>Rptor</italic>) or Rictor (<italic>Rictor</italic>) to eliminate the formation of mTORC1 or mTORC2, respectively, in NK cells by using <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> transgenic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2011</xref>). We find both mTORC1 and mTORC2 are essential for NK cell development. The ablation of mTORC1 disrupts NK cell homeostasis and blocks the transition of the CD27 SP to DP stage. RNAseq analyses reveal significant alteration of the gene expression profile in Raptor-deficient NK cells with impaired expression of transcription factors governing early NK cell development. Loss of mTORC2 blocks the transition of the DP to the terminally mature CD11b SP NK cells. This defect is associated with impaired induction of T-bet through a mechanism involving the mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1 signaling axis. These findings reveal distinct roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in NK cell development and define them as the upstream regulators of T-box transcription factors during NK cell development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>mTORC1 is critical for homeostasis and differentiation of NK cells</title><p>To define the role of mTORC1 in NK cell homeostasis, we generated NK-cell-specific conditional knockout (cKO) mice by breeding <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<italic>loxp</italic> sites targeting exon 6) with <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> knockin mice.

The percentage of proliferating NK cells was significantly reduced in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice at steady-state, as evidenced by Ki-67 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Increased cell number in the BM suggested a potential impairment in the trafficking of NK cells. To test this, WT and <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice were intravenously injected with an anti-CD45.2 antibody, sacrificed after 2 min, and their BM cells were analyzed. This allowed us to quantify the number of NK cells in the sinusoidal versus parenchymal regions of the BM, an indicator of NK cell trafficking under steady state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leong et al., 2015</xref>). The frequency and number of CD45.2<sup>+</sup> NK cells were significantly reduced in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice, indicating impairment in the trafficking of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). There were no differences in cell viability between WT and <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO NK cells, as demonstrated by Annexin V and Propidium iodide staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). These data showed that disruption of mTORC1 impairs homeostatic NK cell proliferation and migration, but not viability.</p><p>Next, we investigated the role of mTORC1 in NK cell differentiation. Expression of CD122, NK1.1, and DX5 indicated a reduction of the mNK population in the spleen, while the iNK population was similar between WT and <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which matches with the onset of <italic>Ncr1</italic> expression occurring at the late stage of iNK. No significant changes were observed among NKPs, iNKs, and mNKs in the BM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We then focused our analyses on NK cell maturation using cell surface markers CD27 and CD11b. Raptor deficiency resulted in a significant block in the transition from the CD27 SP to DP stage in both the BM and periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Consistent with this, the frequency of KLRG1-expressing NK cells was also significantly reduced in all organs tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Analyses of other activating and inhibitory cell surface receptors indicated further developmental defects including reduced expression of Ly49D, Ly49G2, and Ly49H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Collectively, we conclude that mTORC1 is required for maintaining NK cell homeostasis through proliferation, migration, and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>mTORC2 is required for terminal maturation of NK cells</title><p>To elucidate the role of mTORC2 in NK cell development, we crossed <italic>Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice (<italic>loxp</italic> sites targeting exon 11) with <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> mice to generate conditional knockout of <italic>Rictor</italic> in NK cells.

In NK cells, the earlier study revealed the essential role of mTOR in controlling development following Ncr1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). This study revealed that lack of mTOR resulted in an impairment in the transition of CD27 SP to DP and defective IL-15-mediated STAT5 activation. , Irrespective of these findings, the independent roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 remains unknown. Moreover, it is impossible to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms by which mTOR regulate distinct developmental progression of NK cells with the concurrent loss of both mTORC1 and mTORC2. Therefore, we generated <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic>-mediated conditional deletion of <italic>Rptor</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> to disrupt mTORC1 or mTORC2 specifically in NK cells. Phenotypic analyses revealed that both mTOR complexes are critical for the homeostasis of NK cells and that the independent disruption of mTORC1 or mTORC2 results in defective NK cell maturation at distinct developmental stages. The differential alteration of the expression of Eomes and T-bet in <italic>Rptor</italic> or <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice provide a potential mechanistic explanation for the maturation defects. In the physiological context, neither <italic>Rptor</italic> nor <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice demonstrated robust NK cell-mediated antitumor responses, highlighting the biological consequences of lacking either mTORC1 or mTORC2.</p><p>In <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice, the homeostatic NK cellularity is disrupted as evidenced by reduced NK cell number in the periphery, reduced steady-state proliferation and impaired migration <italic>in vitro</italic>. Moreover, exclusive loss of mTORC1 significantly impairs NK cell maturation, as demonstrated by accumulation of CD27 SP population and reduced DP and CD11b SP populations. This defect may directly contribute to the accumulated NK cells in the BM, as they gradually obtain migratory capacity following CD11b expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayol et al., 2011</xref>). Despite our findings using <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice, <italic>Ncr1<sup>Cre</sup></italic>-mediated deletion of <italic>Pdpk1</italic> or <italic>Tsc1</italic> did not have any impact on NK cell development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). This suggests that following <italic>Ncr1</italic> expression, mTORC1 is potentially activated through an alternative mechanism instead of the canonical PI3K-PDK1-Akt-TSC1/2-mTORC1 pathway. In addition, mTORC1 is also likely critical for early NK cell commitment and development at pre-Ncr1 stages based on the phenotype seen in <italic>Pdpk1<sup>fl/fl</sup> Vav1<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Further work is required to elucidate these up-stream mechanisms that regulate mTORC1 signaling. mTORC1 regulates protein translation through various mechanisms. One of which directly affects the translation of proteins comprising the translational machinery such as eIFs, eEFs, and ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Meyuhas, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Thoreen et al., 2012</xref>). However, less is known about the regulation of these proteins at the transcriptional level, especially related to the loss of mTORC1. In this context, our RNAseq analyses revealed that selective disruption of mTORC1 leads to increased transcripts level of eIFs, eEFs, and ribosomal proteins, implying an alternative pathway that compensates the protein translation defects. Gene ontology analyses also revealed that oxidative phosphorylation and integrin signaling are impaired in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO NK cells. These findings are novel and have not been implicated with mTORC1 in lymphocytes. These observations warrant future studies especially related to the effector functions of NK cells.</p><p>NK cell maturation is driven by the temporally-regulated production of key transcription factors at distinct developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hesslein and Lanier, 2011</xref>). Our RNAseq analyses revealed that expression of key transcription factors (Nfil3, Id2, Eomes) that govern early NK cell development are impaired in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO but not in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells, correlating with the early developmental defects in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO mice. Among those three transcription factors, Nfil3 is dispensable for the development of NK cells following <italic>Ncr1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Firth et al., 2013</xref>). Although both Id2- and Eomes-deficient NK cells have similar developmental phenotype as <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gordon et al., 2012</xref>), we did not detect increased expression of E-protein genes that are suppressed by Id2 in NK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, we found significantly reduced expression of Eomes protein and enrichment of Eomes target genes in <italic>Rptor</italic> cKO NK cells. This indicates that among those three transcription factors, the reduced Eomes expression is more likely responsible for the maturation defects due to the exclusive loss of mTORC1.</p><p>Compared to mTORC1, less is known about mTORC2, mainly due to the lack of mTORC2-specific inhibitors; however, through using the <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> mice model, we are able to study the independent role of mTORC2 specifically in NK cells. Our data reveal that mTORC2 is essential for the development of NK cells. NK cell number is significantly reduced in the periphery of <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO mice, and this impairment potentially results from reduced steady-state proliferation. Unlike the early maturation impairment at CD27 SP to DP transition by the loss of mTORC1, deletion of <italic>Rictor</italic> causes a defect during the transition from the DP to CD11b SP stage. Importantly, when we assess the expression of T-box transcription factors, Eomes expression is comparable between WT and <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells, which is consistent with an unaltered transition from CD27 SP to DP stages. This indicates that mTORC1 activation is not affected in Rictor-deficient NK cells during development. The <italic>in vitro</italic> IL-15 stimulation further proves that mTORC2 deficiency did not affect mTORC1 activation despite diminished Akt<sup>S473</sup> phosphorylation. In contrast, the expression of T-bet is significantly reduced in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells, which correlates with the impairment in terminal maturation. Mechanistically, Rictor but not Raptor deficiency results in hyperactive FoxO1 due to abolished mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1 signaling regulation. FoxO1 has been shown to directly bind the promoter region of T-bet and suppress its expression. However, the upstream signaling pathway that releases the suppression of T-bet from FoxO1 has not been established during NK cell development. RNAseq analyses revealed a hyperactive FoxO1 phenotype in Rictor-deficient NK cells. Reduced steady-state phosphorylation of FoxO1 further emphasizes a more functionally active FoxO1 in the absence of mTORC2 due to abolished Akt<sup>S473</sup> phosphorylation. Thus, the hyperactive FoxO1 suppresses T-bet expression at transcriptional level in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells. While this pathway has previously been shown to control CD8 T cell memory differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollizzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), our work establishes that during NK cell development, stimuli (presumably IL-15) activate mTORC2-Akt<sup>S473</sup>-FoxO1 signaling cascade that reveals the suppression of T-bet from FoxO1 and this signaling axis is indispensable to maintain NK cell homeostasis and drive terminal maturation. The RNAseq analyses also revealed that PTEN signaling is impaired in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells, which indicates a balanced activation loop consists of PI(3)K-PI(3,4,5)P3-mTORC2-PTEN. This may contribute to the moderately increased mTORC1 activity in <italic>Rictor</italic> cKO NK cells. Future work is warranted to explore this phenomenon. The overall effector functions are normal in Poly (I:C)-primed or IL-2-cultured Rictor-deficient NK cells.</p><p>In summary, our study establishes the differential and independent roles of mTORC1 and mTORC2 in the development of NK cells. Our study implies that careful considerations should be taken when utilizing mTOR inhibitors following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation since manipulation of mTOR complexes can potentially compromise NK cell development and repopulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice, cell lines, and reagents</title><p> <italic>Rptor<sup>fl/fl</sup> and Rictor<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME). <italic>Ncr1<sup>iCre</sup></italic> mice were a generous gift from Dr. Eric Vivier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Narni-Mancinelli et al., 2011</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michel Nussenzweig as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Megan Cooper (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper was reviewed by two scientists expert in NK cell biology and a member of the Board of Reviewing Editors (BRE). They endeavored to provide a consensus statement and together suggest the authors submit a revised manuscript describing the in vitro functions of Rictor and Raptor ko NK cells as suggested by both reviewers. In addition, the reviewers wondered about the novelty of the findings, given that they were almost exactly as expected, based on the previous findings regarding mTor and NK cells. A revised manuscript should help readers understand why the current manuscript is an advance even though the findings were predictable. FoxO1 deserves more prominence in the Discussion as one reviewer felt that this finding was the more novel findings for NK cells. The full reviews are given below. The authors should endeavor to address all comments in a revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript by Yang et al. investigate the requirements for mTORC1 and mTORC2 on NK cell development and homeostasis using a genetic model. Overall, the manuscript presents novel findings and provides significant insight into mechanisms regulating NK cell development. The experiments are well-controlled and the manuscript is well-written. The authors use an NKp46-specific iCre mouse to target Rptor and Rictor, primary components of the mTORC1 and mTORC2 complexes respectively. They performed a phenotypic analysis of the NK compartment and demonstrate a block in early NK cell differentiation with Rptor ko and a block in the final stages of NK differentiation with Rictor ko. Analysis of TFs known to be important for NK differentiation reveal Eomes (Rptor) and Tbet (Rictor) as downregulated, as well as differences in CD122 expression and IL-15 signaling. There is some data suggesting impaired BM egress and trafficking including an in vivo assay and decreased mRNA expression of S1PR5, although this is not that developed and it isn't clear whether there is truly a trafficking defect. The focus, and strength of the manuscript, is the investigation of the molecular pathways altered by deletion of Rptor and Rictor in NK cells, including analysis of Eomes and Tbet and the identification of hyperactive FoxO1 activity.</p><p>There are no in vitro functional assays of the NK cells presented (cytokine production, degranulation, killing). The authors do present in vivo data with reduced cell clearance.

The authors do present in vivo data with reduced cell clearance. However, it is expected that lower NK cell numbers would lead to lower in vivo target clearance (and susceptibility to a tumor model), while in vitro studies would reveal any functional differences on a single cell level.</p></disp-quote><p>We analyzed the functional capabilities of these NK cells using two different systems.</p><p>The first system is in vivo Poly (I:C)-activated NK cells stimulated with NK cell-sensitive target cell line RMA/s, IL-12/18 or PMA/Ionomycin. We included the medium and RMA cell line which is not NK cell sensitive target as the controls. We evaluated the degranulation and IFN-γ generation using flow cytometry. The data demonstrated that Raptor-deficient NK cells have impaired effector functions when stimulated with RMA/s cell lines or PMA/Ionomycin. Consistent with the previous report, mTORC1 seems to be independent for IL-12/18-mediated activation (Figure 9A and B). On the contrary, Rictor-deficient NK cells do not have any functional defects regardless of the type of stimuli (Figure 9C and D).</p><p>The second system we used is the IL-2-cultured NK cells. Specifically, NK cells from spleen are expanded in vitro and subject to functional assay. Due to the pool expansion of Raptor-deficient NK cells, we used Rapamycin to acutely inhibit mTORC1 as the surrogate. The cytolytic potential of NK cells is not affected either by Rapamycin (Figure 9—figure supplement 1A) or Rictor deficiency (Figure 9—figure supplement 1B), indicating that neither mTOR complex is involved in degranulation progress. As for cytokine generation, mTORC1, but not mTORC2, is required for IFN-γ production downstream of activating receptor NKG2D (Figure 9—figure supplement 1C and D).</p><p>In summary, our data indicate that mTORC1 is essential for the effector function of NK cells, and mTORC2 is not critical for these processes. These additional data are included in the revised manuscript (Figure 9 and Figure 9—figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The NK cells from KO mice could be analyzed in greater depth.
