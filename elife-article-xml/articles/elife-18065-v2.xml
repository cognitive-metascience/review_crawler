In Huntington’s disease (HD), neurotoxicity correlates with an increased aggregation propensity of a polyglutamine (polyQ) expansion in exon 1 of mutant huntingtin protein (mHtt). Here we establish how the domains flanking the polyQ tract shape the mHtt conformational landscape in vitro and in neurons. In vitro, the flanking domains have opposing effects on the conformation and stabilities of oligomers and amyloid fibrils. The N-terminal N17 promotes amyloid fibril formation, while the C-terminal Proline Rich Domain destabilizes fibrils and enhances oligomer formation. However, in neurons both domains act synergistically to engage protective chaperone and degradation pathways promoting mHtt proteostasis. Surprisingly, when proteotoxicity was assessed in rat corticostriatal brain slices, either flanking region alone sufficed to generate a neurotoxic conformation, while the polyQ tract alone exhibited minimal toxicity. Linking mHtt structural properties to its neuronal proteostasis should inform new strategies for neuroprotection in polyQ-expansion diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18065.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18065.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18065.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Huntington’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder in which misshapen proteins accumulate in the brain and kill neurons. The misshapen proteins form as a result of specific mutations in the gene that encodes a protein called huntingtin. These mutations result in a region of the protein called the polyQ tract being longer than normal. Other regions of huntingtin that are near to the polyQ tract can dramatically change the behavior of the mutant protein. Shen et al. investigated how these regions control the shape of mutant huntingtin and how this affects the toxicity of the mutant protein in neurons.</p><p>The experiments found that the two regions on either side of the polyQ tract dramatically change the shape of mutant huntingtin proteins. In the absence of these flanking regions, the extended polyQ region is not very toxic, demonstrating that the flanking sequences play important roles in generating the toxic protein shapes. These flanking regions help mutant huntingtin to form a particular shape that was strongly linked with the death of neurons in rat brain slices. The flanking regions also change the way that the cellular machinery in neurons recognizes mutated huntingtin proteins and acts to prevent them from causing harm.</p><p>Misshapen forms of other proteins are responsible for causing other neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s diseases. Therefore, the findings of Shen et al. may help researchers to develop new drugs for these conditions, as well as for Huntingdon’s disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18065.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18065.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Huntington's disease</kwd><kwd>proteostasis</kwd><kwd>aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>gm56433</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Koning</given-names></name><name><surname>Frydman</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS080514</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calamini</surname><given-names>Barbara</given-names></name><name><surname>Lo</surname><given-names>Donald C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>pn2ey016525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shahmoradian</surname><given-names>Sarah H</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Wah</given-names></name><name><surname>Frydman</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>gm103832</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Boxue</given-names></name><name><surname>Shahmoradian</surname><given-names>Sarah H</given-names></name><name><surname>Chiu</surname><given-names>Wah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fauerbach</surname><given-names>Jonathan A</given-names></name><name><surname>Frydman</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS092525</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Koning</given-names></name><name><surname>Frydman</surname><given-names>Judith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The polyQ tract of pathogenic Huntingtin causes aggregation when expanded in Huntington’s disease, but its two flanking domains control its conformational landscape, proteostasis and neurotoxicity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Huntington’s disease (HD) is an inherited neurodegenerative disease characterized by movement disorders, behavioral abnormalities, and brain atrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Orr and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ross et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Vonsattel and DiFiglia, 1998</xref>). HD arises from mutations in Huntingtin (Htt) that expand a polyglutamine (polyQ)-encoding CAG repeat in exon 1 above a threshold length of 35 Qs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">MacDonald, 1993</xref>). The length of the polyQ tract correlates with both disease severity and propensity to form amyloid aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Scherzinger et al., 1999</xref>). A link between neuronal toxicity and amyloid aggregation is further supported by post-mortem analyses of HD brains, which contain amyloid aggregates formed primarily by N-terminal exon 1 truncations of Htt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Difiglia, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Landles et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mangiarini et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ross and Poirier, 2004</xref>). Such N-terminal fragments may arise from aberrant splicing at the Htt exon 1 junction or from caspase cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sathasivam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wellington et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, mutant Htt exon 1 carrying a polyQ expansion (herein 'mHtt-Ex1') suffices to cause HD-like disease in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldberg et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sathasivam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wellington et al., 2002</xref>) and is thus widely used as a relevant model for HD biology and pathology.</p><p>Despite the link between aggregation and neurodegeneration, the underlying neurotoxic species in HD and other amyloid-linked neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis remains elusive. One model proposes that amyloid aggregates are toxic because they sequester and deplete essential cellular proteins such as transcription factors or molecular chaperones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kirstein-Miles et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Olzscha et al., 2011</xref>). However, a number of findings question the causal relationship between mHtt amyloid aggregates and toxicity. For instance, the medium spiny striatal neurons more vulnerable to HD toxicity show few to no aggregates in HD patient brains. In contrast, less affected neuronal cell-types contain many aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kuemmerle et al., 1999</xref>). In addition, while transgenic mHtt-Ex1 is neurotoxic in mice, a longer N-terminal mHtt fragment encompassing exons 1 and 2 forms many aggregates in transgenic mice but exhibits no neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Slow et al., 2005</xref>). Finally, longitudinal survival studies of primary neurons expressing fluorescently-tagged mHtt-Ex1 demonstrated that the formation of an amyloid inclusion correlated with neuronal survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrasate et al., 2004</xref>). Since fluorescence and EM imaging studies have suggested that mHtt can be sequestered in different types of cellular inclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caron et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Nekooki-Machida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sahl et al., 2016</xref>) one possible explanation for these observations is that only some inclusions are toxic, while others are protective.</p><p>An alternative hypothesis proposes that toxicity resides in soluble oligomeric mHtt conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrends et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Campioni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). Biophysical studies indicate that amyloidogenic proteins, including mHtt, not only form amyloid fibrils but also populate an array of ill-defined soluble, oligomeric conformations. Studies with conformationally-sensitive antibodies indicate that these states are conformationally highly heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Duim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kayed and Glabe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nucifora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sontag et al., 2012</xref>). The transient and structurally diverse nature of these soluble species has hindered their characterization; accordingly, the nature and determinants involved in the formation of these oligomeric mHtt species remain elusive. It remains imperative to clarify the mHtt conformational landscape and link the various species – aggregates, oligomers, or even aberrant monomers – to proteotoxicity. We also must understand how various mHtt species engage the cellular protein homeostasis (or 'proteostasis') pathways that clear aberrant and aggregation-prone conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Martinez-Vicente et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ravikumar et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Rubinsztein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Rui et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</xref>). mHtt interactions with the chaperones and degradation pathways that handle misfolded proteins in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balch et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hartl et al., 2011</xref>) are likely key determinants of the cellular balance of toxic and non-toxic conformers.</p><p>Recent studies indicate that two domains flanking the expanded polyQ tract greatly influence mHtt aggregation and biology. N17, the 17 amino acid N-terminal flanking domain, has been shown to enhance mHtt aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thakur et al., 2009</xref>). N17 also mediates mHtt interaction with chaperones, hosts many post-translational modifications regulating mHtt toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Steffan, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>), and harbors a functional nuclear export sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maiuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rockabrand et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>). The C-terminal proline-rich flanking domain (herein 'PRD') also binds cellular factors and influences mHtt toxicity in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Duennwald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). The PRD has also been shown to slow aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhattacharyya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, an integrated understanding of the interplay between the biophysical and cellular modulation of mHtt by these flanking regions should provide insights into the nature of proteotoxicity.</p><p>Here we combine biophysical and cell biological approaches to define how the domains flanking the polyQ tract modulate the ensemble of mHtt conformations in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, we link the mHtt conformational ensemble to mHtt proteostasis and toxicity in cultured neurons and brain slices. Biophysical and structural analyses demonstrate that N17 and PRD have opposing effects on the energetic barriers dictating the formation of aggregates and oligomers by mHtt both in vivo and in vitro. This interplay between N17 and PRD determines the formation of toxic mHtt conformations and their interaction with cellular proteostasis pathways. One corollary of our data is that neuronal mHtt toxicity cannot be explained by a simple model whereby amyloid fibrils or oligomers are toxic, but rather one that points to specific toxic conformational sub-populations. Our work linking the mHtt conformational landscape with neuronal proteostasis and toxicity informs rational avenues to leverage the roles of the polyQ flanking regions for HD therapeutics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Opposing effects of N17 and PRD flanking domains on polyQ amyloid propensity and aggregation</title><p>To evaluate the impact of N17 and PRD on the expanded polyQ tract, we created a set of mHtt-Ex1 deletion variants containing a pathogenic-length polyQ tract (Q51) and lacking the N17 (∆N), PRD (∆P), or both N17 and PRD domains (∆N∆P).

The filter trap assay detects large, SDS-insoluble aggregates through filtration through a 20 µm cellulose acetate membrane, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wanker et al., 1999</xref>). Formation of β-sheet rich amyloid structures was detected using the fluorescent dye ThioflavinT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">LeVine, 1999</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, deletion of N17 reduces the rate and yield of amyloid formation and aggregation, while deletion of the PRD domain enhances formation of amyloids and aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Thakur et al., 2009</xref>). ∆N∆P exhibited a complex, combined behavior of both N17 and PRD deletions. Similar to ∆P, the ∆N∆P mutant displayed enhanced aggregation rates measured in the filter trap assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). On the other hand, similar to ∆N, ∆N∆P had very slow kinetics of amyloid formation as measured by the ThioflavinT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Indeed, fitting the normalized ThioflavinT amyloid formation kinetics to the Finke-Watzky kinetic model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Morris et al., 2009</xref>) showed that the elongation rate <bold><italic>v</italic></bold> for amyloid formation and half-time to saturation of amyloid formation <bold>t<sub>1/2</sub></bold> for mHtt variants lacking N17 (∆N and ∆N∆P) were much slower than those for mHtt variants containing N17 (Ex1 and ∆P) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We conclude that the presence of a PRD disfavors formation of large, SDS-insoluble aggregates while N17 exerts a dominant effect to promote the ThioflavinT-reactive, amyloid conformation.</p><p>To relate these biophysical observations to mHtt-Ex1 behavior in a neuronal cellular environment, the equivalent mHtt-Ex1 variants were fused C-terminally to GFP and expressed in striatal neuron-derived ST14a cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cattaneo and Conti, 1998</xref>). Formation of GFP-inclusions provided a read-out for the aggregation propensity of the mHtt variants in vivo. As observed in vitro, deleting N17 reduced the formation of visible inclusions in vivo, while deleting PRD enhanced the formation of aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>). Notably, few aggregates were visible in the ∆N∆P expressing cells, despite rapid formation of insoluble aggregates in vitro. Given the slow kinetics of amyloid aggregation by ∆N∆P in vitro, it is possible that in the absence of the N17 and PRD flanking regions, the polyQ tract does not efficiently generate amyloidogenic fibrils but instead forms non-amyloidogenic aggregates that are less stable in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crick et al., 2013</xref>). We conclude that N17 and PRD have opposing effects of on amyloid formation and aggregation in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and further suggest that the cellular environment destabilizes the non-amyloid aggregates generated by the polyQ tract in ∆N∆P.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>N17 and PRD control the morphology of mHtt amyloid fibrils</title><p>Next, we used cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to gain a structural understanding of how N17 and PRD impact the formation of mHtt amyloid fibrils. mHtt-Ex1 fibrils have a characteristic architecture, in which frayed fibril ends branch out from a bundled central core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bugg et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Darrow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shahmoradian et al., 2013</xref>). For the ∆N mHtt variant, we observed dramatically fewer fibrils, consistent with its lower amyloid aggregation propensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In addition, the fibrils formed by ∆N had a strikingly distinct morphology, which lacked the bundled architecture of Ex1 fibrils and were much thinner and straighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Allowing ∆N aggregation to reach saturation by prolonged incubation increased the number of fibrils but did not change their thin morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Thus, the thin fibril structure of ∆N aggregates is intrinsic to the mutation. In contrast, ∆P formed many large, densely packed aggregates with individual fibrils arranged in parallel bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with its increased aggregation propensity. As observed for kinetic measurements, the morphology of ∆N∆P aggregates combined properties from both the ∆N and ∆P fibrils. Similar to ∆N fibrils, the ∆N∆P fibrils were shorter, thinner and lacked the frayed fibril ends observed for Ex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>); similar to ∆P fibrils, ∆N∆P aggregates consisted of more densely packed fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Quantification of at least 10 individual micrographs for each fibril variant supported these observations, indicating that ∆N fibrils were only several nanometers in width, whereas Ex1 and ∆P fibrils were on average almost a micron wide and over a micron long (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). We conclude that N17 and PRD have independent and dramatic effects on the amyloid formation propensity of the polyQ tract and its fibrillar structure. N17 promotes amyloid formation but also enhances interfibrillar contacts, thereby driving the bundling of individual fibrils observed for Ex1 and ∆P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, PRD appears to destabilize lateral contacts among fibrils and thus prevents their dense packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The combined effects of N17 and PRD in Ex1 lead to the characteristic mHtt structure consisting of fibril bundles with frayed ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). When N17 is absent, PRD leads to thin sparse fibrils observed for ∆N; while when PRD is absent, N17 leads to thick, bundled aggregates as observed for ∆P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18065.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Morphology of mHtt aggregation highlight how N17 and PRD contribute to mHtt aggregation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Morphology of fiber aggregates from each of the mHtt mutants by cryo-EM. mHtt fibers were imaged 24 hr post initiation of aggregation.

This effect may be of importance for HD in light of the prion hypothesis that postulates that intercellular transmission of aggregate 'seeds' can nucleate aggregation in naïve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pearce et al., 2015</xref>).

In contrast, aggregates formed by mHtt variants lacking a PRD, namely ∆P and ∆N∆P, resisted disruption and remained in large and highly bundled fibrillar structures ranging from 0.3–2 µm even at the harshest sonication conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Cryo-EM imaging confirmed and extended these observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The sonicated seeds of Ex1 and ∆N were small structures only one or two fibrils in width, while the sonication products of ∆P and ∆N∆P were large, thick, and densely-packed bundles of fibers. Of note, the presence or absence of N17 had no significant impact on the size of the fragmented species, indicating that while N17 contributes to the formation of these fibrils, it does not contribute to their mechanical stability. We conclude that the PRD mechanically destabilizes mHtt aggregates by disfavoring inter-fibrillar contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), thus providing a molecular basis for reduced aggregation propensity of mHtt variants with a PRD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>We next examined whether the PRD domain also contributed to the chemical stability of mHtt fibrils to protein denaturating agents, such as urea or formic acid. The isolated amyloid aggregates of Ex1 and ∆P were initially treated with 8M urea, which was unable to disaggregate either fibril variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We then subjected urea-treated fibrils with increasing concentrations of the much harsher denaturant formic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Both Ex1 and ∆P fibrils were similarly resistant to intermediate concentrations of formic acid and only following incubation with 100% formic acid, which can dissolve mHtt aggregates formed in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hazeki et al., 2000</xref>), did we observe significant denaturation of the mHtt fibrils of both Ex1 and ∆P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>).

In contrast, large SDS-soluble oligomers appeared to increase over time in the SDS-AGE gel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). By contrast, ∆P had much fewer oligomers in both native- and SDS-AGE gels. Furthermore, the native oligomers disappeared much more rapidly during the time-course of aggregation that those observed for Ex1, consistent with the overall faster aggregation of ∆P. Thus, the absence of PRD alters the balance between oligomer and fibril formation, perhaps by allowing faster progression of these oligomeric species to aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D</xref>).</p><p>Surprisingly, very large ∆N oligomers persisted through the aggregation reaction in both the native-AGE and SDS-AGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Even after 60 hr, when ∆N amyloid aggregation was saturated, the population of ∆N oligomers remained under both native and mildly denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Consistent with our previous data, the increased presence of ∆N oligomers resulted in few filter-trap retained aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C</xref>). We wondered if these stable, large ∆N oligomers corresponded to the small, thin ∆N amyloid fibrils observed by cryo-EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, while large ∆N oligomers were already abundant as early as 3 hr post-aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>), cryo-EM imaging of ∆N at 3 hr of aggregation showed very few fibrils and no additional identifiable densities or structures (not shown). Furthermore the amyloidogenic, ThioflavinT-reactive species formed by ∆N only accumulated significantly after 30 hr of aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Together, these data indicate that ∆N becomes trapped forming stable soluble oligomers that may be mildly SDS-resistant but are neither fibrillar nor amyloid. These ∆N oligomers, despite being very large in size, appear to be too structurally heterogeneous to yield identifiable diffraction signatures by cryoEM.</p><p>We next examined the impact of the polyQ flanking regions on the formation of soluble oligomer populations smaller than 400 kDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Nucifora et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Schagger and von Jagow, 1991</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The aggregation reaction was initiated by TEV cleavage of the GST-moieties and time-points analyzed by Blue-Native PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D<italic>i</italic></xref>). Interestingly, all mHtt variants formed several small oligomer species very early in the aggregation reaction. For Ex1 and ∆P, these small oligomers disappeared as aggregation progressed, while the species of ∆N and ∆N∆P were very stable, similar to that observed for large oligomers in SDS-AGE gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This analysis supports the view that N17 promotes the formation of fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) at the expense of oligomer formation, whereas the PRD contributes to the accumulation of oligomers.</p><p>Interestingly, N17 and PRD seem to act independently in oligomer formation since the oligomers formed by ∆N∆P exhibited a behavior intermediate between the ∆N and ∆P phenotypes in the AGE oligomer assays. While a significant amount of ∆N∆P species progressed to the insoluble aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, filter trap), a population of trapped oligomers persisted in the SDS-AGE gel and in the Blue-Native PAGE gel. It thus appears that N17 and PRD have independent and antagonistic effects on the conformational landscape of the polyQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). N17 promotes amyloid formation and fibril bundling and prevents the accumulation of non-amyloidogenic oligomeric species. On the other hand, PRD disfavors aggregation by enhancing the levels of soluble oligomeric species while structurally destabilizing the amyloid fibril association.</p><p>We next considered whether the flanking regions also influence the structural properties of the oligomers, as observed for the fibrils. Indeed, their distinct migration patterns in Native-AGE and Blue-Native PAGE, which separate oligomers based on a number of shape, size and exposed charge characteristics, seems to support this hypothesis. Unfortunately, characterizing these oligomeric species by conventional structural approaches such as electron microscopy, crystallography or NMR is technically challenging given that these oligomeric species are structurally heterogeneous and chemically unstable. Conformational antibodies have provided a useful approach to distinguish specific conformations of amyloidogenic proteins, albeit the characteristics of these reactive species are not often defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kayed and Glabe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kayed et al., 2003</xref>).

We tried a panel of conformationally-sensitive antibodies to identify conformational subsets in the oligomer populations separated in our AGE and PAGE analyses. We failed to observe significant reactivity of the oligomers of any flanking domain variant with A11 or OC conformationally-sensitive antibodies (not shown). Interestingly, we did observe reactivity with the 3B5H10 antibody, previously proposed to recognize a toxic polyQ conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2011</xref>). The 3B5H10 reactive species were small oligomers resolved by the Blue-Native PAGE gels, while none of the larger oligomers in the SDS-AGE gel were 3B5H10 reactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, 3B5H10 reactivity did support the hypothesis that the flanking regions influence the structural conformation of the oligomers. We observed that Ex1, ∆N and ∆P all formed small 3B5H10-reactive oligomers, albeit of different sizes and mobilities. In contrast, the small oligomers formed by ∆N∆P, which had similar mobility to those formed by ∆N, were not 3B5H10 reactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D<italic>ii</italic></xref>). This suggests that the conformation adopted by the polyQ tract within oligomers is influenced by the flanking regions. Thus, the flanking regions influence structural differences in not only the fibrillar aggregate species but also in soluble species affecting both the stabilities and conformations of the heterogeneous species formed along the mHtt aggregation pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>N17 triggers a molecular switch from oligomers to fibrils</title><p>In considering the relationship between the polyQ flanking regions and oligomer populations, the above results suggest that N17 plays a role in promoting the oligomer to fibril transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

Oligomer formation was assessed by SDS-AGE and immunoblotting against ∆N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The addition of N17 at the start of the aggregation reaction led to the disappearance of ∆N oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with the increase in aggregates observed by EM and filter trap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>). The rate of oligomer disappearance was enhanced at higher N17 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, it seems that N17 triggers a conformational switch that disfavors the accumulation of trapped, oligomeric species and allows the formation of amyloid fibrils. Such a role explains the slow ∆N amyloid formation observed in the kinetic and cryo-EM analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Specifically, ∆N forms many oligomers and few fibrillar aggregates; ∆P forms many fibrillar aggregates and few oligomers; and ∆N∆P, which is essentially a pathogenic length Q-tract, forms both oligomers and fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). To evaluate the toxicity of these polyQ expanded mHtt variants we looked at the striatal neurons of rat corticostriatal brain slices, which provide a more disease relevant, 'tissue contextual' model of HD when compared to traditional models of neuronal cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Khoshnan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reinhart et al., 2011</xref>). In corticostriatal brain slices, the striatal medium spiny neurons (MSNs), which are preferentially affected in HD, remain within their intact local tissue environment and maintain interactions among multiple brain cell-types. mHtt toxicity was measured by co-transfecting corticostriatal brain slices with a plasmid encoding untagged mHtt-Ex1 variants and another plasmid encoding YFP, which serves as an independent morphological marker for the transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crittenden et al., 2010</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). MSN viability is measured by examining the cellular and dendritic morphology by YFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>).

Although ∆N and ∆P have dramatically different aggregation and oligomerization propensities in vitro and in vivo, both were as toxic as Ex1 as early as 3 days after transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Even more surprisingly, ∆N∆P, which generates both aggregates and oligomers and has an expanded polyQ tract of identical length, exhibited only modest toxicity even by day 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results negate simple models of aggregate-only or oligomer-only toxicity and instead call for a more nuanced view of proteotoxicity. Since both ∆N, which forms few amyloid fibrils, and ∆P, which forms few oligomers are both highly toxic, our data cannot be explained by either fibrillar aggregates or, oligomeric species per se as being toxic. Remarkably, since the expanded polyQ tract itself is only mildly toxic, the action of the flanking regions must be key to induce the toxic polyQ conformation(s).</p><p>Our unexpected toxicity findings suggest a number of hypotheses. First, it is possible that there is no universal proteotoxic species, and either specific fibrillar or oligomer states mediate toxicity, most likely through different mechanisms given their radically different properties. However, it was intriguing that mHtt toxicity in the brain slices was observed for those variants that gave rise to 3B5H10-reactive small oligomers, namely Ex1, ∆N and ∆P but not ∆N∆P. Thus, an alternative is that toxicity resides in a subclass of structural conformers, such as oligomers linked to 3B5H10 reactivity, rather than a particular size of species. Yet another possibility is that mHtt interconverts between several conformations when expressed in vivo and that toxicity arises when those species cannot be efficiently cleared by the cellular machinery. We thus extended our analysis to the soluble mHtt conformers formed in striatal neurons, as well as their interactions with the proteostasis machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Influence of N17 and PRD on mHtt conformation in neurons</title><p>To understand how the neuronal cellular environment impacts the mHtt conformational ensemble, we tested whether in vivo the 3B5H10-reactive conformation was also specifically observed for the toxic variants Ex1, ∆N and ∆P, but not for the less toxic ∆N∆P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kayed and Glabe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kayed et al., 2003</xref>).

GFP immunoblotting of the Blue-Native PAGE revealed variant-specific single bands, suggesting that, unlike what we observed in vitro each variant forms a predominant small oligomeric species in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). In contrast, the larger mHtt oligomers observed in vivo displayed a heterogeneous spectrum of sizes as observed with purified mHtt.

The similar 3B5H10 reactivity of Ex1, ∆N, ∆P and ∆N∆P in vitro and in vivo suggests that the conformational differences among these mHtt variants is intrinsic to the structural influence of the flanking regions on the polyQ region.</p><p>While it is tempting to speculate that these soluble, 3B5H10-reactive small oligomers are by themselves the toxic Htt species, it is possible that additional toxic species exist but are not recognized by any existing conformational antibody. Nonetheless, these experiments demonstrate that mHtt variants that produce neurotoxic species share specific conformers that are disfavored in the ensembles formed by the less toxic, expanded polyQ tract alone.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Neuroprotective addition of chaperonin ApiCCT1 reduces 3B5H10 reactive oligomer levels</title><p>We analyzed how known protective proteostasis mechanisms impact the presence of small oligomers in vivo. One established mechanism is the chaperonin TRiC/CCT, which suppresses mHtt aggregation and toxicity in many HD models through recognition of N17 by the CCT1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrends et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tam et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>). In neuronal cell culture, overexpression of CCT1 or exogenous addition of the purified substrate-binding domain of CCT1 (ApiCCT1) to the media suffices to suppress mHtt toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kitamura et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sontag et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>). We thus examined if ApiCCT1 could also be neuroprotective in the corticostriatal brain slice toxicity model of HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Indeed, exogenous administration of purified recombinant ApiCCT1 significantly protected MSNs from mHtt neurotoxicity in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E<italic>i</italic></xref>). Strikingly, Blue-Native PAGE revealed that this exogenous ApiCCT1 addition caused a concentration-dependent reduction in the levels of small 3B5H10-reactive oligomers implicated in toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E<italic>ii</italic></xref>). These experiments support the notion that these 3B5H10-reactive small oligomers are diagnostic of a conformational pathway linked to toxicity and that chaperonin protection against HD toxicity decreases the levels of these soluble species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>N17 and PRD act in synergy to control mHtt proteostasis</title><p>The toxicity of mHtt populations depends not only on their biophysical properties but also their interactions with cellular proteostasis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), which may also depend on the influence of the polyQ flanking domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). We first used corticostriatal brain slices to investigate the impact of the different polyQ flanking domain variants on TRiC-mediated neuroprotection. CCT1 was cotransfected with the toxic mHtt-Ex1 variants into the corticostriatal brain slices and MSN viability assessed as above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, overexpression of CCT1 dramatically protected MSNs from mHtt-Ex1 toxicity but did not protect MSNs from ∆N-induced toxicity. These results are consistent with the notion that N17 hosts the CCT1 binding site in mHtt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>). Surprisingly, despite the presence of N17, CCT1 afforded only a modest degree of protection for ∆P-induced toxicity. The minimal rescue of ∆P by CCT1 may be due to the aggressive neurotoxicity of ∆P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>), which may impair neurons too quickly to be effectively rescued by CCT1. Alternatively, we considered that the absence of the PRD domain may reduce the availability of N17 to engage CCT1.</p><p>To further probe the interplay between N17 and PRD in vivo, we examined two additional cellular processes regulated by N17. First, N17 contains a nuclear export sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maiuri et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Zheng et al., 2013</xref>), leading ∆N variants to accumulate in the nucleus. In striatal-derived neurons, we confirmed that mHtt-Ex1 was both cytoplasmic and nuclear while ∆N was enriched in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Surprisingly, ∆P was also enriched in the nucleus, even though it contains the N17 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>), further suggesting that the PRD region may regulate the exposure of N17.</p><p>Second, N17 is also proposed to promote mHtt degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>), which occurs via the ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Thompson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</xref>). A pulse of <sup>35</sup>S–methionine labeling followed by a non-radioactive chase measured the impact of N17 and the PRD on the clearance of soluble mHtt variants, which were detected by immunoprecipitation and autoradiography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>). The pulse began 14 hr post-transfection when cellular mHtt was still soluble (not shown) to ensure labeling of only soluble mHtt populations. Under these conditions, the disappearance of mHtt-Ex1 is abrogated by inhibition of the proteasome and lysosomal pathways, as expected (not shown). Notably, both ∆N and ∆P had significantly slower protein clearance rates compared to Ex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). This suggests that efficient mHtt recognition by the cellular degradation pathways requires the presence of both polyQ-flanking domains.</p><p>To clarify the synergy between the PRD and N17, we considered the structural and energetic contributions of the two domains to mHtt conformation. As N17 is critical to drive the initial stages of amyloidogenesis and aggregation and the absence of the PRD promotes rapid aggregation, N17 may become more buried in the faster-forming ∆P oligomer species. We thus assessed the relative exposure of N17 in purified mHtt-Ex1 variants with and without PRD by exploiting the enhanced protease susceptibility of exposed unstructured protein regions. Oligomers formed by Ex1 and ∆P were generated in vitro and the degree of exposure of N17 was tested by a short incubation with low concentrations of Proteinase K, a broad specificity protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E<italic>i</italic></xref>). N17 was then detected by SDS-PAGE immunoblotting with an anti-N17 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E<italic>i</italic></xref>). We found that N17 was significantly more protease-sensitive in Ex1 oligomers containing the PRD than in ∆P oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E<italic>ii–iii</italic></xref>). As an alternative assay, we exploited the fact that N17 is the only region in mHtt-Ex1 that contains lysine residues, which are specifically cleaved by trypsin. Since Ex1 and ∆P contain the same N17 sequence, any differences in trypsin digestion will arise from the differential exposure of N17. Indeed, N17 in Ex1 oligomers was much more sensitive to trypsin protease cleavage than in ∆P oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, these experiments show that the PRD increases exposure of the N17 domain, which explains the similar responses of ∆N and ∆P to CCT1 protection, their enhanced nuclear localization and their slower protein degradation kinetics, all of which were previously shown to depend on N17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B–D</xref>). Taken together, these analyses indicate that, despite their opposing effects on the energetics of aggregation or oligomer formation, the two polyQ flanking regions also act synergistically in vivo to determine the cellular fate of mHtt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18065.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Flanking domains act synergistically in vivo to determine mHtt fate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Htt flanking domains engage various cellular proteostasis pathways (<bold>B</bold>) Relative viability of MSNs from rat brain slices biolistically co-transfected with the toxic mHtt variants, YFP, and the CCT1 subunit of the TRiC chaperonin.

In vitro the ∆N∆P variant, encompassing essentially only the polyQ tract, accumulates filter-trappable SDS-insoluble species at similar rates as mHtt-Ex1 and also forms large and small oligomers. However, the conformations populated by ∆N∆P are clearly different from those of Ex1: its rate of amyloid formation measured by ThioflavinT is much slower, similar to the toxic ∆N variant and its fibrils are more tightly bundled, similar to the toxic ∆P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Supporting the role of flanking domains in generating specific polyQ conformers, ∆N∆P does not give rise to 3B5H10 reactive species, unlike the toxic Ex1 variants, even though this antibody is known to recognize a polyQ-containing β-hairpin conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brooks et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Peters-Libeu et al., 2012</xref>). These data suggest that in the absence of flanking regions, the polyQ tract quickly forms large, non-amyloidogenic oligomers and SDS-insoluble aggregates but takes longer to develop an amyloid conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binette et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crick et al., 2013</xref>) and is less likely to populate toxic conformation(s).</p><p>N17 and PRD affect the energetic barriers leading to formation of diverse polyQ oligomers and aggregates, as well as their structural characteristics. We propose that N17-N17 and N17-polyQ interactions lower the kinetic barrier between non-amyloidogenic oligomeric species and amyloid fibrils to disfavor accumulation of oligomeric species and promote amyloid aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Without the N17 domain, ∆N becomes kinetically trapped in large and small oligomer states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). <italic>Trans</italic> addition of the N17 peptide can convert these trapped oligomers to fibrillar aggregates in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and accelerate mHtt-Ex1 aggregation in striatal-derived neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>). N17 may act by increasing local mHtt concentration through inter-molecular interactions with the polyQ and N17 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atwal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jayaraman et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>), thereby nucleating amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fiumara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jayaraman et al., 2012b</xref>) and promoting fibril bundling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition N17 may induce a conformational switch in the polyQ tract, through direct intrachain interaction to induce its transition to β-sheet structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kokona et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Williamson et al., 2010</xref>), that may be important for on-pathway aggregation of polyQ stretches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Nagai et al., 2007</xref>). The importance of the non-polar residues of N17 in promoting aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E–F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>) could reflect the N17-N17 interaction interface, or a model where nonpolar N17 residues impact the conformation of the polyQ region.</p><p>In contrast to N17, the PRD destabilizes fibrils and stabilizes oligomeric species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) and disfavors aggregation both in vitro and in vivo(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharyya et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, removing the PRD in ∆P enhances the progression to amyloid fibrils and makes oligomer states more transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). ∆P amyloid fibrils are also more densely packed and more mechanically stable than amyloid fibrils containing a PRD region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B–C</xref>). Several models may explain these findings. The PRD could form a PolyProline-II (PPII) helix that propagates into the polyQ region to promote a more helical conformation in the polyQ rather than a β-sheet structure to disfavor aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Binette et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Darnell et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">2009</xref>). A dynamic PPII-helical PRD within the fibril could also interfere with fibril packing interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bugg et al., 2012</xref>), perhaps by adopting a 'bottle brush' like architecture protruding from the amyloidogenic core of the fibril (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Isas et al., 2015</xref>). Differences in the mechanical stabilities of fibrillar aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) may have implications for their frangibility in vivo and the generation of mHtt seeds competent for intercellular transmission and spread.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Assessing the structure-proteotoxicity relationship in mutant Huntingtin</title><p>One perplexing aspect of CAG-repeat disorders like HD is why an expansion of the polyQ length beyond a certain threshold leads to neuronal toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Orr and Zoghbi, 2007</xref>). One proposed theory is that toxicity arises from a feature in the repetitive ligand-binding units of a linear polyQ lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Owens et al., 2015</xref>). In this sense, the longer the polyQ repeat, the more of these repetitive units may confer aberrant cellular interactions and cause pathogenesis. Alternatively, the 'emergent conformation' model proposes that a unique, toxic polyQ conformation appears at only pathogenic, expanded polyQ lengths (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Since mHtt constructs of identical polyQ length, but different flanking regions, have different toxicities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), our results support the 'emergent conformation' model. The reduced toxicity of ∆N∆P implies the flanking regions contribute to generating an 'emergent' toxic conformation(s). Interestingly, all the toxic variants share a subset of conformers, as evident from their shared 3B5H10-reactivity. Even if the 3B5H10-reactive oligomer itself is not the toxic species, it appears diagnostic of a conformational pathway linked to toxicity.</p><p>Overall, these results have two major implications. Firstly, mHtt structural conformers and their cellular interactions are more relevant to pathogenesis than polyQ aggregation propensity. The Ex1, ∆N and ∆P variants are all highly toxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>) despite their different propensities to form insoluble aggregates or soluble oligomers both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B-E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that only certain conformational sub-populations are neurotoxic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C–D</xref>). Defining these toxic conformers is hindered by the limitations of current structural approaches, highlighting the need for improved methodologies to structurally define soluble mHtt states. Secondly, since polyQ alone generates toxic conformations inefficiently, the sequence context is key to the neurotoxic structural transition. Thus, the other polyQ-expansion disease causing proteins, such as ataxins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2013</xref>) must contain additional sequence elements that are functionally equivalent to N17 or the PRD. This finding highlights the need for understanding polyQ dynamics in the relevant protein context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The cellular fate of Huntingtin is synergistically determined by the polyQ flanking domains</title><p>Unexpectedly, we find that despite their distinct intrinsic effects in stabilizing either the oligomer or fibrillar states, N17 and PRD cooperate in vivo to determine mHtt fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). mHtt may be prevented from exerting cellular damage through interaction with chaperones, clearance pathways as well as through sequestration into protective inclusion bodies, such as the aggresomes or IPOD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arrasate et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaganovich et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kopito, 2000</xref>). However, the synergistic action of the N17 and PRD regions is essential to engage these proteostasis pathways that promote mHtt clearance and/or prevent formation of toxic species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). While N17 contains the recognition site for CCT1 and is known to promote mHtt degradation, both N17 and PRD are required for efficient CCT1-mediated neuroprotection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and clearance of soluble mHtt species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). N17 is also essential to prevent the accumulation of mHtt in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2015</xref>), but deletion of PRD also causes nuclear-enrichment of mHtt toxic species, which may play an enhanced role in Htt pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Difiglia, 1997</xref>).</p><p>We propose the observed synergy of the flanking regions in vivo is rooted in the conformational modulation exerted by the PRD to promote exposure of N17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). This explains the paradoxical observations that, despite having an N17 domain, ∆P shows enhanced nuclear localization and poor neuroprotection from toxicity by TRiC/CCT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>). One model for this is the PRD may directly enhance N17 availability through transient interactions with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Behrends et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Caron et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the structural hindrance imposed by the PRD may prevent N17 from becoming buried in the early stages of oligomerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The key role of different proteostasis pathways in suppressing mHtt toxicity also suggests a model for the age-association of HD pathogenesis. Both proteostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brehme et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Taylor and Dillin, 2011</xref>) and nucleo-cytoplasmic trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">D'Angelo et al., 2009</xref>) decrease during aging. As a result, the N17-driven aggregation of mHtt into large, inert, amyloidogenic aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B–D</xref>) remains the predominant available route for protection, causing neurons to become saturated with aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Waelter et al., 2001</xref>). As a neuron’s ability to clear mHtt declines, the ensuing accumulation of soluble species may exert further toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). With age or the absence of N17, toxic oligomeric species accumulate, thereby exerting cellular damage. Of note, toxic, off-pathway oligomers are also reported for α-synuclein, emphasizing the potential toxicity of soluble species that cannot be sequestered into larger aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chen et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implication for Huntington’s disease therapeutics</title><p>Our study suggests that effective therapeutics for HD should impact the conformers associated with toxicity. Better structural methods to study conformationally heterogeneous samples will be key to define these toxic species. The cellular proteostasis machinery, which can clearly identify and neutralize these toxic species, also offers therapeutic avenues. We show that TRiC, previously shown to interact with mHtt monomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tam et al., 2009</xref>), large oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sontag et al., 2013</xref>) and fibrillar aggregates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shahmoradian et al., 2013</xref>), promotes clearance of small 3B5H10-reactive mHtt oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) confirming its crucial protective role in HD. In addition, mHtt clearance rate in neurons is linked to their likelihood of survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Tsvetkov et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, enhancing the ability of mHtt flanking regions to engage proteostasis pathways could provide highly specific and potent HD therapeutics.</p><p>One interesting question raised by our studies is whether ∆N and ∆P variants are generated during mHtt biosynthesis. Htt contains a methionine at residue 8 which could be used as an alternative translation initiation site, leading to a partial truncation of N17.

For mHtt, this proline-dependent stalling may generate a partially truncated '∆P-like' mHtt-Ex1 variant.

Cells were transfected using Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen). Media was refreshed immediately before and within 24 hr post transfection. Cells were harvested 48 hr after transfection and lysed with 10 mM Tris, pH 7.5; 150 mM NaCl; 1 mM EDTA; 0.5% NP-40; 1 mM PMSF; 1x Protease Inhibitor (Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Protein concentration of lysate was measured by BCA assay (Thermo Fisher Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Organotypic culture of brain slice explants</title><p>Hemi-coronal brain slices were prepared accordingly to established procedures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Reinhart et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, postnatal day 10 Sprague–Dawley rat pups (Charles River, Wilmington, MA, USA) were used to prepare 250 μm thick hemi-coronal brain slices using vibratomes (Vibratome; Bannockburn, IL, USA). Animals were killed in accordance with NIH guidelines and under Duke IACUC approval and oversight. Slices were placed into 12-well plates on a semi-solid support consisting of culture medium (Neurobasal A medium supplemented with 15% heat-inactivated horse serum, 10 mM KCl, 10 mM HEPES, 100 U/mL penicillin/streptomycin, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 1 mM L-glutamine, and 1 μM MK-801) set in 0.5% agarose. Slice cultures were maintained at 32°C in humidified incubators under 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Biolistic transfection and viability assay in brain slices</title><p>A modified Helios Gene Gun (Helios Gene Gun, Bio-Rad, Hercules, California) was used for particle-mediated gene transfer, or biolistics, of all mHtt plasmids into brain slices as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lo et al., 1994</xref>). Brain slices were co-transfected with a yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) expression plasmid in all cases, to image medium spiny neurons (MSNs). MSNs were identified by their location in the striatum and characteristic dendritic aborization. Brain slices were assessed for viability on day 3 or 4 after transfection by counting the number of healthy MSNs, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crittenden et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly brain slices were imaged on a fluorescence stereomicroscope (SteREO Lumar.V12, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and qualified MSNs as 'healthy' if presenting a normal cell body diameter, a continuous expression of YFP within all cell compartments, and more than two discernable primary dendrites were scored as viable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Crittenden et al., 2010</xref>). Average numbers of healthy MSNs per brain slice explant (N=12 brain slices per condition) are shown as means ± SEM and statistical significance was assessed by an unpaired t test with Welch’s correction using the GraphPad software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Immunostaining and confocal imaging</title><p>Transfected ST14a cells were immunostained with the 3B5H10 antibody. Briefly, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at 4°C, then quenched with 10 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton, then blocked for 1 hr with 5% Normal Donkey Serum (Jackson Immunoresearch, West Grove, PA). Cells were stained with 3B5H10 in 1:10,000 dilution for 2 hr, then Alexa Fluor 546 conjugate secondary antibody (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Blue-Native PAGE gels</title><p>Time points were combined with 4x Native PAGE Sample Buffer (Invitrogen) and stored at −80°C.

Cells were then pulse labeled for 3 hr with methionine starvation media with 50 mCi/ml <sup>35</sup>S-methionine (Perkin Elmer, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Then, cell media was replaced with rich DMEM high glucose media for the chase, which was in total 18 hr post transfection. Cells were harvested at respective time points and lysed with 50 mM Tris-HCl/7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% NP-40, 1x Roche Protease Inhibitor, 1 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF. Lysate concentration was measured by BCA assay. mHtt protein was immunoprecipitated with a GFP nanobody.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, one of whom Jeffery W Kelly (Reviewer#1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>1) Protein aggregation seems to be the driver of numerous neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and Huntington's disease.

Consistent with previous reports, they find the flanking regions of the extended polyQ tract strongly influence the properties of the aggregates formed. Combining various approaches, including elegant electron microscopy experiments with an antibody that is thought to recognize a toxic huntingtin species (Miller et al. Nat Chem Biol 2011), they do a great job of characterizing the fibrils resulting from each domain deletion in detail. The in vitro results presented are an important extension of published work in this field, and are well worth publishing. We are more reserved about the in vivo sections of this manuscript. There is no clear overall theme, and it is not clear that the experiments presented add much in terms of impact, as the manuscript is organized in a way to suggest that the characteristics of the fibrils are not (or only weakly) correlated with toxicity.

If the authors feel that the in vivo work should be part of the revised paper; perhaps the authors can attempt to enrich the oligomers by gel filtration chromatography with variable degrees of light crosslinking to see whether it is truly the oligomers that are driving toxicity in cell culture model(s) and possibly in brain slices, if the oligomers are taken up?

The Frydman group studies 4 variants of a Q-51 expanded exon 1, one lacking the N17 amyloid promoting domain, a Q-51 expanded exon 1 lacking the PRD amyloid inhibiting domain, a Q-51 expanded exon 1 lacking both domains flanking the Q-51 expanded exon 1, as well as full-length Q-51 expanded exon 1.</p><p>The authors present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that deleting the PRD domain (ΔP) forms amyloid fibrils that are SDS insoluble in vitro and in striatal neurons.

The Reviewers were overall positive about the timeliness and relevance of our study, stating that: “Combining various approaches, including elegant electron microscopy experiments with an antibody that is thought to recognize a toxic huntingtin species (Miller et al. Nat Chem Biol 2011), they do a great job of characterizing the fibrils resulting from each domain deletion in detail. The in vitro results presented are an important extension of published work in this field, and are well worth publishing.”</p><p>The Reviewers were more reserved about our in vivo analyses, stating that: “There is no clear overall theme” and also found that the “manuscript is organized in a way to suggest that the characteristics of the fibrils are not (or only weakly) correlated with toxicity.” In retrospect, we agree with the reviewers that the data, as originally organized, did not cleanly tie the biophysical and cell biological characterization of the mutant Huntingtin (mHtt) conformational landscape. We have made an effort to re-organize and refocus our MS to more clearly explain our overall view, which was to both characterize the conformational landscape of Htt, and to link the biophysical and structural properties of Htt to its proteostasis in vivo and its toxicity to neurons. As part of this revision, we have also changed the title to “Control of the structural landscape and neuronal proteotoxicity of mutant Huntingtin by domains flanking the polyQ tract”, which we feel embodies better the focus of our work.</p><p>One major goal of our work is to bridge the disconnect between the biophysical nature of aggregation-prone proteins and their toxicities. Many studies focus on the biophysical properties of aggregation-prone proteins, while others focus on their toxicities and behavior in cell culture, leaving a large gap in understanding how the biophysical nature of these aggregating proteins leads to their cellular consequences. Here we address the challenge of integrating these biochemical and biophysical approaches and link them to toxicity in a relevant brain model. However, the complexity of moving back and forth between systems was evident from the disjointed nature of our original manuscript. Our current revision focuses on the novel in vitro structural insights, while simplifying the integration of our in vivo analysis.</p><p>We have also softened our discussion of the nature of the toxic species. Our study shows that toxicity may not derive from just fibrils or oligomers but likely in specific conformations (or conformational ensembles) as shown by the selective reactivity of toxic variants to the 3B5H10 antibody. While we feel that the 3B5H10 reactive species illustrates this point, we do not want to state that this is “the” toxic conformation, since there may be toxic species that we cannot detect due to a lack of conformational probes. This may include specific conformations of fibrils, since we show here that there is much conformational diversity among fibrils. We have now expanded on this discussion in the manuscript..</p><p>What we also show in the final in vivo figures of the manuscript is that the cellular chaperone and clearance machineries can interact with 3B5H10-reactive species in suppressing their toxicity. A novel insight of these experiments is that the flanking regions are not only essential in this recognition but also act synergistically to engage the cellular machinery, rooted in the intrinsic conformational interplay between N17 and the PRD. We hope that we have succeeded in the revision to capture the role the polyQ flanking regions play in controlling complex interplay between the biophysics and cell biology leading to the cellular fate mHtt and that these results will be of great interest to those studying other neurodegenerative diseases.</p><p><italic>Strengths of the paper:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors present multiple lines of evidence suggesting that deleting the PRD domain (ΔP) forms amyloid fibrils that are SDS insoluble in vitro and in striatal neurons. ΔP adopts a bundled fibril densely packed amyloid structure by EM, an ensemble of aggregate stratures that largely lack oligomers based on native gels.</italic> </p><p><italic>Multiple lines of evidence suggest that deleting the N17 domain (ΔN) forms predominantly oligomers that are non-amyloid, but fibrillar, based on low ThT binding, their EM morphology and the smear produced in Native-AGE and 0.1% SDS-AGE.</italic> </p><p><italic>The sonication approach to compare aggregate stability produced by Q-51 expanded exon 1, ΔP and ΔN is clever, it might be interesting to compare urea denaturation susceptibility.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for their comment. Based on their suggestion, we have compared the sensitivity of the Ex1 and ∆P fibrils to urea and formic acid denaturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We found the results to nicely highlight important aspects for biophysical characteristics of mHtt fibrils.</p><p>First, we found that both Ex1 and ∆P mHtt-Ex1 fibrils were very resistant to urea denaturation. Despite their differential sensitivity to mechanical disruption, isolated Ex1 and ∆P mHtt-Ex1 fibrils were both completely refractory to 8M urea treatments (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> is 8M urea treatment for 30 min at 37 °C but other conditions were also tested).</p><p>We next examined the differential sensitivity of these fibrils to formic acid treatments of increasing severity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Only 100% formic acid was able to significantly solubilize the mHtt fibrils formed by either the Ex1 or ∆P variants.</p><p>These new experiments show that, despite their very distinct mechanical stabilities, mHtt aggregates of either Ex1 or ∆P are so stable to chemical denaturation that they require 100% formic acid for significant – though only partial – solubilization.</p><p><italic>The EM work is beautiful, however a statistically significant approach to quantify the fibrils vs. oligomers vs additional aggregate structures would impart confidence to the reader with regard to the aggregate strtural distributions that are being made in the central brain slice experiments.</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we now include a quantification of the structural features of the fibrils in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. These new analyses nicely bolster our conclusion that the flanking regions contribute to the distinct structure and architecture of these fibrils. By measuring the length and width of the fibrils, we quantitatively support our model of how the N17 and PRD domains contribute to mHtt fibrillar structure.</p><p>With regards to the distribution between fibrillars and other soluble species, we have now included a biochemical analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). After 48 hr of aggregation, all of the mHtt Ex1 or ∆P are quantitatively depleted from the soluble fraction (note complete absence of mHtt in the initial Sup).</p><p>However, with regards to EM analyses of oligomeric species, unfortunately, current cryoEM capabilities don’t have the ability to characterize (let alone quantify) these mHtt oligomers. We have tried extensively to use cryoEM to visualize oligomers, with and without antibody labeling, but their much smaller size and vast structural heterogeneity preclude their reliable identification on the grids. Accomplishing this is the subject of an on-going collaboration project with Dr. Wah Chiu’s lab at Baylor College of Medicine. We hope to report these results in the near future, but this was out of scope for the current study. We now comment on the urgent need of novel structural approaches to understand the structures of these soluble species.</p><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>We would favor a version of the manuscript that focuses mainly on the characterization of the different aggregate species</italic> in vitro.</p><p>We have restructured the manuscript to focus more on the biophysical impact of the flanking regions on the Htt aggregation landscape. In addition to incorporating the experiments suggested by the Reviewers, we have also restructured the in vivo data to better integrate it with the biophysical analyses of the different mHtt variants.</p><p><italic>The comparisons of the toxicity of full-length Q-51 expanded exon 1, ΔP and ΔN were not different enough to convince either reviewer that the oligomers were the main toxic species.</italic> </p><p>We agree that this experiment was not well presented in the original version of the manuscript, and we have attempted to clarify both its importance and our conclusions.</p><p>We feel it is important to include the toxicity experiment, because it is the first time that the toxicities of these various flanking region variants are compared side-by-side in a relevant neuronal model system, rather than isolated cells in culture.</p><p>In addition, these results are important, given the many conflicting models of “aggregate” or “oligomer-only” toxicity. We find that the mHtt variant that forms very few fibrils in vitro is as toxic as the one that forms few oligomers. Even more surprising, a polyQ tract of identical length has almost no discernible toxicity. We feel these results dispel the more simplistic models of toxicity, which we feel is an important conclusion in moving the field forward.</p><p>As to the identity of the toxic species, the Reviewers are correct that we cannot state that a 3B5H10 reactive oligomer is the toxic species. In principle, given the heterogeneity of mHtt aggregate species, it is also possible that a certain subset of fibrils is also toxic. What we can suggest based on our data, is that a subset of conformations must be toxic. At the moment, we unable identify them beyond the very few available conformation-sensitive antibodies. We expand more on the relevance of these 3B5H10-reactive oligomer species in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref> and in this Response letter.</p><p><italic>If the authors feel that the</italic> in vivo <italic>work should be part of the revised paper; perhaps the authors can attempt to enrich the oligomers by gel filtration chromatography with variable degrees of light crosslinking to see whether it is truly the oligomers that are driving toxicity in cell culture model(s) and possibly in brain slices, if the oligomers are taken up? I realize that some aggregate remodeling may take place.</italic> </p><p>We did try to develop a system to directly test whether oligomers or fibrils added directly to cells in culture or striatal brain slices can mediate toxicity. This would open the door to the identification of toxic species as well as therapeutics that block toxicity. As described below, our initial attempts at these experiments are promising, and do indeed support the toxic nature of 3B5H10 oligomers, but the system will require extensive optimization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). Given that our effects – while statistically significant – are still small, we have decided against including these results in our manuscript. We prefer to wait for the system to become more robust before presenting it to the public.</p><p>We used StHdh Q7/111 striatal neurons and measured cell toxicity by the LDH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1</xref>). We generated oligomers from the supernatant of a 3h aggregation reaction; fibrils were obtained from a 24h aggregation reaction. Unfortunately, oligomers cannot survive a gel filtration step, complicating further purification steps. Oligomers and fibrils were added to striatal neurons using the Xfect protein transfection kit (Clontech) and toxicity was assessed 48 hours after protein transfection.</p><p>Overall, we observed statistically significant but small effects: oligomers were significantly toxic to cells, whereas the fibrils were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1A</xref>). Just the soluble oligomer fraction (30 min, 16000 x g) was also significantly toxic when added to these striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1B</xref>). Notably, pre-incubating these soluble oligomers with the 3B5H10 conformational antibody abrogated their toxicity, suggesting that the 3B5H10 antibody indeed blocks a toxic determinant in these soluble species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1B</xref>). Overall, we believe that these data impart confidence to our conclusion that a specific sub-population of soluble species is toxic, and this may include a population of oligomers that have a 3B5H10-reactive conformation.</p><p>Unfortunately, the effects, while statistically significant are still very small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1A – B</xref>). We believe the problem lies in the inefficient uptake of exogenously added protein. Indeed, a test using Cy3-labeled mHtt-Ex1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1C</xref>) followed by confocal imaging of neurons showed that very little of Cy3-protein enters the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1C</xref>). The finding that fewer than 10% of the cells uptake mHtt could explain the small effects observed in the toxicity assay. We believe that this promising assay is one of the first experiments demonstrating increased toxicity in striatal neurons upon mHtt-Ex1 addition. However, optimization of this assay is beyond the timeframe and scope of this study.</p><p>Given the above results, we were concerned that the uptake of the 3B5H10 antibody into these brain slices would be very low and thus these experiments were deemed very unlikely to yield interpretable results.</p><p>With regards to crosslinking, the Reviewer is correct that aggregate remodeling will take place. Because Huntingtin aggregates very quickly compared to other amyloidogenic proteins, even light crosslinking (0.05% glutaraldehyde) propels oligomeric species into aggregates rather than trapping them. This is an experiment we have tried many times and have only been able to successfully crosslink Htt oligomers with a short polyQ length (17 glutamine residues).</p><p>Finally, we agree with the Reviewer that separation of different sizes and populations of mHtt soluble species is a worthwhile effort, especially to characterize populations of soluble mHtt that may differentially contribute to toxicity. However, we have had little success eluting mHtt from gel filtration columns. We have tried a multitude of resins, with only limited success. While this endeavor would take beyond the timeframe given to revise this paper, we agree that this would be an important step forward for the field.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18065.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Exogenous addition of mHtt-Ex1 oligomers and aggregates to striatal cells</title><p><bold>A</bold>. <bold>i</bold>.

An oligomer probe/antibody that blocked toxicity in the brain slice assays would be very powerful.</italic> </p><p>As described above, visualizing 3B5H10-bound oligomers by EM would be technically very challenging given their low molecular weight (100-200 kDa), their shape heterogeneity and small size. With this approach, the antibody would be the main species observed. An alternative experiment along this line of thought would be to immunoprecipite oligomeric species from an aggregation reaction using the 3B5H10 antibody, similar to as was done in Peters-Libeu et al., JMB 2012 from the Finkbeiner group at UCSF. Immunoprecipitation from either in vitro aggregation reactions or cellular lysates would allow for structural or biochemical analysis of the 3B5H10 reactive species. However, accomplishing this experiment would be a structural project in its own right and out of the scope for the current manuscript.</p><p>Furthermore, while our other experiments lend confidence that the 3B5H10-reactive oligomers are relevant to toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Author response image 1B</xref>), we have restructured the manuscript to de-emphasize the identification of a specific toxic species in favor of a more general conclusion that toxicity may stem from only specific sub-populations of conformations. Our revised manuscript highlights the complexity of different Huntingtin conformations – some of which may be toxic and some of which may not – and merely suggests a particular population such as the 3B5H10-reactive small oligomers may be toxic. Because the oligomers are such a heterogeneous population, we do not want to imply that all oligomers are toxic and fibrils are not. There may be other conformations of mHtt, both fibrillar and oligomeric, that contribute to toxicity but go undetected in our study due to lack of proper detection methods. Importantly, our data highlight the need to develop structural tools that can characterize different sub-populations of mHtt species in order to identify more populations of toxic mHtt conformations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
