These experiments used young and aged rats to test the role of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in intertemporal decision making. An optogenetic approach was used to inactivate the BLA in young and aged rats at discrete time points during choices between levers that yielded a small, immediate vs. a large, delayed food reward. BLA inactivation just prior to decisions attenuated impulsive choice in both young and aged rats. In contrast, inactivation during receipt of the small, immediate reward increased impulsive choice in young rats but had no effect in aged rats. BLA inactivation during the delay or intertrial interval had no effect at either age. These data demonstrate that the BLA plays multiple, temporally distinct roles during intertemporal choice, and show that the contribution of BLA to choice behavior changes across the lifespan.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46174.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>One marshmallow now or two in 15 minutes? That was the choice offered to young children in a classic psychology experiment known as the Stanford marshmallow test. Children who chose to wait went on to do better at school and to show healthier body weights in later life than those who ate the single marshmallow. A brain region called the basolateral amygdala (BLA) helps individuals choose between rewards that differ both in size and in when they will be available. Studies in people and in rodents show that the ability to wait for a larger reward – to delay gratification – increases with age. But whether changes in BLA activity contribute to this change was not known.</p><p>Choosing between a small reward now versus a larger one later involves several steps. Before a choice, individuals use their previous experience to compare the value of the immediate and the delayed rewards. How they feel at the time can bias this judgment. Someone who is hungry, for example, will assign greater value to receiving a single marshmallow now than someone who feels full. After making their choice, the individual then decides whether the reward they received was better or worse than they expected. This information helps them adjust their expectations for next time.</p><p>Hernandez et al. set out to examine how the BLA contributes to these different parts of the decision. Young and old rats were given a choice between a small food reward now or a larger reward after a delay. Hernandez et al. used optogenetic tools to temporarily inactivate the BLA either before or after the rats made their choice, and found that the role of the BLA varies across the lifespan. Inactivating the BLA before the choice made both young and old rats more likely to wait for the larger reward. By contrast, inactivating the BLA after a choice made young rats less likely to wait next time round, but had no effect in the older rats.</p><p>Changes in BLA activity with aging may thus make it easier to delay gratification in later life. But while the willingness of older adults to forego short-term rewards for long-term gain is often viewed as ‘wisdom’, such behavior can also be problematic. A pensioner who decides not to spend some of their savings on heating, for example, may be needlessly reducing their quality of life. Moreover, extreme impulsivity and extreme patience both feature in psychiatric disorders. The former may drive addiction, while the latter is a hallmark of anorexia. Identifying the mechanisms that underlie the ability to delay gratification may therefore help to promote effective decision-making in aging and psychiatric disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>basolateral amygdala</kwd><kwd>delay discounting</kwd><kwd>intertemporal choice</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>impulsive choice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007049</institution-id><institution>McKnight Brain Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bizon</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG029421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bizon</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez</surname><given-names>Caesar M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pat Tillman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez</surname><given-names>Caesar M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Thomas H.

Biases in intertemporal choice, whether manifesting as extreme impulsivity or patience, strongly associate with psychiatric disease. For example, enhanced preference for smaller, immediate rewards (greater impulsive choice) is a hallmark of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bickel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamilton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Patros et al., 2016</xref>), whereas pronounced preference for delayed gratification is characteristic of the eating disorder anorexia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Steinglass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kaye et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Decker et al., 2015</xref>). Independent of psychopathology, intertemporal choice both associates with life outcomes and changes across the lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Denburg et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boyle et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Beas et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hess et al., 2015</xref>). Contrary to economic models predicting that older individuals should account for reduced time on the horizon in making intertemporal choices, healthy older adults actually exhibit a marked increase in preference for delayed outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jimura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Löckenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samanez-Larkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eppinger et al., 2012</xref>). Although this pattern of choice behavior is sometimes characterized as ‘wisdom’, increased preference for delayed over immediate rewards may also be maladaptive. For example, biases toward delayed gratification in older adults could contribute to inappropriately conservative financial strategies that forgo expenditures necessary to maintain quality of life.</p><p>The neural circuits underlying age-associated changes in intertemporal choice remain poorly understood. Relevant to elucidating this circuitry is the fact that intertemporal choice is a multicomponent process that involves a series of temporally distinct cognitive operations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rangel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fobbs and Mizumori, 2017</xref>). Specifically, most decisions begin with representations of past choices, as well as some idea of the outcomes associated with each choice option. These representations are weighted by one’s motivation to obtain the choice outcomes at the time of the decision. A second phase of decision making occurs after a choice is made and involves evaluating the outcome to determine the degree to which it matches its predicted value. Feedback from this evaluative process can be used to adjust representations of the options to guide future choices. Both deliberation before a choice and outcome evaluation after a choice are supported by a network of brain structures that mediate reward processing, prospection, planning, prediction error, and value computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters and Büchel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orsini et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fobbs and Mizumori, 2017</xref>). The basolateral amygdala (BLA), which forms associations between cues or actions and their outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johansen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wassum and Izquierdo, 2015</xref>), plays a central role in decision making and has been specifically implicated in both deliberative and evaluative processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schoenbaum et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schoenbaum et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghods-Sharifi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters and Büchel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zuo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grabenhorst et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zangemeister et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>). The BLA also undergoes structural and functional alterations with advanced age, and BLA neural activity during intertemporal decision making is attenuated in aged rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lolova and Davidoff, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rubinow and Juraska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rubinow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roesch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prager et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samson et al., 2017</xref>). It remains unclear, however, how age-associated changes in BLA recruitment actually influence intertemporal choice.</p><p>Optogenetic tools have been employed previously to define temporally-specific roles of BLA during deliberation and outcome evaluation in young rats performing a decision-making task involving risk of punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, BLA inactivation at discrete timepoints in the decision process shifted choice behavior in opposite directions, highlighting multiple roles for BLA information processing in risky decision making. The present study used a similar optogenetic approach to define the roles of BLA neural activity in intertemporal choice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and to further determine if the roles of BLA change across the lifespan.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electrophysiological confirmation of light-induced inhibition of BLA neurons expressing eNpHR3.0.</title><p>Virally-transduced neurons were identified by mCherry expression and targeted for whole-cell patch clamp recordings using a combination of epifluorescence and differential interference contrast microscopy.

Overall, voltage clamp experiments measured in the first 500 msec after the light pulse revealed similar mean currents in young and aged neurons (young: 0.6 ± 1.6 pA, n = 16 cells, aged: 4.1 ± 2.1 pA, n = 16 cells, t<sub>(30)</sub>=1.351, p=0.187). Similarly, only 1 of 61 neurons examined in current clamp (across both ages and light durations) that were silent before exposure to light fired any action potentials within 1 s of cessation of the light pulse. Overall, these data indicate that light-induced activation of eNpHR3.0 produces robust inhibition of virally-transduced BLA principal neurons, and that these effects do not significantly vary with age. The data further demonstrate that rebound excitation after eNpHR3.0 activation in BLA is minimal and unlikely to be functionally impactful.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Fiber placement and AAV transduction</title><p>Expression of mCherry was used to confirm viral transduction in the BLA of rats used in behavioral studies that were injected with either AAV5-CamKIIα-eNpHR3.0-mCherry (AAV-eNpHR3.0, black circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) or AA5-CamKIIα-mCherry alone (AAV-control, white circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

To better define the nature of this interaction, follow-up analyses using two-factor ANOVAs (laser condition × delay block) were performed on choice behavior separately in young and aged rats.

To address this possibility, an additional analysis was conducted in which aged rats were sub-grouped into those with delays comparable to young (‘aged delay-matched’) and those with delays that exceeded young (‘aged delay-unmatched’). A multi-factor ANOVA was conducted with age subgroup (two levels: aged delay-matched and aged delay-unmatched) as the between-subjects factor and laser condition (two levels: laser on or off) and block (three levels: blocks 1, 2, and 3) as within-subjects factors. Critically, this analysis revealed no choice difference between aged delay-matched and aged delay-unmatched subgroups when the BLA was inactivated during the small reward delivery (main effect of sub-group: F<sub>(1,4)</sub>=0.180, p=0.694; main effect of laser condition: F<sub>(1,4)</sub>=0.050, p=0.834; main effect of block: F<sub>(2,8)</sub>=80.518, p&lt;0.001, η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup>=0.953, 1-β=1.000; laser condition × sub-group: F<sub>(1,4)</sub>=0.082, p=0.789; laser condition × block: F<sub>(2,8)</sub>=0.167, p=0.849; sub-group × block: F<sub>(2,8)</sub>=0.328, p=0.729; laser condition × sub group × block: F<sub>(2,8)</sub>=0.515, p=0.616).

A trial-by-trial analysis was conducted on these data to determine the effects of BLA inactivation on two distinct behavioral strategies that could mediate these shifts in choice preference.

Specifically, BLA inactivation using such techniques results in more impulsive choices that favor immediate over delayed rewards. Lesion and pharmacological inactivation approaches, however, do not differentiate between temporally-discrete stages of decision making (e.g., deliberation, delay, outcome evaluation), which have been shown in other contexts to involve distinct neural circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peters and Büchel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fobbs and Mizumori, 2017</xref>). The current study employed optogenetic tools in order to parse temporally-discrete contributions of BLA to intertemporal choice in both young and aged rats.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of BLA in outcome evaluation in young rats</title><p>A large literature supports a role for BLA in assigning and updating the value of stimuli and events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hatfield et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Málková et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baxter et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baxter and Murray, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shiflett and Balleine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Izquierdo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Parkes and Balleine, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wassum and Izquierdo, 2015</xref>). With respect to decision making, the evaluative process mediated by BLA after an outcome has been received appears to involve acquisition and/or integration of information about the negative properties of that outcome. For example, previous work from our laboratory using a risky decision-making task demonstrated that BLA inactivation during receipt of a large, punished reward increased subsequent choice of this option over a small but safe reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>). Given this previous finding, it was somewhat surprising that in the current study, BLA inactivation during the large reward following the delay and/or the delay interval itself had no effect on choice behavior. These data demonstrate that the aversive properties of delays that bias choice behavior toward immediate options are not critically mediated by BLA. Importantly, however, BLA inactivation during the small reward epoch did reliably bias young rats toward choices of the small, immediate reward. This bias, which mimics that produced by BLA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winstanley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchwell et al., 2009</xref>), indicates that BLA is specifically important for evaluating and integrating the aversive properties that make the small reward less attractive than the large. Indeed, the trial-by-trial analysis showed that BLA inactivation rendered rats more likely to ‘stay’ with choices of the small reward after selection of that option on the previous trial, as though the negative feedback about that small reward ‘not being good enough’ had been attenuated. While these data are consistent with the idea that the BLA processes information about the aversive properties of outcomes in order to bias future behavior toward more favorable options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ghods-Sharifi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>), they also suggest that final integration of the values of both reward magnitude and delay occurs outside of the BLA. Given that working memory appears to contribute to the ability to delay gratification during intertemporal choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shamosh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bobova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shimp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>), it is likely that brain regions such as the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex mediate at least some components of information processing during the delay period. As such, one might predict that temporally-selective inactivation of these structures while waiting for a large reward (i.e., the delay interval) would influence future choice of that delayed option (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchwell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mariano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abela and Chudasama, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sonntag et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yates et al., 2014</xref>). It should also be noted that BLA might be more critically involved in integrating information about delays and reward magnitude under other intertemporal choice conditions, such as in the presence of a cue that predicts large reward delivery during the delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeeb et al., 2010</xref>). Future work applying temporally-discrete inactivation approaches to other brain regions implicated in intertemporal decision making (e.g., prefrontal cortex and hippocampus) will help to more fully elucidate their unique and/or shared contributions with BLA to choice behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of BLA during deliberation in young rats</title><p>In contrast to results obtained during outcome evaluation, BLA inactivation during deliberation in young rats increased choice of the large, delayed reward. This shift toward less impulsive choice is opposite of that produced by inactivation methods such as lesions, which inhibit the BLA throughout the entire decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winstanley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchwell et al., 2009</xref>). The prior study from our lab investigating risky decision making also showed that BLA inactivation during the deliberation epoch produced effects on choice behavior that were opposite those produced by neurotoxic lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Orsini et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, during choices between small, safe and large, risky rewards, BLA lesions increase risky choice whereas selective optogenetic BLA inactivation during deliberation attenuates risky choice. Together, these data indicate a critical role for BLA during deliberation, which is normally overshadowed by its role in outcome evaluation. Importantly, although the risky decision-making and intertemporal choice tasks are analogous in design, performance on the two tasks is orthogonal and involves dissociable neural mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Floresco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchwell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Simon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mitchell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Orsini et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orsini et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the similar pattern of results observed with BLA manipulations suggests a common role for this structure in multiple forms of decision making. Specifically, BLA activity during deliberation under normal conditions may be important for ascribing incentive salience to the choice options, signaling their motivational value, or how much they are ‘wanted’, in the moment of the decision. Consequently, choice may be biased toward the more immediate reward in the intertemporal choice task, and toward the larger, albeit riskier, reward in the risky choice task. When this signal is removed (e.g., during BLA inactivation), rats are more likely to wait in the intertemporal choice task and less likely to risk punishment in the risky choice task to obtain the large reward. Indeed, the trial-by-trial analysis in the current study shows that BLA inactivation during deliberation renders rats more likely to shift their choices to the delayed reward following a choice of the immediate reward, as though the incentive properties driving the immediate choice have been attenuated. This interpretation agrees with evidence from other behavioral contexts. For example, an intact BLA is necessary for the potentiating influence of reward-predictive cues on instrumental responding for reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Everitt et al., 2003</xref>), as well as for maintaining effortful choices of preferred options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hart and Izquierdo, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Age differences in intertemporal choice</title><p>Across species, aging is accompanied by an increased ability to delay gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Green et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jimura et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Löckenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Samanez-Larkin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eppinger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). Previous work from our labs showed that relative to young rats, aged rats display greater preference for large, delayed over small, immediate rewards in a ‘fixed delays, block design’ intertemporal choice task. This difference is not readily attributable to age-related deficits in cognitive flexibility, working memory, or food motivation, nor is it attributable to impairments in reward or temporal discrimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). The present study replicated these prior findings using a task variant in which the fixed delays/block design employed in our previous work was maintained, but the delays to large reward delivery were adjusted on an individual basis to obtain equivalent levels of choice preference in young and aged rats. Under these conditions, aged rats required longer delays to achieve levels of choice preference comparable to young, consistent with the idea that delays are less effective at discounting reward value in aged compared to young rats.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Age differences in the role of BLA in intertemporal choice</title><p>Inactivation of BLA during the deliberation epoch decreased impulsive choice in both young and aged rats. In contrast, BLA inactivation during the small reward epoch increased impulsive choice in young rats but had no effect in aged rats. Importantly, this lack of effect in aged rats is unlikely to be attributable to age-related impairments in viral transduction or optogenetic efficacy. Histological reconstruction showed comparable BLA viral transduction in young and aged rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Moreover, in vitro electrophysiological experiments showed that halorhodopsin-transduced BLA neurons in both age groups were silenced to a similar degree in response to light pulses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Most importantly, inactivation during the deliberation epoch in the same aged rats used to test the effects of inactivation during the small reward epoch produced effects on behavior that were as robust as those in young rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). These latter data provide direct, in vivo verification that the absence of behavioral effects following BLA inactivation during the small reward epoch in aged rats cannot be ascribed to attenuated halorhodopsin efficacy. It is possible that aged rats’ bias toward the large, delayed reward could have resulted in insufficient parametric space in which to observe optogenetically-induced shifts in choice behavior. The intertemporal choice task was explicitly designed to address this possibility by adjusting the delays to equate baseline choice preference in young and aged rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Additional analyses were conducted to ensure that the age difference in the delay to large reward delivery that resulted from this design did not itself influence the role of BLA in intertemporal choice. Specifically, aged rats were divided into subgroups based on whether their delays to large reward delivery matched or exceeded the range of young. The effects of BLA inactivation were identical between these aged subgroups, and in particular, BLA inactivation during the small reward epoch had no effect in either subgroup. These data indicate that the different delay durations experienced by young and aged rats do not account for the age differences in the role of BLA in intertemporal choice.</p><p>The distinct effects of BLA inactivation in young and aged rats could suggest that aged subjects fundamentally make decisions differently than young, relying less heavily on evaluation of choice outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Löckenhoff et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mather et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Samanez-Larkin and Knutson, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pachur et al., 2017</xref>). For example, whereas young adults readily incorporate new information to guide decisions, older adults tend to rely more heavily on previously-learned, ‘crystalized’ knowledge for decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Horn, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mather, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mata et al., 2011</xref>). If the cognitive structure of the decision process differs, the absence of BLA inactivation effects during outcome evaluation in aged rats may not necessarily reflect BLA dysfunction. For example, the increased reliance of older adults on crystalized knowledge for decision making has been attributed in part to vulnerability in neural structures such as hippocampus, which compromises encoding of new information and prospective memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Del Missier, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shadlen and Shohamy, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, there is substantial evidence in aged humans and rodents for recruitment of brain circuits that are distinct from those engaged by young subjects during complex cognitive operations, even when performance is equated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonenko and Flöel, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lighthall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tomás Pereira et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).

It is certainly possible, however, that the fact that aged rats don’t use the BLA for outcome evaluation during intertemporal decision making reflects neural dysfunction and/or compensation associated with other brain regions.</p><p>While the current findings do not necessarily reflect age-associated neurobiological impairments within the BLA, prior evidence does suggest that this region is susceptible to age-associated changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rubinow and Juraska, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rubinow et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roesch et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Prager et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, although BLA neuron number remains relatively stable with age, baseline firing rate of BLA neurons in vivo is reduced in aged rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almaguer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Roesch et al., 2012</xref>), and a recent electrophysiological recording study reported enhanced β-power in BLA of aged rats during reward evaluation in a probabilistic decision-making task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Samson et al., 2017</xref>). Projections from the BLA to the nucleus accumbens (NAc) may be particularly relevant for reward outcome evaluation. Pharmacological disconnection of the BLA and NAc impairs discrimination between a devalued vs. a non-devalued food reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shiflett and Balleine, 2010</xref>), and optogenetic inactivation of BLA terminals in NAc during outcome evaluation increases preference for the ‘risky’ option in a probabilistic decision-making task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bercovici et al., 2018</xref>). These results support the idea that BLA projections to NAc are responsible for mediating negative feedback regarding choice outcomes. Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eppinger et al. (2013)</xref> showed blunted activity in ventral striatum during reward prediction errors in older adults performing a learning task. Together with the current study, these findings suggest that the BLA-NAc circuit is disengaged during decision making in older adults.</p><p>Unlike BLA inactivation during outcome evaluation, inactivation during deliberation in both young and aged rats mimicked the attenuated impulsive choice observed in aging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). This effect is only observed using temporally-discrete optogenetic inhibition during deliberation, and not during outcome evaluation or with experimental methods such as lesions or pharmacological inactivation that inhibit the BLA across all stages of the decision process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Winstanley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchwell et al., 2009</xref>). Such data suggest that in young rats, activity in BLA circuits involved in outcome evaluation may be the primary driver of choice behavior. The failure to engage such outcome evaluation circuits in aging, however, may ‘unmask’ the contributions of BLA during deliberation. According to this hypothesis, structural or functional changes in BLA that occur with aging would thus exert their influence on intertemporal choice through a putative ‘deliberation circuit’, perhaps involving BLA projections to prefrontal cortex (PFC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Burgos-Robles et al., 2017</xref>). The BLA contains co-distributed neurons that send distinct efferent projections to PFC and NAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pérez-Jaranay and Vives, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambroggi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Shiflett and Balleine, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dilgen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McGarry and Carter, 2017</xref>). These distinct populations of BLA efferents may subserve unique roles in intertemporal choice, and further, may be differentially susceptible to aging. In other words, attenuated impulsive choice in aged rats might reflect a failure to engage a BLA-NAc ‘outcome evaluation’ circuit in combination with a hypoactive BLA-PFC ‘deliberation’ circuit that mimics the effect of BLA inactivation during deliberation. Future experiments applying circuit-based optogenetic approaches to the study of decision making in aging should be helpful for further elucidating the neurobiological substrates of age-associated alterations in intertemporal choice.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The current experiments demonstrate several unique roles for BLA activity in intertemporal choice. First, these data demonstrate a novel role for BLA in <italic>promoting</italic> impulsive choices when deciding whether to delay gratification. Moreover, these experiments defined a second role for BLA in <italic>attenuating</italic> impulsive choices, by providing negative feedback about the inadequacy of small vs large reward. Notably, this latter role in negative feedback does not extend to the aversive properties of the delay, indicating that the integrated valuation of reward and costs occurs outside of the BLA. Finally, the current experiments demonstrate that these temporally distinct roles of BLA in decision making change in aging. Specifically, aged rats do not appear to use BLA in any form of outcome evaluation. Moreover, the effects of age on intertemporal choice are mimicked by inactivation of BLA during deliberation. These findings suggest complex effects of aging within and/or outside BLA, which may uniquely impact distinct BLA efferent circuits. This study is among the first to apply optogenetic techniques to the study of cognitive aging. The findings offer unique insights into how BLA mediates intertemporal choice, and show that optogenetic approaches can be used to complement and extend our understanding of how changes in neural activity guide behavioral alterations in aged subjects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Young (6 months old, n = 24) and aged (24 months old, n = 19 male Fischer 344 x Brown Norway F1 hybrid (FBN) rats were obtained from the National Institute on Aging colony (Charles River Laboratories) and individually housed in the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited vivarium facility in the McKnight Brain Institute building at the University of Florida in accordance with the rules and regulations of the University of Florida Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee and National Institutes of Health guidelines. The facility was maintained at a consistent temperature of 25° with a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights on at 0600) and free access to food and water except as otherwise noted. Rats were acclimated in this facility and handled for at least one week prior to initiation of any procedures. A subset of rats completed only some of the behavioral epochs due to lost headcaps and premature death, and some rats were excluded entirely for misplaced injections.

Rats were anesthetized with isofluorane gas (1–5% in O<sub>2</sub>) and secured in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf). An incision along the midline over the skull was made and the skin was retracted. Bilateral burr holes were drilled above the BLA and five additional burr holes were drilled to fit stainless steel anchoring screws. Bilateral guide cannulae (22-gauge, Plastics One) were implanted to target the BLA (anteroposterior (AP): −3.25 mm from bregma, mediolateral (ML): ±4.95 mm from bregma, dorsoventral (DV): −7.3 mm from the skull surface) and secured to the skull using dental cement. A total of 0.6 µL of a 3.5 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml titer solution (University of North Carolina Vector Core) containing AAV5 packaged with either halorhodopsin (CamKIIα-eNpHR3.0-mCherry, n = 8 young and n = 7 aged rats) or mCherry alone (CamKIIα-mCherry, n = 4 young and n = 4 aged rats) was delivered through the implanted cannulae at a rate of 0.6 µL per min. Stainless steel obdurators were placed into the cannulae to minimize the risk of infection. Immediately after surgery, rats received subcutaneous injections of buprenorphine (1 mg/kg) and meloxicam (2 mg/kg). Buprenorphine was also administered 24 hr post-operation, and meloxicam 48–72 hr post-operation. A topical ointment was applied as needed to facilitate wound healing. Sutures were removed after 10–14 days and rats recovered for at least 2 weeks before food restriction and behavioral testing began.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>In vitro electrophysiology</title><p>For in vitro electrophysiological verification of functional halorhodopsin (eNpHR3.0), young (n = 4) and aged (n = 3) rats underwent surgery as described above except that neither guide cannulae nor skull screws were implanted. Following a 3–4 week survival time, rats were deeply anesthetized via i.p. injection of ketamine (75–100 mg/kg) and xylazine (5–10 mg/kg). The brain was rapidly cooled via transcardial perfusion with cold oxygenated sucrose-laden artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) containing (in mM): 205 sucrose, 10 dextrose, 1 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>. Rats were then decapitated, brains extracted and coronal slices (300 µm) prepared using a Leica VT 1000 s vibratome. Slices were incubated for 30 min at 37°C in oxygenated low-calcium ACSF containing (in mM): 124 NaCl, 10 dextrose, 3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.23 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, after which they were transferred to room temperature for a minimum of 30 min prior to experimentation. During recording experiments, slices were bathed in ACSF containing (in mM): 125 NaCl, 11 dextrose, 1.5 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 3 KCl, 1.2 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.4 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, maintained at 28–30°C. The pipette (internal) solution contained (in mM): 125 K-gluconate, 10 phosphocreatine, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 0.1 EGTA, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.25 Na<sub>3</sub>GTP, and 5 biocytin, adjusted to pH 7.25 and 295 mOsm with KOH. BLA neurons were visualized using a combination of IR-DIC and epifluorescence microscopy using an Olympus BX51WI microscope and a TTL-controlled light source (X-Cite 110 LED light source, XF102-2 filter set, Omega Optical, excitation 540–580 nm, emission 615–695 nm, also used for in vitro activation of eNpHR3.0 for 1 or 4 s). Patch pipettes were prepared with a Flaming/Brown type pipette puller (Sutter Instrument, P-97) from 1.5 mm/0.8 mm borosilicate glass capillaries (Sutter Instruments) and pulled to an open tip resistance of 4–7 MΩ using internal solution and ACSF noted above. Electrophysiological recordings were performed using a Mutliclamp 700B amplifier and Digidata 1440A digitizer (Axon Instruments/Molecular Devices). Electrophysiological data were collected at 20 kHz and low-pass filtered at 2 kHz.</p><p>At the conclusion of experiments, a subset of slices was transferred to 10% formalin (4°C, 24 hr) to allow for <italic>post hoc</italic> histological analysis. Slices were washed in PBS, permeabilized in PBS containing 0.1% Triton-X, and incubated in streptavidin conjugate with fluorophore (1:1000, 594 nm, ThermoFisher S32356). Slices were then mounted onto slides and coverslipped using VECTASHIELD.

Each test chamber was housed in a sound-attenuating cubicle and was equipped with a custom food pellet delivery trough fitted with a photobeam to detect head entries (TAMIC Instruments) located 2 cm above the floor and extending 3 cm into the chamber in the center of the front wall. A nosepoke hole equipped with a 1.12 W lamp for illumination was located directly above the food trough. Food rewards consisted of 45 mg grain-based food pellets (PJAI; Test Diet, Richmond, IN, USA). Two retractable levers were positioned to the left and right of the food trough (11 cm above the floor). A 1.12 W house light was mounted near the top of the rear wall of the sound-attenuating cubicle. For optical activation of eNpHR3.0, laser light (561 nm, 8–10 mW output at the fiber tip, Shanghai Laser and Optics Century) was delivered through a patch cord (200 µm core, Thor Labs) to a rotary joint (1 × 2, 200 µm core, Doric Lenses) mounted above the operant chamber. At the rotary joint, the light was split into two outputs. Tethers (200 µm core, 0.22 NA, Thor Labs) connected these outputs to the bilateral optic fibers (200 µm core, 0.22 NA, 8.3 mm in length; Precision Fiber Products) implanted in the BLA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Orsini et al., 2017</xref>).

Prior to commencement of behavioral testing, both young and aged rats were food-restricted to 85% of their free-feeding weights over the course of 5 days and maintained at these weights for the duration of the experiments. Rats were initially shaped to lever press to initiate delivery of a food pellet into the food trough and were then trained to nosepoke to initiate lever extension. Each nosepoke initiated extension of either the left or right lever (randomized across pairs of trials), a press on which yielded a single food pellet. After two consecutive days of reaching criterion performance (45 presses on each lever), rats began testing on the intertemporal choice task.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Intertemporal choice task</title><p>Each 60 min session consisted of 3 blocks of 20 trials each. The trials were 60 s in duration and began with a 10 s illumination of both the nosepoke port and house light. A nosepoke into the port during this time extinguished the nosepoke light and triggered lever extension. Any trials on which rats failed to nosepoke during this 10 s window were scored as omissions. Each 20-trial block began with two forced choice trials, in which either the right or left lever was extended, in order to remind rats of the delay contingencies in effect for that block. These forced choice trials were followed by 18 free choice trials, in which both levers were extended. For all trials, one lever (either left or right, counterbalanced across age groups) was always associated with immediate delivery of one food pellet (the small reward), and the other lever was associated with three food pellets (the large reward) delivered after a variable delay. Lever assignment (small or large reward) remained consistent throughout testing. Within a session, the duration of the delay preceding large reward delivery increased across the three blocks of trials. The actual delay durations were adjusted individually for each rat, such that the percent choice of the large reward corresponded to roughly 100% in block 1, 66% in block 2, and 33% in block 3. On all trials, rats were given 10 s to press a lever, after which the levers were retracted, and food was delivered into the food through. If rats failed to press a lever within 10 s, the levers were retracted, lights were extinguished, and the trial was scored as an omission. An inter-trial interval (ITI) followed either food delivery or an omitted trial, after which the next trial began.</p><p>Rats were initially trained for 15 sessions on the intertemporal choice task. They were then lightly anesthetized and optic fibers (Precision Fiber Products) were inserted into the guide cannulae such that they extended 1 mm past the end of the guide cannulae and were cemented in place.

Your article has been reviewed by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor, Geoffrey Schoenbaum as the Reviewing Editor, and two reviewers. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors build on prior work regarding the role of the amygdala in an inter temporal choice task to examine effects of aging on its involvement. Young and aged rats were presented with trials involving a choice between two levers, one producing a small reward immediately and another producing a larger reward at a delay, with the length of delay increasing in three steps across trial blocks. They found that aged rats were less sensitive to delay than young controls. After adjusting the delay to obtain similar choice performance in each block between young and old, which was clever, they then ontogenetically inactivated basolateral amygdala in specific time periods of the trials. They found that inactivation during deliberation had similar effects in the two groups, whereas inactivation during evaluation of the small reward affected young but not old rats. Inactivation during a number of other periods did not alter the behavior in either group.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Overall the reviewers thought the study was well-designed and analyzed and the results were clear. However, the main concern was that the novelty with regard to aging was predicated on a single null finding, with inactivation in most time periods having apparently no impact. The reviewers felt that negative results in such a cleanly designed study were worthwhile, but that the overall picture was somewhat lost in the discussion. To correct this, there were three essential revisions that seemed important in the Discussion section. One was to consider better the import of the data overall, the limitation of the null result and its significance alongside all the other negative findings. Does this mean the effects of aging are quite subtle? Why is amygdala not involved in these other periods? A second related revision is to conduct the explicit direct age group comparisons of data as requested by R2. A third is to provide some additional detail or discussion of the effectiveness of the optogenetics in young versus aged rats – can expression and the results of the slice physiology be better quantified to show it is quantitatively similar? If revisions along these lines can be made, the reviewers thought this would be an important contribution to the aging literature.</p><p>Minor points: see reviews. The title might also be adjusted to reflect the balance of negative results. Also the species used might be mentioned.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>This report from Hernandez et al., uses a combination of optogenetic methods and parametric task manipulations to explore how basolateral amygdala (BLA) circuitry might contribute to the effects of aging on decision making. The results demonstrate that, whereas BLA inhibition when rats are deliberating about an impending choice enhances delayed gratification independent of age, the same manipulation after reward delivery, during outcome evaluation, shifts decision making in the opposite direction only in young subjects. This pattern suggests that BLA recruitment mediates multiple, temporally discrete processing functions in decision making that are differentially sensitive to aging. The paper is well written, the approach is methodologically rigorous, and the analysis appears appropriate. The findings with respect to BLA contributions to intertemporal choice are novel, but conclusions regarding the effects of aging seem less compelling.</p><p>The key findings of the paper regarding aging are illustrated in Figure 5. They demonstrate that BLA inhibition during choice deliberation enhances delayed gratification similarly in young and aged rats (Figure 5A). However, only young rats display an effect of inhibition delivered during choice outcome evaluation (Figure 5B). Evidence that the role of BLA is altered in aging therefore hinges on a single negative result, i.e., the absence of a modulatory effect of BLA inhibition seen in young rats. What would strengthen the conclusions is evidence pointing to the potential direction of effect. Is outcome evaluation insensitive to BLA inhibition because the role of the BLA is altered in aged animals, or is BLA inhibition ineffective because choice outcome evaluation is altered in aging? Viewed in a different way, is 'choice indifference' at a ~5 second delay in young rats really the same processing function as 'choice indifference' at a ~20 second delay in aged rats? Disentangling these alternatives on the basis of the negative result reported seems problematic.</p><p>The body of the report indicates that a variety of task-specific performance measures failed to differ as a function of age, but the Tables listing the results do not indicate that direct age group comparisons were conducted (i.e., they reference effects of inactivation and task condition, but not age). Of particular note, response latencies (Table 2) seem generally faster for the aged rats and it would be interesting to know if this effect was reliable.</p><p>The results of the in vitro slice physiology provide valuable confirmation, but subjectively they suggest that firing rates after optogenetic inhibition may increase relative to baseline (see pre/post trace in Figure 2D). Are the data sufficient to assess whether this effect is reliable, or age-dependent?</p><p>The Materials and methods section mention food restriction, but specifics do not seem to be reported, including potential differential restriction in the young and aged rats.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript by Hernandez and colleagues addresses the hypothesis that age-related increases in the ability to delay gratification are related to changes in the function of the basolateral amygdala (BLA), a region that supports reward-cost evaluation. The investigators used optogenetics to manipulate the BLA in an intertemporal choice paradigm. In this paradigm, rats have a deliberation period followed by the opportunity to choose between a response that will provide a small, immediate reward or a response that will provide a large, delayed reward. If the BLA was inactivated during deliberation, young and aged rats were less impulsive in their choices and were more likely to choose the large delayed rewards. If the BLA was inactivated during outcome evaluation of small rewards, the young rats more impulsive on the next choice and less likely to choose the large, delayed reward. Aged rats were not affected by inactivation during evaluation of small rewards. Choice behavior was not impacted by inactivation during delay, during large outcome evaluation, or delay plus large outcome evaluation. This shift in opposite directions following inactivation of the BLA has been observed in young rats in a similar paradigm in a study conducted by the same group.</p><p>The authors interpretation is that the BLA is involved only in certain temporal components of intertemporal decision making under certain reward and that alterations in the recruitment of the BLA intertemporal decision making underlies age-related preferences for delayed gratification.</p><p>What is new here? We already know that aging alters delayed gratification and that this relies on the BLA. So, it's not clear what is novel here, unless it is the impact on particular components of the behavior.</p><p>One issue is whether differences in the duration of light might underlie some of these effects or underlie some of the null effects. There are some reports that constant NpHR light can induce increases in intracellular chloride accumulation that result in increased excitability of neuronal networks or a rebound effect. So, it is possible that differences in the duration of light could have different effects on the BLA in ways that are different across conditions or different across age groups.

As such, temporally-discrete optogenetic manipulations of neural activity during decision making (in which multiple cognitive operations are being performed) would be expected to produce distinct behavioral effects. Having said that, intertemporal choices are supported by a large network of brain structures and thus it seems unlikely that any single brain structure within this network would contribute in the same way across all of the behavioral epochs as we have defined them within this study (e.g., deliberation vs. delay vs. outcome evaluation). Indeed, one goal of the current study was to define exactly when and how information processed within the BLA guides intertemporal choice behavior. Within this context, the “null” effects offer critical information about when the BLA (and its diverse inputs and outputs) critically mediates intertemporal choice. By extension, the combination of null and positive effects on behavior help define the nature of information processed in this structure that is responsible for driving those choices.</p><p>A primary example of the new information that has been gleaned using this optogenetic approach is related to the role of BLA in “outcome evaluation”. We made the somewhat surprising observation that BLA inactivation during outcome evaluation only impacted subsequent choices when paired with the small, immediate reward. We observed no effect on behavior when BLA was inactivated during the delay or the large reward. We speculate that the role of the BLA during outcome evaluation is restricted to providing negative feedback about the small reward outcome received, and that integration of negative feedback about the delay and large reward outcome must originate in other brain loci. As is described more extensively in the revised Discussion section, a role for BLA in conferring negative feedback about the choice outcome being “less than expected” is supported by other data from a risky decision task in which BLA inactivation selectively influenced behavior on trials associated with punished rewards but not on other trials types in which rats received other outcomes (Orsini et al., 2017). There are a number of other brain regions that might process information about delay interval and the large reward and use that information to guide choice behavior. For example, prefrontal cortex and hippocampus are implicated in both intertemporal choice and maintenance of information during delay periods (Churchwell et al., 2009; Mariano et al., 2009; Abela and Chudasama, 2013; Sonntag et al., 2014; Yates et al., 2014). Manipulating neural activity in one or both of these structures during delays might be expected to impact intertemporal choice. In the revised manuscript, we have expanded the discussion of the null effects and their implications for defining the specific role of BLA in intertemporal choice (Discussion section).</p><p>Does this mean the effects of aging (on BLA) are quite subtle?</p><p>First, it is important to consider that the effects of aging on intertemporal choice task performance are circumscribed. Aged rats perform procedural elements of the task as well as young, and they do discount delayed rewards to some extent. The effects of age are only on the distribution of choices, such that aged rats discount rewards less steeply than young.</p><p>On another level, however, the effects of age on the role of BLA in intertemporal choice are not subtle at all, in that the BLA plays a qualitatively different role in outcome evaluation in aged compared to young rats. Importantly, this difference does not necessarily reflect BLA dysfunction in aged rats but does clearly demonstrate that aged rats are not using information from the BLA in the same way as young to make intertemporal choices.</p><p>Finally, although there are copious data indicating that neural activity differs between young and aged subjects, there are very few data in the literature that directly address how such differences in activity contribute to age differences in performance. Thus, we would argue that we (as a field) do not yet know what to expect in terms of the magnitude of behavioral effects that might arise from discrete age differences in neural activity within particular brain regions or circuits.</p><p>We have substantially revised the Discussion section in order to offer a better interpretation of both the positive and null effects of BLA inactivation. In particular, we have restructured this section to detail the interpretation of first the young data, followed by the aging-associated changes. We hope that this revision will better frame the unique contributions of this study to the literature and how the null effects can be used to sculpt and restrict the interpretation of the BLA’s role in intertemporal decision making.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second related revision is to conduct the explicit direct age group comparisons of data as requested by R2.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we have now added the age comparison to the trial-by-trial analyses (see revised Figure 5 and subsection “Altered choice strategy resulting from BLA inactivation during the deliberation and small reward epochs”). As is evident in Figure 5B and 5D, the trial-by-trial age comparisons are consistent with those observed in the analyses of mean choice of the large reward across trial blocks (Figure 5A and 5C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A third is to provide some additional detail or discussion of the effectiveness of the optogenetics in young versus aged rats – can expression and the results of the slice physiology be better quantified to show it is quantitatively similar?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments and have now included an explicit and quantitative comparison of slice electrophysiological data in young and aged rats, including results from new experiments that assessed the effects of light durations that match those used during the behavioral experiments (Results section and Figure 2, as well as Discussion section).

We used a three-factor ANOVA to compare these aged sub-groups (with Sub-group as the between-subjects factor and Laser condition and Block as within-subjects factors). Across all behavioral epochs, this analysis revealed no differences between aged sub-groups. Most importantly, there was no difference in choice behavior between the “aged delay-matched” and “aged delay-unmatched” groups on the behavioral epoch in which BLA inactivation produced different results in young and aged rats (statistics from comparisons on small reward outcome delivery: main effect of sub-group and all interactions involving subgroup: all Fs &lt;0.51, ps&gt;.33). The results of these subgroup analyses demonstrate that differences in the actual delay durations between young and aged rats do not appear to account for age differences in the effects of BLA inactivation during small reward outcome evaluation. Rather, these results are consistent with the interpretation that BLA activity during outcome evaluation simply does not influence intertemporal choice in aged rats as it does in young rats. The full statistical analysis for the subgroup analysis in the small reward outcome epoch is now included in the Results section and summarized in the Discussion section. In addition, sub-group comparisons for each task epoch (figures and full statistical results) are included at the end of this letter. Finally, we have considerably revised the discussion and now devote considerable attention to the issue of whether the “failure” of aged rats to use their BLA during outcome evaluation reflects a deficit in BLA function or rather, a difference in how aging influences the cognitive structure (and the neural circuitry) of decision making. This discussion can be found in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The body of the report indicates that a variety of task-specific performance measures failed to differ as a function of age, but the Tables listing the results do not indicate that direct age group comparisons were conducted (i.e., they reference effects of inactivation and task condition, but not age).

Specifically, these data reveal an influence of BLA on choice behavior during deliberation between choice options that is opposite of that produced by BLA lesions. Moreover, we show that effects of BLA lesions can be reproduced by inactivation of BLA selectively during small reward outcome evaluation in young rats. These data define multiple, temporally-distinct roles for BLA in intertemporal decision making that influence choice behavior in opposite directions.</p><p>A second novel element of these results is that they show that these discrete roles of the BLA in decision making change in aging. We have substantially revised the entire Discussion section in part to better highlight each novel aspects of the results. We further highlight other points of novelty, including that this is one of the first studies to employ optogenetic approaches to study either cognitive aging or intertemporal choice. In reference to these points, it is important to recognize that the data do not simply replicate or verify results from other studies using a host of different techniques (lesion, behavioral pharmacological, electrophysiological, neuroimaging). The optogenetic findings instead extend and offer unique insights into the BLA’s role in intertemporal choice, and show that this approach can be used to complement and extend other approaches used to evaluate neural activity at the cellular and systems level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One issue is whether differences in the duration of light might underlie some of these effects or underlie some of the null effects.

Regarding the effects of age on BLA neurons’ response to optogenetic inactivation, we have now conducted explicit and quantitative comparisons of halorhodopsin effects in young and aged BLA neurons using in vitro electrophysiology. These experiments show equivalent responses to light durations that match those used during behavioral testing (Results section and Figure 2, as well as Discussion section). The reviewer also raised the possibility that differences in light duration could contribute to age differences in the effects of BLA inactivation on behavior. Importantly, age differences were only observed for inactivation during the small reward epoch, in which the duration of light delivery (4 seconds) was equivalent in young and aged rats. Moreover, for the only task epoch (the delay prior to large reward delivery) for which the duration of light delivery did differ between young and aged rats, BLA inactivation had no effect in either age group. We have now made these points more explicit in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although an interesting finding consistent with what we know about aging and the BLA, this paper would have been more impressive if the investigators had moved the aged rats in the other direction, in other words, correcting the age-related enhanced ability to delay gratification.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that this is an interesting set of experiments, which are currently in the planning stages in our labs.
