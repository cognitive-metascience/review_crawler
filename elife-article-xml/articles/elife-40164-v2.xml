understanding of 3D genome architecture remains a major challenge, as it requires quantitative measurements of the key proteins involved. Here, we report the quantification of CTCF and cohesin, two causal regulators of topologically associating domains (TADs) in mammalian cells. Extending our previous imaging studies (Hansen et al., 2017), we estimate bounds on the density of putatively DNA loop-extruding cohesin complexes and CTCF binding site occupancy. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation studies of an endogenously tagged subunit (Rad21) suggest the presence of cohesin dimers and/or oligomers. Finally, based on our cell lines with accurately measured protein abundances, we report a method to conveniently determine the number of molecules of any Halo-tagged protein in the cell. We anticipate that our results and the established tool for measuring cellular protein abundances will advance a more quantitative understanding of 3D genome organization, and facilitate protein quantification, key to comprehend diverse biological processes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CTCF</kwd><kwd>cohesin</kwd><kwd>loop

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Folding of mammalian genomes into structures known as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs) is thought to help regulate gene expression while aberrant misfolding has been associated with disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dekker and Mirny, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fudenberg and Pollard, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr"

rid="bib58">Symmons et al., 2014</xref>). CTCF and cohesin have emerged as causal regulators of TAD formation and maintenance, since acute CTCF or cohesin depletion causes global loss of most TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nora et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). Concordantly, knock-out of cohesin loading proteins NIPBL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schwarzer et al., 2017</xref>) and MAU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>) also affect TAD organization, although to different extents. Likewise, loss of the cohesin unloader WAPL strengthens TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haarhuis et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wutz et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with the key roles played by CTCF and cohesin, models of genome folding through cohesin-mediated loop extrusion, which is stopped by chromatin-bound CTCF, have been remarkably successful in reproducing the general features of genomic contact maps at the level of TADs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fudenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>). Nevertheless, these models have been limited by a dearth of quantitative biological data to constrain the modeling. Importantly, the number of CTCF and cohesin molecules, the molecular mechanism of loop extrusion and the stoichiometry of cohesin during this process remain unknown, further limiting our ability to test various models. Building on our recent genomic and imaging studies of endogenously tagged CTCF and cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), here we (1) estimate bounds on the density of potentially loop-extruding cohesin complexes and estimate the CTCF-binding site occupancy probability in cells; (2) provide biochemical evidence that at least a subset of cohesin complexes exist as dimers or oligomers and (3) develop a simple method for determining the absolute cellular abundance of any protein fused to the widely used and highly versatile HaloTag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Los et al., 2008</xref>).</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Determining the number of CTCF and cohesin proteins per cell</title><p>To estimate the absolute abundance (number of proteins per cell) of CTCF and cohesin, we applied a combination of three distinct methods: 1) ‘in-gel’ fluorescence, 2) Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS)-calibrated imaging, and 3) Flow Cytometry (FCM). First, we developed an ‘in-gel’ fluorescence method based on previously validated mouse and human cell lines where either CTCF (U2OS and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESC)) or the cohesin kleisin subunit Rad21 (mESC) were endogenously and homozygously Halo-tagged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). We showed that these cell lines express the tagged proteins at endogenous levels by quantitative western blotting, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). To establish a standard, we purified recombinant 3xFLAG-Halo-CTCF and Rad21-Halo-3xFLAG from insect cells and labeled the purified proteins with the bright dye JF<sub>646</sub> coupled to the covalent HaloTag ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grimm et al., 2015</xref>). We then ran a known quantity of protein side-by-side with a known number of cells labeled with the same fluorescent HaloTag ligand and quantified the total protein abundance per cell using ‘in-gel’ fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; Materials and methods). We note that JF<sub>646</sub>-labeling is near-quantitative in live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoon et al., 2016</xref>); moreover, a titration experiment indicated ≥90% labeling efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>), although we cannot exclude slight undercounting due to incomplete labeling. Quantification by ‘in-gel’ fluorescence revealed that, on average, mESCs contain ~218,000 ± 24,000 CTCF protein molecules (mean ± std) as well as ~86,900 ± 35,600 Rad21 proteins and thus presumably cohesin complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; Rad21 appears to be the least abundant cohesin subunit, see Materials and methods). Similarly, we determined the abundance of Halo-CTCF in U2OS cells (C32) to be ~104,900 ± 14,600 proteins per cell. The CTCF abundance in human U2OS cells corresponds thus to about half the number of CTCF molecules determined for mESCs (~218,000 proteins/cell). Independent FCS experiments in HeLa Kyoto CTCF-EGFP cells measured ~125,000 CTCF molecules per cell in G1-phase and ~181,000 in G2-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holzmann et al., 2019</xref>). It is thus tempting to speculate that cell-type-specific control of chromatin looping may be achieved in part by regulating CTCF abundance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40164.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Absolute cellular CTCF and cohesin quantification.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative SDS-PAGE gel showing a titration of purified and labeled JF<sub>646</sub>-3xFLAG-Halo-CTCF protein as a standard (first three lanes) side-by-side with JF<sub>646</sub>-Halo-CTCF from lysed mESCs (3 replicates of 150,000 cells each from two different clones and different replicates).

FCS-calibrated imaging has been recently established as a robust tool for absolute protein abundance quantification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Politi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). We adapted this method to Halo-tagged proteins using the commercially available HaloTag ligand TMR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and applied it to quantify cellular Halo-CTCF abundance in the U2OS C32 clone. We found a mean of 114,600 ± 10,200 CTCF proteins per U2OS interphase cell, randomly sampling asynchronously cycling single cells (mean ± std of 4 replicates with number of cells <italic>n</italic> ≥ 21; 101 single cells in total; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). Over 90% of cellular Halo-CTCF molecules localized to the interphase U2OS nucleus (~106,000 nuclear Halo-CTCF molecules, which corresponds to a nuclear Halo-CTCF concentration of ~144.3 nM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B,E</xref>)). The result of our FCS-calibrated imaging method (~114,600 ± 10,200) agrees within technical error with our ‘in-gel’ fluorescence estimate of ~104,900 ± 14,600 CTCF molecules per cell, and thereby validates the latter approach for determining average cellular protein abundances. We take the mean of the two methods, 109,800 CTCF proteins per cell in U2OS cells, as our best and final cross-validated estimate.</p><p>We finally used our robust and cross-validated CTCF abundance estimate in U2OS cells as a standard to estimate protein abundances in the endogenously Halo-tagged mESC lines. We labeled cells with HaloTag TMR ligand and used FCM with TMR fluorescence as readout. After background subtraction, we could estimate the absolute abundance of TMR-labeled mESC C59 Halo-CTCF, C87 Halo-CTCF, and C45 Rad21-Halo by comparing to the standard U2OS C32 TMR-Halo-CTCF fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Notably, the estimates of mESC C59 and C87 Halo-CTCF were identical within error by both the ‘in-gel’ fluorescence and FCM method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We take the mean of C59 and C87 across the two methods, namely ~217,200 CTCF proteins per cell in mESCs, as the best and final estimate. This provides additional cross-validation and furthermore suggests that FCM can be used to estimate the absolute abundance of other Halo-tagged proteins if the U2OS C32 Halo-CTCF cell line is used as a standard (see below; Figure 3). For mESC C45 Rad21-Halo, the FCM estimate of 131,800 ± 12,600 proteins/cell differed more from the ‘in-gel’ fluorescence estimate of 86,900 ± 35,600, but was still just within error. We speculate that this discrepancy could be due to poorer Rad21-Halo protein stability during the biochemical steps of the ‘in-gel’ fluorescence method. We again take the mean of the two methods,~109,400 Rad21 proteins per cell, as our final, although less certain, estimate of Rad21 abundance in mESCs.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Quantitative constraints of 3D genome organization from CTCF and cohesin abundances</title><p>The loop extrusion model posits that cohesin extrudes chromatin loops until blocked by chromatin-bound CTCF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fudenberg et al., 2017</xref>). Based on the determined abundances of CTCF and cohesin in mESCs, we can now parameterize this model. First, we measured the interphase cell cycle distribution of JM8.N4 mESCs: 10.2% in G1-phase, 73.9% in S-phase, and 15.9% in G2-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). This approximately agrees with other mESC estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hansen et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sladitschek and Neveu, 2015</xref>) and shows that an ‘average’ mESC is approximately half-way through the cell cycle and thus contains ~3 genome copies. We have previously determined the fraction of CTCF molecules bound to specific DNA sites in mESCs by single-molecule imaging (~49%) and the total number of CTCF sites in the mESC genome by ChIP-seq (~71,000) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). Now we can use the information on the absolute abundance of CTCF proteins per mESC (217,200) to calculate that an average CTCF-binding site is occupied ~50% of the time by a CTCF molecule (always assuming three genome copies; full details in Materials and methods). In the context of the loop extrusion model, this suggests that the time-averaged occupancy of an average CTCF boundary site by CTCF is ~50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) – that is, an extruding cohesin will be blocked ~50% of the time at an average CTCF site in the simplest version of the loop extrusion model. We cannot estimate CTCF binding site occupancy and probability of blocking cohesin extrusion in U2OS cells, since these cells have a poorly defined karyotype.</p><p>For cohesin, we previously estimated the fraction of cohesin complexes that are relatively stably associated with chromatin (~20–25 min residence time in mESC G1) and thus presumably topologically engaged to be ~40% in G1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). If we take this as the upper bound of putatively ‘loop-extruding’ cohesin complexes, we can similarly calculate the upper limit on the density of extruding cohesin molecules as ~5.3 per Mb assuming cohesin exists as a monomeric ring or ~2.7 per Mb if cohesin forms dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>; full details on calculation in Materials and methods). This corresponds to a genomic distance between extruding cohesins of ~186–372 kb in mESCs, which approximately matches computational estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gassler et al., 2017</xref>). We envision that these numbers will be useful starting points for constraining and parameterizing models of 3D genome organization and we discuss some limitations of these estimates below.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Mammalian cohesin can form dimers and/or higher order oligomers in cells</title><p>Interpreting the cohesin data described above requires an accurate count of its molecular stoichiometry, but whether cohesin complexes function as single rings, dimers or higher order oligomeric structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) has been highly debated in the literature. In addition to potentially engaging in loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hassler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nichols and Corces, 2018</xref>) cohesin plays important roles in sister chromatid cohesion and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Losada et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Michaelis et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Onn et al., 2008</xref>). Cohesin is generally assumed to exist as a single tripartite ring composed of the subunits Smc1, Smc3 and Rad21/Scc1/Mcd1 at 1:1:1 stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nasmyth, 2011</xref>), with a fourth subunit, Scc3 (SA1 or SA2 in mammalian cells) that is bound to Rad21. However, higher order oligomeric cohesin structures have been proposed based upon the unusual genetic properties of cohesin subunits in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skibbens, 2016</xref>). Moreover, a previous study used self co-immunoprecipitation (CoIP) of cohesin subunits to suggest a handcuff-shaped dimer model for cohesin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Still, this study has remained highly controversial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nasmyth, 2011</xref>) and self-CoIP experiments of cohesin subunits in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haering et al., 2002</xref>) and human HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauf et al., 2005</xref>) could not detect cohesin dimers. Moreover, budding yeast condensin, an SMC complex related to cohesin, can extrude loops in vitro as a monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>). Since the mammalian study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) relied on over-expressed epitope-tagged cohesin subunits and given our recent observations that over-expression of the Rad21 subunit does not faithfully recapitulate the properties of endogenously tagged Rad21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), we decided to revisit this important issue using endogenous tagging without overexpression. First, we generated mESCs where one endogenous Rad21 allele was Halo-V5 tagged while the other allele was not tagged (clone C85; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>; see Materials and methods for details). We also generated an additional mESC line where one allele of Rad21 was tagged with Halo-V5 and the other with SNAP-3xFLAG (clone B4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). We then carefully examined the specificity of several V5 and FLAG antibodies in both western blot and CoIP assays to select those with no cross-reactivity with either the reciprocal tag or the wild-type, untagged Rad21 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). If cohesin exclusively existed as a single ring containing one Rad21 subunit, a V5 IP of Rad21-Halo-V5 should not pull down the Rad21 protein generated from the other allele. However, in the C85 clonal line, the V5 CoIP clearly precipitated wild-type Rad21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). This cohesin:cohesin interaction appears to be protein-mediated rather than dependent on DNA association since benzonase treatment, which leads to complete DNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>), did not interfere with CoIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; single-color blots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This demonstrates that Rad21 either directly or indirectly self-associates in a protein-mediated and biochemically stable manner, consistent with cohesin forming dimers or higher order oligomers in vivo. However, this observation does not implicate that cohesin dimers or oligomers are a functional state of loop-extruding cohesin complexes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40164.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Cohesin subunit Rad21 self-interacts in a protein-dependent manner.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sketches of hypothetical single-ring, dimer and oligomer models of cohesin.

Under the simplest assumption of cohesin forming dimers, we calculated that at least ~8% of cohesin is in a dimeric state during our pull-down experiment, based on our IP and CoIP efficiencies (full calculation details in Materials and methods). This percentage is likely an underestimate of the actual oligomeric vs monomeric ratio in live cells, since we expect a substantial proportion of the self-interactions not to survive cell lysis and the typically harsh IP procedures. Thus, while these results cannot exclude that some or even a majority of mammalian cohesin exists as a single-ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), they do suggest that a measureable population may exist as dimers or oligomers.

Similarly, since the standard and the cell line of interest have to be measured side-by-side, the dynamic range of the flow cytometer will in principle impose an upper limit. This will be instrument-specific, but we note that our method may not be appropriate for extremely highly expressed proteins (&gt;10–20 million proteins per cell; calculated based on the LSR Fortessa instrument used in this study). Compared to the ‘in-gel’ fluorescence method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>), we believe this live-cell FCM method is both more convenient and robust, since it avoids cell lysis and other biochemical steps that may affect protein stability.

Our results suggest that a significant subpopulation of mammalian cohesin (lower bound: ~8%) may exist as either a dimer or an oligomeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is consistent with an earlier study that relied on over-expression of tagged mammalian cohesin subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Along these lines, the related bacterial SMC complex, MukBEF, also forms a dimer or and even ‘dimers of dimers’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arciszewska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badrinarayanan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fennell-Fezzie et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Matoba et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Woo et al., 2009</xref>). Moreover, the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> SMC condensin complex has been proposed to extrude DNA loops at a speed of ~50 kb/min as a dimeric handcuff complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). In budding yeast, cohesin exhibits inter-allelic complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eng et al., 2015</xref>) consistent with a dimeric or higher order complex. However, previous self-CoIP experiments with differentially tagged budding yeast cohesin subunits failed to detect cohesin dimers or oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Haering et al., 2002</xref>). Likewise, single-step photobleaching strongly indicates that budding yeast condensin can extrude loops as a single ring complex in a one-sided, asymmetric fashion in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ganji et al., 2018</xref>). Nevertheless, other studies have shown that budding yeast condensin can exist as both monomers, dimers, and oligomers and that multimeric budding yeast condensin is more active in a single-molecule magnetic tweezers-based DNA-compaction assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keenholtz et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, recent computer simulations suggest that only effectively two-sided extrusion (either two-sided extrusion, or one-sided extrusion with directional switching) can achieve the ~1000 fold condensin-mediated compaction observed for mammalian mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banigan and Mirny, 2018</xref>). Although SMC complexes are highly conserved from prokaryotes to mammals, it remains unclear to what extent cohesin and condensin mechanistically differ and to what extent mammalian and budding yeast cohesin differ. For example, several cohesin proteins that are encoded by a single gene in budding yeast are encoded by multiple genes in mammals (e.g. Scc3 in budding yeast vs SA1 or SA2 in mammals). Since mammalian cohesin contains either SA1 or SA2, but not both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sumara et al., 2000</xref>) and since SA1- and SA2-cohesin appear to mediate at least partially different functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kojic et al., 2018</xref>), one possibility would be that SA1- and SA2-cohesin might also differ in their architecture. Our CoIP results show that cohesin can exist in a dimeric and/or oligomeric state in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). These oligomers may also be arising from cohesin clusters, which we previously observed with super-resolution microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), or even from larger complexes that contain single ring cohesins which do not directly interact. We hope that our results here spur further investigations using orthogonal methods into the stoichiometry of mammalian cohesin and the architecture of the putatively loop-extruding cohesin complex. Moreover, although polymer-modeling of 3D genome organization is rapidly advancing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fudenberg et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nuebler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Racko et al., 2018</xref>), a paucity of quantitative data to inform us of the stoichiometry of key 3D genome organizers currently constrains our ability to test the various models that have been reported. We hope that the data presented here will prove useful in informing and advancing such efforts in the future.</p><p>The absolute CTCF and cohesin protein measurements that we report here for mESCs will be valuable to constrain current in-silico models of 3D genome organization. However, we note that these calculations have inherent limitations. First, although the different methods gave nearly identical CTCF estimates, the cohesin estimate is less certain. Second, these numbers represent averages (e.g. we averaged over different cell cycle phases, and protein abundance can vary significantly between phases of the cell cycle and even between genetically identical cells, as visible by the biological cell-to-cell heterogeneity of CTCF abundance in U2OS C32 cells determined by FCS-calibrated imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>)). Third, although it remains unclear how ChIP-Seq peak strength relates to time-averaged occupancy, the wide distribution of CTCF ChIP-Seq read counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) suggests that some CTCF binding sites will be occupied most of the time, while other sites are rarely bound (i.e. 50% is an average). Fourth, the density of extruding cohesin complexes is unlikely to be uniform across the genome (e.g. due to uneven loading or obstacles to cohesin extrusion by other large DNA-binding protein complexes) and our estimate is only an upper bound. Fifth, although we have previously shown that CTCF and cohesin interact as a dynamic complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), we are currently unable to accurately estimate what fraction of chromatin-bound CTCF proteins are directly interacting with cohesin. This is an important aspect for future research, as it will constrain loop extrusion models further.</p><p>Although knowing the absolute in vivo abundance of a protein is crucial for understanding its function, methods for determining absolute protein abundances tend to be inconvenient and labor-intensive (e.g. the ‘in-gel’ fluorescence method in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) and/or require extensive and sophisticated experimental and computational infrastructure (e.g. FCS-calibrated imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>) or quantitative mass spectrometry (Ref: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holzmann et al., 2019</xref>, also submitted to eLife)). As a consequence, absolute abundance measurements are currently limited to a subset of cellular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Walther et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we introduce and validate a simple FCM-based method using U2OS C32 Halo-CTCF as a standard for absolute protein quantification in live cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). We will freely share the cell lines described here as standards for absolute quantifications of any Halo-tagged protein of interest. Given that our FCM-based method is simple, fast and convenient, we hope that it will find widespread use for accurate quantification of absolute protein abundances.</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">U2OS</td><td valign="top">(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td valign="top">U2OS</td><td valign="top">Wild-type U2OS cell line.

The SNAPf-Tag is an optimized version of the SNAP-Tag, and we purchased a plasmid encoding this gene from NEB (NEB, Ipswich, MA, #N9183S). We transfected mESCs with Lipofectamine 3000 (ThermoFisher L3000015) according to manufacturer’s protocol, co-transfecting a Cas9 and a repair plasmid (2 μg repair vector and 1 μg Cas9 vector per well in a 6-well plate; 1:2 w/w). The Cas9 plasmid was slightly modified from that distributed from the Zhang lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ran et al., 2013</xref>): 3xFLAG-SV40NLS-pSpCas9 was expressed from a CBh promoter; the sgRNA was expressed from a U6 promoter; and mVenus was expressed from a PGK promoter.

Band intensities were quantified using Image Lab (Bio-Rad).

Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), using ChIP-Seq we found 68,077 MACS2-called peaks in wild-type mESCs and 74,374 peaks in C59 FLAG-Halo-mCTCF/mRad21-SNAP<sub>f</sub>-V5 double knock-in mESCs. If we take the mean, this corresponds to ~ 71,200 CTCF-binding sites in vivo. This is per haploid genome. An ‘average’ mouse embryonic stem cell is halfway through the cell cycle and thus contains three genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>). In total, an ‘average’ mES cell therefore contains ~ 213,600 CTCF-binding sites. Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), we found that 48.9% and 49.3% of Halo-mCTCF molecules were bound to cognate binding sites in the C59 and C87 cell lines (two independent clones where CTCF has been homozygously Halo-Tagged), respectively. This corresponds to a mean of 49.1%. The average number of Halo-mCTCF molecules per cell was 215,200 ± 3400 and 219,200 ± 990 in the C59 and C87 cell lines, respectively (mean across ‘in-gel’ fluorescence and FCM estimates ± standard deviation). This corresponds to a mean of ~ 217,200 molecules per cell. Thus, the average occupancy (i.e. fraction of time the site is occupied) per CTCF binding site is:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>mCTCF</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.491</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mn>217200</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mn>71200</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0.499</mml:mn></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, an average CTCF binding site is bound by CTCF ~ 50% of the time in mES cells. Note, that this analysis assumes that all binding sites are equally likely to be occupied. Most likely, some of the sites will exhibit substantially higher and lower fractional occupancy as suggested by <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> (i.e. some sites may be occupied essentially all of the time, whereas others only rarely).</p><p>Within the context of the loop extrusion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fudenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sanborn et al., 2015</xref>), it is crucial to know the average density of extruding cohesin complexes (e.g. number of extruding cohesins per Mb). We found the average number of mRad21-Halo molecules per JM8.N4 mES cell to be ~ 109,400 ± 31,700 (mean across ‘in-gel’ fluorescence and FCM estimates ± standard deviation; note the significant uncertainty in this estimate). Previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>), we found 39.8% of mRad21-Halo molecules to be topologically bound to chromatin in G1 phase and 49.8% in S/G2-phase. After DNA replication begins in S-phase, cohesin adopts multiple functions other than loop extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skibbens, 2016</xref>). Thus, we will use 39.8% as an estimate of the upper bound of the fraction of cohesin molecules that are topologically engaged and involved in loop extrusion throughout the cell cycle. The estimated size of the inbred C57BL/6J mouse genome, the strain background from which the JM8.N4 mES cell line is derived, is 2716 Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Waterston et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, using single-molecule tracking we found that essentially all endogenously tagged mRad21-Halo protein is incorporated into cohesin complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>). Accordingly, we can assume that the number of Rad21 molecules per cell corresponds to the number of cohesin complexes per cell. Thus, we get an average density of ‘loop extruding’ cohesin complexes of (assuming again, that an ‘average’ cell contains three genomes):<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>mRad21</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.398</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mn>109400</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>3</mml:mn><mml:mo>∙</mml:mo><mml:mn>2716</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mtext>Mb</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>5.34</mml:mn> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>molecules</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>Mb</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Thus, on average each megabase of chromatin contains 5.34 loop extruding cohesin molecules. We note that it is still not clear whether cohesin functions as a single ring or as a pair of rings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Skibbens, 2016</xref>). Thus, if cohesin functions as a single ring, the estimated average density is 5.34 extruding cohesins per Mb and if cohesin functions as a pair, the estimated average density is 2.67 extruding cohesin complexes per Mb. We also note that it is currently unclear whether or not the density of extruding cohesins is likely to be uniform across the genome. Finally, here we have assumed that the cohesin subpopulation we observed by single-molecule live-cell imaging to be relatively stably associated with chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>) is entirely engaged in loop extrusion. However, this may not be the case and this estimate should therefore be interpreted as an upper bound, since the true fraction is not known.</p></sec><sec id="s3-10"><title>Flow-cytometry-based absolute abundance of Halo-tagged cell lines</title><p>To obtain the absolute abundance of the Halo-Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Teves et al., 2016</xref>) and Halo-TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Teves et al., 2018</xref>) cell lines, we grew them side-by-side with the U2OS C32 Halo-CTCF knock-in cell line.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Architectural Features of 3D Genome Organization Revealed by Counting CTCF and Cohesin Molecules&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including David J Sherratt as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript provides quantitative abundance estimates of the cohesin subunit Rad21 and of the architectural protein CTCF. When validated these are invaluable to the chromatin organization field and for the modelling of genome folding and loop extrusion processes. The manuscript also proposes novel methods to quantify absolute protein abundancy in living cells. Nevertheless, better validation of the methods and discussion of their limitations is required. In places the manuscript contains 'over-selling' and 'over-interpretation', combined in places with a lack of clarity and failure to discuss the field incisively.</p><p>Our agreed consensus is to ask you for a revised submission based on the comments below. All three of us are of the opinion that there is potentially important and useful material in the manuscript, but that significant revision is required if it is to be published in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Clarity/over-interpretation</p><p>1) Regarding the Title of the manuscript, we didn't see which 'Architectural features' have been revealed by the work. 'Quantitative features…' would be better. Furthermore, the work does not address directly '3D organisation'. A simple accurate title would do the work justice.</p><p>2) In the Introduction, the authors don't quite correctly cite the recent work on cohesin depletion. Schwarzer et al., did not deplete cohesin itself, but like Haarhuis et al., rather depleted a subunit of the cohesin loader complex. Both these papers should be cited appropriately.</p><p>3) One reviewer felt that 'CTCF boundary permeability' is an inappropriate term for the Abstract without explanation of what this esoteric term means. A second reviewer was of the opinion that the work did not directly address CTCF boundary permeability as stated in the Abstract. The reviewer states: 'to determine boundary permeability, one would need to do either in vitro experiments that assess cohesin passage, or otherwise perform detailed genomic analysis of TAD boundary strength; experiments beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p><p>4) Similarly, the reviewers were concerned that the absolute numbers of Rad21 taken together with the fraction that was stably bound (previous work) was distilled into a statement concerning 'the number of cohesins that are extruding loops'. We do not understand the basis of this statement, since 'loop extrusion' is not assayed or directly addressed in the manuscript. Stably DNA-bound cohesin could be doing anything, and in other cases maybe even be doing nothing (e.g. if it stops translocating at appropriately paired CTCF-bound CTCF sites). Given the data, it is premature to make assumptions on the amount of extruding cohesin complexes. The authors work beautifully determines the upper limit for this number, as we now know that are no more than a certain number of complexes per cell. The authors should phrase the text accordingly and should not say that they have 'determined the density of extruding cohesins', as they do in the Abstract and in the main text.</p><p>5) One thing that is missing is determination of (or discussion of) the fraction of cohesin molecules that are associated with CTCF at CTCF sites (wasn't this information potentially accessible using the methods here; for example, using co-immunoprecipitation?).</p><p>6) Overall, the manuscript needs finessing with care to avoid over-interpretation and repetition (e.g. the statement 'In the context of the loop extrusion model, is repeated at least twice). In places it is not clear whether bound CTCF or bound cohesin is being talked about; for example, in subsection “Absolute CTCF/cohesin quantification and implications for 3D genome organization”, occupancy by what? (I presume CTCF?) – this needs to be stated explicitly.</p><p>Cohesin oligomers?</p><p>This is a contentious and much debated issue, except for the <italic>E. coli</italic> SMC complex MukBEF, in which the dimeric kleisin provides the basis for the inferred dimer of dimer complexes in vivo. The authors show by co-immunoprecipitation experiments of endogenously tagged Rad21 that a significant fraction of Tagged Rad21 can form dimers or multimers (assessed by co-immunoprecipitation with unlabelled or differentially tagged Rad21) or be in complexes with other proteins, where separate and potentially non-interacting cohesin monomers are co-immunoprecipitated?. The statement: 'this demonstrates that Rad21 either directly or indirectly self-associates in a protein-mediated and biochemically stable manner consistent with dimers or higher order oligomers' is just about OK, although the authors veer towards a model that this likely means functional cohesin dimers, when as best as can be ascertained this could have resulted from single rings interacting independently with other proteins (CTCF?). The issue needs better and more incisive discussion that takes into account other published work. Haering et al., (2002, Figure 6) previously found that budding yeast cohesin rarely if ever forms dimers. They also used endogenously tagged alleles. How do the authors explain their own quite different results? A potential scenario is that the IP used in the current manuscript unspecifically pulls along Rad21. A good control would therefore be to side by side include the untagged parental cells. This should yield no Rad21 pull-downs. Furthermore, Ganji et al., (2018) recently found that the related condensin complex extrudes loops as monomers. Considering the structural similarity between cohesin and condensin, it seems intuitively more likely that cohesin also acts as a monomeric complex. The authors should explain how they envisage that cohesin then acts as a dimer, while condensin acts as a monomer. One possibility could for example be that cohesin dimers/multimers do sometimes exist, but that they play no role in loop formation-perhaps they are found at stalled cohesin-CTCF complexes? If the authors wish to make a strong case for the dimer hypothesis, it would be necessary to additionally show cohesin dimers by using a different method, particularly since oligomerization has only been probed on V5-tagged protein. Therefore, repeating the experiments with a different couple of tags, or probing oligomerization by a different method could strengthen this point of the manuscript. Could the authors use fluorescence fluctuation measurements (e.g. Numbers and Brightness analysis or Photon Counting Histogram analysis) on Halo-Tagged cohesin? This could also provide quantitative estimates on the fraction of cohesin molecules engaged in oligomers.</p><p>Validation and assumptions</p><p>1) In subsection 'A simple general method for counting Halo-tagged proteins in living cells', the authors do not provide sufficient data supporting the reliability of the proposed method. The text does not discuss that abundance of proteins can change throughout the cell cycle. Therefore, the method has the same limitation as other ensemble methods, unless cells are sorted into different cell cycle stages, or single-cell microscopy is used-this could be a useful discussion point?</p><p>2) At a minimum, the authors should apply the method described in Figure 3 to compare the copy number of two proteins that they already measured with another method. For example, the authors could use the c45 (mRAD21-Halo) cell line as a standard, and apply the method of Figure 3 to the c87 (Halo-CTCF) cell line, in order to verify that the &quot;in-gel fluorescence&quot; and the &quot;live-cell&quot; method can provide comparable estimates for the number of CTCF molecules/cell. Also, it is not clear from the text whether the authors tried to quantify the <italic>Sox2</italic> protein number by both flow-cytometry and by microscopy. If yes, the authors should mention how the estimated protein number by these two methods differ. If not, they should only describe the experiments they actually did, and maybe comment in the Discussion section about the possible extension of the proposed method using other approaches (e.g. cell cytometry vs. live microscopy) – also considering that the dynamic range of these two methods is expected to be different.</p><p>3) Additional control experiments should be performed in order to test the reliability of the novel methods introduced and applied in this manuscript. For example, in the text that relates to Figure 1, the authors use the fluorescent signal from a bright fluorescent ligand (JF646) to quantify the protein copy number of endogenous proteins tagged with HaloTag via genome editing. The authors claim that previous work has shown that JF646 labelling is &quot;quantitative&quot; in living cells, but it seems that in the cited paper (Yoon et al., 2016) the fluorescent ligand is only used in a quantitative way to estimate relative changes in expression, with no real proof of its reliability for estimating absolute numbers of proteins. Importantly, the authors should cross-validate the proposed method using an established approach in the same cell line, for example by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. At least the authors could show what are the minimum and maximum protein copy numbers measured in the cellular population and how they relate with the dynamic range in endogenous protein expression measured for example by immunofluorescence or fluorescence cytometry on the non-labelled protein population.</p><p>4) Did the authors check if the HaloTag sequence interfere with transcription, RNA stability, protein synthesis, protein degradation? Any of these processes can influence the protein copy number. At minimum the authors should show by quantitative Western Blotting that the amount of HaloTag-CTCF in the gene-edited cell line is identical to the amount of non-tagged CTCF in the parental cell-line.</p><p>5) How can the authors be sure that all the protein is extracted and detected following cell lysis? How can the authors be sure that all the protein is labelled by the JF646 fluorescent ligand? Interestingly the authors used 500nM ligand to label cellular CTCF, while a previous paper from another group using HaloTag labelling (Mazza et al., 2012 – Supplementary Figure 1) estimated that at this concentration only about 80% of a relatively low abundancy protein such as p53 is labelled by a similar concentration of TMR. The authors could titrate the concentration of fluorescent ligand added to the cells to identify a saturating concentration. The same concerns could potentially apply whenever the methods would be used on a different protein or in a different cell line. For example, the membrane permeability to the ligand might be cell-dependent and the degradation rate of different proteins could be differently affected by the presence of a tag. It would be therefore useful to the scientific community if the authors could discuss the list of controls that would be needed when applying their method to a novel target.</p><p>6) The authors assume that on average a cycling cell is halfway through the cell cycle, and that on average cells therefore have 3 copies of the genome. For mES cells which are mainly in S phase, and whose G1 and G2 are both short, this assumption may well be correct. But the authors also measure the amount of CTCF in U2OS cells, which spend most of their time in G1, and also aren't diploid. Since the authors suggest that their method can be widely applied, it would be good if they could normalise the absolute abundance of the factor of interest relative to DNA content, for example by using appropriate staining in the FACS analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40164.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Our agreed consensus is to ask you for a revised submission based on the comments below.

A simple accurate title would do the work justice.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the Title to “Determining cellular CTCF and cohesin abundances to constrain 3D genome models”. We believe the evidence that CTCF and cohesin are involved in regulating 3D genome organization is quite strong and knowing their abundances constrains 3D genome models. We hope this is OK, but we are happy to change it and also happy to take suggestions. We found it difficult to settle on a title that simultaneously captures all aspects of the work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In the Introduction, the authors don't quite correctly cite the recent work on cohesin depletion. Schwarzer et al., did not deplete cohesin itself, but like Haarhuis et al., rather depleted a subunit of the cohesin loader complex. Both these papers should be cited appropriately.</p></disp-quote><p>In the interest of brevity and simplicity, we did not explicitly state that Schwarzer only indirectly depleted cohesin from chromatin by conditional knock-out of NIPBL. We have now corrected this and included a more lengthy and verbose summary of the previous results from Schwarzer, Wutz and Haarhuis on NIPBL, MAU2 and WAPL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) One reviewer felt that 'CTCF boundary permeability' is an inappropriate term for the Abstract without explanation of what this esoteric term means. A second reviewer was of the opinion that the work did not directly address CTCF boundary permeability as stated in the Abstract. The reviewer states: 'to determine boundary permeability, one would need to do either in vitro experiments that assess cohesin passage, or otherwise perform detailed genomic analysis of TAD boundary strength; experiments beyond the scope of the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed all mentions of “boundary permeability” from the manuscript. We now just stick to “CTCF binding site occupancy” in the Abstract and “In the context of the loop extrusion model, this suggests that the time-averaged occupancy of an average CTCF boundary site by CTCF is ~50% (Figure 1G) – that is, an extruding cohesin will be blocked ~50% of the time at an average CTCF site in the simplest version of the loop extrusion model.” in the main text. We hope that the new phrasing is both simpler and clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Similarly, the reviewers were concerned that the absolute numbers of Rad21 taken together with the fraction that was stably bound (previous work) was distilled into a statement concerning 'the number of cohesins that are extruding loops'. We do not understand the basis of this statement, since 'loop extrusion' is not assayed or directly addressed in the manuscript. Stably DNA-bound cohesin could be doing anything, and in other cases maybe even be doing nothing (e.g if it stops translocating at appropriately paired CTCF-bound CTCF sites). Given the data, it is premature to make assumptions on the amount of extruding cohesin complexes. The authors work beautifully determines the upper limit for this number, as we now know that are no more than a certain number of complexes per cell. The authors should phrase the text accordingly and should not say that they have 'determined the density of extruding cohesins', as they do in the Abstract and in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out and agree that we should have more clearly stated the limitations and assumptions in the main text instead of just in the Materials and methods section and we have completely re-written this part. It remains unclear if mammalian cohesin is capable of loop extrusion and we attempted to make clear that this is an assumption by writing “In the context of the loop extrusion model” etc. But we now explicitly state that the chromatin-associated cohesin fraction can only be considered an upper bound and that extruding cohesins are “putative”. In the Abstract we now write: “Extending our previous imaging studies (Hansen et al., 2017), we estimate bounds on the density of putatively DNA loop-extruding cohesin complexes and CTCF binding site occupancy …”. And in the main text we write: “For cohesin, we previously estimated the fraction of cohesin complexes that are relatively stably associated with chromatin (~20-25 min residence time in mESC G1) and thus presumably topologically engaged to be ~40% in G1 (Hansen et al., 2017). If we take this as the upper bound of putatively “loop-extruding” cohesin complexes, we can similarly calculate the upper limit on the density of extruding cohesin molecules as ~5.4 per Mb assuming cohesin exists as a monomeric ring …”. We have further clarified and specified the text in the Materials and methods as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) One thing that is missing is determination of (or discussion of) the fraction of cohesin molecules that are associated with CTCF at CTCF sites (wasn't this information potentially accessible using the methods here; for example, using co-immunoprecipitation?).</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important but complicated question. First, our previous <italic>eLife</italic> manuscript (Hansen et al., 2017) showed that CTCF and cohesin bind chromatin with residence times that differ by about an order of magnitude. Therefore, the CTCF-cohesin complex that is formed cannot be a stable complex. In that paper, we showed by CoIP and super-resolution 2-color dSTORM imaging that CTCF and cohesin indeed significantly associate with each other consistent with complex formation, but technical issues prevented us (and continue to prevent us) from accurately quantifying this. Given the dynamic nature of CTCF binding on chromatin in cells and the fact that in vitro CoIP experiments only capture a fraction of in vivo CTCF-cohesin interactions, we do not feel comfortable making a quantitative estimate of which fraction of chromatin-bound CTCF proteins are directly interacting with cohesin. We now explicitly state this limitation in the main text: “although we have previously shown that CTCF and cohesin interact as a dynamic complex (Hansen et al., 2017), we are currently unable to accurately estimate what fraction of chromatin-bound CTCF proteins are directly interacting with cohesin.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Overall, the manuscript needs finessing with care to avoid over-interpretation and repetition (e.g. the statement 'In the context of the loop extrusion model, is repeated at least twice). In places it is not clear whether bound CTCF or bound cohesin is being talked about; for example, in subsection “Absolute CTCF/cohesin quantification and implications for 3D genome organization”, occupancy by what? (I presume CTCF?) – this needs to be stated explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have comprehensively re-written most sections of the manuscript and we hope that the quality of our writing has improved. We have changed the sentence referred to by the reviewer to: “, this suggests that the time-averaged occupancy of an average CTCF boundary site by CTCF is ~50% (Figure 1G) – that is, an extruding cohesin will be blocked ~50% of the time at an average CTCF site in the simplest version of the loop extrusion model.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cohesin oligomers?</p><p>This is a contentious and much debated issue, except for the <italic>E. coli</italic> SMC complex MukBEF, in which the dimeric kleisin provides the basis for the inferred dimer of dimer complexes in vivo. […] Could the authors use fluorescence fluctuation measurements (e.g. Numbers and Brightness analysis or Photon Counting Histogram analysis) on Halo-Tagged cohesin? This could also provide quantitative estimates on the fraction of cohesin molecules engaged in oligomers.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise several issues, which we have addressed in 3 ways: (1) we have significantly toned down our interpretation of what our CoIP experiments mean for cohesin architecture; (2) We included an extensive discussion of the previous literature on SMC complex architecture (in the Discussion section, since this inevitably gets speculative); (3) we have performed additional control experiments (Figure 2—figure supplement 1), that rule out the possibility “that the IP used in the current manuscript unspecifically pulls along Rad21”.</p><p>1) Regarding toning down, we now write “This demonstrates that Rad21 either directly or indirectly self-associates in a protein-mediated and biochemically stable manner, consistent with cohesin forming dimers or higher order oligomers in vivo. However, this observation does not implicate that cohesin dimers or oligomers are a functional state of loop-extruding cohesin complexes.” And “Thus, while these results cannot exclude that some or even a majority of mammalian cohesin exists as a single-ring (Figure 2A), they do suggest that a measureable population may exist as dimers or oligomers. Whether this subpopulation represents handcuff-like dimers, oligomers (Figure 2A), cohesin clusters (Hansen et al., 2017) or an alternative state (e.g. single rings bridged by another factor such as CTCF) will be an important direction for future studies.” And “Our CoIP results show that cohesin can exist in a dimeric and/or oligomeric state in mESCs (Figure 2). These oligomers may also be arising from cohesin clusters, which we previously observed with super-resolution microscopy (Hansen et al., 2017), or even from larger complexes that contain single ring cohesins which do not directly interact.”.</p><p>2) Regarding including a more extensive discussion of the literature: we have now included it in the Discussion section. Briefly: we believe the evidence that bacterial condensin can dimerize (Badrinarayanan, 2012, Fennell-Fezzie, 2005, Matoba, 2005, Woo, 2009) and extrude loops presumably as a handcuff dimer (Wang, 2017) is quite strong. At the same time, there is also very strong evidence that budding yeast condensin can extrude loops as a single ring (Ganji, 2017). Since mammalian cohesin is quite different from both bacterial condensin and budding yeast condensin, we believe that the only thing we can say with certainty from the previous literature is that both monomeric and dimeric SMC complexes are plausible. For budding yeast, CoIPs could not detect cohesin dimers (Hearing, 2002). For mammalian cohesin, one CoIP study reported dimers (Zhang, 2008) and another CoIP study failed to detect them (Hauf, 2005). Both used over-expressed cohesin subunits, which we previously showed can cause artifacts (Hansen et al., 2017). To the best of our knowledge, our study is the first to test for cohesin self-CoIP using endogenously tagged cohesin subunits in mammalian cells. We believe that the new Discussion section takes into account most prior work and interprets the CoIP (Figure 2) experiments in a very cautious and conservative manner.</p><p>3) Regarding the CoIP specificity, first of all we would like to point out that although we only engineered mESCs to tag one Rad21 allele with FLAG and the other with the V5 peptide, we probed self-interaction using both FLAG and reciprocal V5 pull-downs. Each pull-down was repeated with antibodies raised in two different species (i.e., mouse and rabbit) and in two different mESC clonal lines (B4 in Figure 2 and A2 in Figure 2—figure supplement 1D). The results from all these experiments are consistent with a protein-mediated cohesin self-interaction. To address the reviewers' concern that our IP protocol unspecifically pulls along Rad21 we now include extensive control experiments in Figure 2—figure supplement 1. These probe specificity and cross-reactivity of all the antibodies used in this study. One antibody (the rabbit anti-FLAG previously used in Figure 2F and now replaced with a mouse anti-FLAG) seems to pull-down non-specifically wild type, untagged Rad21, and was thus excluded from further experiments and analyses. We thank the reviewers for prompting these additional and critical controls.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Validation and assumptions</p><p>1) In the section 'A simple general method for counting Halo-tagged proteins in living cells', the authors do not provide sufficient data supporting the reliability of the proposed method. The text does not discuss that abundance of proteins can change throughout the cell cycle. Therefore, the method has the same limitation as other ensemble methods, unless cells are sorted into different cell cycle stages, or single-cell microscopy is used-this could be a useful discussion point?</p></disp-quote><p>If our method came across as “claiming to be better than ensemble methods”, this was not our intention. It is not. Cells from bacterial to mammalian are well known to exhibit considerable cell-to-cell variation in gene expression (also referred to as “noise”), which can be due to cell cycle differences but also due to the fact that gene expression is an inherently stochastic process. We now explicitly state this limitation in the main text: “these numbers represent averages (e.g. we averaged over different cell cycle phases, and protein abundance can vary significantly between phases of the cell cycle and even between genetically identical cells).” Nevertheless, we believe that knowing the average abundance of a protein per cell is still useful.</p><p>Second, the reviewers asked for better validation of the method. To do this, we approached the Ellenberg lab, experts in using FCS-calibrated imaging for absolute protein abundance estimates. Our “in-gel” fluorescence estimate of CTCF abundance in U2OS cells was 104,900+/-14,600. Their FCS-based estimate (101 single cells; 4 replicates) was 114,600+/-10,200. Thus, two completely orthogonal methods performed on different continents by different scientists yield identical results within error. When we test the two mESC C59 and C87 Halo-CTCF cell lines using the U2OS line as a standard for flow cytometry-based quantification, we similarly get convergent results (Figure 1E-F). We believe these new experiments provide strong validation of the proposed method used in Figure 3.</p><p>Nevertheless, when we apply the method to mESC C45 Rad21-Halo, our flow cytometry (FCM) and “in-gel” estimates do differ to some extent and we explicitly state this in the main text: “For mESC C45 Rad21-Halo, the FCM estimate of 131,800 +/- 12,600 proteins/cell differed more from the “in-gel” fluorescence estimate of 86,900 +/- 35,600, but was still just within error. We speculate that this discrepancy could be due to poorer Rad21-Halo protein stability during the biochemical steps of the &quot;in-gel&quot; fluorescence method. We again take the mean of the two methods, ~109,400 Rad21 proteins per cell, as our final, though less certain, estimate of Rad21 abundance in mESCs.”</p><p>Finally, it has also become clear to us that using a mESC line as a standard is not optimal because embryonic stem cell culture is much more specialized (e.g. if a user is not experienced with ES cell culture, it is easy to accidentally differentiate the cells). We have therefore switched to using the U2OS C32 Halo-CTCF cell line as the standard in Figure 3 since it is validated by FCS-calibrated imaging and more convenient to grow. We note that the <italic>Sox2</italic> and TBP estimates have now changed significantly, but we feel much more confident in the new estimates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) At a minimum, the authors should apply the method described in Figure 3 to compare the copy number of two proteins that they already measured with another method. For example, the authors could use the c45 (mRAD21-Halo) cell line as a standard, and apply the method of Figure 3 to the c87 (Halo-CTCF) cell line, in order to verify that the &quot;in-gel fluorescence&quot; and the &quot;live-cell&quot; method can provide comparable estimates for the number of CTCF molecules/cell. Also, it is not clear from the text whether the authors tried to quantify the Sox2 protein number by both flow-cytometry and by microscopy. If yes, the authors should mention how the estimated protein number by these two methods differ. If not, they should only describe the experiments they actually did, and maybe comment in the Discussion section about the possible extension of the proposed method using other approaches (e.g. cell cytometry vs. live microscopy) – also considering that the dynamic range of these two methods is expected to be different.</p></disp-quote><p>It’s a great suggestion and we have done this. We have now used the live-cell flow cytometry (FCM) method to quantify all the mESC lines (new Figure 1E-F). For CTCF they give highly similarly results to the “in-gel” fluorescence method, but for Rad21 they differ more, still just within error. We performed 4 replicates, which are shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 3.</p><p>Regarding microscopy (instead of FCM), we just meant that it was a possibility (after all, they are just different ways of reading out fluorescence). But we agree, that since we did not perform these experiments also using microscopy, we have removed all mentions of microscopy.</p><p>We believe our new FCM experiments and our new FCS-calibrated imaging experiments have fully addressed this point by providing validation through an orthogonal method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional control experiments should be performed in order to test the reliability of the novel methods introduced and applied in this manuscript. For example, in the text that relates to Figure 1, the authors use the fluorescent signal from a bright fluorescent ligand (JF646) to quantify the protein copy number of endogenous proteins tagged with HaloTag via genome editing. The authors claim that previous work has shown that JF646 labelling is &quot;quantitative&quot; in living cells, but it seems that in the cited paper (Yoon et al., 2016) the fluorescent ligand is only used in a quantitative way to estimate relative changes in expression, with no real proof of its reliability for estimating absolute numbers of proteins. Importantly, the authors should cross-validate the proposed method using an established approach in the same cell line, for example by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy or mass spectrometry. At least the authors could show what are the minimum and maximum protein copy numbers measured in the cellular population and how they relate with the dynamic range in endogenous protein expression measured for example by immunofluorescence or fluorescence cytometry on the non-labelled protein population.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern in two ways. First, the reviewers suggested Fluorescence Correlation Spectroscopy (FCS) as an orthogonal method of cross-validation. To do this, we approached the Ellenberg lab, who are experts in using FCS-calibrated imaging for absolute protein abundance estimates. Our “in-gel” fluorescence estimate of CTCF abundance in U2OS cells was 104,900+/-14,600. Their FCS-based estimate (101 single cells; 4 replicates) was 114,600+/-10,200. Thus, two completely orthogonal methods performed on different continents by different scientists yield identical results within error, which we believe provides validation for the “in-gel” fluorescence method of Figure 1A-B (the Ellenberg lab separately provided extensive validation for their FCS method). Second, we have performed a titration experiment to estimate the live-cell labeling efficiency of Halo-JF<sub>646</sub> (show in in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C). At the 500 nM concentration we used, we estimate ~&gt;90% labeling efficiency.</p><p>Finally, in our hands, immunofluorescence is not very robust and also not very generalizable (due to antibody idiosyncrasies), but we have estimated the dynamic range from Flow Cytometry by also measuring non-labeled cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1). Based on these we estimate that for very lowly expressed proteins (below ~10,000 proteins/cell), our flow cytometry method may not be sufficiently sensitive and now explicitly state this limitation in the text: “Although this method should be generally applicable, we note that it may not be robust for very lowly expressed proteins (below ~10,000 proteins per cell; Figure 3—figure supplement 1)”. Within the biologically plausible range (below many millions of proteins per cell), we do not believe our method has an upper limit on protein abundance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Did the authors check if the HaloTag sequence interfere with transcription, RNA stability, protein synthesis, protein degradation? Any of these processes can influence the protein copy number. At minimum the authors should show by quantitative Western Blotting that the amount of HaloTag-CTCF in the gene-edited cell line is identical to the amount of non-tagged CTCF in the parental cell-line.</p></disp-quote><p>These are all excellent points, which we addressed in our previous work (Hansen et al., 2017). But we agree that we should have referred to this in this paper and have now done so by writing “We showed that these cell lines express the tagged proteins at endogenous levels by quantitative Western blotting, (Hansen et al., 2017)”. Below, we mention some of the control experiments we presented in the 2017 paper upon which the present paper builds as a Research Advance:</p><p>Untagged and homozygously tagged protein levels for CTCF and Rad21 are similar within experimental error in both mESCs and human U2OS cells: Hansen, 2017 Figure 1—figure supplement 3B.</p><p>Tagged CTCF and cohesin CoIP as efficiently as untagged proteins: Hansen et al., 2017 Figure 1G.</p><p>Endogenously tagging both CTCF and cohesin in mESCs barely affects their chromatin binding behavior as assayed using ChIP-seq (Hansen et al., 2017 Figure 1E-F; Hansen et al., 2017 Figure 1—figure supplement 4 and Figure 1—figure supplement 5).</p><p>Endogenously tagging both CTCF and cohesin in mESCs does not affect pluripotency as assayed using a teratoma assay (Hansen et al, 2017 Figure 1—figure supplement 2) nor does it affect at the RNA level the expression of key pluripotency genes (Hansen et al., 2017 Figure 1—figure supplement 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) How can the authors be sure that all the protein is extracted and detected following cell lysis? How can the authors be sure that all the protein is labelled by the JF646 fluorescent ligand? Interestingly the authors used 500nM ligand to label cellular CTCF, while a previous paper from another group using HaloTag labelling (Mazza et al., 2012 – Supplementary Figure 1) estimated that at this concentration only about 80% of a relatively low abundancy protein such as p53 is labelled by a similar concentration of TMR. The authors could titrate the concentration of fluorescent ligand added to the cells to identify a saturating concentration. The same concerns could potentially apply whenever the methods would be used on a different protein or in a different cell line. For example, the membrane permeability to the ligand might be cell-dependent and the degradation rate of different proteins could be differently affected by the presence of a tag. It would be therefore useful to the scientific community if the authors could discuss the list of controls that would be needed when applying their method to a novel target.</p></disp-quote><p>To estimate the labeling efficiency using Halo-JF<sub>646</sub>, we performed a titration experiment as suggested by the reviewers and we estimate that we are getting at least 90% labeling (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C). The 2012 Mazza paper is a classic landmark paper in the SPT field, but direct comparison of the labeling efficiencies are difficult. First, that paper used transient transfection, which is known to result in huge cell-to-cell variation and also in high day-to-day transfection efficiency variation. Second, close inspection of Supplementary Figure 1G in (Mazza et al., 2012) actually shows 500 nM TMR gave the highest labeling efficiency out of all tested concentrations. Third, Mazza et al., estimates that there are only 600-4,000 p53 proteins present per cell and in the revised manuscript we now state that our robust detection lower limit is around 10,000 proteins per cell. Nevertheless, we agree that we cannot exclude slight undercounting due to incomplete labeling and we now state this: “We note that JF<sub>646</sub>-labeling is near-quantitative in live cells (Yoon et al., 2016); moreover, a titration experiment indicates ≥90% labeling efficiency (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A-C), though we cannot exclude slight undercounting due to incomplete labeling.” As far as we know, Halo-tag dyes work well in all tissue culture cells that have ever been tested as long as the protein is significantly expressed (we even successfully labeled live E4.5 late blastocyst mouse embryo chimeras (Mir et al., 2018)). But we do acknowledge that the “in-gel” fluorescence method may suffer from protein-specific idiosyncrasies such as poor stability, difficulty with full extraction, etc. In fact, we believe that now that we have validated the absolute abundance of Halo-CTCF in U2OS cells using 2 orthogonal methods, the “live-cell” flow cytometry (FCM) method is more robust. As suggested, we now explicitly state this: “Compared to the “in-gel” fluorescence method (Figure 1A-B), we believe this live-cell FCM method is both more convenient and robust, since it avoids cell lysis and other biochemical steps that may affect protein stability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors assume that on average a cycling cell is half-way through the cell cycle, and that on average cells therefore have 3 copies of the genome. For mES cells which are mainly in S phase, and whose G1 and G2 are both short, this assumption may well be correct. But the authors also measure the amount of CTCF in U2OS cells, which spend most of their time in G1, and also aren't diploid. Since the authors suggest that their method can be widely applied, it would be good if they could normalise the absolute abundance of the factor of interest relative to DNA content, for example by using appropriate staining in the FACS analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>First, regarding the mESCs we have now performed cell cycle phase measurements and show that indeed, an average mES cell is approximately halfway through the cell cycle: 10.2% in G1; 73.9% in S-phase; 15.9% in G2. These new experiments and results are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 1D-G.</p><p>Regarding U2OS cells, we disagree with the reviewers; as the reviewers point out the U2OS karyotype is not well-defined. For this reason, we are careful not to estimate the average CTCF binding site occupancy for U2OS cells. We only do this for mESCs. However, this does not mean that knowing the absolute abundance of CTCF proteins per U2OS cell is useless. For example, we show that the nuclear concentration of CTCF in U2OS cells is 144.3 nM. Knowing this number may help interpret DNA binding affinities (K<sub>d</sub>) etc. and may also be useful for other “back-of-the-envelope” calculations. The live-cell flow cytometry absolute quantification method (Figure 3) can be used in any tissue culture cell regardless of karyotype to estimate the total number of proteins per cell. How a researcher will use this number will depend on their research question and we are not in a position to dictate or predict this. Nevertheless, we now state explicitly in the main text that: “We cannot estimate CTCF binding site occupancy and probability of blocking cohesin extrusion in U2OS cells, since these cells have a poorly defined karyotype.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
