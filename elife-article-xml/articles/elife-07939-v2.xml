Structural analyses revealed that the β-hairpin of 40S protein Rps5/uS7 protrudes into the 40S mRNA exit-channel, contacting the eIF2∙GTP∙Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> ternary complex (TC) and mRNA context nucleotides; but its importance in AUG selection was unknown. We identified substitutions in β-strand-1 and C-terminal residues of yeast Rps5 that reduced bulk initiation, conferred ‘leaky-scanning’ of AUGs; and lowered initiation fidelity by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the eIF1 AUG codon to reduce eIF1 abundance. Consistently, the β-strand-1 substitution greatly destabilized the ‘P<sub>IN</sub>’ conformation of TC binding to reconstituted 43S·mRNA complexes in vitro. Other substitutions in β-hairpin loop residues increased initiation fidelity and destabilized P<sub>IN</sub> at UUG, but not AUG start codons. We conclude that the Rps5 β-hairpin is as crucial as soluble initiation factors for efficient and accurate start codon recognition.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07939.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07939.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07939.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>To make a protein, the DNA sequence of a gene is first copied to make an mRNA molecule, which is then translated into a protein by a molecular machine called the ribosome. The first step of translation is known as initiation. Several proteins referred to as initiation factors can bind to the small subunit of the ribosome, which itself is composed of an RNA molecule and numerous proteins, and form a pre-initiation complex (or PIC for short). This complex contains a molecule called initiator tRNA that is specialized for initiation. The PIC then attaches to the mRNA and starts scanning it, searching the sequence for an AUG triplet to serve as the start codon. The sequence immediately surrounding an AUG triplet, known as the context, influences the likelihood of its selection as the start site. When the start codon is recognized by the initiator tRNA in the PIC, the complete ribosome assembles and begins to build the protein. Choosing the correct start codon is crucial to ensure that the correct protein is made from every mRNA in the cell.</p><p>The PIC can adopt an ‘open’ state, which makes it easier to scan the mRNA for the correct start codon and ignore triplets similar in sequence to AUG (like UUG) or AUG triplets in a poor context. Once the correct AUG start codon has been recognized, the PIC changes to a ‘closed’ state, ceases to scan, and assembles the complete ribosome.</p><p>One of the proteins that make up the small ribosomal subunit (called Rps5 in budding yeast) is located near the channel where the mRNA molecule exits the PIC during scanning, and is also thought to be involved in translation initiation. However, the role of Rps5 in recognizing the start codon is poorly understood.</p><p>Visweswaraiah et al. have now studied Rps5—in particular, a region of this protein that adopts a hairpin structure that dips into the exit channel—using genetic and biochemical methods. In mutant yeast cells in which the hairpin structure was mutated, translation initiation was diminished at suboptimal start codons—including a UUG start codon and an AUG codon in poor context—thus making translation initiation more accurate.</p><p>Visweswaraiah et al. then performed experiments on PICs built from purified components to determine how the Rps5 mutations might affect the assembly and stability of the PIC. The results revealed that mutating the upper region of the Rps5 hairpin destabilized the closed state of the PIC when either an AUG or UUG start codon was present in the mRNA. However, other mutations of the hairpin structure destabilized the closed state of the PIC only at a UUG start codon. In both cases, the mutations made the PIC more likely to remain in the open conformation and continue scanning at incorrect or suboptimal start codons, making it more likely that translation begins at the correct AUG start codon.</p><p>These results indicate that the Rps5 hairpin is crucial for both efficiently and accurately recognizing the start codon to begin translation. This suggests that ribosomal proteins not only contribute to ribosome structure but can actively participate with other initiation factors in choosing the correct start sites for protein synthesis on all mRNAs in the cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07939.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07939.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>translation</kwd><kwd>initiation</kwd><kwd>regulation</kwd><kwd>Rps5/uS7</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Intramural Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A structural element of mRNA exit channel protein Rps5 performs a critical role in start codon recognition during translation initiation by stabilizing initiator tRNA binding to the pre-initiation complex.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Accurate identification of the translation initiation codon is critical to ensure synthesis of the correct cellular proteins. In eukaryotic cells this process generally occurs by a scanning mechanism, wherein the small (40S) ribosomal subunit first recruits initiator tRNA (Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub>) in a ternary complex (TC) with eIF2-GTP in a reaction stimulated by eIFs 1, 1A, and 3. The resulting 43S pre-initiation complex (PIC) attaches to the mRNA 5′ end and scans the 5′ UTR for an AUG, using complementarity with the anticodon of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> to identify the start codon and assemble a 48S PIC. Nucleotides immediately surrounding the AUG, particularly the −3 and +4 positions (referred to below as context nucleotides), also influence start codon selection. During scanning, the GTP bound to eIF2 in the TC is hydrolyzed in the 43S PIC in a manner dependent on the GTPase activating protein eIF5, but P<sub>i</sub> release is blocked by eIF1, which also impedes stable binding of Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site. Start codon recognition triggers dissociation of eIF1 from the 40S subunit, which allows interaction between eIF5 and the C-terminal tail (CTT) of eIF1A, P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2-GDP·P<sub>i</sub>, and more stable TC binding in the P site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Subsequent dissociation of eIF2-GDP and other eIFs from the 48S PIC enables eIF5B-catalyzed subunit joining and formation of an 80S initiation complex with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base-paired to AUG in the P site (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07939.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Model describing conformational rearrangements of the PIC during scanning and start codon recognition.</title><p>Assembly of the PIC, scanning and start codon selection in WT cells. (i) eIF1 and the scanning enhancer (SEs) elements in the CTT of eIF1A stabilize an open conformation of the 40S subunit to which the TC loads rapidly. (ii) The 43S PIC in the open conformation scans the mRNA for the start codon with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> bound in the P<sub>OUT</sub> state. The GAP domain in the N-terminal domain of eIF5 (5N) stimulates GTP hydrolysis by the TC to produce GDP•Pi, but release of P<sub>i</sub> is blocked. The unstructured NTT of eIF2β interacts with eIF1 to stabilize eIF1•40S association and the open conformation. (iii) On AUG recognition, Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> moves from the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> state, clashing with eIF1 and the CTT of eIF1A. Movement of eIF1 and the eIF1A CTT away from the P site disrupts eIF1's interaction with eIF2β-NTT, and the latter interacts with the eIF5-CTD. eIF1 dissociates from the 40S subunit, and the eIF5-NTD disengages from eIF2 and interacts with the eIF1A CTT instead, dependent on the SE elements, thereby facilitating P<sub>i</sub> release from eIF2. The eIF5-CTD moves into the position on the 40S subunit previously occupied by eIF1 and blocks reassociation of eIF1. (Below) Arrows summarize that eIF1 and the eIF1A SE elements promote P<sub>OUT</sub> and block transition to the P<sub>IN</sub> state, whereas the scanning inhibitor (SI) element in the NTT of eIF1A stabilizes the P<sub>IN</sub> state.

It promotes an open, scanning-conducive conformation of the PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>) to which TC rapidly loads, bound in a state capable of inspecting successive triplets entering the P site (dubbed P<sub>OUT</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Passmore et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saini et al., 2010</xref>); and it also blocks recognition of near-cognate start codons (e.g., UUG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yoon and Donahue, 1992</xref>) and AUG codons in poor sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pestova and Kolupaeva, 2002</xref>). Hence, eIF1 must dissociate from the 40S subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maag et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheung et al., 2007</xref>) to allow P<sub>i</sub> release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Algire et al., 2005</xref>) and rearrangement to a scanning-incompatible state with Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> base paired with AUG and more tightly bound in the P<sub>IN</sub> conformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Passmore et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saini et al., 2010</xref>). Consistent with this, structural analyses of different PICs reveal that eIF1 and eIF1A promote rotation of the 40S head relative to the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>), which is likely instrumental in TC binding in the P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation, but that eIF1 physically obstructs Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> binding in the P<sub>IN</sub> state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rabl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</xref>). Accordingly, eIF1 is deformed and displaced from its 40S location in the open complex during the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). Consequently, mutations that weaken eIF1 binding to the 40S subunit reduce the rate of TC loading, while elevating initiation at near-cognate codons or AUGs in poor context, by destabilizing the open/P<sub>OUT</sub> conformation and favoring rearrangement to the closed/P<sub>IN</sub> state during scanning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2013</xref>). Moreover, decreasing wild-type (WT) eIF1 abundance reduces initiation accuracy, whereas overexpressing eIF1 suppresses initiation at near cognates or AUGs in poor context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Valasek et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alone et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Saini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>). This tight link between eIF1 abundance and initiation accuracy is exploited to autoregulate eIF1 expression, as the AUG start codon of the eIF1 gene (<italic>SUI1</italic> in yeast) occurs in poor context—a feature conserved throughout eukaryotic evolution—and the frequency of recognizing its own start codon is inversely related to eIF1 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The stability of the codon-anticodon duplex is an important determinant of initiation accuracy, as the rate of the P<sub>OUT</sub> to P<sub>IN</sub> transition and stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state are both favored by AUG vs non-AUG start codons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible that favorable context also contributes to the stability of P<sub>IN</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pisarev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>), but the stimulatory effect of optimum context on initiation rate is not understood at the molecular level. There is evidence that the context nucleotides are recognized by the α-subunit of eIF2, as replacement of heterotrimeric eIF2 with the eIF2βγ heterodimer reduced the efficiency of AUG recognition and diminished the stimulatory effect of optimum context on 48S PIC assembly in a reconstituted mammalian system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pisarev et al., 2006</xref>). Moreover, crosslinking experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pisarev et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sharifulin et al., 2013</xref>) and structural analyses of a mammalian 43S PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hashem et al., 2013</xref>) and a partial yeast (py48S) PIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>) indicate that the N-terminal domain (D1) of eIF2α is in proximity to the −3 nucleotide of the mRNA in the exit channel of the 40S subunit. These and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lomakin and Steitz, 2013</xref>) revealed that the conserved β-hairpin of the 40S protein uS7 (Rps5 in yeast) lies in the vicinity of eIF2α-D1 and the −3 nucleotide of mRNA in reconstituted 43S/48S PICs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>); however, functional evidence that eIF2α-D1 and the Rps5 β-hairpin have important roles in start codon recognition in vivo is lacking.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07939.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Location in the py48S PIC, and sequence conservation, of the Rps5 β-hairpin loop.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Depiction of the partial yeast 48S PIC (PDB 3J81) showing Rps5 (gold), mRNA (orange), Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> (green), eIF2α (purple), eIF2γ (yellow), eIF1 (cyan) and eIF1A (blue).

Substituting Glu-144 (E144) in β-strand 1 of the hairpin, or the proximal C-terminal residue R225 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), confers a marked reduction in the efficiency of AUG recognition.

Analysis in the yeast reconstituted system reveals striking destabilization of the P<sub>IN</sub> state formed at AUG codons by E144R mutant 40S subunits. Substitutions in the loop portion of the Rps5 β-hairpin also destabilize the P<sub>IN</sub> state, but produce this effect selectively for near-cognate UUG start codons, and thereby dampen UUG initiation in vivo.

To test the importance of the Glu144/Arg225 salt-bridge, we constructed the <italic>E144R/R225E</italic> double mutant in which the salt-bridge should be reinstated. This strain displayed a Slg<sup>−</sup> phenotype and increased UUG:AUG ratio similar in magnitude to that of the <italic>R225K</italic> mutant but less severe than seen for the <italic>E144R</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). The fact that combining these mutations did not produce more severe phenotypes than those conferred by <italic>E144R</italic> alone is consistent with the possibility that reinstating the salt-bridge mitigates the effects of the <italic>E144R</italic> single mutation, with the stipulation that the WT identity of E144 or R225 is needed for robust Rps5 function. Thus, although the salt-bridge is reinstated, the substitution of one or both residues still impairs growth and initiation fidelity in the double mutant. Additional experiments are needed to establish the importance of the salt bridge for Rps5 function.</p><p>Mutations in various initiation factors are known that elevate the UUG:AUG ratio and restore translation of mutant <italic>his4-301</italic> mRNA, which lacks the AUG start codon, by enabling initiation at the third, UUG codon, thereby suppressing histidine auxotrophy and conferring a Sui<sup>−</sup> (<underline>Su</underline>ppressor of <underline>i</underline>nitiation codon mutation) phenotype. However, neither <italic>E144R</italic> nor <italic>R225K</italic> suppress the His<sup>−</sup> phenotype of <italic>his4-301</italic> to confer the Sui<sup>−</sup> phenotype. Based on previous observations of Sui<sup>−</sup> mutants, it is possible that the Rps5 substitutions do not elevate the UUG:AUG ratio sufficiently to produce enough <italic>his4-301</italic> product for adequate histidine biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dorris et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Marcos et al., 2013</xref>). For example, the eIF1 mutations <italic>sui1-K37A</italic> and <italic>sui1-R33A</italic> increase the UUG:AUG ratio by 4.8- and 7.7-fold, but only the latter suppresses the His<sup>−</sup> phenotype of <italic>his4-301</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Marcos et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, the Rps5 mutations could interfere with an unknown aspect of histidine biosynthesis or utilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nanda et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Consistent with their Slg<sup>−</sup> phenotypes, <italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> conferred significant reductions in the polysome:monosome (P/M) ratio (p-value &lt;0.0005) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), indicating a reduced rate of bulk translation initiation relative to elongation, with the greater reduction conferred by the mutation (<italic>E144R</italic>) with the stronger Slg<sup>−</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Neither mutant significantly perturbed the ratio of 40S to 60S subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>), suggesting that the initiation defects arise from altered 40S function rather than abnormalities in expression of Rps5, 40S biogenesis, or stability of mature 40S subunits. Thus, it appears that <italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> reduce the function of Rps5 in stimulating the rate of general translation initiation and promoting accurate start codon selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> elevate UUG initiation indirectly by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the <italic>SUI1</italic> start codon and thereby reducing eIF1 abundance</title><p>In addition to increasing initiation from near-cognate UUG codons, certain Sui<sup>−</sup> mutations in eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF2β are known to enhance initiation from AUG codons in poor context.

This test was conducted using the <italic>RPS5</italic> mutant strains harboring sc<italic>SUI1</italic> to compensate for the reduced eIF1 expression responsible for their Sui<sup>−</sup> phenotypes. Introducing <italic>SUI5</italic> on a plasmid conferred the expected His<sup>+</sup>/Sui<sup>−</sup> phenotype in the <italic>his4-301</italic> strain harboring WT <italic>RPS5</italic> and native eIF1 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, compare row 1 with 2).

A <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> reporter was employed with a modified version of upstream ORF1 that is elongated to overlap the <italic>GCN4</italic> ORF (el.uORF1). This construct is ideally suited for this query because virtually all scanning ribosomes normally recognize the uORF1 AUG (uAUG-1), and reinitiation at the downstream AUG of the <italic>GCN4</italic> main ORF following termination of el.uORF1 translation is almost non-existent, so that translation of the main ORF is extremely low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Grant et al., 1994</xref>). Remarkably, <italic>rps5-E144R</italic> confers a dramatic increase in leaky scanning through el.uORF1, elevating <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression by 20-fold for the construct containing optimum context (<sup>−3</sup>AAA<sup>−1</sup>) at uAUG-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, row 1, WT vs <italic>E144R</italic>).

In agreement with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin-Marcos et al., 2014</xref>), TC dissociates very little from WT PICs formed with mRNA(AUG) over the time course of the experiment, yielding a rate constant of only 0.05 hr<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). By contrast, TC dissociation from WT PICs assembled on an otherwise identical mRNA containing a UUG start codon is ∼sevenfold faster (k<sub>off</sub> = 0.34 hr<sup>−1</sup>), reflecting the reduced stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state at this near-cognate start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>). Remarkably, for 43S∙mRNA(AUG) complexes assembled with <italic>E144R</italic> 40S subunits, the dissociation rate was increased ∼36-fold compared to that seen for the corresponding WT complexes (from 0.05 hr<sup>−1</sup> to 1.8 hr<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F</xref>). An even larger increase in k<sub>off</sub> of ∼130-fold was measured for mRNA(UUG) complexes assembled with <italic>E144R</italic> vs WT 40S subunits (≥46 hr<sup>−1</sup> vs 0.34 hr<sup>−1</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,F</xref>). These findings provide strong biochemical evidence that <italic>E144R</italic> destabilizes P<sub>IN</sub> at both AUG and UUG start codons with a relatively stronger effect on the near-cognate triplet, which coincides with the in vivo effects of <italic>E144R</italic> of reducing recognition of the <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG and <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 start codons, and of suppressing UUG initiation on <italic>his4-301</italic> mRNA.</p><p>The rates of TC association (k<sub>on</sub>) were measured by mixing labeled TC with different concentrations of WT or <italic>E144R</italic> 40S subunits and saturating eIF1, eIF1A and mRNA(AUG). Aliquots were removed at different time points, the reactions terminated with excess unlabeled TC, and the amount of labeled TC in PICs was measured by native gel electrophoresis. The slope of the plot of the pseudo-first-order rate constants (k<sub>obs</sub>) for PIC formation vs 40S concentration yields the second-order rate constant (k<sub>on</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolitz et al., 2009</xref>). The k<sub>on</sub> values measured for WT and <italic>E144R</italic> 40S subunits were essentially identical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D,F</xref>), indicating that PICs formed with the mutant ribosomes assemble the P<sub>OUT</sub> complex and rearrange to P<sub>IN</sub> at the same rates achieved with WT ribosomes, and that <italic>rps</italic>-<italic>E144R</italic> primarily reduces the stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state. Calculation of K<sub>d</sub> values using the measured rate constants k<sub>off</sub> and k<sub>on</sub> reveals that <italic>E144R</italic> decreases the affinity of TC for 43S∙mRNA(AUG) complexes by ∼40-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, k<sub>off</sub>/k<sub>on</sub>).

A decreased rate of TC binding derepresses <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression because scanning 40S subunits that have translated uORF1 and resumed scanning can bypass the start codons of the inhibitory uORFs 2–4 before rebinding TC, and then reinitiate further downstream at the <italic>GCN4</italic> AUG codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hinnebusch, 2005</xref>).

In the recent py48S cryo-EM structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>), this domain projects into the mRNA exit channel of the 40S subunit and the hairpin loop approaches the key context nucleotide at the −3 position of mRNA. The β-hairpin also interacts with eIF2α-DI, which mimics an E-site tRNA and contacts the Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Our genetic findings indicate that the E144R substitution in β-strand 1 of the hairpin reduces the rate of bulk translation initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) and dramatically impairs recognition of <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 in optimal context by the scanning PIC, conferring a higher incidence of leaky scanning for the <italic>el.uORF1-GCN4-lacZ</italic> reporter than described thus far for any initiation factor mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elantak et al., 2010</xref>).

This difference could be interpreted to indicate that <italic>E144R</italic> disrupts recognition of optimum context nucleotides, so that its deleterious effect on AUG recognition is dampened when the optimum context nucleotides are absent. However, this interpretation would overlook the fact that it is impossible to detect an increase in leaky scanning of uAUG-1 in poor context by 20-fold, as only a ∼threefold reduction in its recognition yields <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression essentially indistinguishable from that seen in the absence of uAUG-1 itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, cf. constructs <underline>UUU</underline>AUG vs AAA<underline>AGC</underline> in WT cells).

However, one distinctive feature of WT uORF1 and the elongated el.uORF1 contained in our leaky scanning reporter is the absence of typical coding sequences 3′ of the uAUG-1 start codon. WT uORF1 is only 3 codons long, and much of el.uORF1 is derived from non-translated triplets that normally reside between uORF4 and the <italic>GCN4</italic> coding sequence. This region has a relatively low propensity for secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kertesz et al., 2010</xref>), which might enable elongating ribosomes to clear the initiation region more rapidly than occurs with more typical coding sequences. In fact, the properties of the leaky scanning reporter insure that the increases in <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> expression observed in the Rps5 mutants reflect diminished recognition of uAUG-1 relative to the main ORF start codon by scanning PICs. Considering that the <italic>rps5</italic> mutations appear to have no effect on recognition of the main ORF AUG in the <italic>GCN4-lacZ</italic> construct lacking el.uORF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, row 7), the presence of greater secondary structure in the main ORF could reduce the rate of scanning through the initiation region to promote start codon recognition in a way that would be lacking at the el.uORF1 start codon. If elongating ribosomes located in the initiation region can enhance initiation by this mechanism, this could compensate for the reduction in P<sub>IN</sub> stability conferred by <italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> for the <italic>SUI1</italic> and <italic>GCN4</italic> initiation regions in a way that would not occur for el.uORF1, making the latter sensitive to the destabilizing effects of these mutations even with optimum context present. Consistent with this scenario, it was shown recently that the presence of slowly-translated codons near the AUG codon can affect the initiation rate in yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it seems plausible that <italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> decrease the efficiency of start codon recognition only for weak initiation sites, including near-cognate UUG codons and sub-optimal AUG start sites, without reducing recognition of AUG codons in strong context that initiate structured coding sequences.</p><p>The impaired recognition of the native <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG codon and attendant reduced synthesis of eIF1 conferred by the <italic>rps5-E144R</italic> and -<italic>R225K</italic> mutations evokes increased recognition of near-cognate, UUG start codons. While this elevated UUG:AUG initiation ratio is the expected outcome of diminished eIF1 abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ivanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>), previously described Ssu<sup>−</sup> substitutions in eIF1 and eIF1A reduce eIF1 levels by the same mechanism described here—discriminating against the weak context of the native <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG—but they suppress, rather than elevate, the UUG:AUG initiation ratio despite reduced eIF1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, these eIF1 and eIF1A Ssu<sup>−</sup> substitutions appear to have a stronger effect than <italic>rps5-E144R</italic> and -<italic>R225K</italic> in blocking selection of UUG start codons. On the other hand, the eIF1A and eIF1 Ssu<sup>−</sup> substitutions confer much smaller increases in leaky scanning of <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fekete et al., 2007</xref>) (Pilar Martin Marcos and AGH, unpublished observations) compared to that seen here for <italic>rps5-E144R</italic>, thus indicating a relatively greater defect in AUG recognition for the Rps5 mutation.</p><p>In addition to the mutations affecting the upper, structured portion of the β-hairpin loop (<italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic>), we also identified Ssu<sup>−</sup> substitutions in the loop region that discriminate against UUG codons in the presence of Sui<sup>−</sup> substitutions in eIF5 or eIF2β. Consistent with this, an exemplar of such mutations, <italic>rps5-R148E</italic>, specifically destabilized the P<sub>IN</sub> state formed at UUG, but not AUG, start codons in reconstituted PICs in vitro. The Rps5 loop substitutions do not discriminate against the weak context of the <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG codon, nor increase leaky scanning of el.uORF1 even when uAUG-1 resides in poor context, and thus exclusively destabilize PICs lacking a cognate (AUG) start codon. They differ from previously described Ssu<sup>−</sup> substitutions in eIF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Martin-Marcos et al., 2011</xref>) in that the Rps5 substitutions efficiently suppress UUG initiation but do not discriminate against the poor context of the native <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG codon. This distinction might be explained by noting that eIF1 is the principal ‘gate-keeper’ that blocks utilization of weak initiation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hinnebusch, 2014</xref>). As the eIF1 Ssu<sup>−</sup> substitutions delay eIF1 release from the 40S subunit on start codon recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Martin-Marcos et al., 2013</xref>), they might discriminate more broadly against unstable PICs regardless of whether they lack strong context or a perfect codon:anticodon duplex in the P site. Our Rps5 loop substitutions, by contrast, appear to have a more nuanced effect that destabilizes P<sub>IN</sub> only when a mismatch occurs in the codon:anticodon duplex itself. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, our results indicate that both E144 and R148 promote start codon selection by stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state, and the finding that <italic>E144R</italic> reduces initiation at both UUG and sub-optimal AUG codons, while R148E impairs only UUG recognition, can be explained as the result of a relatively stronger contribution of E144 vs R148 to the stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state.</p><p>There are several possibilities to explain how perturbing the Rps5 β-hairpin destabilizes the P<sub>IN</sub> state and reduces start codon recognition. The proximity of the hairpin loop to the E site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) suggests a disruption of Rps5 contacts with the context nucleotides in mRNA. Indeed, R156 in the loop interacts with the backbone of rRNA helix 23, which in turn contacts the −3 context nucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). If this interaction promotes the P<sub>IN</sub> state, it would help explain why loop residue substitutions impair recognition of UUG start codons (Ssu<sup>−</sup> phenotype). However, except for the lethal substitution G151S, all of the substitutions affecting loop residues we examined—G151 through Q158—have weaker phenotypes compared to the E144R substitution in β-strand 1 of the hairpin itself, distant from the context nucleotides. Thus, perhaps structural alteration of the β-hairpin by E144R indirectly perturbs the conformation of the N-terminal tail of yeast Rps5, which promotes AUG recognition by its interaction with Rps16/uS9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 2014</xref>), whose C-terminal tail closely approaches the codon-anticodon duplex in the P site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>). Alternatively, E144R might affect the conformation or location of ribosomal proteins Rps28 and Rps14, also located in the exit channel and in contact with the Rps5 β-hairpin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>), or of domain 1 of eIF2α, which interacts with other regions of Rps5 as well as Met-tRNA<sub>i</sub> in the P<sub>IN</sub> complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In these latter scenarios, the inherent flexibility of the Rps5 hairpin loop could prevent loop substitutions from altering the orientation of the β-hairpin and attendant perturbations within the PIC compared to effects exerted by <italic>E144R</italic> or <italic>R225K</italic> on the structured portion of the hairpin.</p><p>The β-hairpin of uS7 also protrudes into the mRNA exit channel of bacterial ribosomes in position to interact with mRNA residues just upstream from the P site codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenner et al., 2007</xref>). In bacterial elongation complexes, the hairpin is also in proximity to E-site tRNA, and truncation of the hairpin increases the frequency of frameshifting, most likely by allowing premature dissociation of the E-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devaraj et al., 2009</xref>). Interestingly, in the yeast py48S PIC, eIF2α-D1 essentially occupies the position of E-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al., 2014</xref>), in accordance with our suggestion that altering the β-hairpin of yeast uS7/Rps5 could impair start codon selection by perturbing the position or flexibility of eIF2α-D1. Regardless of the exact mechanisms involved, the strong impairment of AUG recognition in vivo and marked destabilization of the P<sub>IN</sub> state in vitro conferred by <italic>E144R</italic> dramatically illustrates that a 40S ribosomal protein functions as an equal partner with soluble initiation factors in ensuring efficient and accurate start codon recognition.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and yeast strains</title><p>Yeast strains and plasmids are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data SD3-data">Supplementary files 2, 3</xref>, respectively.</p><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>.

By skillful extensive genetic and biochemical experiments, the authors identified a new element that assists recognition of the proper start codon during the initiation step in the eukaryotic model system of yeast. The data clearly indicate that the conserved β-hairpin and the C-terminal extension of ribosomal protein uS7 play a significant role in selection of the start codon while a pre-initiation complex scans messenger RNA to begin translation. The genuine finding that uS7 helps to recognize a correct initiation site in yeast is reminiscent of the well-known example of protein S12, which is important for accurate selection of tRNA during decoding in bacteria. The presented results center the attention on the idea that ribosomal proteins are not only ‘building blocks’ in the ribosome structure, but are also actively involved in its function together with numerous translation factors. The findings provide important and new insights into the molecular mechanism of how scanning eukaryotic ribosomes accomplish initiation site selection.</p><p>However, the reviewers raised several issues regarding the exact interpretation of some of the data, and the clarity of the arguments.

The major findings are (i) specific mutations in the beta-hairpin region of this ribosomal protein, which from structural studies is near the site of start-codon recognition, have substantial impact on start codon selection and (ii) these mutations have a different spectrum of effects on start codon selection than do mutations of translation initiation factors. These analyses combine Saccharomyces genetics with biophysical approaches that use a reconstituted cell free system to address how the interplay between the ternary complex, the ribosome, and key initiation factors control start site selection. The findings provide important and new insights into the molecular mechanism of how scanning eukaryotic ribosomes accomplish initiation site selection.</p><p>The manuscript is well-written and organized but may be improved overall by considering where additional transitional sentences could help readers, particularly when introducing more detailed aspects of initiation, and by breaking complex sentences into separate sentences.</p><p>Specific comments are as follows:</p><p>Abstract: Include the idea of the relative importance of Rps5 relative to eIFs at the conclusion of the Abstract?</p><p>Introduction: The GTP bound to eIF2 […] the transition to this may be too abrupt in the first paragraph of the Introduction.

By skillful extensive genetic and biochemical experiments, the authors identified a new element that assists recognition of the proper start codon during the initiation step in the eukaryotic model system of yeast. The provided data clearly indicate that the conserved β-hairpin and the C-terminal extension of ribosomal protein uS7 play a significant role in selection of the start codon while a pre-initiation complex scans messenger RNA to begin translation. This information is undoubtedly valuable for ‘untangling’ complicated process of mRNA scanning during initiation in eukaryotes. The genuine finding that uS7 helps to recognize a correct initiation site in yeast is reminiscent of the well-known example of protein S12, which is important for accurate selection of tRNA during decoding in bacteria. The presented results center the attention on the idea that ribosomal proteins are not only ‘building blocks’ in the ribosome structure but are also actively involved in its function together with numerous translation factors. In my opinion, the manuscript fully deserves to be published by <italic>eLife</italic> because it solidly establishes a specific role of ribosome protein uS7 in initiation process.</p><p>My major concern is related to the results describing effects of mutations in uS7 on initiation from near-cognate UUG start codon. Because initiator Met-tRNAMet is expected to form less than three standard base-pairs with this codon, an initiation complex assembled on mRNA with UUG, a priori, is less stable than the complex formed on the AUG codon with complete three base-pairs. Consequently, the results describing, for example, dissociation of the initiation complexes assembled on the UUG codon can be exaggerated because inherently unstable complexes additionally fall apart owing to the experimental procedure (viz. electrophoresis during 45 min). Hence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> shows that the initiation complex assembled on the UUG codon with the wild type 40S is very weak compared to the stable complex on the AUG codon. In this regard, it would be more correct to describe relative effects rather than provide exact values of constants. Since the Y-axis of most of the graphs is presented in arbitrary units, it would be also very helpful to show actual dmp/cpm values to demonstrate efficiency of signals and their differences.</p><p>I would also like to add the following suggestions:</p><p>1) It is not explained in the figures why eIF3 is not depicted in the schemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig9">Figures 1, 9</xref>) and why in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> the authors provide a picture of the 48S initiation complex with only a few components while normal 48S contains much more initiation factors bound to the 40S subunit?</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> I would recommend to use a more conventional orientation of 18S rRNA of the small ribosomal subunit, to clearly depict where exactly uS7 is located, where tRNAMet binds etc. I have the same problem with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: normally mRNA is shown with its 5'-nucleotides at the left and P-site codon on the right. In general, figure legends do not contain all necessary information.</p><p>3) The Discussion part is rather narrowed to a specific role of uS7 in eukaryotic initiation. It would be useful to draw some parallels with the role of the same protein in bacterial protein synthesis, whose conserved loop shares the same location relatively to the E- and P-site elements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Visweswaraiah et al., describes a functional role for <italic>rps5</italic> in start codon recognition. Previous studies have shown that <italic>rps5</italic> contacts the nucleotide at the -3 position (5' to the AUG start codon), which may suggest that rps5 affects start codon selection or fidelity. This manuscript examines the role of <italic>rps5</italic> on start codon recognition, both for recognition of the AUG and for the sequence context of the AUG. Their findings revealed that mutations in <italic>rps5</italic> resulted in a decrease in AUG recognition for start codons that were not in the optimal sequence context. As a result of this expression levels of eIF1, which uses a suboptimal start codon context to regulate its gene expression, are lower. When eIF1 levels were increased by expressing eIF1 from a plasmid, initiation at UUG returned to wild-type levels suggesting that the decrease in eIF1 is responsible for the increase in UUG initiation and not the <italic>rps5</italic> mutants. However, there must be some additional effect of <italic>rps5</italic> on UUG initiation since it was able to suppress UUG recognition in a yeast strain that harbored an eIF5 mutation that increased UUG initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The authors used binding studies to examine the affinity of the ternary complex bound to the Wild-type and <italic>rps5</italic> mutant 40S ribosomes. They show that the mutant <italic>rps5</italic> destabilizes the PIN/closed state. Interestingly, the transition from POUT to PIN is not affected, however, the stability of the PIN complexes is decreased for the <italic>rps5</italic> mutant ribosomes. Overall the findings are interesting and significant in that they suggest a novel role for <italic>rps5</italic> in start codon recognition, but the manuscript was a bit difficult to understand and it would benefit from additional clarifications and simplifications. Please see the following comments.</p><p>It is unclear why the <italic>rps5</italic> mutants promote leaking scanning for the <italic>GCN4</italic> reporter, since the phenotype is that these mutations confer a hyperaccurate initiation phenotype one would assume that a start codon in a good sequence context would be as good as WT initiation or better (the structural argument provided is not clear nor satisfying as written). However, it does appear that while the <italic>rps5</italic> mutants confer reduced initiation at start codons in a poor or week context that they may not enhance initiation in a favorable context. Could it be possible that a general decrease in frequency of start codon recognition could just have a much greater effect on the weaker or poor context AUGs and relatively less on the AUG in a good sequence context? Would this explain all the data, the binding studies showing reduced complex formation, the decrease in UUG initiation, and <italic>SUI1</italic> initiation? As the manuscript reads it appears that there are more than one model/mechanism for how <italic>rps5</italic> is affecting translation initiation depending on which reporter or assay is used. For example, when ribosomes with <italic>rps5</italic> mutations don't recognize the <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG it is promoting leaky scanning, but when it doesn't recognize the <italic>SUI1</italic> or UUG it is hyperaccurate.</p><p>It is not clear how <italic>rps5</italic> could be affecting initiation at UUG codons given is position, perhaps the authors could discuss this further in the Discussion. Is the UUG in good sequence context or could this also be contributing to its initiation? What does moderately strong? Is the -3 position optimal? Perhaps defining these sequences would go a long way towards answering these questions.</p><p>There seems to be some disconnect between the Introduction and the Results where the authors state that <italic>rps5</italic> is required for efficient initiation. It is unclear where in the results the rate of initiation was measured. Perhaps the authors can better define what they mean by efficiency.</p><p>At the end of the second paragraph of the subsection headed “<italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> elevate UUG initiation indirectly by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the <italic>SUI1</italic> start codon and thereby reducing eIF1 abundance” and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The authors conclude: “the increased recognition of UUG start codons conferred by the <italic>rps5</italic> mutations is an indirect consequence of their reduced expression of eIF1.” They show that expressing eIF1 from a plasmid returns UUG/AUG recognition ratio back to WT and eIF1 levels increase (although quantification would be helpful as they appear not to come back to wt level). However, the authors assume but do not show whether the defect in sequence context is still present when eIF1 is expressed from a plasmid. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> should be repeated with yeast strains expressing eIF1 from a plasmid. &lt;textboxend&gt;</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07939.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>[…] The manuscript is well-written and organized but may be improved overall by considering where additional transitional sentences could help readers, particularly when introducing more detailed aspects of initiation, and by breaking complex sentences into separate sentences.</italic></p><p><italic>Specific comments are as follows</italic>:</p><p><italic>Abstract</italic>: <italic>Include the idea of the relative importance of Rps5 relative to eIFs at the conclusion of the Abstract?</italic></p><p>We have included the relative importance of Rps5 in the Abstract and the sentence has now been changed to: “We conclude that the Rps5 β-hairpin is as crucial as soluble initiation factors for efficient and accurate start codon recognition.”</p><p><italic>Introduction: The GTP bound to eIF2 […] the transition to this may be too abrupt in the first paragraph of the Introduction.

Because initiator Met-tRNAMet is expected to form less than three standard base-pairs with this codon, an initiation complex assembled on mRNA with UUG,</italic> a priori<italic>, is less stable than the complex formed on the AUG codon with complete three base-pairs. Consequently, the results describing, for example, dissociation of the initiation complexes assembled on the UUG codon can be exaggerated because inherently unstable complexes additionally fall apart owing to the experimental procedure (viz. electrophoresis during 45 min). Hence,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6C</italic></xref> <italic>shows that the initiation complex assembled on the UUG codon with the wild type 40S is very weak compared to the stable complex on the AUG codon. In this regard, it would be more correct to describe relative effects rather than provide exact values of constants. Since the Y-axis of most of the graphs is presented in arbitrary units, it would be also very helpful to show actual dmp/cpm values to demonstrate efficiency of signals and their differences</italic>.</p><p>The in vitro reconstituted experiments in this study are based on the thorough analysis from the Lorsch lab described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolitz et al. (2009)</xref>, using single and double substitutions in the mRNA start codon to investigate the effects of base-pair mismatches with initiator tRNA on the rates of TC association and dissociation from 43S·mRNA complexes. They found that when UUG replaces AUG in the mRNA, the rate constant for TC binding (k<sub>on</sub>) was reduced by ∼40%, while the dissociation rate constant (k<sub>off</sub>) was increased ∼4-fold, to yield an increase in K<sub>d</sub> of ∼7-fold. Thus, the referee is correct in stating that the UUG complex is inherently less stable than the AUG complex; however, this difference is the key feature of this assay that allows us to discern relatively greater effects of Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations on UUG versus AUG complexes. Based on the measured K<sub>d</sub> values in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolitz et al. (2009)</xref>, UUG is the near-cognate closest to AUG in forming a stable PIC. With WT ribosomes, the UUG complexes are still quite stable, with &lt;20% dissociating in the first hour of incubation; and even less dissociation occurs when the ß-S264Y variant of eIF2 is employed, as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref> where the destabilizing effect of <italic>R148E</italic> on UUG complexes was established. Note also that the key conclusion that <italic>E144R</italic> destabilizes the PIC derives in large part from its effect of increasing the k<sub>off</sub> for the highly stable AUG complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Dissociation of the UUG complexes during electrophoresis is not an issue because this would occur equally for all of the time points in the assay, including the zero-time point from which dissociation during the incubation is measured as a function of time. This assay has been used in several previous papers that we published in collaboration with the Lorsch lab, including the analysis of Sui<sup>-</sup> and Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations in initiator tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2014</xref>), and of eIF1 Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martin-Marcos et al.

Hence, we believe that the comparable analyses of <italic>rps5</italic> Ssu<sup>-</sup> mutations presented here is both appropriate and accurate.</p><p><italic>I would also like to add the following suggestions</italic>:</p><p><italic>1) It is not explained in the figures why eIF3 is not depicted in the schemes (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig9"><italic>Figures 1, 9</italic></xref><italic>) and why in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2B</italic></xref> <italic>the authors provide a picture of the 48S initiation complex with only a few components while normal 48S contains much more initiation factors bound to the 40S subunit?</italic></p><p>We did not include eIF3 in the schematic models of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig9">Figures 1 and 9</xref> for several reasons. First, eIF3 is a large, multisubunit complex and accurately displaying even a simplified PIC containing only eIFs 1, 1A, TC and mRNA is already challenging. Second, the binding sites in the PIC for all of eIF3’s subunits are not yet known, and adding the well-established binding site for the PCI domains of eIF3α and -c on the solvent-exposed side of the 40S subunit would add little to visualization of the subunit interface surface depicted in these schematics. Third, the functions of the eIF3 subunits in scanning and AUG selection are not well established and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig9">Figures 1 and 9</xref> are used to facilitate descriptions of the known functions of eIFs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) is the partial yeast 48S structure from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al.

While it might be non-standard, we chose the view in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> because it illustrates most clearly the location of uS7 in the mRNA exit channel, the residues identified in this study that affect initiation, and the position of the uS7 hairpin relative to the mRNA nucleotides and eIF2α-D1, which are all depicted similarly in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> after zooming in on the exit channel. We note that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> of Devaraj et al., on the effects of S7 hairpin mutations on frameshifting in <italic>E. coli</italic>, depicts exactly the same view of the bacterial components of the exit channel.</p><p><italic>3) The Discussion part is rather narrowed to a specific role of uS7 in eukaryotic initiation. It would be useful to draw some parallels with the role of the same protein in bacterial protein synthesis, whose conserved loop shares the same location relatively to the E- and P-site elements</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer and have included the following sentences in the final paragraph: “The β-hairpin of uS7 also protrudes into the mRNA exit channel of bacterial ribosomes in position to interact with mRNA residues just upstream from the P site codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jenner et al. 2007</xref>). In bacterial elongation complexes, the hairpin is also in proximity to E-site tRNA, and truncation of the hairpin increases the frequency of frameshifting most likely by allowing premature dissociation of the E-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Devaraj et al. 2009</xref>). Interestingly, in the yeast py48S PIC, eIF2α-D1 occupies the position of E-site tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hussain et al, 2014</xref>), in accordance with our suggestion that altering the β-hairpin of yeast uS7/Rps5 impairs start codon selection by altering the position or flexibility of eIF2α-D1.”</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p><italic>[…] The authors used binding studies to examine the affinity of the ternary complex bound to the Wild-type and</italic> rps5 <italic>mutant 40S ribosomes.

Overall the findings are interesting and significant in that they suggest a novel role for</italic> rps5 <italic>in start codon recognition, but the manuscript was a bit difficult to understand and it would benefit from additional clarifications and simplifications. Please see the following comments</italic>.</p><p><italic>It is unclear why the</italic> rps5 <italic>mutants promote leaking scanning for the</italic> GCN4 <italic>reporter, since the phenotype is that these mutations confer a hyperaccurate initiation phenotype one would assume that a start codon in a good sequence context would be as good as WT initiation or better (the structural argument provided is not clear nor satisfying as written). However, it does appear that while the</italic> rps5 <italic>mutants confer reduced initiation at start codons in a poor or week context that they may not enhance initiation in a favorable context. Could it be possible that a general decrease in frequency of start codon recognition could just have a much greater effect on the weaker or poor context AUGs and relatively less on the AUG in a good sequence context? Would this explain all the data, the binding studies showing reduced complex formation, the decrease in UUG initiation, and</italic> SUI1 <italic>initiation? As the manuscript reads it appears that there are more than one model/mechanism for how</italic> rps5 <italic>is affecting translation initiation depending on which reporter or assay is used.

We agree with his/her interpretation and had actually laid the groundwork for advancing it as a likely scenario with the text in the second and third paragraphs of the Discussion that seeks to explain the increased leaky scanning observed for uAUG-1 in optimum context as the result of el.uORF1 being unstructured. However, at the end, we failed to propose this explanation explicitly. To rectify this, we added the following sentence: “Thus, it seems plausible that <italic>E144R</italic> and <italic>R225K</italic> decrease the efficiency of start codon recognition only for weak initiation sites, including near-cognate UUG codons and sub-optimal AUG start sites, without reducing recognition of AUG codons in strong context that initiate structured coding sequences.” And later in the Discussion we state: “As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, our results indicate that both E144 and R148 promote start codon selection by stabilizing the P<sub>IN</sub> state, and the finding that <italic>E144R</italic> reduces initiation at both UUG and sub-optimal AUG codons, while <italic>R148E</italic> impairs only UUG recognition, can be explained as the result of a relatively stronger contribution of E144 versus R148 to the stability of the P<sub>IN</sub> state”.</p><p><italic>It is not clear how</italic> rps5 <italic>could be affecting initiation at UUG codons given is position, perhaps the authors could discuss this further in the Discussion</italic>.</p><p>We had presented various possibilities at the end of the Discussion of how mutations in the β-hairpin might affect start codon recognition. Briefly, we suggested a disruption of the interaction of hairpin loop residues with the rRNA residue in close proximity to the -3 context nucleotide, perturbation of the hairpin interaction with Rps16 whose CTT closely approaches the codon-anticodon duplex in the P-site, and altering the interaction with domain-1 of eIF2α that interacts with both tRNA<sub>i</sub> and the mRNA 5’ of the start codon. We now suggest that this last mechanism would be analogous to the role of the orthologous hairpin in bacterial S7 in stabilizing the E-site tRNA during elongation, as eIF2α-D1 and E-site tRNA occupy very similar positions.</p><p><italic>Is the UUG in good sequence context or could this also be contributing to its initiation? What does moderately strong? Is the -3 position optimal? Perhaps defining these sequences would go a long way towards answering these questions</italic>.</p><p>The sequence context for the <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> UUG reporter examined in vivo is strong, while that of the model mRNA used for in vitro experiments is weak. However, no effect of context has been observed thus far in the reconstituted system using the model mRNAs. Given the concordance of our findings in vivo with the <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> UUG reporter and those in vitro with the UUG model mRNA, we believe that context plays a minor role in suppression of UUG initiation by the Rps5 substitutions. Moreover, the context for the UUG and AUG <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> reporters are identical, and the same holds for the UUG and AUG model mRNAs, which is now stated explicitly in Results. The sequences of the model mRNAs used in the assays were mentioned in the Materials and methods, and we have now added the context of the <italic>HIS4-lacZ</italic> reporters to that section as well.</p><p><italic>There seems to be some disconnect between the Introduction and the Results where the authors state that</italic> rps5 <italic>is required for efficient initiation. It is unclear where in the results the rate of initiation was measured. Perhaps the authors can better define what they mean by efficiency.</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, we show that the <italic>R225K</italic> and <italic>E144R</italic> mutants exhibit moderate, but statistically significant reductions in the polysome:monosome ratio, which indicates a reduction in the rate of initiation versus elongation. We have cited this result in the first paragraph of the Discussion as evidence that the <italic>E144R</italic> substitution in β-strand 1 of the hairpin reduces the rate of bulk translation initiation. Combining this result with the increased leaky scanning of <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 conferred by this mutation leads us to conclude that selection of AUG codons by the scanning PIC is less efficient in this Rps5 mutant.</p><p><italic>At the end of the second paragraph of the subsection headed “</italic>E144R <italic>and</italic> R225K <italic>elevate UUG initiation indirectly by exacerbating the effect of poor context of the</italic> SUI1 <italic>start codon and thereby reducing eIF1 abundance” and</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>. The authors conclude: “the increased recognition of UUG start codons conferred by the</italic> rps5 <italic>mutations is an indirect consequence of their reduced expression of eIF1.” They show that expressing eIF1 from a plasmid returns UUG/AUG recognition ratio back to WT and eIF1 levels increase (although quantification would be helpful as they appear not to come back to wt level). However, the authors assume but do not show whether the defect in sequence context is still present when eIF1 is expressed from a plasmid.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4B</italic></xref> <italic>should be repeated with yeast strains expressing eIF1 from a plasmid</italic>.</p><p>We have quantified the blots and added the results to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, and the reviewer is correct that the levels of eIF1 are not fully restored to the WT level when an extra copy of <italic>SUI1</italic> under its native promoter is introduced into the mutants on a single-copy plasmid (compare lanes 3-4 and 7-8 to 9-10). Despite this, the increase in eIF1 levels in the mutants achieved with <italic>scSUI1</italic> is sufficient to restore the elevated UUG/AUG ratio to the WT level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This demonstrates that elevated UUG initiation is an indirect consequence of low eIF1 levels in the mutants, which is the main point of this experiment. The fact that the eIF1 levels in the mutants harboring <italic>scSUI1</italic> remain well below those seen in the corresponding WT/<italic>scSUI1</italic> transformant (lanes 3-4 &amp; 7-8 vs. 11-12) indicates that enhanced discrimination against the poor context of native <italic>SUI1</italic> still occurs in the mutants at the boosted levels of eIF1. Similarly, we show later in the paper that the increased leaky scanning of <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1 in the mutants is not diminished by increasing eIF1 levels with <italic>scSUI1</italic>. Thus, we think it is clear that the defects in AUG recognition, whether for the native <italic>SUI1</italic> AUG or <italic>GCN4</italic> uAUG-1, do not arise from the reduced eIF1 levels in the mutants. In fact, because eIF1 promotes scanning, reduced eIF1 levels per se should diminish discrimination against the poor context of SU1I and boost eIF1 levels; and if anything, should reduce, not increase, leaky scanning of uAUG-1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
