The insect olfactory system plays a key role in these processes, and antennae are often considered to be the nostrils of insects. However, some species also use other cephalic organs, such as maxillary palps and proboscis, to detect volatile compounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haverkamp et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lu et al., 2007</xref>). Olfactory sensilla distributed on these organs are multiporous hair-like structures innervated by the dendrites of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benton and Dahanukar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Stocker, 1994</xref>). Odorant receptors (ORs) are atypical, 7-transmembrane domain proteins, which are located on the dendritic membrane of OSNs, selectively bind to volatile ligands in the environment and are the primary determinants of the detection spectrum of OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dobritsa et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldman et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Störtkuhl and Kettler, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wicher et al., 2008</xref>). These ligand-binding ORs are considered to form a heteromultimeric complexes with a co-receptor (ORco) and to function as non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butterwick et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Neuhaus et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sato et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vosshall et al., 1999</xref>). Some ionotropic receptors (IRs) and gustatory receptors (GRs) are also recognized as odorant-detecting receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Benton et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Several recent studies have challenged the hypothesis that only cephalic organs are involved in the detection of volatile compounds in insects. Olfactory receptor genes are expressed not only in antennae and maxilla, but also in ovipositors of a variety of moth species, including <italic>Heliothis virescens</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Widmayer et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>Sesamia nonagrioides</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glaser et al., 2013</xref>), <italic>Chilo suppressalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xia et al., 2015</xref>), and <italic>Manduca sexta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klinner et al., 2016</xref>). However, the function of olfactory receptor genes expressed in the ovipositor remains unknown.</p><p>Moth ovipositors are always connected to pheromone glands, and several lines of evidence from different moth species suggest that functional olfactory receptors may be present in the sensilla located on moth ovipositors. For example, a pheromone receptor is expressed in the ovipositor of <italic>H. virescens</italic>, suggesting a possible role of the ovipositor in feedback regulation of biosynthesis and emission of the female sex pheromone from the sex pheromone gland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Widmayer et al., 2009</xref>). Two ORs are expressed in the pheromone gland and ovipositor of the grassland moth, <italic>C. suppressalis</italic>, but no ORco was detected there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Xia et al., 2015</xref>). Sensilla with a multiporous surface are observed in <italic>Monopis crocicapitella</italic> and <italic>Homoeosoma nebulella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faucheux, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Faucheux, 1988</xref>). Finally, a subset of sensilla located on the ovipositor of <italic>M. sexta</italic> exhibit electrophysiological responses to a large array of volatile organic compounds, and expression of ORco and the ionotropic co-receptors IR8a and IR25a was detected in the ovipositor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klinner et al., 2016</xref>). However, the function of ORs expressed in the ovipositor of moths and whether these ORs are co-expressed with ORco remains unclear.</p><p>The Oriental tobacco budworm, <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>, is a serious crop pest with a narrow host plant range which includes only Solanaceae such as tobacco, hot pepper, and several <italic>Physalis</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2004</xref>). Previous antennae transcriptome studies showed that more than 60 ORs were expressed in the antennae of <italic>H. assulta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). The function of the pheromone receptors and several ORs responding to plant volatiles were characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). To determine whether any ORs were expressed in the ovipositor, we sequenced the transcriptome of the pheromone gland-ovipositor complex and found one OR with a very high expression level. Next, we functionally analyzed the response spectra of this OR to a wide range of host plant-related odorants using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp recording. In situ hybridization, scanning electron microscopy and electrophysiology studies indicated that this OR is expressed in some multiporous sensilla on the moth ovipositor. Together with the results of oviposition experiments, we suggest that the OR expressed in the ovipositor helps <italic>H. assulta</italic> females to find precise egg-laying sites on their host plants.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Transcriptome sequencing and identification of chemosensory receptors in pheromone gland - ovipositor of <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic></title><p>We conducted next-generation transcriptome sequencing analyses using a cDNA library constructed from pheromone gland-ovipositors (PG-OVs) of female <italic>H. assulta</italic> using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform.

The twelve GLV and terpenoid compounds are widely present in leaves, flowers, and fruits of plants, and are strongly attractive to herbivorous insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>). The ortholog of HassOR31, HarmOR31, has a similar wide spectrum in polyphagous <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Di et al., 2017</xref>). Nevertheless, the most effective ligand of HassOR31 was Z-3-hexenyl butyrate while that of HarmOR31 was myrcene.

This may have significance in the divergence of the host plant range between the two closely related species: <italic>H. assulta</italic> is a specialist on hot pepper, tobacco, and some <italic>Physalis</italic> plants in Solanaceae, whil<italic>e H. armigera</italic> is a typical generalist with a host plant range of over 300 species belonging to 68 plant families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>As a specialist, <italic>H. assulta</italic> lays their eggs singly, preferably on or near the flowering or fruiting parts of these host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu, 1990</xref>). The headspace collections of tobacco flowers were analyzed by GC-MS and GC-EAD previously. Tobacco flowers release volatiles including E-β-ocimene, Z-3-hexenyl acetate, nonanal, Z-3-hexenyl 2-methyl butyrate, linalool, and Z-3-hexenyl butyrate, and blends of them are attractive to <italic>H. assulta</italic> females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2012</xref>). Most odorants in the response spectrum of HassOR31/HassORco can be detected in headspace collections from tobacco.</p><p>As a general plant volatile and most effective ligand of HassOR31, Z-3-hexenyl butyrate is released by many plant fruits and has a green, fruity, and somewhat buttery aroma. It is also present in the headspace collections of tobacco flowers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2012</xref>) and hot pepper fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forero et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, Z-3-hexenyl butyrate is very likely to be used by females of <italic>H. assulta</italic> as a signal for choosing oviposition sites rather than a signal for searching host plants. The behavioral assay with hot pepper volatiles (a complex cue) showed that antennectomized females still preferred to oviposit on sites treated with hot pepper volatiles, but their oviposition preference index was significantly decreased. Another behavioral assay with Z-3-hexenyl butyrate showed that antennectomized and normal females both prefer to lay eggs on the sites treated with the ligand for the receptor in the ovipositor but had no significant difference in oviposition preference index. These results suggest that detecting host volatile blends in general oviposition is governed by both antennae and ovipositor but detecting for Z-3-hexenyl butyrate seems to be mainly governed by the ovipositor. The expression levels of HassOR31 and other ORs expressed in the ovipositor and antennae may explain such behavioral responses. We speculate that a gravid female moth takes two steps to find an oviposition site: firstly, she smells the plant volatiles mainly by using antennae to search for a host plant, and secondly when she comes near to or land on the host plant, she integrates the information from olfactory sensilla as well as mechanical and contact chemosensory sensilla on the ovipositor to determine the precise oviposition sites on the host plants. Z-3-hexenyl butyrate and other ligand compounds of HassOR31 are expected to play a major role in the second step.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Large difference in expression of <italic>HassOR31</italic> and <italic>HassORco</italic> in the ovipositor</title><p>It is believed that ORs cannot function in the absence of ORco (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sato et al., 2008</xref>). Recent Cryo-EM structure of the insect olfactory receptor ORco supports a model in which ORco and OR subunits assemble into a heterotetramer with a central shared ion-conduction pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butterwick et al., 2018</xref>). One unresolved question from this study relates to the large difference in expression levels between <italic>HassOR31</italic> and <italic>HassORco</italic> in the ovipositor. We first assumed that <italic>HassOR31</italic> played a role alone without <italic>HassORco</italic>. To test this idea, we injected <italic>HassOR31</italic> cRNA alone into the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes and found that oocytes expressing <italic>HassOR31</italic> alone had no response to the tested compounds. We then hypothesized that some co-receptor-like proteins might replace HassORco to function in cooperation with HassOR31. In addition to HassOR31, the ionotropic glutamate receptor, <italic>HassiGluR7,</italic> was also highly expressed in the ovipositors of <italic>H. assulta</italic> and had a similar tissue expression pattern to <italic>HassOR31</italic>. To test if these two receptors function together, we co-expressed <italic>HassOR31</italic> and <italic>HassiGluR7</italic> in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, but no response was detected.</p><p>In the electrophysiological experiments, we discovered only a few sensilla on the ovipositor that responded to Z-3-hexenyl butyrate, the most effective ligand of HassOR31/HassORco, which explains the low expression of <italic>HassORco</italic> in the ovipositor. However, it does not explain the presence of high expression levels of redundant <italic>HassOR31</italic>. We speculate that in addition to cooperating with HassORco and functioning in olfactory sensation, HassOR31 might function in mediating cell responses to endogenous signaling molecules, regulating neural development, or play other non-chemosensory roles. The similar situation is also found in testes of <italic>A. gambiae</italic>, where some AgORs are abundantly expressed, but AgORco transcript is present at a very low level. It is proved that the AgORs and AgORco are localized to the flagella of <italic>A. gambiae</italic> spermatozoa where Orco-specific agonists, antagonists, and other odorant ligands robustly activate flagella beating in an Orco-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pitts et al., 2014</xref>). Studies on mammals have found that many ORs are present in tissues outside the olfactory system and have diverse functions in several physiological contexts beyond odor recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2017</xref>). For example, a human testicular OR, hOR17-4 was found to control cellular motility and chemotaxis in sperm cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Spehr et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the ORs, we also found some GRs and IRs present in the ovipositors of <italic>H. assulta</italic>. The expression of HassGR9, the ortholog of fructose receptor HarmGR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), suggests that sugar taste sensilla are also present in the ovipositor of <italic>H. assulta</italic>. Sugar taste sensilla have also been found on the ovipositor of cotton leaf worm <italic>Spodoptera littoralis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seada et al., 2016</xref>). The co-receptors of IR families (HassIR8a, HassIR25a) were also expressed, indicating that IRs may also play chemosensory roles in the ovipositor. There is no evidence in the literature of any ionotropic glutamate receptor other than antennal IRs involved in the chemical sensation of insects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The features of chemosensory sensilla on the ovipositor</title><p>Previous morphology and electrophysiology studies shown that there were various types of sensilla including mechanical, contact chemosensory, and putative olfactory sensilla distributed on the ovipositor of lepidopteran insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faucheux, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klijnstra and Roessingh, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maher and Thiery, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Seada et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Waladde, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yamaoka et al., 1971</xref>). On <italic>H. assulta</italic> ovipositors we identified two types of chemosensory sensilla with shapes similar to the trichoid and basiconic sensilla on the antenna, respectively. However, unlike traditional olfactory sensilla, these multiporous sensilla also have a large terminal pore, which is characteristic of contact chemosensory sensilla. Therefore, we infer that these two types of sensilla may perform both olfactory and taste functions. The electrophysiological results indicated that some sensilla on the ovipositor responded to the tested odorants though their firing frequency was lower than that on the antennae. A 100-microgram equivalent of the tested compound stimulated around 20 spikes per second. The putative olfactory sensilla identified in the ovipositor of <italic>M. sexta</italic> have similar characteristics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klinner et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In summary, this was the first study to functionally characterize an OR, HassOR31, expressed in <italic>H. assulta</italic> ovipositors. We also characterized sensilla related to the ovipositor OR with a supplemental function to antennal olfactory sensilla. These sensilla were involved in detecting GLV and terpenoid compounds in host plants, and most likely played a role in oviposition site selection of this oligophagous herbivore. Future researches should focus on knocking out <italic>HassOR31</italic> or destroying the related sensilla in the ovipositor and then measuring how insect behaviors are affected. The CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing method provides a good opportunity for us to knock out <italic>HassOR31</italic> to verify its function. Moreover, the pathway of OSN-expressed HassOR31/HassORco projecting into the terminal abdominal ganglion and the function of superfluous HassOR31 in the ovipositor also require further investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene (<italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>18S</italic> ribosomal RNA gene</td><td valign="top">NCBI</td><td valign="top">GenBank: EU057177.1</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top">Cat# 73404</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">Dynabeads mRNA purification kit</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# 61006</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">Q5 High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">Cat# M0491</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">M-MLV reverse transcriptase</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">Cat# M1701</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">SYBR Premix Ex TaqII</td><td valign="top">Takara</td><td valign="top">Cat# RR820</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">T7/SP6 RNA transcription system</td><td valign="top">Roche</td><td valign="top">Cat# 10999644001</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6</td><td valign="top">Ambion</td><td valign="top">Cat# AM1340</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Trimmomatic</td><td valign="top">Trimmomatic</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011848">SCR_011848</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">FastQC</td><td valign="top">FastQC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_014583">SCR_014583</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Trinity</td><td valign="top">Trinity</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013048">SCR_013048</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">RSEM</td><td valign="top">RSEM</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013027">SCR_013027</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002798">SCR_002798</ext-link></td><td valign="top">7.0</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">ZEN Digital Imaging for Light Microscopy</td><td valign="top">ZEN Digital Imaging for Light Microscopy</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_013672">SCR_013672</ext-link></td><td valign="top">2012</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">Adobe Illustrator</td><td valign="top">Adobe systems</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_010279">SCR_014198</ext-link></td><td valign="top">CS6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">pCLAMP software</td><td valign="top">pCLAMP software</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_011323">SCR_011323</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal rearing</title><p><italic>H. assulta</italic> were originally collected as larvae in tobacco fields in Zhengzhou, Henan Province, China, and successive generations were maintained in the laboratory under a 16 L: 8 D photoperiod cycle at 26 ± 1°C and 55–65% relative humidity.

an odorant receptor on the ovipositor. The pictures on egg distribution are a valuable addition, and the new text nicely clarifies the last few issues raised by the reviewer.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A highly expressed odorant receptor in the ovipositor of a moth is involved in detecting host-plant volatiles&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ian Baldwin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Markus Knaden (Reviewer #2); Leslie Voshall (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Your manuscript provides extensive data on an odorant receptor (OR) present in the ovipositor/pheromone gland complex of the moth <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>. The study shows that there is one OR that is higher expressed in the olfactory receptor ovipositor/pheromone gland complex than in the antennae of the insect. Yet, the antennae are the best known organs involved in olfaction by moths and many other insects. This yields an intriguing question, i.e. on the involvement of this OR in oviposition decisions by the moths. By expressing the odorant receptor and its co-receptor in a <italic>Xenopus</italic>oocyte model system, 12 plant odours are identified that yield a response. Finally, by electrophysiological analyses and by investigating oviposition behaviour of the moths with intact antennae or after removal of the antennae you provide evidence supporting the role of the odorant receptor in the ovipositor/pheromone gland complex in odour perception and in behavioural decisions of the animals.</p><p>The most important criticism is that the final piece of the puzzle is lacking, i.e. the evidence that knocking out the OR specifically eliminates the effects of the plant volatiles on oviposition. Although such information would be really nice, the dataset as it stands is quite extensive and an important step. Developing CRISPR-Cas9 for this system would be a major step in itself. Yet, it will be important to address the value of such a next step in the current manuscript to provide the full evidence, thus supplementing the current step taken, i.e. antennectomy.</p><p>In addition, we ask you to provide additional data on the recordings in Figure 2 to substantiate the replication of these findings.</p><p>You will find the detailed comments by the three reviewers and ask you to revise the manuscript in response to these comments.</p><p>A revised version of the manuscript will be sent out for additional review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents data on an odorant receptor that is highly expressed in the ovipositor/pheromone gland and that is involved in the selection of oviposition sites. The OR is responsive to a limited number of plant volatiles, none of which seem to be specific for the host plants of the moth. That an odorant receptor is highly expressed in the ovipositor/pheromone gland is remarkable and the data presented here provide a new view of how female moths use plant information during decisions in oviposition site selection.</p><p>The study is well performed, albeit that the behavioural experiments are done with a rather limited number of individuals, but the conclusions are straightforward. The antennectomy treatment is a rather crude treatment. Yet, I wonder why the reverse experiment, i.e. ovipositorectomy has not been carried out as well.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their study the authors present evidence that female moths of <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic> evaluate leaves as oviposition sites with olfactory sensilla situated on the moths' ovipositor. By a huge array of experiments (transcriptome analysis of the ovipositor, in situ hybridization of that receptor that is strongly expressed in the ovipositor, functional analysis of this receptor in frog oocytes, SSR experiments with basiconic-like sensilla on the ovipositor with those odorants the oocytes ectopically expressing the receptor responded to, and finally oviposition assays with moths lacking olfactory input via the antennae) the authors convincingly show that the receptor <italic>HassOR31</italic> expressed in sensilla on the ovipositor is governing oviposition choice in this species. While this is not the first report of olfactory sensilla the expression of olfaction-related genes on the ovipositor, it is to my knowledge the most comprehensive analysis and the first one to show, which olfactory receptor is involved. I have only few rather minor concerns:</p><p>1) The authors show that moths without antennae still prefer leaves with the major ligand of <italic>HassOR31</italic> added (i.e. the ligand that becomes detected by the olfactory sensilla on the ovipositor). This suggests that olfaction by the ovipositor is sufficient to govern oviposition behavior. It would have been, however, much nicer, if the authors would have included experiments with gene-edited moths, lacking <italic>HassOR31</italic>. Anyhow, the establishment of CRISPR Cas9 in a new species is very time consuming, and I feel that the manuscript even without this critical test for receptor sufficiency is convincing.</p><p>2) The manuscript is easy to read but would profit from some language editing.

This shows that general oviposition is governed by both antennae and ovipositor, but that only cis-3-Hexenyl butyrate seems to be mainly governed by the ovipositor.

Odorant receptors associated with the detection of volatile chemical signals/cues are typically located on the antennae or maxillary palps of insects. We integrated the transcriptome analysis, and molecular, electrophysiological, and behavioral techniques and methods to reveal that the ovipositor of the moth species <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic> bearing a functional OR complex, <italic>HassOR31</italic>-<italic>ORco</italic>, also plays a role in detecting volatile chemical cues.</p><p>On your concerns:</p><p>1) We agree that if we can bring to the modern technology of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing, it would directly and fundamentally illuminate the involvement of <italic>HassOR31</italic> in oviposition decisions by the moths.</p><p>In fact, our laboratory has been trying to establish CRISPR-Cas9 in this species and its closely related species <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>. However, up to now it is not successful on <italic>H. assulta</italic>: one reason is that this oligophagous species is not easy to be successively reared in the single-pair crossing condition in the lab. Considering the special topic of this study, even if we could knock out <italic>HassOR31</italic> in the whole body of <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic>, it would be still hard to explain the function of <italic>HassOR31</italic> expressed in ovipositor because <italic>HassOR31</italic> in the antennae would also been removed. The ideal mutant comparing with the wild type for this study is the insects with no or less expression of <italic>HassOR31</italic> in the ovipositor but normal expression in the antennae, which is even more difficulttobe achieved now in this non-model species. In such a case we have discussed the value of such a next step, and hopefully can reach this goal in the near future.</p><p>2) We have added new recordings in Figure 2, and also provided some additional data in two new supplementary figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, Figure 2—figure supplement 2). In these figures we can see that in most cases <italic>HassOR31</italic> is expressed alone.</p><p>We will explain these in detail in the terms of responding to three reviewers’ comments as follows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] rather limited number of individuals, but the conclusions are straightforward. The antennectomy treatment is a rather crude treatment. Yet, I wonder why the reverse experiment, i.e. ovipositorectomy has not been carried out as well.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your comments and suggestions.</p><p>1) Yes, the ligands of <italic>HassOR31</italic> including Z-3-hexenyl-butyrate, myrcene, citral, and Z-3-hexenyl acetate are all common plant volatiles, suggesting that the ovipositors owning such a highly expressed OR ensure <italic>H. assulta</italic> females to lay their eggs on the green plant surface. In contrast, its closely related species <italic>H. armigera</italic>, a generalist, has no such strictness on oviposition behaviors, and the neonate larvae are also much more mobile and robust than those of <italic>H. assulta</italic>.</p><p>2) Antennectomy was our unwilling choice in the beginning. In the pre-experiments, besides removing the antennae, we had also tried to use the nail polish to seal the sensilla on the surface of the ovipositor, or to seal the sensilla on the antennae, but both failed. We found that the antennectomized female moths could still lay eggs, so we chose this relatively crude treatment. Ovipositorectomy was not considered because the moths without the ovipositor could not lay any eggs.</p><p>3) We set up two oviposition preference experiments, one with the host-plant volatile mixture, another with the most effective ligand Z-3-hexenyl-butyrate. In each experiment we arranged 5-7 biological replicates, and in each replicate, we used 10-15 female moths (with or without antennae). Considering it is not easy rearing insect species in the lab, the individuals we used are already a large number in total although the replications are still limited. When we received these comments, we immediately planned to carry out more replications. Unfortunately, the unexpected new coronavirus spreading in China prevented us from doing anything in this period of time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] I have only few rather minor concerns:</p><p>1) The authors show that moths without antennae still prefer leaves with the major ligand of HassOR31 added (i.e. the ligand that becomes detected by the olfactory sensilla on the ovipositor).

As our responses above to the related comments of the editor, gene editing exploring by CRISPR-Cas9 for this species is ongoing in our laboratory, but we still have a long way to go, hence instantly using this technology for this species is impractical at present. In this study, we take advantages of the unusual high expression of <italic>HassOR31</italic> in ovipositor of <italic>H. assulta</italic> to reveal its hidden secret, we validated the co-expression of <italic>OR31</italic> and <italic>ORco</italic> under the sensilla of ovipositor and identified its ligands. Electrophysiological and behavioral experiments proved the related sensilla play a role in insect oviposition preference. To provide the last piece of evidences, we will do our best to knock out the genes by genome-editing in future, as discussed in the article.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript is easy to read but would profit from some language editing.

We have added some sentences on this point in the Discussion section as follows: “The behavioral assay with hot pepper volatiles (a complex cue) showed that antennectomized females still preferred to oviposit on sites treated with hot pepper volatiles, but their oviposition preference index was significantly decreased.

Nevertheless, the primary finding of this study is the olfactory function of <italic>HassOR31</italic> in the ovipositor of <italic>H. assulta</italic>, rather than requirement of this gene in oviposition behavior although the latter is also what we do best to validate. We give thanks to the solid foundation on molecular mechanisms of insect olfaction built by previous studies, especially discovery of the ligand-gated ion channel formed by OR-ORco complex in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. It is by applying this “principle” we used a series of comprehensive methods including transcriptome analysis, in situ hybridization, <italic>Xenopus</italic> expression system and two-electrode voltage-clamp, SSR, and finally oviposition assays to prove the olfactory function of <italic>HassOR31</italic> in the ovipositor of <italic>H. assulta</italic>. It should be of public interest because generally people believe the olfaction organ is only on the head of insects, here we tell the ovipositor can smell in some moths and provide the first example to show which olfactory receptor is involved in such a process.</p><p><italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> and <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic> are two ideal models in studying olfaction mechanisms of insects. They are closely related species but have big differences in sex pheromone communication and host-plant selection. The genome information of <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> has been reported, while that of <italic>Helicoverpa assulta</italic> has not yet. We are on our way in trying to turn these two moth species into new model organisms with the modern technology of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing.</p><p>We totally agree that the model organisms like <italic>Drosophila</italic> have provided valuable insights into biology including olfaction. The logic used in genetic dissection is quite simple and effective: inactivate an OR gene and measure the behavioral output, and then one can conclude that the OR plays a key role in host-searching behavior. However, the complexity of the system is far too great to be only encoded by a simple correspondence between single genes and neurons, network interactions and the environment also play a role. Yet apart from the technical feasibility in this case, it seems not easy to clarify the role of the OR expressed in the ovipositor by simply knocking the gene out because is also expressed in the main olfactory organ antennae. The behavioral output could be a combined or complementary effect, and therefore transitively dissecting step by step could be another useful approach.</p></body></sub-article></article>
