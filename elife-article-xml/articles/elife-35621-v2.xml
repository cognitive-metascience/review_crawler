First, the genome becomes highly condensed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Koshland and Strunnikov, 1996</xref>). Secondly, cell cycle dependent phosphorylation cascades inactivate transcription globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prescott and Bender, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rhind and Russell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taylor, 1960</xref>). Lastly, the disassembly of the nuclear membrane combined with TF exclusion from mitotic chromosomes was thought to result in the dispersal of most TFs throughout the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gottesfeld and Forbes, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">John and Workman, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez-Balbás et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rizkallah and Hurt, 2009</xref>). How then do the new daughter cells faithfully re-establish the original transcription program? The observation that DNase I hypersensitive sites were maintained in mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martínez-Balbás et al., 1995</xref>) led to the theory of ‘mitotic bookmarking’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michelotti et al., 1997</xref>) where a select group of TFs maintain the ability to bind to target sequences during mitosis and ‘bookmark’ target genes for efficient reactivation. The first few TFs identified to bind to mitotic chromosomes provided early support for the bookmarking theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caravaca et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kadauke et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Xing et al., 2005</xref>). Recently, we and others discovered that previous evidence for the widely observed exclusion of TFs from mitotic chromosomes was primarily due to formaldehyde crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lerner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pallier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>). In fact, most TFs remain associated with mitotic chromosomes but in a dynamic manner. Rather than acting as a stable bookmark, TFs seem to ‘hover’ on mitotic chromosomes. However, it was not clear how such a dynamic mode of bookmarking by TFs could maintain stable transcriptional memory following mitosis.</p><p>To effect transcriptional regulation, TFs at enhancers must cross-talk with the RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) machinery at promoters. Previous studies have shown that certain transcription start sites (TSSs) remain sensitive to permanganate oxidation during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Michelotti et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting the potential for a promoter-specific bookmarking mechanism. Central to the recruitment of Pol II to promoters is the TATA-binding protein (TBP), the prototypic member of the multi-subunit core promoter recognition ensemble TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goodrich and Tjian, 1994</xref>), making TBP an attractive candidate for a global facilitator of transcriptional memory. Indeed, a number of studies have tested the hypothesis of TBP as a mitotic bookmarker. For instance, immunofluorescence (IF) staining of TFIID subunits, including TBP, showed cellular redistribution of the subunits away from chromosomes during mitosis but that a subpopulation of TFIID subunits, including TBP, remains associated with biochemically purified mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fairley et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Segil et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, live-cell imaging of GFP-tagged but over-expressed TBP shows enrichment on chromosomes throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). We now know, however, that some of these experiments need to be revisited, as these early studies suffered from potential experimental biases, including unanticipated TF exclusion induced by formaldehyde crosslinking as well as over-expression biases for proteins with highly regulated concentrations within the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lerner et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pallier et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Um et al., 2001</xref>). Furthermore, some studies have found that TBP remains bound at specific loci during mitosis via chromatin immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christova and Oelgeschläger, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xing et al., 2008</xref>), whereas others have not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kelly et al., 2010</xref>), though differences may be cell-type specific. More importantly, the functional consequence of TBP bookmarking (i.e. promoting transcriptional memory through mitosis), if any, has thus far not been established.</p><p>Through live-cell imaging of endogenously tagged proteins in mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs), we report that TBP stably binds to interphase chromatin for minutes. Moreover, TBP maintains a stable association with mitotic chromosomes, and occurs on a global scale at promoters of active genes. Using an endogenous knock-in of a drug inducible protein degradation system, we found that TBP recruits a small fraction of Pol II molecules to mitotic chromosomes, and that a subset of the recruited Pol II retain activity in mitosis. Lastly, nascent RNA analysis indicates that TBP promotes efficient reactivation of global transcription programs following mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Endogenous TBP bookmarks mitotic chromosomes</title><p>Previous studies have shown that mitotic chromosomes globally retain accessibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiung et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>). Focusing specifically at the TSS of mESCs, we analyzed our previously published ATAC-seq data for all genes. Reads under 100 bp indicate potential transcription factor (TF) binding sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buenrostro et al., 2013</xref>). Short reads are highly enriched at the TSS of active genes in asynchronous cells and maintained in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that TSSs may be bookmarked by promoter bound factors. We also analyzed the mono-nucleosome sized fragments (180–250 bp) from the ATAC-seq at the TSS genome-wide. Remarkably, we found that the accessibility of the nucleosomes flanking the TSS increased during mitosis relative to interphase chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results suggest that nucleosomes around the TSS may assume a different configuration during mitosis than in interphase that allows for increased transposition activity. One possibility is that the global decrease in transcription observed in mitosis may result in decreased occupancy and/or decreased residence time of trans-acting factors at the TSS, resulting in an apparent increase in accessibility of the surrounding nucleosomes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35621.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Endogenous TBP associates with mitotic chromosomes.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Previous ATAC-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>) were examined for TSS analysis.

We used CRISPR/Cas9 to knock-in HaloTag at the endogenous TBP locus and allow for live-cell imaging of endogenous proteins, which remain functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After stable integration of H2B-GFP in the Halo-TBP C41 homozygous line, we observed that the endogenous Halo-TBP is enriched on mitotic chromosomes throughout mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>To test whether over-expressed Halo-TBP could recapitulate the behavior of endogenous Halo-TBP we analyzed the enrichment on mitotic chromosomes of stably over-expressed (Halo-TBP OE) and the endogenous knock-in (Halo-TBP KI) in live versus fixed cells as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>). Under live imaging conditions, both knock-in and overexpressed TBP show enrichment on mitotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>). However, fixation led to eviction of overexpressed but not the knock-in, suggesting that over-expression may not fully recapitulate the complex endogenous regulation of TBP, such as the ubiquitination/deubiquitination process that tightly regulates TBP levels in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Our observation that endogenous TBP is insensitive to fixation-based exclusion from chromosomes, in contrast to most sequence-specific TFs, suggests a distinct interaction modality between TBP and mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Endogenous TBP stably binds to mitotic chromosomes</title><p>To examine TBP interaction with mitotic chromosomes, we imaged individual Halo-TBP KI molecules at a frame rate of 133 Hz and high illumination intensity using stroboscopic photoactivatable single particle tracking (spaSPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hansen et al., 2017</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">2018</xref>). We then localized individual particles and measured their displacement between consecutive frames (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Short displacements are indicative of bound molecules whereas long displacements are suggestive of diffusing ones. The shift to longer displacements in mitosis compared to interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) suggests a difference in the bound fraction and/or the diffusion constant between the two cell cycle stages. We then used Spot-On, an analysis tool for kinetic modeling of SPT data, and fitted the distribution of displacements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hansen et al., 2018</xref>). A 2-state kinetic model representing ‘bound’ and ‘free’ populations could not adequately fit the data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that a dual classification of ‘bound’ and ‘free’ TBP populations may be insufficient to accurately characterize the data. Therefore, we fitted a 3-state kinetic model to represent three distinct populations: a fast-diffusing TBP population (‘fast’), a slower diffusing population wherein TBP may be diffusing in a complex with the TAFs as TFIID (‘slow’), and a stably DNA bound population (‘bound’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The 3-state model fitted the data more precisely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 2</xref>). From this analysis, we estimate that in interphase 27.1% of TBP molecules are bound, whereas 13.3% are bound in mitotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This decrease in fraction bound during mitosis may reflect the minimum amount of TBP needed to ‘bookmark’ active genes during mitosis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35621.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>TBP dynamics within live cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cells were labeled with 25 nM pa-JF549 and individual molecules were tracked over 25,000 frames.

This binding is significantly more stable than typical sequence-specific TFs like Sox2, p53, GR, which normally have residence times on the order of a few to around ten seconds in interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mazza et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mueller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Normanno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Swinstead et al., 2016</xref>). Halo-TBP also remains stably bound during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), with a calculated average residence time of 118 s. The longer calculated residence time is likely due to the small fraction of TBP molecules (less than 1%) with very long dwell times (above 100 s in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Given that the whole distribution profiles appear very similar, we concluded that for most of the bound TBP, residence times are indistinguishable between interphase and mitotic cells. This result is in stark contrast to Sox2, whose residence time decreases by at least half during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that TBP binding to mitotic chromosomes may be independent of transcriptional activity.</p><p>As an orthogonal approach to SPT, we performed FRAP (Fluorescence Recovery after Photobleaching) analysis to independently measure TBP binding dynamics during interphase and mitosis. We plotted the FRAP recovery at the bleach spot over time for Halo-TBP in interphase and in mitotic cells, along with Halo-3xNLS and H2B-Halo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). When normalized for bleach depth, the recovery curves for interphase and mitotic cells become super-imposable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). The difference in bleach depth is consistent with a decrease in the fraction of bound molecules between interphase and mitotic cells, whereas the super-imposable recovery curves is consistent with similar residence times of the bound fraction.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>TBP binds to the TSS of active genes in mitosis</title><p>Given that TBP is resistant to formaldehyde-based exclusion, we performed crosslinked ChIP-seq analysis to determine where TBP binds in mitosis.

Analyzing reads under 100 bp shows that in both asynchronous and mitotic mESCs, the accessibility at the TSS remains largely maintained even after TBP degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, top). To further quantify changes, we measured the log<sub>2</sub> of untreated vs TBP-degraded samples, and averaged the levels at the TSS of all genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, bottom). The minor reductions in levels suggest that chromatin accessibility at the promoter may be determined by underlying sequences rather than TBP binding. Furthermore, TBP degradation has little or no effect on accessibility at enhancers and other TF binding sites, or at CTCF sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). For mono-nucleosomal reads (180–250 bp), we observe a consistent decrease in read counts surrounding the TSS in asynchronous population after TBP degradation, but the overall pattern of chromatin architecture remains the same (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The effect of TBP degradation in mitosis is largely confined to the −1 nucleosome, showing a decrease at this location compared to neighboring nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, bottom).

As with TBP, the 2-state kinetic model fitted the Pol II data poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>). Fitting a 3-state kinetic model, we extracted the fraction of bound Halo-Pol II molecules for all the tested conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref>).

To assess the specificity of the bound population, we treated the cells with either Flavopiridol, an inhibitor of Pol II promoter escape, or Triptolide, an inhibitor of Pol II initiation. After treatment with Flavopirodol or Triptolide, the bound Pol II fraction decreases to 18.0% (S.D. 5.4%) and 15.0% (S.D. 3.8%), respectively. TBP degradation in interphase cells also leads to a marked decrease in bound Pol II, to 21.9% (S.D. 4.7%), confirming the role of TBP in recruiting Pol II to chromatin.

After treatment with Flavopiridol or Triptolide, the bound population decreases significantly to 11.5% (S.D. 3.1%) and 12.1% (S.D. 3.0%), respectively, which suggests that a small fraction of Pol II molecules may be actively engaged during mitosis. Furthermore, TBP degradation also leads to a significant decrease in bound Pol II molecules, to an average 11.8% (S.D. 2.9%) compared to untreated mitotic cells. This suggests a model wherein TBP recruits a small but significant subpopulation of Pol II to mitotic chromosomes. As with interphase cells, combining TBP degradation with either drug treatment also did not result in a significant change in bound Pol II. Taken together, these results suggest that a small population of active Pol II binds specifically to mitotic chromosomes that is recruited by TBP.</p><p>To determine the dynamics of Pol II binding to mitotic chromosomes, we performed SPT with long exposure times (500 ms) and measured the dwell times for Halo-Pol II in interphase and mitosis with and without TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Pol II binding to DNA involves complex steps, from transient binding due to promoter association and abortive initiation, to the stable binding during elongation, and to the as yet undefined mechanisms for termination. Therefore, modeling the binding of Pol II to DNA using a single residence time likely over-simplifies the complex dynamics of Pol II. Therefore, instead of extracting a single residence time for Pol II after model fitting, we calculated the apparent half-life of the bound population. During interphase, the apparent half-life of Pol II is 26.7 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). TBP degradation leads to a modest decrease in apparent half-life, to 21.0 s, which is consistent with the prominent role of TBP in transient Pol II promoter association. During mitosis, the apparent half-life of Pol II binding decreases to 3.5 s. This order of magnitude decrease suggests that the primary mechanism that stabilizes Pol II binding, active elongation, becomes dramatically decreased during mitosis. Furthermore, after TBP degradation during mitosis, the apparent half-life decreases from 3.5 to 2.3 s, consistent with the role of TBP in recruiting transiently-binding Pol II to mitotic chromosomes.</p><p>To cross-validate the SPT residence time analysis, we performed FRAP analysis on Halo-Pol II during interphase and mitosis, with and without TBP degradation. We plotted the FRAP recovery over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and measured the time it takes to reach 90% recovery (T90%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Halo-Pol II takes 179 s to reach 90% recovery in interphase cells, whereas in mitosis, it takes 3 s. Upon TBP degradation in interphase cells, T90% decreases to 150 s, consistent with the decreased apparent half-life as measured by SPT. TBP degradation in mitotic cells shows little change in the recovery curve relative to untreated mitotic cells, further confirming our SPT residence time analysis. Taken together with the SPT results, these findings suggest that TBP affects the more transient promoter association of Pol II during interphase, and potentially directs Pol II binding to mitotic chromosomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mitotic TBP binding affects transcriptional reactivation rate</title><p>To test the hypothesis that TBP recruitment of Pol II to mitotic chromosomes helps prime active genes for efficient reactivation following mitosis, we performed two orthogonal experiments: one based on imaging and another on sequencing newly transcribed RNA products as a time course after mitosis.

Overall levels decrease to noise levels in mitotic samples and remain low 30 min after release. However, by 60 min after release, RNA levels have increased to the levels in asynchronous samples.</p><p>To examine the role of TBP in promoting efficient reactivation, we degraded TBP in asynchronous (A) and in mitotic cells (M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>) and sequenced the chr-RNA and spike-in controls in a strand-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). A snapshot of the mapped reads of TBP-degraded samples on <italic>Gapdh</italic> and <italic>Nanog</italic> is also shown on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>. We still observe high levels of intronic reads in asynchronous (A) samples, despite near complete degradation of TBP. Our results are reminiscent of a previous study that has observed Pol II transcription in the absence of TBP in mouse blastocyst cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martianov et al., 2002</xref>). However, we observed a marked decrease in transcription reactivation in M60 samples following TBP degradation in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This decrease occurs globally as most genes show decreased nascent chr-RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>), suggesting a specific role for TBP in transcriptional reactivation following mitosis. Intriguingly, we see that TBP degradation has an effect on tRNA (Pol III genes) but not on rRNA (Pol I genes) expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Although this result may suggest differential roles for TBP among the three different polymerases, more stringent nascent RNA analysis will be needed to further inform this line of research.</p><p>To examine the kinetics of transcriptional reactivation following mitosis, we calculated the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of reads in the 30- and 60 min conditions relative to mitotically arrested samoles (M30/M and M60/M, respectively), for both untreated and TBP-degraded samples. In this way, we can observe the change in RNA levels relative to mitotic cells as a function of time after release from mitosis. Globally, the untreated M30/M sample shows no overall change in RNA levels whereas M60/M samples show massive increase in both upstream and downstream transcription at the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, TBP-degraded samples show delayed transcription levels evident in the M60/M sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if these changes are driven by differences in TBP levels, we measured the average change in RNA levels when genes are clustered by the three groups as determined by TBP ChIP-seq k-means clustering shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. We observed no effect between the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), further suggesting that the minor changes we observed by TBP ChIP-seq are likely due to changes in cyclical gene expression. We next performed unbiased k-means clustering on the untreated M30/M data with k = 3. Cluster 1 includes 5504 genes that show an increase in transcription whereas cluster 3 includes 6693 genes that show a decrease in transcription relative to mitotic cells. The remaining genes (cluster 2) show no change in transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). Ordering the M60/M data using the same three clusters shows that cluster one increases in transcription the earliest and the fastest whereas clusters 2 and 3 lag behind. We then ordered the M30/M and M60/M data from TBP-degraded samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). This analysis shows that the early changes in transcription seen in untreated samples are dampened in TBP-degraded samples with the biggest effect on cluster 1. Using GO term analysis, cluster one is enriched for genes involved in metabolism of RNA, cell cycle, and transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). These genes are also generally highly expressed in the asynchronous population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that these genes represent the global transcription program of the cells. In contrast, cluster three is enriched for genes involved in basic cellular processes such as microtubule cytoskeleton organization and regulation of GTPase activity, but also for genes involved in differentiation and development such as cell morphogenesis in differentiation, and morphogenesis of epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Furthermore, these genes tend to be less expressed than cluster one in the asynchronous population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that TBP promotes efficient reactivation of the global transcription program through cell division.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35621.021</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>TBP promotes efficient reaction of transcription following mitosis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The log<sub>2</sub> ratio of M30 and M60 reads relative to M reads were calculated for untreated and TBP-degraded samples (M30/M and M60/M, respectively).

In this study, we have shown that unlike most classical transcription factors that bind with rapid dynamics, the endogenous TBP maintains stable binding at the TSS of active genes in mitotic mESCs. Remarkably, such stable TBP binding leads to recruitment of Pol II to mitotic chromosomes, despite a global decrease in transcriptional activity. Rather, as cells exit mitosis, TBP promotes efficient reactivation of transcription globally by priming the promoters of active genes. Taken together, TBP acts as a stable bookmarker of active promoters throughout mitosis and promotes transcriptional fidelity from mother to daughter mESC.</p><p>Previous biochemical and structural data have generated static views of molecular processes, such as the formation of stable complexes or binding of factors to DNA. These static views have propagated the sense of stability. For instance, a ChIP signal for TFs has generally been viewed as a binary classification of specific loci: bound or unbound. The advent of live-cell single-molecule imaging has revolutionized our understanding of basic molecular processes, particularly, how dynamic these processes are. Many TFs examined by live-cell single-molecule imaging have shown much shorter residence times on DNA than previously expected from biochemical data. For instance, Bicoid binds to the Drosophila genome for about 100 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mir et al., 2017</xref>), p53 has an average residence time of 3–6 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loffreda et al., 2017</xref>), and Sox2 binds to specific loci in mESCs for about 12 s on average (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teves et al., 2016</xref>). We now have a much more dynamic view of repeated and rapid binding/unbinding events that ultimately affect transcriptional output. In contrast to most sequence-specific TFs, TBP seems unusual by binding to loci on the order of minutes. Although still more dynamic than previous biochemical data had suggested, this more stable mode of TBP binding may serve a specific function unique to TBP among TFs, perhaps as a more stable landing pad for the dynamic binding of various other factors that make up the transcriptional machinery. For instance, binding of both TFIIA and TFIIB are highly dependent on prior TFIID/TBP binding, and TFIIB has been shown to bind to TBP-bound promoter DNA in a highly transient manner through in vitro single molecule imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Despite the general silencing of transcription during mitosis, this relatively stable binding of TBP is maintained. Here, we have shown that TBP recruits Pol II to mitotic chromosomes and promotes efficient reactivation of transcription following mitosis, but such stable binding in mitosis may also serve other functions. Another potential function may be to promote a decondensed state of chromatin at the TSS through interactions with phosphatase PP2A, which counteracts chromatin condensation that occurs in mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xing et al., 2008</xref>). In this way, TBP may promote transcriptional fidelity through mitosis in multiple ways.</p><p>A previous study has shown that mouse blastocyst cells with homozygous deletion of the TBP locus still contain Pol II in active phosphorylation states, suggestive of active transcription in the absence of TBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martianov et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, the authors found that transcription from Pol I and Pol III are dramatically reduced without TBP, suggesting a differential dependency of the various polymerases on TBP. In this study, we have used a rapid drug-inducible depletion of TBP and measured the newly transcribed RNA after depletion. We have confirmed that Pol II transcription occurs even in the absence of TBP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), but that Pol III transcription is dramatically decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). How does Pol II transcription occur in the absence of TBP? Several mechanisms may potentially answer this question. First, TBP-like factor (TLF, also known as TBP-related factor 2 – TRF2), a closely related protein to TBP containing a similar saddle-like core domain for DNA binding, has been proposed to substitute for TBP in certain specialized cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhtar and Veenstra, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dantonel et al., 1999</xref>). However, unlike the constant expression of TBP, previous studies have shown that TLF is not expressed in early mouse embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Martianov et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2002</xref>). A second potential mechanism for TBP-independent transcription is that the SAGA complex, which shares many of the TBP-associated factors found in TFIID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baptista et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brand et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wieczorek et al., 1998</xref>), may be able to compensate for the absence of TBP once transcription is on going as in interphase. A third potential mechanism, and not mutually exclusive with the first two, is that independent mechanisms exist for the initiation of transcription and the subsequent re-initiation. Our finding that TBP depletion strongly inhibits activation of genes following mitosis is consistent with this theory. That is, the first transcription event following mitosis requires TBP, providing a rationale for TBP mitotic bookmarking, whereas subsequent transcription events throughout interphase may occur even in the absence of TBP.</p><p>Our observation that TBP recruits Pol II to mitotic chromosomes may seem surprising, given that historically, transcription has been shown to be globally decreased during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Prescott and Bender, 1962</xref>). Recent studies, however, are beginning to shed some nuance to this historical adage. For instance, several groups have shown that transcription transiently spikes at the later stages of mitosis, followed by an adjustment back to normal interphase levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hsiung et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Vaňková Hausnerová and Lanctôt, 2017</xref>). One potential mechanism for such a spike in transcriptional activity could derive from our observed recruitment of Pol II by TBP to mitotic chromosomes. Combined with the lack of crosstalk between enhancers and promoters during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsiung et al., 2015</xref>), it is possible that Pol II recruitment results in promiscuous transcriptional activation of most accessible promoters immediately following mitosis. Adding more nuance, several groups have recently shown that the global transcription pattern is retained albeit at low levels during mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>). It is possible that the small fraction of Pol II that we observe to be recruited to mitotic chromosomes is transcriptionally active, especially since these bound molecules are also sensitive to drug inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). If so, this activity must be quite transient, as we observe no detectable Pol II molecules that bind to mitotic chromosomes for longer than 30 s by slow tracking SPT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, we observe much longer residence times of Pol II during interphase when transcription is highly active. Indeed, less than 1% of mitotically bound Pol II molecules show binding for greater than 10 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), which may reflect the low transcriptional activity during mitosis as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Palozola et al., 2017</xref>). What does become evident, however, is the gradual increase in bound Pol II concomitant with increase in newly transcribed RNA as cells progress from mitosis, and the important role of TBP in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Regardless of the transcriptional activity of Pol II during mitosis per se, TBP promotes efficient reactivation of global transcription following mitosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(mouse cell line)</td><td>JM8.N4 mouse ES <break/>cells</td><td>KOMP repository</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_J962">CVCL_J962</ext-link></td><td>Parental cell line <break/>used for all genetic <break/>manipulations</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>TBP</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Abcam #ab51841; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_945758">AB_945758</ext-link></td><td>1:250 for Western; <break/>10 <italic>μ</italic>g for ChIP</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>N-20 RNA Polymerase <break/>II</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Santa Cruz #sc-899; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_632359">AB_632359</ext-link></td><td>1:250 for Western</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>8WG16 Pol II</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_785522">AB_785522</ext-link></td><td>1:250 for Western</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Flag</td><td>Sigma Aldrich</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich <break/>Cat# F3165, <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_259529">AB_259529</ext-link></td><td>1:5000 for Western</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>Halo-TBP KI C41</td><td>This paper</td><td>Halo-TBP KI C41</td><td>Endogneous knock-in <break/>of HaloTag to N-ternimal <break/>of TBP in JM8.N4 cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>mAID-TBP KI C94</td><td>This paper</td><td>mAID-TBP KI C94</td><td>Endogenous knock-in <break/>of the minimal auxin <break/>inducible degron to <break/>N-terminal of TBP in <break/>JM8.N4 cells</td></tr><tr><td>Cell line (mouse)</td><td>Halo-Pol II C64</td><td>This paper</td><td>Halo-Pol II C64</td><td>Endogenous knock-in <break/>of the HaloTag to C-terminal <break/>of Rbp1, largest subunit of <break/>Pol II, in mAID-TBP C94 cells</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay <break/>or kit</td><td>Nextera DNA Library <break/>Preparation Kit</td><td>Illumina</td><td>FC-121–1030</td><td>ATAC-seq reagent for Tn5 <break/>transposition</td></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Spot-On</td><td>doi: 10.7554/eLife. <break/>25776</td><td/><td>Spot-on software used to <break/>analyze spaSPT data</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>For all experiments, we used the mouse ES cell line JM8.N4 (RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_J962">CVCL_J962</ext-link>) obtained from the KOMP repository (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.komp.org/pdf.php?cloneID=8669">https://www.komp.org/pdf.php?cloneID=8669</ext-link>) and tested negative for mycoplasma.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A stable mode of bookmarking by TBP recruits RNA Polymerase II to mitotic chromosomes&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Aviv Regev as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, Teves et al. report the results of a series of elegant experiments aimed at elucidating the role of TBP in transcriptional reactivation after mitosis. The authors used a suite of advanced approaches, such as epitope-tagging of endogenous TBP and Pol II, various live imaging techniques, and degron-mediated depletion of endogenous TBP. These approaches provide a superior experimental approach relative to previous published work investigating TBP action during mitosis. Key results can be summarized as follows:</p><p>1) Unlike many other TFs, TBP remains strongly bound to chromatin during mitosis.</p><p>2) TBP binds to promoters of active genes during mitosis.</p><p>3) TBP is partly required for Pol II recruitment to chromatin both in interphase and mitosis.</p><p>4) In the absence of TBP, Pol II reactivation after mitosis is impaired at a large subset of genes.</p><p>The reviewers deemed the results interesting and appreciated the novel approaches employed. However, the reviewers also identified and discussed a number of major concerns, and decided to invite resubmission of a revised paper addressing these.</p><p>Reviewers noted that the novelty of the results presented needs to be better placed into the context of the published literature. Segil et al., (1996) showed that a sub-population of TBP is visible on chromosomes of mitotic cells and that TBP and TAF12 were clearly present in their highly purified mitotic chromosome preparation. Christova et al. (2002) showed that TFIID (TBP and TAF5) remains associated with active class II gene promoters during mitosis (the authors did not cite this study). Fairley et al. (2003) showed that TBP and Brf1 remain associated with purified metaphase chromosomes (the authors did not cite this study). Xing et al.

Where in the genome is the fraction of Pol II that is bound to chromatin during mitosis? Which pool of Pol II is sensitive to TBP versus sensitive to mitotic chromosome condensation? Presumably, Pol II would be depleted from gene bodies during mitosis, indicative of a shutdown in elongation and transcription, but a fraction of it would remain bound to promoters.

This could be answered with ChIP-seq for Pol II in asynchronous cells versus mitotic cells -/+ TBP. Another way of investigating this would be to look at the impact of TBP depletion on tagged Pol II after treatment with flavopiridol (an inhibitor of elongation) or tryptolide (an inhibitor of initiation).

This same team (Teves et al., 2016) showed that TBP fractionated with mitotic chromosomes, whereas Pol II did not (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 in Teves et al., 2016). In contrast, in the present study the authors show that in the heterozygous Halo-Pol II knock-in cell-line, the bound population of Halo-Pol II is 12.1% during mitosis (Results, subsection “TBP recruits RNA Polymerase II to mitotic chromosomes”, fourth paragraph). The authors should clarify this contradiction. Moreover, the effect of TBP degradation on Pol II recruitment and binding is quite mild, it changes from 12.1% in untreated mitotic cells to about 10.8% after TBP degradation. Is this change really significant? This very minor change does not support the claim that &quot;TBP recruits RNA Polymerase II to mitotic chromosomes&quot;.

Our study on TBP does not make the assumption that the observed binding of TBP during mitosis constitutes the initial bookmarking event, as defined in the traditional sense. Rather, we focus on the mechanisms of TBP stably binding to promoters during mitosis and that this binding has the functional consequence of recruiting Pol II for efficient reactivation of transcription. With discoveries showing that most TFs associate with mitotic chromosomes, the term bookmarking is evolving from an all-or-none to a continuum definition. Where TBP and the Pol II machinery fit in this continuum may remain to be decided.</p><p>To respond to this main concern further, we have broken it down by concept and addressed each one individually. Overall, we find these suggestions helpful in further understanding the mechanisms of TBP and Pol II action during and after mitosis, and we think the results support the main conclusions presented in the manuscript on the role of TBP in reactivating global transcription. However, we have toned down our interpretation that “TBP is required for bookmarking … to preserve cell identity” throughout the manuscript because as the reviewers point out, we do not have direct evidence on maintenance of cell identity per se to fully support this interpretation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These issues can be addressed experimentally with technologies already used in the manuscript.

In summary, TBP depletion shows some minor effects on promoter chromatin architecture, suggesting that the major determinants of promoter chromatin architecture are largely independent of TBP. We also found that most sequence specific TF binding sites remain unaffected upon TBP depletion, as would be expected (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second issue within this same framework revolves around the interpretation of the impact of TBP depletion on recruitment of Pol II during interphase and mitosis.

We had previously performed ChIP-seq for Pol II (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) but we could not distinguish whether the remaining signal that we observed was due to the ~5% contaminating interphase cells in our mitotic prep. Furthermore, we also could not rule out potential effects of formaldehyde crosslinking on the mitotic ChIP. Instead, we turned to live-cell single molecule imaging. To address the reviewers’ comments, we redid all of our imaging experiments using a more sensitive dye and imaging set up (using far-red dye and lasers), and included Triptolide and Flavopiridol drug treatments with and without TBP degradation in interphase and mitotic cells. Also, instead of the table summarizing these results, we have included figures showing the fraction bound for each single cell that we analyzed (32 cells total, 8 technical replicates over 4 biological replicates – Figure 5A, B), and statistical analyses showing significant changes in the highlighted experiments. To summarize the results presented in the manuscript, we show that 1) our tagged Pol II is sensitive to inhibitors in both interphase and mitotic cells, suggesting that, even in mitosis, there exists a population of Pol II that is actively engaged; and 2) inhibitor treatment combined with TBP degradation during mitosis (Figure 5B, Mit+IAA vs. Mit+IAA+Flav, Mit+IAA+Trip) has no significant effect on the small remaining fraction of bound Pol II molecules, suggesting that the majority of <italic>specific</italic> Pol II interactions during mitosis is TBP-dependent.

For several reasons, we disagree that our previous result (Teves et al., 2016) is necessarily a contradiction to our claims in the current manuscript. First, from the current study, we found that the small fraction of Pol II molecules that bind during mitosis has an average residence time of 5-8 seconds, making Pol II much more dynamic in mitosis compared to interphase (Figure 5B, C). This increase in dynamics likely affected Pol II during the mitotic chromosome purification in our 2016 study. The second reason relates to Part 2 of this comment. We agree that the majority of the ‘bound’ Pol II that we observe is largely non-specific interactions between Pol II and DNA/chromatin in general, and that the small fraction that changes when TBP is degraded is likely the fraction that specifically interacts with promoter DNA. Since promoters make up a very small fraction of the genome, it is not surprising that the number of Pol II molecules that specifically interacts with promoters in mitosis would be small. It is likely that what we would observe in the biochemical fractionation of mitotic chromosomes from our previous study is the stripping away of non-specific chromatin associations by our stringent washing and that our Western blots were not sensitive enough to detect the small fraction of specific binding events that the single molecule imaging was able to reveal.</p><p>Part 2 (“Moreover, the effect of TBP degradation […] tone down their overstated conclusions.”). After improving the imaging method (see response to Major concern point #3), our data now show that the average fraction of bound Pol II in mitosis is 15.39% (SEM 0.56) while after TBP degradation, the fraction bound decreases to 11.84% (SEM 0.51). After statistical analyses, this difference has a p-value &lt; 0.05 (t-test). These results suggest that TBP does recruit a subset of Pol II molecules to mitotic chromosomes. However, we agree with the reviewers that we should be more careful in not overstating our conclusions, and we have made changes to the manuscript to reflect this. We have changed the heading of the section to “TBP recruits a subset of RNA Polymerase II molecules to mitotic chromosomes” and point out in the text that non-specific interactions dominate the fraction of bound Pol II in mitosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, when analyzing the effects of mitotic TBP binding/depletion on the transcriptional reactivation rate (in Figure 6 or Figure 7), could the authors see any difference between Group 1, 2, 3 genes (as defined in Figure 3D)?</p></disp-quote><p>For the new analyses included in the revised manuscript, we performed differential peak analysis on the TBP ChIP-seq data using DiffBind (new Figure 3A, B) and found that the majority of the peaks in asynchronous and mitotic cells are not significantly different from each other (new Figure 3A and B), suggesting that the differences that we observed by k-means clustering (old Figure 3D), are minor level changes. Indeed, in our GO term analysis of the genes in these groups, we see similar classes of genes and we concluded that “the differences in TBP binding that we observe by ChIP-seq largely reflect the cyclical expression of genes during the cell cycle.” With this in mind, we performed the analysis requested by the reviewer, comparing the RNA data on Groups 1, 2, and 3 from the TBP ChIP-seq. We plotted the heatmap of the log<sub>2</sub> ratio of reads in the 30- and 60-minute conditions relative to mitotically arrested (M30/M and M60/M, respectively), for both untreated and TBP-degraded samples using the 3 groups as defined in TBP ChIP-seq data. In general, we see no differences in the amount of RNA in groups 1 and 3, whereas group 2 shows much lower levels. Based on our GO term analysis of these groups, this seemed like the expected result. We have included this analysis as a new supplemental figure (Figure 7—figure supplement 2), and added the appropriate reference in the Results section of the main manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Need for further insight about which TBP-containing complex impacts on Pol II reactivation after mitosis.

This would provide more novelty over published work.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question posed by the reviewers. We reasoned that our chrRNA-seq data may shed some light into this question. Upon further analysis of our chrRNA-seq data, we observe that tRNA genes show a large decrease in reactivation upon TBP depletion in mitosis, suggesting that RNA Polymerase III activity is also affected by TBP degradation in mitosis. We performed a similar analysis on ribosomal RNA genes (RNA Polymerase I-transcribed genes), but we see little change upon TBP depletion during mitosis. However, this result may reflect the stability of ribosomal RNA in mitotic cells. Because our assay relies on enrichment of nascent RNA through chromatin association, it is possible that effects of TBP degradation on nascent rRNAs may be masked in our assay. These results are now summarized in Figure 6—figure supplement 3 and in the Results section of the manuscript. However, we chose not to elaborate on these results as they are somewhat outside the scope of the current manuscript, but we will likely pursue these effects in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Asynchronous versus mitotic cells.

To further quantify the purity of our mitotic preps using orthogonal methods, we imaged H2B-GFP after Nocodazole synchronization and shake off, and individually scored each cell as either mitotic or interphase (n=1075 cells). This data is now summarized in the new Figure 3—figure supplement 1, which shows that our mitotic prep typically achieves ~96% purity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
