family of enzymes that synthesise ADP-ribosylation (ADPr), a reversible modification of proteins that regulates many different cellular processes. Several mammalian PARPs are known to regulate the DNA damage response, but it is not clear which amino acids in proteins are the primary ADPr targets. Previously, we reported that ARH3 reverses the newly discovered type of ADPr (ADPr on serine residues; Ser-ADPr) and developed tools to analyse this modification (Fontana et al., 2017). Here, we show that Ser-ADPr represents the major fraction of ADPr synthesised after DNA damage in mammalian cells and that globally Ser-ADPr is dependent on HPF1, PARP1 and ARH3. In the absence of HPF1, glutamate/aspartate becomes the main target residues for ADPr. Furthermore, we describe a method for site-specific validation of serine ADP-ribosylated substrates in cells. Our study establishes serine as the primary form of ADPr in DNA damage signalling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PARP</kwd><kwd>ADP-ribosylation</kwd><kwd>ARH3</kwd><kwd>DNA damage</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>enzyme</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005010</institution-id><institution>Associazione Italiana per la Ricerca sul Cancro</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>14895</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Palazzo</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000289</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C35050/A22284</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>657501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101794</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahel</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EXC 229</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahel</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>281739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahel</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Serine residues in proteins are the primary targets for PARP-dependent ADP-ribosylation signalling upon DNA damage.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>ADP-ribosylation (ADPr) is a reversible evolutionarily conserved posttranslational modification of proteins, which controls many critical cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Palazzo et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lüscher et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) compose the major family of enzymes that catalyse the transfer of ADP-ribose unit(s) from NAD<sup>+</sup> to protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barkauskaite et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>). Seventeen members of the PARP superfamily are encoded within the human genome, which are characterized by distinct structural domains, activities and involvement in a variety of cellular processes, including the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>). PARPs directly involved in DNA repair are PARP1, PARP2, and PARP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Langelier and Pascal, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martin-Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While PARP3 can attach only a single ADP-ribose unit on target proteins (MARylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Vyas et al., 2014</xref>), PARP1 and PARP2 can extend the initial ADPr event into long chains that remain attached on the proteins (Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, PARylation) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">D'Amours et al., 1999</xref>). PARP-dependent ADPr of these proteins is induced by binding of PARPs to DNA breaks, which produces timely and localised ADPr signals that control appropriate DDR mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Langelier et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>PARPs have previously been described to mainly target acidic residues (glutamates and aspartates; Glu and Asp, respectively) in proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gagné et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crawford et al., 2018</xref>). However, we recently showed that serine (Ser) residues are also targets for PARP-dependent protein modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Crawford et al., 2018</xref>) and that Ser ADP-ribosylation (Ser-ADPr) is involved in processes underlying genome stability and the DDR, in particular (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). Furthermore, we showed that the DNA damage responsive protein <underline>H</underline>istone <underline>P</underline>ARylation <underline>F</underline>actor-1 (HPF1/C4orf27) forms complexes with either PARP1 or PARP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>) and promotes the synthesis of Ser-ADPr on a variety of protein substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). Finally, we discovered ARH3/ADPRHL2 as a hydrolase responsible for the specific reversal of Ser-ADPr in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Our previous observations suggested that Ser-ADPr is a widespread form of ADPr in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). Here, by using a combination of biochemical and cell biology approaches, we demonstrate that the bulk of ADPr synthesised in cultured mammalian cells is strictly dependent on HPF1 and that Ser-ADPr represents the most abundant form of ADPr after DNA damage in these cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>ADPr of proteins rapidly occurs to recruit and control activities of many crucial proteins involved in the repair of damaged DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Martin-Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). The study of ADPr has been significantly hampered by technical limitations, such as the barriers to visualize all forms of cellular ADPr and the challenges in proteomics analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Vivelo and Leung, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonfiglio et al., 2017b</xref>). For example, until recently, only anti-PAR antibodies have been available, which can detect only the long PAR chains. However, recently a reagent specific for ADPr of any length (referred here as a pan-ADPr antibody) as well as a reagent specific for mono-ADPr have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibson et al., 2017</xref>) and allowed us to follow protein ADPr events in cells upon DNA damage. We first exposed human osteosarcoma U2OS to the DNA damaging agent hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) and compared the ADPr pattern of control, ARH3 knock-out (KO), HPF1 KO and PARP1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In control cells, pan-ADPr signals after DNA damage revealed a number of modified proteins in the extract. The most easily identifiable signals relate to the modification of histone proteins as well as PARP automodification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Both signals can also be recognised by the reagent that is specific for MARylation (referred here as a mono-ADPr antibody; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibson et al., 2017</xref>). 2 hr after DNA damage the global ADPr signal is reduced to the levels comparable to untreated cells. However, importantly, the DNA damage-inducible ADPr is prevented in HPF1-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as we observed previously for specific histone substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). An exception is the auto-modification of PARP1 that is characterized by relatively longer ADPr chains (although also at overall lower levels) when compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as noted previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016</xref>). Expectedly, most of the global ADPr signal was abolished in PARP1 KO cells, as we showed previously for histone Ser-ADPr marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>), confirming that PARP1 is the most active PARP involved in DDR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In order to investigate whether the global pan-ADPr is truly dependent on HPF1, we tested two independent clones of HPF1 KO cells and observed comparable results with both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These data suggest that global ADPr in response to DNA damage requires both HPF1 and PARP1.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34334.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>HPF1-dependent Ser-ADPr is the major form of ADPr upon genotoxic stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control, ARH3 KO (ARH3<sup>−/−</sup>), HPF1 KO (HPF1<sup>−/−</sup>), and PARP1 KO (PARP1<sup>−/−</sup>) U2OS cells were treated with 2 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

However, the difference in ADPr signal upon DNA damage was much more pronounced and allowed detection of a number of additional ADP-ribosylated protein bands in ARH3-deficient extracts that persisted for at least 2 hr. This was especially obvious for histone ADPr detected by the pan-ADPr reagent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we used another DNA damaging agent, the alkylating agent methyl methanesulfonate (MMS). U2OS cells were treated with MMS, and then their recovery was analysed at 40’ and 120’ time points. Consistent with the observations for H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, most of the ADPr signal was HPF1-dependent and persisted in ARH3-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>In order to validate our observations in other cellular models, we next tested the human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cells. To confirm whether ADPr is HPF1-dependent in these cells, we challenged wild type and HPF1-depleted HEK293 cells with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Notably, HEK293 cells showed a number of ADP-ribosylated proteins detected by pan-ADPr antibody and modifications of most of these proteins were strictly dependent on HPF1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>The dependence of ADPr regulation on HPF1 and ARH3 suggests that Ser-ADPr is the dominant form of ADPr upon DNA damage. This is consistent with the data from recent proteomic analyses capable of detecting Ser-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilan et al., 2017</xref>). However, proteomics studies based on hydroxylamine, which excludes ADPr mapping on residues other than the Glu and Asp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moss et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniels et al., 2015</xref>), showed that modification of these residues is widespread in DDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gibson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zhen et al., 2017</xref>). We reasoned that hydroxylamine could allow a direct and simple estimate of the abundance of the modification on Glu/Asp in the context of the global ADPr. Importantly, using defined substrates for both Ser-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>) and Glu/Asp-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sharifi et al., 2013</xref>), we showed by autoradiography that hydroxylamine does not remove ADPr from Ser residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) while confirming the complete removal of ADPr from Glu/Asp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Considering the above data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>) that imply the predominance of Ser-ADPr upon DNA damage, we hypothesized that the loss of signal after hydroxylamine treatment would be minor in wild type cells. To test this, we incubated hydroxylamine with proteins extracted under denaturing conditions from both control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>–treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) cells and monitored the ADPr signal with the anti-pan-ADPr and anti-PAR antibodies. We observed no noticeable loss of either the global ADPr or PARylation signal in DNA-damaged cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and only a moderate reduction in untreated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that under these conditions Glu/Asp-ADPr is not abundant. In contrast, intriguingly, hydroxylamine completely abolished both the global ADPr and PAR signals on proteins extracted from HPF1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>), implying that in the absence of HPF1 virtually all the ADPr is on acidic residues. This cellular finding is in accordance with the well-established biochemical evidence that Asp and Glu are the prevalent target residues when in vitro ADPr reactions are performed without HPF1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Tao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sharifi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34334.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>HPF1-dependent ADPr is resistant to hydroxylamine.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Autoradiogram shows serine ADPr of two synthetic peptides (wild type (WT) or Ser10Ala (S10A) mutant) corresponding to amino acids 1–21 of human H3 by wild type PARP1 or PARP1 E988Q in the presence of HPF1, with or without treatment with 1M NH<sub>2</sub>OH (hydroxylamine).

In our previous studies, we identified by mass spectrometry ADPr of H2B exclusively on Ser residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>) and showed that this modification is highly dependent on HPF1 in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). Here, we set to investigate whether Ser-ADPr is the primary form of ADPr on histone H2B. To test this, we generated mammalian expression constructs where H2B was tagged with the Flag epitope as well as a version of Flag-tagged H2B where the main candidate ADPr site, Ser6 was mutated to alanine (S6A). Both wild type and S6A Flag-tagged H2B constructs were transiently transfected into control and HPF1-depleted HEK293 cells. Whilst the Flag-tagged wild type H2B was efficiently ADP-ribosylated upon H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment in control cells, the H2B ADPr signal was completely abolished in HPF1 KO HEK293 cells, as shown in both whole cell extracts and Flag-immunoprecipitations (IP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>, respectively). In addition, the S6A mutant did not show any ADPr in both control and HPF1-depleted cells. These data demonstrate that Ser residue at position six is the main acceptor site of ADPr on H2B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>) and confirm that this Ser-ADPr is HPF1-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34334.004</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Serine six is the main ADPr site of histone H2B induced by DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Control and HPF1 KO (HPF1<sup>−/−</sup>) HEK293 cells were transfected or not with Flag-H2B wild type (wt) and Flag-H2B Ser6Ala mutant construct (S6A). 24 hr post-transfection, cells were treated with 2 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. After treatment/recovery, cells were lysed and proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE, analysed by western blot and probed for pan-ADPr, Flag, and HPF1 antibodies.

In our previous study, we detected H3 ADPr sites in cells on Ser10 and Ser28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Leidecker et al., 2016</xref>), so we prepared the constructs for the expression of the Flag-tagged H3 wild type protein, the H3 alanine mutants at Ser10 (S10A) and Ser28 (S28A), as well as the double mutant (S10A S28A). Flag-IP of the Flag-tagged proteins expressed in HEK293 cells and subsequent western blot against pan-ADPr revealed that the mutation of both Ser10 and Ser28 on H3 abolishes the DNA damage-induced H3 ADPr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that in our conditions ADPr predominantly happens on the Ser10 site, while the mutation of Ser28 showed a small, but significant reduction of ADPr. In conclusion, the expression of wild type and Ser-ADPr mutants in HEK293 cells by this simple approach should allow the validation of Ser-ADPr sites for many other ADP-ribosylated candidate proteins involved in the DDR.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34334.005</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Serine 10 and serine 28 are the main ADPr sites of histone H3 induced by DNA damage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HEK293 cells were transfected or not with Flag-H3.1 (Flag-H3) wild type (wt), Flag-H3.1 Ser10Ala (S10A), Flag-H3.1 Ser28Ala (S28A), and Flag-H3.1 Ser10Ala Ser28Ala double mutant (S10A S28A) constructs. 24 hr post-transfection, cells were treated with 2 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

Glu, Asp, Lys, Arg and Ser have been indicated as the major ADPr target residues by recent proteomics studies, some of which, however, employ sub-optimal approaches that may lead to misassignment of ADPr specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonfiglio et al., 2017b</xref>). Thus, the attention is currently shifting from mere identification of ADPr sites to the elucidation of the biological pathways in which a form of ADPr plays a major role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gupte et al., 2017</xref>). Our discovery of Ser-ADPr in 2016 has fuelled the rapid progress in the field, which has already resulted in the identification of the ‘eraser’ of Ser-ADPr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontana et al., 2017</xref>). Our computational reanalysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Matic et al., 2012</xref>) of a published ADPr dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Martello et al., 2016</xref>); ProteomeXchange ID: PXD004245) showed that Ser-ADPr is a widespread modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>). This has stimulated the current study, in which we address the abundance of Ser-ADPr in cells. Our findings show that in endogenous wild type cells Ser-ADPr is the primary form of ADPr upon DNA damage. This is consistent with the data from an independent study, in which an unbiased proteomics technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonfiglio et al., 2017b</xref>) showed that the vast majority of ADPr localises on Ser residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilan et al., 2017</xref>). Importantly, our data indicate that Asp and Glu are the main targets of ADPr in PARP1-dependent, but HPF1-independent DNA damage signalling. This extends the concept of the ‘switching’ of PARP1 amino acid specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bonfiglio et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leung, 2017</xref>) to the cellular context.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript provides compelling data that supports ADP-ribosylation of serine residues as the major outcome of PARP1 activity during the DNA damage response. The paper will serve as a nice addition to the previously published paper identifying ARH3 as the enzyme that reverses the Ser-ADPr modification. The current study is important because it will highlight the prevalence of the serine modification during the DNA damage response, and could lead the field to re-focus on this type of modification, rather than just the Glu/Asp modification. In that regard, this is a valuable contribution to the literature and is worth publishing.</p><p>There are few experiments that need to be conducted.</p><p>1) The authors state that the major fraction of ADP-ribosylation occurs on serines after DNA damage. To substantiate the findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> that shows HPF1-dependent serine ADP-ribosylation of H2B, the authors should test whether knockout of HPF1 indeed abolishes serine 6 ADP ribosylation in vivo using MS. To what extent does Glu/Asp become the main ADP-ribose acceptors in the absence of HPF1? H2B does not appear to become ADP-ribosylated at all in the absence of HPF1, while PARP1 does. Is there any unbiased study addressing this switch in target residues?</p><p>2) Is serine-ADP ribosylation of other histones or additional main targets previously reported by authors such as HMGA1, HMGB1, HMGN1, NPM1, and TMA7 also dependent on HPF1. These experiments should be done in order to demonstrate that serine ADP ribosylation is the major fraction of ADP ribosylation after DNA damage.</p><p>3) What are the 'readers' of Ser-ADPr? This is referenced in the penultimate paragraph of the Results and Discussion section, but it is not clear what proteins carry out the specific reading of Ser-ADPr. A reference would be helpful here. The &quot;erasers&quot; of Ser-ADPr are more clear since the ARH3 enzyme is implied. It would be great to use ARH3 enzyme (as has been done in the previous <italic>eLife</italic> paper) to validate ADP-ribosylation on serine next to hydroxylamine (validating ADPr on Glu/Asp) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p><p>4) The use of wild-type and S6A histone H2B is a nice example of specific ADPr modification, and there are not many examples in the literature specific ADPr sites confirmed in vivo. Are there other examples (e.g. other histones) that could be included in this study to solidify the technique and add important confirmed sites to the literature?</p><p>5) It is interesting to see that the level of basal/untreated ADP-ribosylation is often (at least on the used cell extracts) more than the levels detected upon recovery from DNA damage. Could the authors comment on this phenomenon? Also, while the study focuses on DNA damage-induced ADP-ribosylation, are you able to address which residues are predominantly modified in the untreated cells?</p><p>In summary, all reviewers were very favorable and kindly ask for the 4-5 points raised to be addressed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34334.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are few experiments that need to be conducted.</p><p>1) The authors state that the major fraction of ADP-ribosylation occurs on serines after DNA damage.

However, in our previous publication (Bonfiglio et al., 2017a) we have performed an unbiased mass spectrometric analysis of in vitro ADPr reactions addressing the switch in target residues on PARP-1 itself. In the current manuscript, our data show that the majority of ADPr under both basal and DNA-damage stimulus happens on Ser residues and that most of Ser-ADPr is lost in the absence of HPF1 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). Without HPF1 PARP1 is automodified significantly on the acidic residues and the average chain length substantially increases, while we cannot detect significant glutamate ADPr on histone in the same conditions. This is not surprising, since in the absence of HPF1 histone ADPr is effectively lost (while PARP1 becomes hyper-PARylated), as previously shown by us (Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Is serine-ADP ribosylation of other histones or additional main targets previously reported by authors such as HMGA1, HMGB1, HMGN1, NPM1, and TMA7 also dependent on HPF1.

ADPr of those target proteins was HPF1-dependent. In the same publication, we also showed that Ser-ADPr is lost on H3, H4, H1 and PARP1 in HPF1 KO cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) What are the 'readers' of Ser-ADPr? This is referenced in the penultimate paragraph of the Results and Discussion section, but it is not clear what proteins carry out the specific reading of Ser-ADPr. A reference would be helpful here. The &quot;erasers&quot; of Ser-ADPr are more clear since the ARH3 enzyme is implied. It would be great to use ARH3 enzyme (as has been done in the previous eLife paper) to validate ADP-ribosylation on serine next to hydroxylamine (validating ADPr on Glu/Asp) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.</p></disp-quote><p>The “readers” of Ser-ADPr are not known at the moment (we are sorry if our text was misleading, we have rewritten it) and this is another exciting area to explore in the future.</p><p>We have performed the requested experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and we noted that ARH3 removes the ADPr signal from both the wildtype and the HPF1 KO samples. This is not surprising, considering that it is well known that ARH3 removes poly-ADPr chains and that the absence of HPF1 leads to hyperPARylation (formation of very long chains of ADPr largely on PARP-1 itself), as shown by us previously (Gibbs-Seymour et al., 2016). In fact, treatment with PARG, which removes polyADPr without removing the terminal unit of ADPr, gives identical result in HPF1 KO samples (last lane). The complete loss of the ADPr in the HPF1 KO sample with either PARG or ARH3 might be surprising in the first instance. However, it is important to keep in mind that ADPr polymers can be extremely long (up to 200 units). Thus, by assuming that the average ADPr polymer contains 100 units of ADPr, the amount of ADPr that remains after the treatment with either ARH3 or PARG would be two orders of magnitude lower. Based on our experience with the anti-pan reagent, which is not very sensitive, it does not surprise us that this amount of ADPr does not give any detectable signal. In control cells, however, the amount of mono-ADPr seems to be a lot higher (with many more different sites modified), as supported by the PARG treatment experiment, therefore the ADPr signal is still detected.</p><p>We have performed this experiment for the reviewers, but we have decided not to include it in the manuscript, as the interpretation of this blot is very complicated (especially for non-specialist readers) and can, therefore, lead to misunderstanding of our message.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34334.008</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34334-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The use of wild-type and S6A histone H2B is a nice example of specific ADPr modification, and there are not many examples in the literature specific ADPr sites confirmed in vivo.

The results fully support the previous data, and demonstrate that most of the main acceptor sites of ADPr on H3 is on Ser10 position and that there is also some ADPr targeting Ser28 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Ser10 and Ser28 are the only ADP-ribosylation sites on histone H3 identified in our previous study (Leidecker et al., 2016) and the mutation of both residues completely abolished ADPr of histone H3 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, this result shows that our technique will be very useful for the confirmation of in vivo ADPr sites for different proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is interesting to see that the level of basal/untreated ADP-ribosylation is often (at least on the used cell extracts) more than the levels detected upon recovery from DNA damage.

The fact that ADPr signal is often higher in the untreated samples than in the post-treated samples is likely due to upregulation of hydrolases in response to high doses of DNA damaging agents (as for example documented for PARG, which actively translocates to the nucleus upon DNA damage).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, while the study focuses on DNA damage-induced ADP-ribosylation, are you able to address which residues are predominantly modified in the untreated cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the experiment and as shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, serine residues are the residues predominantly modified even under basal condition.</p></body></sub-article></article>
