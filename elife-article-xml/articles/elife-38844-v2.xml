However, it is unknown whether this common behavioral abnormality is a continuum explained by a neural mechanism shared across diseases or a set of discrete dysfunctions. Here, we performed predictive modeling to examine working memory ability (WMA) as a function of normative whole-brain connectivity across psychiatric diseases. We built a quantitative model for letter three-back task performance in healthy participants, using resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI). This normative model was applied to independent participants (<italic>N</italic> = 965) including four psychiatric diagnoses. Individual’s predicted WMA significantly correlated with a measured WMA in both healthy population and schizophrenia. Our predicted effect size estimates on WMA impairment were comparable to previous meta-analysis results. These results suggest a general association between brain connectivity and working memory ability applicable commonly to health and psychiatric diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>working memory</kwd><kwd>rs-fMRI</kwd><kwd>functional connectivity</kwd><kwd>prediction model</kwd><kwd>biomarkers</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009538</institution-id><institution>Council for Science, Technology and Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ImPACT Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamashita</surname><given-names>Masahiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Kawato</surname><given-names>Mitsuo</given-names></name><name><surname>Imamizu</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Brain/MINDS</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kasai</surname><given-names>Kiyoto</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seymour</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000341</institution-id><institution>Arthritis Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Seymour</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001700</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>‘Development of BMI Technologies for Clinical Application’ of the Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences and JP18dm0307008</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawato</surname><given-names>Mitsuo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAKENHI 26120002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Imamizu</surname><given-names>Hiroshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Human neuroimaging and machine learning reveals a generalizable relationship between brain connectivity and working memory ability across healthy populations and distinct psychiatric diagnoses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Working memory is a goal-directed active information maintenance and manipulation in mind, forming a foundation for diverse complex cognitive functions, learning, and emotion regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baddeley, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cowan, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Etkin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Otto et al., 2013</xref>). A range of psychiatric disorders commonly shows working memory deficits, although the severity of the deficits is dependent of psychiatric diagnosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Forbes et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lever et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Millan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Snyder, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Snyder et al., 2015</xref>). Working memory emerges by coordinating multiple related processes from sensory perception, cognitive control (e.g. updating, focused attention), to motor action and thus requires close communication among widespread brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Esposito and Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eriksson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Owen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Postle, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rottschy et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Functional connectivity (FC) quantifies how brain regions are temporally coordinated and is increasingly used to examine brain network architecture. Resting state (i.e. task-free) FC has been associated with a wide range of individual traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baldassarre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lewis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>). For example, whole-brain FC models have recently demonstrated that sets of functional connections across widespread brain regions can predict performance on cognitive tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>). These findings suggest that specific cognitive processes (e.g. memory, attention) may be represented by the corresponding interaction patterns among distributed brain networks, at least among healthy populations.</p><p>Functional connectivity has also provided insight into the biological basis of psychiatric disorders and shown that different diagnoses are related to unique patterns of FC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yahata et al., 2016</xref>). For example, a whole-brain FC-based model has been shown to reliably predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD), as well as individual clinical scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emerson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lake et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yahata et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting that FC disruption is quantitatively relevant to behavioral abnormality. More broadly, this suggests that a specific relationship between FC and behavior might exist across many disparate diagnoses that have common symptoms, such as impairments in working memory.</p><p>With the above issues in mind, we set out to examine competing hypotheses about the relationship between FC and working memory ability (WMA) across healthy populations and a range of psychiatric diagnoses. In this study, we define working memory ability simply as a summary index of general working memory performance, without specializing sensory modality and underlying sub-functions. The first hypothesis proposes a distinct FC-WMA relationship for each diagnosis, rationalized by the fact that each psychiatric diagnosis is characterized by differential alterations in FC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kaiser et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yahata et al., 2016</xref>). This hypothesis predicts that the FC-WMA relationship among healthy populations will fail to generalize in predicting impairments across different diagnoses. The alternative hypothesis proposes a common FC-WMA relationship across health and multiple diagnoses. The rationale for this hypothesis is that previous studies have suggested that several cognitive functions, such as attention and memory, generalize to predict behavior in patients as well as in healthy populations (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kessler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Halloran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>). This hypothesis predicts that a FC-WMA relationship estimated from whole-brain functional connections in healthy populations will generalize to predict working memory impairment across diagnoses.</p><p>To test these hypotheses, we built a prediction model of working memory ability in a letter 3-back task using whole-brain FC among a healthy population. Then, we examined whether the model was predictive of individual differences in behaviorally measured working memory ability not only in healthy individuals but also in individuals with schizophrenia. Moreover, we examined whether the model was predictive of group differences in working memory ability among four different psychiatric diagnoses by comparing the predicted effect sizes across diagnoses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Design</title><p>We constructed a prediction model of working memory ability among healthy individuals recruited at ATR (Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute International), Japan (ATR dataset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test its generalizability, independently collected resting state fMRI (rs-fMRI) was entered into this model to predict individual working memory ability. Specifically, we applied the model to independent test datasets of healthy individuals in the USA (the Human Connectome Project dataset, HCP dataset) and schizophrenia patients and their controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The predicted working memory ability was compared with actually measured working memory score. We emphasize that these individual differences analyses were performed to examine the relative (i.e. the ability to differentiate between good and bad performers), not absolute accuracy of the prediction model (i.e. the ability to predict specific level of performance). Moreover, the model was applied to patients with psychiatric diagnoses including schizophrenia (SCZ), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), and ASD and also their age- and gender-matched healthy/typically developed controls (multiple psychiatric diagnoses dataset; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The effect size estimates of predicted working memory impairments were compared with that of behaviorally observed ones reported in previous meta-analysis studies. We note that individual behavioral scores on working memory ability were available in schizophrenia cohort but not available in other psychiatric diagnoses, and that the same SCZ dataset was analyzed from an individual difference perspective as well as a group-level difference perspective (see below).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38844.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of model construction and generalization tests using independent datasets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model was developed using a whole-brain resting state FC and a learning plateau of a letter 3-back task within healthy individuals from ATR dataset.

The participants performed a letter 3-back task for about 25 sessions (80–90 min). Working memory ability was quantified by estimating a learning plateau in this task as follows. An individual learning curve was obtained by calculating d-prime for each session, and by smoothing the data points with five-session moving average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The individual learning curve was fitted by an inverse curve (<italic>y</italic> = <italic>a – b</italic>/<italic>x</italic>), where <italic>y</italic> is a d-prime in the <italic>x</italic>-th session, while <italic>a</italic> and <italic>b</italic> is a parameter for learning plateau and learning speed, respectively. We collected resting state fMRI data from each participant, and estimated whole-brain functional connectivity. We used network-level rather than node-level connectivity features to avoid overfitting to training samples (the curse of dimensionality). Specifically, we calculated FC values, based on 18 whole-brain intrinsic networks of BrainMap ICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laird et al., 2011</xref>), for pair-wise between-network (18 × 17/2 = 153) connections and within-network connections.</p><p>To evaluate test-retest reliability of this functional connectivity estimation method, we calculated intra-class correlation (ICC) using three external datasets: Beijing Normal University (BNU 1), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS 1), and University of Utah (Utah 1). As a result, we obtained ICC values 0.34 ± 0.12 (range 0 to 0.65) for BNU 1, 0.26 ± 0.18 (range 0 to 0.66) for IACAS 1, and 0.21 ± 0.17 (range 0 to 0.59) for Utah one datasets. We found ICC values for the left FPN/right FPN: 0.28/0.23, 0.49/0.47, and 0.11/0.03 for BNU 1, IACAS 1, and Utah one dataset, respectively. According to an interpretation criteria of ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Landis and Koch, 1977</xref>), our connectivity estimation methods yielded ‘fair’ reliability (0.2 &lt; ICC ≤ 0.4) for the three datasets. These results suggest that test-retest reliability of our methods are comparable to other common connectivity estimation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birn et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noble et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Using sparse linear regression, individual letter 3-back learning plateaus were modeled as a linear weighted summation of automatically selected 16 functional connectivity values among 15 intrinsic networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In contrast, the effect sizes of working-memory deficits (as measured by digit-span task) can be ordered as SCZ, MDD and OCD, which is consistent with the order predicted by our model. Therefore, predicted working-memory deficits were more similar to observed deficits in working memory than those in fluid intelligence. We identified no significant differences in head motion between patients and their healthy controls in any diagnosis (two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests, at largest <italic>t</italic><sub>138</sub> = 1.77, p &gt; 0.080 observed in ASD group).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Functional connectivity patterns in psychiatric diagnoses</title><p>Given a common FC-WMA relationship across these diagnoses, we examined how diagnosis-dependent working memory impairment resulted from FC alteration patterns. Since the model is the weighted summation of 16 FC values, increased/decreased working memory ability is determined by the sum of the increased/decreased weighted-FC values of the connections. To investigate the effect of FC alteration at each connection on working memory impairment, for each individual patient, we examined the difference in weighted-FC value at each connection from the average of the corresponding controls. We call this difference the <italic>D</italic>-score (see Materials and methods). By averaging the <italic>D</italic>-scores within each diagnosis, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> shows how the accumulation of diagnosis-dependent <italic>D</italic>-scores resulted in difference in working memory impairment across the diagnoses. Some <italic>D</italic>-scores are relatively constant, while others are variable across diagnoses.

SCZ patients showed significantly more negative mean <italic>Z</italic>-scores across connections than the other diagnoses (post-hoc diagnosis-pair-wise comparisons, p &lt; 0.05).

Conversely, no significant differences in the <italic>Z</italic>-scores were observed across diagnoses in the remaining nine connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, we examined whether the working memory ability-related 16 connections were more consistently altered in patients relative to controls than connections excluded from the model. Specifically, we first quantified the effect of diagnostic labels on connectivity alterations for every connection by using chi-square values of a Kruskal-Wallis test (a non-parametric version of one-way ANOVA). Then, we tested if the distribution of the chi-square values was different between the model’s 16 connections and other 155 connections (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test). Consequently, we found no significant difference between the distributions (p = 0.30). This means that connectivity is altered at the working memory ability-related connections as well as the other connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To understand these results from global brain networks, we grouped the 18 networks into seven clusters based on the hierarchical clustering of the networks performed in the BrainMap ICA study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laird et al., 2011</xref>). They were named fronto-parietal, motor/visuospatial, emotion/interoception, audition/speech, visual, cerebellum and default-mode clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We selected connections bridging between different clusters. We then fixed a cluster and summed <italic>D</italic>-scores (averaged across participants of each diagnosis) of the connections that have nodes (networks) in the cluster. This summation was repeated for every cluster. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> shows the summed <italic>D</italic>-score for each cluster and diagnosis. The four diagnoses commonly showed altered connectivity related to the fronto-parietal cluster. This confirmed importance of the fronto-parietal networks across diagnosis. The motor/visuospatial, audition/speech, and visual clusters are associated with lower working memory in schizophrenia and MDD. This suggests that dysfunctions in motor and sensory systems are related to lower working memory in specific diagnoses. Note that we could not find any connections that have a node in the default-mode cluster, which does not appear in the figure.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We built a prediction model of working memory ability using data-driven analysis of whole-brain connectivity among healthy Japanese individuals. Our model predicted individual differences of working memory ability in SCZ patients. It also reproduced the order of working memory impairment for four distinct diagnoses (i.e., SCZ &gt; MDD &gt; OCD &gt; ASD). Moreover, the magnitudes of reproduced impairment were consistent with previous meta-analyses. Our results provide the first evidence for a common whole-brain FC-WMA relationship across healthy populations and a range of psychiatric disorders. That is, our results support the idea that working memory impairment in psychiatric disorders is a continuous deviation from a normal pattern while preserving the common relationship between brain-wide connectivity and working memory ability. Our detailed examination suggested that the difference in degrees of the impairment across the diagnoses results from both common and diagnosis-specific connectivity changes within the common FC-WMA relationship.</p><p>Our model’s generalizability to completely independent datasets is supported by rigorous methods. Our simple model by combining low-number (=18) of network nodes and sparse estimation of relevant FC compensated the weakness of relatively small training sample size (=17). Also, our careful evaluation of working memory ability in 1500 trials devoting about 80–90 min enhanced measurement precision by reducing trial-by-trial variability at the individual participant level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith and Little, 2018</xref>). In this way, our training dataset ensured that our model captured low-complexity FC pattern essential for individual working memory ability. We note that larger sample sizes do not really always improve prediction accuracy. Using identical methods in our model construction, we developed a new prediction model of visual-object N-back score using the HCP dataset as a training dataset (<italic>N</italic> = 474). However, this model failed to provide significant prediction even within the training samples (<italic>R</italic><sup>2</sup> = 0.005). This seemingly unexpected result may partly result from differences in the way where individuals’ working memory ability were evaluated. The HCP conducted the N-back task in a limited time (160 trials for each individual), which may be noisy to precisely characterize individual ability. On the other hand, Rosenberg et al. built a model with careful examination of cognitive performance (more than 40 min of attention task), using modest (<italic>N</italic> = 25) training samples and demonstrated robust generalization to independent test sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>). Our model’s accuracy was comparable with their model of attention ability for an external test set (<italic>r</italic> ~ 0.3).</p><p>We carefully excluded the spurious correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Siegel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Whelan and Garavan, 2014</xref>). We examined general intellectual/cognitive ability, age, and head motion and confirmed that these disturbance variables had a minimal effect on prediction. Moreover, we analyzed age- and gender-matched controls from the same sites and compared the alterations from the controls (<italic>Z</italic>-scores), thereby minimizing the false positives that could be derived from age, gender, or imaging sites/parameters.</p><p>Our proposed two-stage approach, which builds a normative model and applies it to multiple diagnoses, is an effective technique to systematically compare neural substrates across multiple diagnoses. Clinical measures of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder were previously predicted by FC patterns that determine attention ability in healthy populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting common connectivity-cognition relationships across healthy and clinical populations. By extending this approach, we directly examined working memory ability of the patients in cognitive tasks rather than assessments of clinical symptoms based on subjective report or behavioral observation. We also tested the model across not only a single diagnosis but also multiple diagnoses.</p><p>By coherently establishing FC-cognition relationships from normal to abnormal, our two-stage approach could potentially cluster multiple psychiatric disorders based on neurobiological measures and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Insel et al., 2010</xref>). Such neurobiological insights into behavioral abnormality are consistent with recent transdiagnostic studies of genomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cross-Disorder Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">O'Donovan and Owen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Plomin et al., 2009</xref>) and neuroimaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clementz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goodkind et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheffield et al., 2017</xref>), which indicate that some neurobiological changes are shared across psychiatric diagnoses. Consistent with our results, recent studies provide evidences indicating that models of attention and memory generalize to predict behavior in patient as well as in healthy populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kessler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">O'Halloran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rosenberg et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Our results identified alterations in large-scale network clusters that correlated with working memory impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). First, the four diagnoses commonly showed altered connections related to the fronto-parietal networks. This finding support a hypothesis that the executive control network regulates symptoms, and its dysregulation is a shared neural substrate across diagnostic categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cole et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Smucny et al., 2018</xref>). Second, visual and auditory networks were associated with lower working memory ability in schizophrenia and MDD. These two results are consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive function is disrupted regarding not only top-down executive control but also bottom-up sensory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Javitt, 2009</xref>). Recently, a neurophysiological study has suggested contributions of motor and premotor neurons to encoding serial order of working memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carpenter et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with our result that alterations of connections related to the motor/visuospatial networks were associated with lower working memory ability in schizophrenia, MDD, and ASD.</p><p>The test-retest reliability of our functional connectivity estimation methods was fair level (0.2 &lt; ICC ≤ 0.4) according to an interpretation criteria of ICC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Landis and Koch, 1977</xref>). A previous study on test-retest reliability of functional connectivity between 18 different brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birn et al., 2013</xref>), reported similar ICC values (ICC ~0.2) when scan length was 6 to 15 min. Another previous study examined functional connectivity reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noble et al., 2017</xref>), using 268 regions from whole-brain, also reported that 6 min of scan length yielded similar reliability (dependability coefficient ~0.2 to 0.4). Although our connectivity estimation methods cannot reach clinically recognized request (ICC &gt; 0.8), these studies suggest that test-retest reliability of our methods are comparable to other common connectivity estimation methods.</p><p>Regarding the large contribution of the left fronto-parietal network (FPN) to our prediction model in comparison to the right FPN, the BrainMap ICA on which our network definition is based gives us useful information. The BrainMap ICA paper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laird et al., 2011</xref>) reported that IC18 (left FPN) has greater functional relevance to working memory than IC15 (right FPN) based on meta-analyses of thousands of publications. Moreover, a meta-analysis on N-back task with different stimulus modality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Owen et al., 2005</xref>) found monitoring of verbal stimuli was strongly associated with left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (a part of left FPN), while monitoring of spatial locations activated right lateralized frontal and parietal regions. In the current study, we used a letter 3-back task that requires encoding alphabet letters, which are more related to word monitoring than location monitoring. Therefore, the left FPN would be expected to contribute more to our prediction model than the right FPN. Although large portion of the model relies on the within-network connectivity of the left FPN (~34% contribution), the right FPN also showed a substantial contribution to working memory via negative connectivity N2 (connection with the midbrain network, please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and N3 (connection with the superior parietal network) (~20% contribution).</p><p>The primary limitation of this study is the assumption that our model captures general capability of working memory not restricted to letter 3-back performance. Working memory is an umbrella term which involves multiple distinct sensory modalities and executive functions, and the empirical findings and theoretical conceptualization is still rapidly extending (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatham and Badre, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cogan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">D'Esposito and Postle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Myers et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Serences, 2016</xref>). Rather than focus a single specific domain, we utilized any domains of working memory performance (letter N-back, visual object N-back, digit-sequencing task, and digit span). Future work may reveal more elaborate findings for FC-WMA relationships based on more nuanced definition of WMA, since distinct types of working memory tasks are engaged with specific neural processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Owen et al., 2005</xref>). Second, working memory performance was measured only in schizophrenia patients but not in other diagnostic groups. Therefore, it was impossible to compare their predicted working memory ability with measured scores. This presents challenges for the between-group comparisons in the patient samples. Third, although the participants are matched on age and sex within each site, the groups may differ along a number of dimensions beyond working memory (e.g. medication status, scanning protocol, and potentially IQ and other cognitive abilities). It is difficult to fully control every dimension, and little is known how such dimensions affect estimation of functional connectivity. Fourth, the results in the HCP dataset showed that only a little variance can be explained by our model. This may be attributed to considerable differences between the HCP dataset and the ATR dataset. The major differences include population location (the American vs. the Japanese), and working memory task properties that contrast in sensory modality (visual object vs. verbal), number of observations made for each individual (160 vs. 1500 trials), difficulty level (0-back and 2-back vs. 3-back), and measurement environment (in vs. out of MRI scanner). Finally, in the HCP dataset, the model predictions were not more closely related to 2-back than 0-back performance. This result suggest that the model may capture abilities beyond working memory.</p><p>In conclusion, our data provide a unified working memory ability framework across healthy populations and multiple psychiatric disorders. Our whole-brain functional connectivity model quantitatively predicted individual working memory ability in independently collected cohorts of healthy populations and patients with any of four psychiatric diagnoses (<italic>N</italic> = 965). Our results suggest that the FC-WMA relationship identified in healthy populations is commonly preserved in these psychiatric diagnoses and that working memory impairment in a range of psychiatric disorders can be explained by the cumulative effect of multiple disturbances in connectivity among distributed brain networks. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research to develop a quantitative, brain-wide-connectivity-based prediction model of human cognition that spans health and psychiatric disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>ATR dataset</title><p>This dataset was a final set of participants after excluding individuals who exhibited noisy data collected in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yamashita et al., 2015</xref>).

We picked up following three datasets, Beijing Normal University (BNU 1), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS 1), and University of Utah (Utah 1). We selected these datasets because 1) they have test-retest data across fMRI sessions, 2) ages of participants are comparable with those in our discovery dataset that was used for the construction of our model (ATR dataset), 3) two datasets include Asian participants (participants in ATR dataset are Japanese). BNU one includes data from 57 healthy young volunteers (age 19–30 years, 30 males) who completed two MRI scan sessions within an interval of approximate 6 weeks (33–50 days, mean 40.94 days).

The N-back task was performed in two fMRI runs, and each run contains eight task blocks of 10 trials (80 trials for each 0-back and 2-back condition). The scores were evaluated by the accuracy percentage of 2-back and 0-back conditions (86.0 ± 9.5% (SD), range 45.8% to 100%). The other working memory measure, the list-sorting test, is a sequencing task of visual or auditory stimuli (mean scores: 110.5 ± 11.6 (SD), range 80.8 to 144.5). Additionally, general fluid intelligence was assessed by Raven’s progressive matrices. The scores are integers that indicate the number of correct items (16.5 ± 4.8 (SD) from 4 to 24).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Examination of model prediction</title><p>We used rs-fMRI data (2 mm isotropic spatial resolution and a temporal resolution of 0.72 s) that were pre-processed and denoised by a machine learning tool that removes structured noise and moment-to-moment motion parameters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Salimi-Khorshidi et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, spatial smoothing (full width at half maximum = 4 mm) and nuisance regression was performed using average signals of gray matter, white matter, and cerebro-spinal fluid. To extract slow oscillation and removes high-frequency noise (e.g. cardiac pulsation around 0.3 Hz), a band-pass filter (0.009–0.08 Hz) was applied and volumes with framewise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm were removed. After preprocessing of fMRI data, FC was estimated following procedures described in the ATR dataset. We entered FC values into the prediction model developed from the ATR dataset, and predicted individual working memory ability. Because the scores of the visual-object N-back task and list-sorting test showed non-normal distributions, we used a nonparametric statistical test (Spearman’s rank correlation) to examine the model prediction accuracy. We compared the rank correlation coefficient between the predicted working memory ability and actual working memory scores with the null distribution obtained by shuffling participant labels (10,000 permutations). Links between behavioral scores and motion measures were preserved. Specifically, the subject label was shuffled for predicted working memory ability while the subject labels were preserved for confounding factors (e.g. age, fluid intelligence, and head motion).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Multiple psychiatric diagnoses dataset</title><p>These data were collected at a Japanese neuropsychiatry consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Takagi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yahata et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yahata et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yamashita et al., 2018</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bicr-resource.atr.jp/decnefpro/">https://bicr-resource.atr.jp/decnefpro/</ext-link>). Resting state fMRI analysis was performed in the same way as described in ATR dataset. We performed slice timing correction and then motion estimation. The estimated motion parameters were used to estimate excessive motion data by frame-wise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm. We did not remove a frame before or after the excessive motion. We conducted quality control for the rs-fMRI data and excluded participants if more than 40% of their total number of volumes of their data were removed by the scrubbing method. We calculated the ratio of excluded volumes to the total number of volumes for each subject, and averaged within patients or controls for each diagnosis. They were 2.3 ± 5.5 % / 1.4 ± 2.9% (patients/controls) for SCZ, 2.7 ± 6.6 % / 2.4 ± 6.3% for MDD, 0.4 ± 0.8 % / 0.7 ± 1.7% for OCD, and 1.4 ± 3.8 % / 4.6 ± 8.5% for ASD. We found a significant difference in the ratio between patients and controls only for ASD (<italic>t</italic><sub>97.3 </sub>= 2.91, p = 4.4×10<sup>−3</sup>).

A team of three experienced psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist assessed all patients. All patients were diagnosed with ASD based on the criteria of the DSM-IV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Association, 2000</xref>) and a medical chart review. The assessment consisted of participant interviews about developmental history, present illness, life history, and family history and was performed independently by a psychiatrist and a clinical psychologist in the team. Patients were also asked to bring suitable informants who had known them in early childhood. At the end of the interview, the patients were formally diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder by the psychiatrist if there was a consensus between the psychiatrist and clinical psychologist; this process required approximately three hours. The group of typically developed individuals was recruited by advertisements and acquaintances. None of the typically developed individuals reported any severe medical problem or any neurological or psychiatric history. None of them satisfied the diagnostic criteria for any psychiatric disorder. The IQ scores of all participants with ASD were evaluated using either the WAIS-III or the WAIS-R, while those of typically developed individuals were estimated using the Japanese version of the national adult reading test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matsuoka et al., 2006</xref>).

After confirming the homoscedasticity (Bartlett’s test, p = 0.17), the standardized predicted working memory ability differences were entered in a one-way ANOVA with diagnosis as a between-participant factor. Post-hoc pair-wise comparisons were corrected using Holm’s method.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-9"><title>Comparison of functional connectivity differences</title><p>We are interested in how working memory ability is determined by functional connectivity, and if the relationship between working memory ability and connectivity is altered by psychiatric disorders (e.g. if our model constructed from healthy controls can predict working memory of patients). The predicted working memory ability in our model is a weighted summation of connectivity values, meaning that alteration in working memory is determined by the product of connectivity values and model weights. For example, the working memory deficit caused by alteration of a specific connection is large, even if difference in a connectivity value between patients and controls is small, when the weight for the connection is large. Conversely, the working memory deficit is small, even if difference in a connectivity value is large, when the weight is small. Therefore, we mainly analyzed product of connectivity values and model weights.</p><p>To illustrate how each connection contributed to the predicted letter 3-back working memory ability differences, we defined the <italic>D</italic>-scores (difference-score) as follows. First, to align the FC value distribution of the control groups across the diagnostic groups, for every connection’s Gaussian distribution <italic>N</italic>(<italic>μ</italic>, <italic>σ</italic>), each control group’s FC value was transformed to an ATR dataset’s distribution <italic>N</italic>(<italic>μ<sub>ATR</sub></italic>, <italic>σ<sub>ATR</sub></italic>) using a linear transformation.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A prediction model of working memory across health and psychiatric disease using whole-brain functional connectivity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Monica Rosenberg (Reviewer #2); Xi-Nian Zuo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The central findings – transdiagnostic WM prediction – builds nicely on recent work on fingerprinting, prediction and transdiagnostic analyses. It is actually quite surprising that training a model on such a small set of healthy subjects generalizes across diagnoses and demographics that lie well outside the training data, but therein lies the value of the paper. While the relatively &quot;dirty&quot; acquisition and cohort details may not be ideal from a pure research perspective, it probably adds to the ecological validity and clinical translatability.</p><p>The paper has had two very thorough, excellent technical reviews. All major concerns are reasonable and should be addressed. Four concerns warrant specific commentary:</p><p>1) Reviewer 2's first point regarding the greater specificity of 2-back over 0-back to working memory and whether there are other cognitive processes at play.</p><p>2) Reviewer 3's first point regarding test-retest reliability. Ideally, you could pursue the reviewer's request here, although I note he has offered alternatives if this is not possible.</p><p>3) Much of the model (~34%) relies on left FP self-correlation – some sort of proxy for the internal coherence of that ICA map. None comes from the right FP – a slightly odd dependence on one feature and an asymmetry. It would be reassuring if this stood up to the test retest reliability analyses.</p><p>4) Given that you use parametric test statistics, it is not obvious why you also employed resampling to ascertain significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In a training sample of 17 healthy adults, the authors built a model to predict d' on a 3-back task from between- and within-network resting-state functional connectivity. They applied the model to resting-state data from an independent sample of 474 healthy adults from the Human Connectome Project dataset and found that model predictions were significantly correlated with n-back task performance when controlling for fluid intelligence and motion, significantly (inversely) correlated with fluid intelligence when controlling for n-back performance and motion, and not significantly correlated with motion when controlling for n-back performance and fluid intelligence. They applied the model to a second independent sample of resting-state data from 58 individuals with schizophrenia and found that predictions were correlated with a working memory measure when controlling for general cognitive ability and age. Based on these external validation results they argue that the model is generalizable and specific to working memory abilities.</p><p>They next applied the model to three additional datasets with patient and control populations. They found that predicted degree of working memory impairment relative to matched controls was greatest for patients with schizophrenia followed by patients with major depressive disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and autism spectrum disorder. This ordering replicates the degree of working memory impairments reported by previous meta-analyses.</p><p>Overall this paper is a rigorous example of neuroimaging-based predictive modeling based on the generalization to two external validation datasets and between-group comparisons in three additional independent samples. My enthusiasm for the work is only slightly dampened by questions about the patient-vs.-control analyses, the specificity of the working memory model, and the feature importance analysis.</p><p>1) The authors take steps to show that model predictions are related to working memory ability specifically rather than cognitive ability more generally, but additional analyses would strengthen this claim. First, the measure of working memory in the HCP dataset includes 0-back task performance, which indexes sustained attention and attentional control rather than working memory. Are model predictions more closely related to 2-back than to 0-back task accuracy? Furthermore, because even 2-back and 3-back tasks measure a number of processes beyond working memory (Kane et al. 2007, J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn), it would be informative to test whether model predictions are related to another measure of working memory such as performance on the NIH toolbox list-sorting task. Second, in the group-level analyses, are predicted working memory deficits more similar to working memory deficits observed in meta-analyses than they are to deficits observed in fluid intelligence or other cognitive domains (in terms of effect size or relative ordering across disorders)?</p><p>2) The lack of working memory measures presents challenges for the between-group comparisons in the patient samples. Although within each site the samples are matched on age and sex, the groups differ along a number of dimensions beyond working memory (e.g., medication status and potentially IQ and other cognitive abilities), and it's not clear whether patients and controls were scanned under the same protocols at each site, or whether protocols differed between sites. Limitations due to these potentially confounding factors should be clearly outlined in the manuscript. Related to this, are there working memory scores for the controls in the schizophrenia sample? If so, did predicted impairment reflect observed impairment in that sample, and does the model hold when applied to this full sample of patients and controls together?</p><p>3) It appears that the measure of general cognitive ability in the schizophrenia dataset includes a verbal memory measure. How correlated are working and verbal memory scores in this sample, and what is the justification for including it in the general cognitive ability score rather than treating it as a variable of interest?</p><p>4) Why was the HCP 500-subject release (2014) used rather than the 900-subject release (2015) or the 1200-subject release (2017)? Although the external generalization results are strong I would find it even more convincing if the model generalized to the full sample of HCP individuals.</p><p>5) The analysis of model weights and functional connectivity alterations between patient and control groups is somewhat confusing. Why does Figure 2 visualize the product of mean FC values and model weights (which will change depending on an individual's unique FC values) rather than just the raw model coefficients? Why do the patient/control difference scores incorporate model weights, rather than simply reflect changes in FC networks predicting working memory? It would be helpful to explain these choices in greater detail.</p><p>6) More details about the scrubbing procedure applied would be useful. Were frames before and after high-motion volumes excluded? What was the distribution of number of excluded volumes in each dataset? Did this differ by dataset or group?</p><p>7) The manuscript is lacking a discussion of predictive network anatomy, anatomy of networks that change vs. stay consistent between disorders, and implications for cognitive psychology or cognitive neuroscience. What do the current findings tell us about working memory and the functional networks that support it from a basic science perspective?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors performed predictive models to examine FC-WMA across psychiatric diseases using a verbal 3-back task. This work was done using a set of data cohorts. The predicted effect size estimates on verbal WMA impairment were comparable to previous meta-analysis results. I personally enjoyed reading this manuscript. This is a very nice sample for reproducible brain-behavior association studies. I would be happy to support its acceptance of a publication in the <italic>eLife</italic> journal. However, I still have several concerns, which need to be fully addressed before the publication.</p><p>Summary of concerns:</p><p>1) It is highly important for studies using clinical patients to choose a measurement tool with high test-retest reliability. The authors employed ICA-derived networks as spatial profiles for whole brain FC modeling, however none of any references was given to support its reliability reaching to the clinically recognized request (ICC &gt; 0.8). Is there any possibility of performing a test-retest analysis using public test-retest datasets (e.g., Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility) to demonstrate the reliability matched to the level in clinic. At least, the literature on test-retest reliability of rfMRI metrics should be carefully documented if you cannot do it in the reasonable time frame (e.g., &lt; 2months), see a review on this topic from my lab (PMID: 24875392). Meanwhile, dual regression with group ICA has been a highly reliable method, and the authors compared it with the FC method for the predictive modeling?</p><p>2) Head motion: Power et al. recently (PMID: 28880888) demonstrated that the order of performing preprocessing rfMRI data has effects on the performance of head motion removal. Of important relevance here is that the data should not be corrected for slice timing differences before the head motion estimated and reduced. The authors should check if their findings are influenced by such a change. Regarding the preprocessing, it is worth noting that ways of dealing with motion are different across data cohorts. How will this have an impact on reproducibility of the findings?</p><p>3) Demographical factors: It is widely known that age and sex have effects on FC, and how these two affect the observations reported here?</p><p>4) Figures: In Figure 1C, it is quite confusing that all the drawings of the graphical brain are the same across different clinical diagnoses (SCZ, MDD, OCD and ASD).</p><p>5) The authors have done a good work on dealing with head motion. However, just a curious point, several work also demonstrated potentially meaningful factors embedded in head motion as trait of human beings. At this point, interesting points related to the current work are: 1) Is there any relationship between motion and WMA? 2) Is there any correlation between global signal and WMA? 3) If so, what is the causal relationship among the four (motion, global signal, WMA and FC)?</p><p>6) Is there any plan in place to share the data publicly?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38844.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] The paper has had two very thorough, excellent technical reviews.

Briefly, the results can be summarized as follows: (i) we did not identify a significant difference in prediction accuracy of our model between the 2-back and 0-back scores; (ii) our model prediction was significantly correlated with another HCP working memory (list-sorting) score; (iii) the effect size of working memory deficits predicted by our model was more similar to digit span than general cognitive ability (IQ). Therefore, we demonstrated specificity of our model to working memory at two of three issues raised by reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewer 3's first point regarding test-retest reliability. Ideally, you could pursue the reviewer's request here, although I note he has offered alternatives if this is not possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We elected to examine test-retest reliability of our methods for functional connectivity estimation that uses ICA-based intrinsic network definition. As suggested by reviewer #3, we used open data from the Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) and calculated intra-class correlation (ICC) of functional connectivity values. These results are described in our response to reviewer #3’s comments, but briefly, we found that our methods are broadly comparable to other common connectivity estimation methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Much of the model (~34%) relies on left FP self-correlation – some sort of proxy for the internal coherence of that ICA map. None comes from the right FP – a slightly odd dependence on one feature and an asymmetry. It would be reassuring if this stood up to the test retest reliability analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>Our network definition is based on the BrainMap ICA which gives us useful information regarding the functional relevance of the ICA-derived networks based on meta-analyses of thousands of publications. In the BrainMap ICA paper (Laird et al., 2011; http://www.brainmap.org/icns/), IC18 (left fronto-parietal network; left FPN) showed greater functional relevance to working memory than IC15 (right FPN). Moreover, a meta-analysis on N-back task with different stimulus modality (Owen et al., 2005) found that monitoring of verbal stimuli was strongly associated with the left ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (a part of left FPN), while monitoring of spatial locations activated right lateralized frontal and parietal regions. In the current study, we used a letter 3-back task that requires encoding alphabet letters, which are more related to word monitoring than location monitoring. Therefore, the left FPN would be expected to contribute more to our prediction model than the right FPN.</p><p>Although much of the model relies on the within-network connectivity of the left FPN (~34% contribution), the right FPN also showed a substantial contribution to working memory via negative connectivity N2 (connection with the midbrain network, please see Figure 2) and N3 (connection with the superior parietal network) (~20% contribution).</p><p>We examined test-retest reliability by calculating intra-class correlation (ICC) for within-network connectivity of these networks using three different datasets from Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) as fully described in our response to reviewer #3. Briefly, we found ICC values for the left FPN/right FPN: 0.28/0.23, 0.49/0.47, and 0.11/0.03 for BNU 1, IACAS 1, and Utah 1 dataset, respectively. According to an interpretation criteria of ICC (Landis and Koch, 1977), these results suggest that the two networks show comparable reliability with each other (0.2 &lt; ICC &lt; 0.5) for mid-term test-retest inter-session intervals (2-3 months: BNU 1 and IACAS datasets). Therefore, it is unlikely that difference in the test-retest reliability between the two networks induced the model’s dependence on left FPN.</p><p>We added the above issues to the Discussion section (<underline>eighth paragraph</underline>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given that you use parametric test statistics, it is not obvious why you also employed resampling to ascertain significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We applied the resampling tests to data shown in Figures 3A and 3C to ascertain significance of the correlation analysis between the predicted and actual working memory abilities in HCP datasets. However, we agree with the editor’s point that they are redundant. We have therefore removed the resampling results (Figures 3B and 3D) from our revised manuscript.</p><p>We used another resampling test in examination of effect of diagnosis and/or connection on degree of functional connectivity change (“<italic>Z</italic>-score”). Although a parametric two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) requires homogenous variance across diagnosis/connection, some connections showed inhomogeneous variance across diagnoses. Thus, we used permutation tests to examine whether effect of diagnosis/connection significantly affects the degree of functional connectivity change. This is mentioned in the last paragraph of the subsection “Comparison of functional connectivity differences”.</p><p>Below, we provide an in-depth response to the individual issues raised by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The authors take steps to show that model predictions are related to working memory ability specifically rather than cognitive ability more generally, but additional analyses would strengthen this claim.

Spearman’s rho partial correlation between the model prediction and task performance was 0.078 for 2-back task and 0.086 for 0-back task, while factoring out two confounding variables (fluid intelligence and head motion). There was no significant difference between the two correlation coefficients. Therefore, we could not conclude that the model prediction is more similar to 2-back score than 0-back score.</p><p>According the reviewer’s comment, we investigated the correlation between the predicted working memory ability and performance of a list-sorting task, which is a working memory task included in the NIH toolbox. The list-sorting score correlated positively with fluid intelligence (Spearman’s rho 0.32, <italic>P</italic> = 5.7 x 10<sup>-13</sup>) and negatively with head motion (Spearman’s rho -0.12, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009). Therefore, we performed a partial correlation analysis while factoring out these two variables. We found significant positive correlation between the predicted working memory ability and the list sorting score (Spearman’s rho = 0.084, <italic>P</italic> = 0.034). These results provide an evidence that the prediction model predicts working memory capability measured by another working memory task other than the 3-back task. These results and methods are described in the Results section (subsection “Prediction in Independent Test Set of Healthy Individuals”) and Materials and methods section (subsection “Human Connectome Project (HCP) Dataset”).</p><p>Second, we examined meta-analyses on fluid intelligence performed in the psychiatric diagnoses to examine if predicted working memory deficits are more similar to working memory deficits observed in meta-analyses than deficits in fluid intelligence. We found no systematic meta-analysis or review from a transdiagnostic viewpoint. Therefore, we searched for a meta-analysis on fluid intelligence for each diagnosis and found a small number of reports on this issue, as follows:</p><p>Schizophrenia: Heinrichs and Zakzanis reported that mean effect size is larger in full scale IQ measured by WAIS-Revised (<italic>d</italic> = -1.24, number of studies <italic>k</italic> = 35) than digit span (<italic>d</italic> = -0.61, <italic>k</italic> = 18). Rajji et al. reported that effect size is larger in full scale IQ (first-episode: <italic>d</italic> = 0.89, <italic>k</italic> = 29; youth-onset: <italic>d</italic> = -1.77, <italic>k</italic> = 15; late-onset: <italic>d</italic> = -1.61, <italic>k</italic> = 4) than digit span (first-episode: <italic>d</italic> = 0.64, <italic>k</italic> = 24; youth-onset: <italic>d</italic> = -0.85, <italic>k</italic> = 7; late-onset: <italic>d</italic> = -0.87, <italic>k</italic> = 5). These two meta-analyses commonly suggest that schizophrenia patients show larger effect size in IQ reduction than working memory deficits.</p><p>MDD: We found a review paper about fluid intelligence in first episode depression. Ahern and Semkovska reported that mean effect size is larger in digit span (forward: <italic>d</italic> = -0.35, <italic>k</italic> = 3; backward: <italic>d</italic> = -0.33, <italic>k</italic> = 4) than IQ composite (<italic>d</italic> = -0.26, <italic>k</italic> = 10). The IQ composite effect size is similar to predicted working memory effect size (<italic>d</italic> = -0.29).</p><p>OCD: We found a meta-analysis on fluid intelligence in OCD patients. Abramovitch et al. reported that mean effect size in full scale IQ in OCD was -0.35 (<italic>k</italic> = 40). Snyder et al. reported smaller effect size for digit span forward (<italic>d</italic> = -0.08, <italic>k</italic> = 19) and backward (<italic>d</italic> = -0.21, <italic>k</italic> = 11).</p><p>ASD: We found no meta-analysis regarding general cognitive ability or intelligence.</p><p>Figure 4—figure supplement 1 shows effect sizes of deficit for fluid intelligence (IQ) as reported in the above meta-analyses (with the largest <italic>k</italic> for each diagnosis) in comparison to those for working memory. Note that the predicted working memory ability falls within the confidence interval of the IQ effect size only for first-episode MDD while it falls within confidence interval of effect size of working memory (forward digit span) for every diagnosis. Regarding the relative order of effect sizes, the effect size of fluid intelligence deficits can be ordered as schizophrenia, OCD, and MDD (first episode). In contrast, the effect sizes of working-memory deficits (as measured by digit-span task) can be ordered as schizophrenia, MDD and OCD, which is consistent with the order predicted by our model. Therefore, predicted working-memory deficits were more similar to observed deficits in working memory than those in fluid intelligence. These results are described in the Results section (subsection “Prediction in Four Distinct Psychiatric Disorders”, last paragraph) of our revised manuscript.</p><p>Collectively, although we cannot conclude that the model prediction is more similar to 2-back score than 0-back score, the model was able to predict another measure of working memory (i.e. List-sorting). Moreover, predicted working memory deficits are more similar to working-memory deficits observed in meta-analyses than deficits in fluid intelligence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The lack of working memory measures presents challenges for the between-group comparisons in the patient samples. Although within each site the samples are matched on age and sex, the groups differ along a number of dimensions beyond working memory (e.g., medication status and potentially IQ and other cognitive abilities), and it's not clear whether patients and controls were scanned under the same protocols at each site, or whether protocols differed between sites. Limitations due to these potentially confounding factors should be clearly outlined in the manuscript. Related to this, are there working memory scores for the controls in the schizophrenia sample? If so, did predicted impairment reflect observed impairment in that sample, and does the model hold when applied to this full sample of patients and controls together?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added limitations to the Discussion section as follows:</p><p>“Second, working memory performance was measured only in schizophrenia patients but not in other diagnostic groups. Therefore, it was impossible to compare their predicted working memory ability with measured scores. This presents challenges for the between-group comparisons in the patient samples.”</p><p>“Third, although the participants are matched on age and sex within each site, the groups may differ along a number of dimensions beyond working memory (e.g., medication status, scanning protocol, and potentially IQ and other cognitive abilities). It is difficult to fully control every dimension, and little is known how such dimensions affect estimation of functional connectivity.”</p><p>We added lines to the table in Supplementary file 1 to make it clear how many patients and controls were scanned with each scanner and protocol.</p><p>We newly analyzed data including the full sample of schizophrenia patients and controls, and found a consistent result with the previous result in only the patient samples. Specifically, we found that the digit-sequencing score was correlated positively with composite BACS score excluding working memory (see our reply to the next comment) (<italic>r</italic> = 0.68, <italic>P</italic> = 2.0 x 10<sup>-17</sup>), and negatively with age (<italic>r</italic> = -0.36, <italic>P</italic> = 5.7 x 10<sup>-5</sup>), but not with head motion (<italic>r</italic> = -0.04, <italic>P</italic> = 0.68). While controlling the age and the composite BACS score, a partial correlation analysis showed that the model prediction is significantly correlated with the digit-sequencing score (<italic>ρ</italic> = 0.15, <italic>P</italic> = 0.048).</p><p>These results are included in the Results section of the revised manuscript (subsection “Prediction in Individual Schizophrenia Patients and Controls”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It appears that the measure of general cognitive ability in the schizophrenia dataset includes a verbal memory measure. How correlated are working and verbal memory scores in this sample, and what is the justification for including it in the general cognitive ability score rather than treating it as a variable of interest?</p></disp-quote><p>First, we found positive correlation between observed working memory and verbal memory scores of BACS in the schizophrenia patients (<italic>r</italic> = 0.49, <italic>P</italic> = 1.0 x 10<sup>-3</sup>). Moreover, the working memory scores showed positive correlation with the other four sub scores (‘verbal fluency’, ‘motor speed’, ‘executive function’, and ‘attention and processing speed’) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, we needed to factor out effects of these correlated scores to examine if the prediction model was specific to the working memory.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Pearson’s correlation matrix of BACS sub-scores.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-38844-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The reason why we treated verbal memory as a variable of no-interest is that the verbal memory measured by BACS seemed very different from working memory measured by the letter 3-back task. We constructed the prediction model based on the letter 3-back task. This task is a recognition test in which alphabet letters (e.g. B, J) are presented moment to moment, and requires participants to update their memory and to group the letters into a unit (chunking). In contrast, the BACS verbal memory task is a free recall test of 15 words, so participants are required to recall lexical/semantic representations. Therefore, we assumed that cognitive functions necessary for performing the 3-back task are different from functions necessary for performing the verbal memory.</p><p>Thanks to reviewer #2’s comments, we realized that “verbal 3-back task” was a confusing term and changed it to “letter 3-back task”. Also, we found that the word “general cognitive ability” is not appropriate. Now we call it “composite BACS score excluding working memory”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why was the HCP 500-subject release (2014) used rather than the 900-subject release (2015) or the 1200-subject release (2017)? Although the external generalization results are strong I would find it even more convincing if the model generalized to the full sample of HCP individuals.</p></disp-quote><p>When we analyzed the data, only HCP 500-subject dataset was released. We are eager to test generalization of our model to the full sample of HCP. However, our analysis needs calculation of voxel-wise correlation when we calculate functional connectivity within a network (e.g., left fronto-parietal network). This calculation is time consuming process, which needs 8 hours for each subject. Therefore, it was impossible for us to finish the analysis of the full sample of HCP within a reasonable (i.e. two month) time-frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The analysis of model weights and functional connectivity alterations between patient and control groups is somewhat confusing. Why does Figure 2 visualize the product of mean FC values and model weights (which will change depending on an individual's unique FC values) rather than just the raw model coefficients? Why do the patient/control difference scores incorporate model weights, rather than simply reflect changes in FC networks predicting working memory? It would be helpful to explain these choices in greater detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We are interested in how working memory ability is determined by functional connectivity, and if the relationship between working memory ability and connectivity is altered by psychiatric disorders (e.g., if our model constructed from healthy controls can predict working memory of patients). The predicted working memory ability in our model is a weighted summation of connectivity values, meaning that alteration in working memory is determined by the product of connectivity values and model weights. For example, the working memory deficit caused by alteration of a specific connection is large, even if difference in a connectivity value between patients and controls is small, when the weight for the connection is large. Conversely, the working memory deficit is small, even if difference in a connectivity value is large, when the weight is small. Therefore, we mainly analyzed product of connectivity values and model weights.</p><p>We added the above explanations to our revised manuscript’s Methods and Materials section (subsection “Comparison of functional connectivity differences”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) More details about the scrubbing procedure applied would be useful. Were frames before and after high-motion volumes excluded? What was the distribution of number of excluded volumes in each dataset? Did this differ by dataset or group?</p></disp-quote><p>Regarding the first question, frames were excluded if the motion was excessive at each time-point (frame-wise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm). We did not remove a frame before or after the excessive motion. We added these details about the scrubbing procedure to the Materials and methods section:</p><p>“We performed slice timing correction and then motion estimation. The estimated motion parameters were used to estimate excessive motion data by frame-wise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm.

They were 2.3 ± 5.5% / 1.4 ± 2.9% (patients/controls) for SCZ, 2.7 ± 6.6% / 2.4 ± 6.3% for MDD, 0.4 ± 0.8% / 0.7 ± 1.7% for OCD, and 1.4 ± 3.8% / 4.6 ± 8.5% for ASD. We found a significant difference in the ratio between patients and controls only for ASD (<italic>t</italic><sub>97.3</sub>= 2.91, <italic>P</italic> = 4.4 x 10<sup>-3</sup>). However, it is unlikely that this difference caused a problem in our result because there was not a significant difference in the predicted working memory ability between ASD patients and their controls. We reported the ratios for each diagnosis (subsection “Multiple Psychiatric Diagnoses Dataset”, first paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The manuscript is lacking a discussion of predictive network anatomy, anatomy of networks that change vs. stay consistent between disorders, and implications for cognitive psychology or cognitive neuroscience. What do the current findings tell us about working memory and the functional networks that support it from a basic science perspective?</p></disp-quote><p>To increase interpretability of our results from the perspective of cognitive neuroscience, we grouped the 18 networks into seven clusters, each of which is more applicable to a functional understanding.

The authors employed ICA-derived networks as spatial profiles for whole brain FC modeling, however none of any references was given to support its reliability reaching to the clinically recognized request (ICC &gt; 0.8). Is there any possibility of performing a test-retest analysis using public test-retest datasets (e.g., Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility) to demonstrate the reliability matched to the level in clinic. At least, the literature on test-retest reliability of rfMRI metrics should be carefully documented if you cannot do it in the reasonable time frame (e.g., &lt; 2months), see a review on this topic from my lab (PMID: 24875392). Meanwhile, dual regression with group ICA has been a highly reliable method, and the authors compared it with the FC method for the predictive modeling?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the important measurement of test-retest reliability. As the reviewer suggested, we examined ICC for the resting state functional connectivity method using Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) database. We added the text below to the Results, Discussion, and Materials and Methods sections respectively.</p><p>as follows.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>“1. Datasets</p><p>We analyzed data from Consortium for Reliability and Reproducibility (CoRR) that facilitates assessment of test-retest reliability and reproducibility for resting state functional connectivity (Zuo et al., 2014). We picked up following three datasets, Beijing Normal University (BNU 1), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (IACAS 1), and University of Utah (Utah 1). We selected these datasets because 1) they have test-retest data across fMRI sessions, 2) ages of participants are comparable with those in our discovery dataset that was used for the construction of our model (ATR dataset), 3) two datasets include Asian participants (participants in ATR dataset are Japanese), 4) sizes of datasets are relatively small (we had to finish our analysis within 2 months).</p><p>[…]</p><p>3. Test–retest reliability</p><p>Intra-class correlation (ICC) was calculated for each of the 171 functional connectivity values (univariate test-retest reliability). ICC was calculated by following equation:</p><p>ICC = (MS<sub>b</sub> – MS<sub>w</sub>)/{MS<sub>b</sub> + (<italic>k –</italic> 1)MS<sub>w</sub>}</p><p>where, MS<sub>b</sub> is the between-subjects mean squared error and MS<sub>w</sub> is the within-subjects mean squared error and k is the number of independent fMRI measures (i.e., <italic>k</italic> = 2 for test and retest). We put negative ICC values to be zeros as done by previous studies (e.g., Zhang et al., 2011).”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“We obtained ICC values 0.34 ± 0.12 (range 0 to 0.65) for BNU 1, 0.26 ± 0.18 (range 0 to 0.66) for IACAS 1, and 0.21 ± 0.17 (range 0 to 0.59) for Utah 1 datasets. We found ICC values for the left FPN/right FPN: 0.28/0.23, 0.49/0.47, and 0.11/0.03 for BNU 1, IACAS 1, and Utah 1 dataset, respectively.”</p><p>Discussion</p><p>“According to an interpretation criteria of ICC (Landis and Koch, 1977), our connectivity estimation methods yielded “fair” reliability (0.2 &lt; ICC ≤ 0.4) for the three datasets. A previous study on test-retest reliability of functional connectivity between 18 different brain regions (Birn et al., 2013), reported similar ICC values (ICC ~ 0.2) when scan length was 6 to 15 minutes. Another previous study examined functional connectivity reliability (Noble et al., 2017), using 268 regions from whole-brain also reported that 6 min of scan length yielded similar reliability (dependability coefficient ~ 0.2 to 0.4). Although our connectivity estimation methods cannot reach clinically recognized request (ICC &gt; 0.8), these studies suggest that test-retest reliability of our methods are comparable to other common connectivity estimation methods.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Head motion: Power et al. recently (PMID: 28880888) demonstrated that the order of performing preprocessing rfMRI data has effects on the performance of head motion removal. Of important relevance here is that the data should not be corrected for slice timing differences before the head motion estimated and reduced. The authors should check if their findings are influenced by such a change. Regarding the preprocessing, it is worth noting that ways of dealing with motion are different across data cohorts. How will this have an impact on reproducibility of the findings?</p></disp-quote><p>We re-analyzed the data by conducting the motion estimation before slice timing correction. We summarize the results below:</p><p>Regarding the individual-level prediction on the SCZ dataset, we found a marginally significant positive correlation between the predicted working memory and the digit-sequencing score (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21, <italic>P</italic> = 0.059), but partial correlation analysis did not show a significant correlation (<italic>rho</italic> = 0.10, <italic>P</italic> = 0.26) while factoring out the BACS composite score and age. We found the model prediction correlated not only with the digit-sequencing score but also with the BACS composite score (<italic>r</italic> = 0.21, <italic>P</italic> = 0.056). Based on the strong correlation between the digit-sequencing and the BACS composite score (<italic>r</italic> = 0.61), obtaining prediction specific to the subtest was a quite challenging goal. These results may reduce the model’s specificity to working memory at least for SCZ dataset but still the model prediction was related to cognitive ability rather than other confounding factors (age and motion).</p><p>Regarding the multiple psychiatric diagnoses dataset, we found almost the same results as our previous results even after changing this procedure, as follows.</p><p>We found two additional MDD patients with excessive motion (40% of data showed frame-wise displacement &gt; 0.5 mm) and removed them from further analysis. We detected outliers in the model prediction within each group (defined as values &gt; 3 SD from the mean): a patient of SCZ, two control participants of MDD, and a patient with OCD.</p><p>We identified significant differences in the predicted working memory between the patient and controls only for SCZ patients (two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-test for SCZ group: <italic>t</italic><sub>115</sub> = -3.11, <italic>P</italic> = (2.4 x 10<sup>-3</sup>) x 4 = 0.0096, Bonferroni corrected).

However, just a curious point, several work also demonstrated potentially meaningful factors embedded in head motion as trait of human beings. At this point, interesting points related to the current work are: 1) Is there any relationship between motion and WMA? 2) Is there any correlation between global signal and WMA? 3) If so, what is the causal relationship among the four (motion, global signal, WMA and FC)?</p></disp-quote><p>1) We examined correlation between head motion and working memory.</p><p>ATR dataset: There was no significant correlation between head motion and observed 3-back task performance (<italic>r</italic> = 0.23, <italic>P</italic> = 0.37).</p><p>SCZ dataset:</p><p>Patients only (<italic>N</italic> = 58), there was no significant correlation between head motion and observed digit-sequencing performance (<italic>r</italic> = -0.03, <italic>P</italic> = 0.83).</p><p>Patients and controls (<italic>N</italic> = 118), there was no significant correlation between head motion and observed digit-sequencing performance (<italic>r</italic> = -0.04, <italic>P</italic> = 0.68).</p><p>HCP dataset: There was a significant correlation between head motion and observed N-back accuracy (Spearman’s rank correlation <italic>rho</italic> = -0.24, <italic>P</italic> = 1.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>) and list-sorting score (Spearman’s rank correlation = -0.12, <italic>P</italic> = 0.009).

Such subtraction is needed because an fMRI signal value is arbitrary one which changes according to runs. However, in the current study, we measured only resting-state fMRI in which there was no baseline or task period.
