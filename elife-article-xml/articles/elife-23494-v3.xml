pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23494.001</object-id><p>In mammals, tactile information is mapped topographically onto the contralateral side of the brain in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1). In this study, we describe Robo3 mouse mutants in which a sizeable fraction of the trigemino-thalamic inputs project ipsilaterally rather than contralaterally. The resulting mixture of crossed and uncrossed sensory inputs creates bilateral whisker maps in the thalamus and cortex. Surprisingly, these maps are segregated resulting in duplication of whisker representations and doubling of the number of barrels without changes in the size of S1. Sensory deprivation shows competitive interactions between the ipsi/contralateral whisker maps. This study reveals that the somatosensory system can form a somatotopic map to integrate bilateral sensory inputs, but organizes the maps in a different way from that in the visual or auditory systems. Therefore, while molecular pre-patterning constrains their orientation and position, preservation of the continuity of inputs defines the layout of the somatosensory maps.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensory maps in the brain integrate physical (topographic) and functional constraints. According to the type of sensory modality, these constraints are differently accommodated. In the somatosensory system, the sensory receptors of the periphery establish topographic replicas in the different brain relay stations, in the brainstem, thalamus and cortex, with a size that is roughly proportional to functional importance of the sensory element represented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Penfield and Boldrey, 1937</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Woolsey and Van der Loos, 1970</xref>).</p><p>Some of the main construction principles of these maps have been elucidated implying collaboration of morphogenetic gradients and neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pfeiffenberger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rash and Grove, 2006</xref>), but there is continued controversy regarding the degree to which the initial clustering and topographical arrangement of axons carrying the inputs plays a role in map layout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Erzurumlu and Gaspar, 2012</xref>).</p><p>The contributions of molecular pre-patterning and nearest-neighbor clustering can be tested in bilateral sensory maps that integrate bilateral signals where the inputs come from each side of the body and therefore arrive via separate routes. Manipulating the laterality of inputs also provides a method to identify mechanisms of bilateral integration during map-building. This has been tested previously in the visual system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rebsam et al., 2009</xref>). However, the natural overlap of the receptive fields for a portion of retinal ganglion cells between the left and right eyes can constrain the topographic organization of the binocular visual cortex. Thus, experiments in the visual system do not allow easy disambiguation of the different mechanisms at play during establishment of the map. Evidently, there is no such continuity and overlap between the somatosensory receptive fields of the left and right sides of the body. Therefore, if genetic patterning were the main factor controlling integration of bilateral sensory processing in the cortex, one would expect that changing the laterality of a fraction of somatosensory inputs would create the equivalent of a ‘binocular’ region in the somatosensory cortex. To the opposite, if the map-building rules maintain nearest-neighbor’s interactions, one would expect that such manipulation would result in fully segregated representation of bilateral inputs in the cortex. Here, we examined the effect of partial uncrossing of presynaptic afferents to the somatosensory thalamus in the whisker to barrel pathway of mice.</p><p>The sensory afferents from the whisker follicles first synapse in the brainstem trigeminal complex and second order neurons in the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (PrV) carry the whisker-specific inputs to the contralateral ventroposteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Erzurumlu et al., 2010</xref>]). In the present study we focused on a conditional mouse mutant in which <italic>Robo3</italic>, an axon guidance receptor necessary for the crossing of commissural axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>) is inactivated in rhombomere 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Renier et al., 2010</xref>), the origin of most whisker-specific PrV neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Oury et al., 2006</xref>). The conditional lack of Robo3 only caused a partial crossing defect of trigemino-thalamic axons. Consequently, conditional Robo3 mutants had bilateral sensory afferents in the brainstem to neocortex portion of the whisker-barrel pathway. We found that this resulted in two functional whisker maps in the thalamic relay, VPM, and the barrel cortex, each receiving inputs from a different side of the animal’s face. Most interestingly, these maps were entirely segregated, both being confined to the cortical space normally allocated to facial whisker representation, but retained correct orientation and topographic organization. These results suggest that the mechanisms shaping topographic representation of the somatosensory map respect the nearest-neighbor continuity of the peripheral receptor topography, within the position and orientation constraints set by the molecular pre-patterning gradients in the thalamus and cortex.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23494.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rewiring of r3 and r5 derived hindbrain projections to midbrain/forebrain projections in <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO</italic> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the mouse whisker to barrel somatosensory pathway.

GFP+ axon terminals arborized in the VPM in both control and mutant mice and formed barreloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). In all mutants and controls (n = 14 for each genotype), the r3-derived GFP+ (r3-GFP+) axons projected to the dorsolateral VPM containing the barreloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Abnormal organization of the whisker barreloids was noted in the mutant VPM. In controls, all the barreloid rows coincided with a dense r3-GFP+ axon territory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; n = 4/4), whereas in mutants two distinct zones were observed (n = 4/4): a lateral VPM domain containing a high density of GFP+ axons and a medial VPM domain with only sparse patches of GFP+ axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). These two VPM domains contained barreloids, identified by cytochrome oxidase staining, and were of comparable surface area in coronal sections through the middle of the VPM (0.19 ± 0.006 mm<sup>2</sup> for the lateral dense GFP+ domain and 0.18 ± 0.003 mm<sup>2</sup> for the medial patches of GFP+ domain, p=0.46). Moreover, they were separated by a cytochrome oxidase-free septum. These observations suggest that in the <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO</italic> mice, the VPM is split into two separate domains, each with different barreloid patterning (although the lateral domain contains the highest density of r3-derived projections, and larger barreloids).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23494.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Organization of the projections to the VPM.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whole-mount immunostaining for GFP in <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-Het;Tau<sup>GFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO;Tau<sup>GFP</sup></italic> P4 brains cleared with iDISCO.

Ipsilateral axons in mutants may reach the VPM first and occupy the dorso-lateral quadrant of the VPM normally populated by the larger barreloids in controls. We looked at development of the trigemino-thalamic (TT) tract at E15.5 in <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO;Tau<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mutant embryos, when axons from the PrV have not yet reached their targets in the VPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, n = 3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kivrak and Erzurumlu, 2013</xref>). In this line, both ipsilateral and contralateral PrV projections to the VPM are GFP+. To selectively label contralateral PrV axons, we injected DiI unilaterally into the PrV. In the TT tract, red axons (DiI+ only), yellow axons (double positive for GFP and DiI), and green axons (GFP+) were organized in a medial to lateral gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>, n = 3), suggesting that ipsilateral and contralateral axons in the TT tract might be pre-sorted before reaching their target. Ipsilateral (green only) axons were always seen next to contralateral axons (red and yellow) in the TT tract up to the rostral-most sections containing the endings/growth cones of the developing axons. Therefore, ipsilateral axons had no measurable lead over contralateral axons before reaching the VPM at this stage. Indeed, in both <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-Het;Tau<sup>GFP</sup></italic> and <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO;Tau<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mutant E18 embryos, the TT have reached the VPM and the terminals fill the whole dorsal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kivrak and Erzurumlu, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>, n = 3). However, the precise timing of arrival of the contralateral and ipsilateral axons in the mutant VPM is difficult to assess. Although we did not find evidence for delayed arrival of the contralateral TT projections in the VPM, we cannot rule out that ipsilateral projections reach their targets earlier and hence have a competitive advantage to innervate the VPM.</p><p>To determine the 3D organization of the VPM map in the <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO</italic> mutants, and the origin of the GFP+ patches, we performed whole-mount imaging of brains from <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO;Tau<sup>GFP</sup></italic> mutants and heterozygous controls at P8 using iDISCO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Renier et al., 2014</xref>). A suitable angle was determined for optimal projection of the barreloids in the thalamic whisker map onto a plane: 3D datasets were oriented at a 45° oblique angle from both coronal and horizontal planes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>).

In control mice, the unilateral ION lesions caused fusion of the barreloids in the contralateral VPM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; n = 3). In mutants, barreloid fusion was found in both the ipsilateral and the contralateral VPM: ipsilaterally, in the GFP-dense region, and contralaterally in the GFP-patched region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, n = 5). This indicated that, as suggested by the tracing experiments, the GFP-dense region in the VPM receives ipsilateral inputs from the PrV, whereas the GFP-patched region receives contralateral inputs. This also demonstrated that the GFP-patched region carries somatosensory inputs from the infraorbital branch of the trigeminal nerve. Moreover, in addition to fusion of the barreloids, the thalamic map that sustained sensory deprivation was reduced in size, while the adjacent non-deprived map was enlarged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, n = 5). This showed that sensory-activity-based competition defines the final space allocated to each map in the mutant VPM.</p><p>To verify whether both maps in the VPM received inputs from the periphery, we performed intact brain c-Fos immunolabeling in control and mutant mice whose whiskers were shaved on the left side, and b, d rows were spared on the right side (n = 3).

Moreover, they were arranged into eight rather than the usual five whisker rows, with clear delineation of two separate cortical zones, a central zone and a peripheral zone, each containing distinct barrel rows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>).

Two scenarios are possible: (i) the thalamic afferents follow topographic molecular guidance cues expressed in the cortex, with complementary receptor expression in the thalamus; in this case one would expect that neighboring whiskers of the ipsi- and contralateral maps lie in register with one another; (ii) the thalamic afferents are clustered following sensory activity-based rules leading functionally coordinated afferents to cluster together; in this scenario, the topographical rule of near neighbors would prevail over molecular gradients. To analyze the topographic alignment of the crossed and uncrossed somatosensory maps, we monitored c-Fos expression in S1 after clipping all whiskers except one row or one arc of whiskers on one side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and data not shown). When the five posterior-most whiskers of the whisker pad (A1-E1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) were left intact in control mice, this resulted in activation of c-Fos in a caudal arc of five barrels exclusively in the contralateral S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Likewise, when the second whisker row (B1-B4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) was left intact, the corresponding row of barrels was activated in the contralateral S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In mutants, c-Fos activation was bilateral, with labeling in both the central (ipsi) and peripheral (contra) PMBSF domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The general orientation of the two nested maps was similar and resembled that of control mice, likely because of the patterning activity of morphogens that determine the polarity of the map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). However, unlike the visual or auditory bilateral maps, we observed that there were discontinuities in organization of the bilateral somatotopic map, such as a lack of topographic proximity of the ipsi/contra representation for a given barrel or barrel row. Rather, there appeared to be clear separation and independence of the ipsi- and contralateral inputs. Taken together, these results favor the hypothesis that nearest-neighbor’s interactions prevail to some extent over the molecular pre-patterning to organize continuous representation of the periphery for each map. However, the molecular gradients still contribute to maintain the general orientation of the maps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Competition between ipsi- and contralateral inputs for cortical space</title><p>In the mouse models studied here, the space occupied by the barrel map was not increased in mutants (2.32 ± 0.05 mm<sup>2</sup> in controls <italic>vs</italic> 1.90 ± 0.12 mm<sup>2</sup> in mutants, p=0.04), unlike results from other mouse models with duplication of the S1 map where a second S1 map is formed at the expense of other cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">2003</xref>). This suggests that the ipsi- and contralateral thalamic inputs compete to occupy a defined cortical space in S1. Accordingly, individual barrels in mutants were roughly half the size (44 ± 2%) of those in controls. As with the VPM, we looked again at the consequences of unilateral deprivation of whisker inputs induced by a neonatal (P1) lesion of the ION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Waite and Cragg, 1982</xref>). In control mice, barrel fusion was observed in the S1 contralateral to the lesion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; n = 3/3). In mutants, barrels fused in the maps corresponding to the ipsi- and contralateral representations of the lesioned whisker pad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; n = 5/5). Furthermore, the representation of the unlesioned side expanded at the expense of the fused-map. This suggests that there is sensory activity-dependent competition for cortical space between the ipsilateral and contralateral sensory inputs in the mutant S1.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23494.015</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Activity-dependent competition between ipsilateral and contralateral inputs in mutant barrel cortex.</title><p>Tangential sections of controls or <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO</italic> flat-mounted P10 cortices stained for cytochrome oxidase in control conditions or after unilateral lesion of the infraorbital nerve (ION) at P1.

We took advantage of the ClearMap pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Renier et al., 2016</xref>) to compare c-Fos activity patterns in the whole brain in an unbiased way, in the unilateral whisker stimulation protocol (n = 3 per group) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We looked for brain regions that exhibited left-right differences that were opposite in controls and mutants. As expected, the barrel cortex and VPM exhibited statistically significant differences between the shaved and stimulated sides of the brain, that were opposite between controls and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Of note, the column of activity detected in d row registered precisely in the same position in control and mutants, showing that the absolute position of the d row in the brain is the same in the aberrant ipsilateral map of the mutant mice a in controls. We then isolated c-Fos+ cells from the upper cortical layers (n = 4). In upper layers, contrary to layer 4, activity patterns are not restricted to the stimulated barrels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but expand over adjacent barrels, due to downstream cortical integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Kaliszewska et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Peron et al., 2015</xref>). We looked at the effect of a patterned sensory deprivation created by trimming rows b and d on one side and shaving all whiskers on the other side. Expansion of c-Fos+ cells was observed within both maps between activated rows in the upper cortical layers 2–3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), but not across the boundaries of each map. This suggests that the ipsilateral and contralateral whisker maps have little to no direct horizontal integration in the upper cortical layers.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23494.016</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cortical integration of sensory information.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) ClearMap analysis of the c-Fos patterns in iDISCO+ cleared brains in control and mutant mice after 1 hour of exploration of a new environment (n = 3 for each group).

If targeting of the ascending axons was solely organized in a point-to-point manner by patterning gradients in the thalamus and cortex, this genetic manipulation should have resulted in formation of an interspersed ‘biwhisker’ representation of the whiskers in both thalamic and cortical relays. Instead, we observed complete segregation of the ipsi- and contralateral whisker maps, with each map following the spatial continuity of inputs from the whiskers. However, each map retained correct orientation and topographic organization. This shows that genetic pre-patterning and preservation of the continuity of inputs interact to control, respectively, the position and layout of the somatosensory maps. The absence of left-right mixing of inputs in the <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO</italic> mutant somatosensory cortex also suggests that mechanisms allowing integration of bilateral inputs in the visual cortex might be absent from the somatosensory cortex.</p><p>The effect of uncrossing commissures was studied in the same conditional Robo3 mutant in other systems: the olivo-cerebellar projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Badura et al., 2013</xref>) and the auditory projections from the cochlear nucleus to the medium nucleus of the trapezoid body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Michalski et al., 2013</xref>). In these two studies, it was found that affecting the laterality of the projections did not affect the topographic targeting of the uncrossed axons. However, in the case of the calyx of Held, maturation of the uncrossed synapses was delayed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Michalski et al., 2013</xref>). It is unclear whether midline crossing changes the molecular expression profile of the axons to promote synaptic maturation, or whether this is an indirect effect of incorrect integration within an otherwise normal network. It would be of value to determine the physiological properties of the ipsilateral map, especially because this new model provides an opportunity to study cortical integration of an abnormal circuit.</p><p>The absence of bilateral integration between the two maps in the cortex of <italic>Robo3</italic> mutants differs strikingly from that observed in the binocular region of the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sato and Stryker, 2008</xref>). The particular organization of the two embedded whisker maps emphasizes an important characteristic of the somatosensory system which combines two different mapping rules: the first being the continuous topographic representation of the body surface, and the second being organization into distinct functional units. Organization of bilaterality in the somatosensory cortex occurs differently when forced in the <italic>Robo3<sup>R3-5</sup>-cKO</italic> mice than in the normal visual cortex. This raises the tantalizing possibility that specific molecular and activity-based mechanisms absent from the somatosensory system are present in the visual system to promote integration of bilateral information in the cortex, and could therefore be evolutionary mechanisms governing how sensory information is processed in <italic>Bilateria</italic>.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Orientation of representations and cortical plasticity</title><p>Contrary to previous observations of experimental map duplication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001</xref>), the present orientation of the two whisker maps was similar in the general rostrocaudal and mediolateral axes, indicating that matching gradients of guidance molecules and their receptors was most likely unchanged, which was confirmed for ephrin-A5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This contrasts with the mirror image organization of the sensory maps obtained when inducing novel sources of molecular gradients in the somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fukuchi-Shimogori and Grove, 2001</xref>). This also contrasts with observations of map duplication in the visual system, caused by a change in the retinal axon crossing at the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Petros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rebsam et al., 2009</xref>), by lack of one eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Trevelyan et al., 2007</xref>) or by lack of one hemisphere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Muckli et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>The normal orientation of the ipsilateral map in the mutants is surprising. One might have expected that switching laterality of the normally crossed projections would flip the axis of the ipsilateral map from the contralateral map to account for the chiral organization of the left and right sides of the face. As both maps in the mutants respect the normal orientation, the ascending tract from the ipsilateral side may either undergo torsion en route to the VPM to correct the orientation based on molecular gradients present in the lemniscal pathway. Alternatively, the correction of the orientation may occur only at the target site in the VPM based on the gradients of expression of Eph receptors/ephrin ligands in a process akin to the visual tectum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Feldheim et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tessier-Lavigne, 1995</xref>). If true, this hypothesis implicates the presence of additional mechanisms of axonal pruning and refinement, as seen during the post-targeting development of visual projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Nakamura and O'Leary, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Simon et al., 2012</xref>) to correct the final orientation of the ipsilateral map.</p><p>In conclusion, although the initial wiring of the brain relies largely on genetically encoded processes, our results illustrate the remarkable plasticity of the mammalian brain and its ability to accommodate changes in afferent wiring in evolution to create new maps and bilateral representations.

To speed up the acquisitions, both channels were acquired in two separate scans.</p><p>Maximum 3D projections in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and all panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7B</xref> were performed using Imaris (Bitplane, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaris">http://www.bitplane.com/imaris/imaris</ext-link>), and generated from manual 3D segmentation of the raw data using the surface tool.

The peripheral (contra) map area was limited to the barrels located immediately above and below the border of the central ipsi map. To determine individual barrel areas in adults, only the largest unambiguous barrels were measured (first three barrels for rows e, d, c, and first barrels for rows a and b).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Denis Jabaudon (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors use an elegant genetic strategy to compromise the trigeminothalamic projection in mice. Sensory information arising from one whisker is mapped onto one barrelette in the brainstem. This study shows that after conditional deletion of Robo3, a receptor mediating midline crossing at the principal sensory nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (PrV), the same information is mapped bilaterally in the secondary relay in the thalamus and in the cerebral cortex. The model is a promising tool to manipulate sensory projections that could help to understand rules governing the formation of sensory maps in general. The data are very robust and well-presented graphically. However, there are certain issues that need to be clarified, especially concerning the focus given to this model in the present manuscript.</p><p>Major revisions:</p><p>1) Although the experimental paradigm used is novel and interesting, a major concern is that it is difficult to identify a new principle beyond what is already known about the mechanisms underlying somatosensory map formation. For example, the authors attempt to compare their results with existing duplication models of the barrel field, but the contribution of the present study and advances it offers to understanding the rules governing the development of the somatosensory system are unclear. One suggestion is to better articulate on the first/second page of the Introduction what is being tested here – overlap of sensory fields, map-building and/or whether the inputs are segregated if midline crossing is aberrant?</p><p>2) One point of interest to the reviewers would be to use the model to better highlight the mechanisms involved in the formation of ipsilateral and contralateral bilateral projections:</p><p>A) You found that within the thalamus and cortex the ipsi and contra projections form a distinct and duplicated map. Therefore, you conclude that a mechanism may exist for segregation based on competition between these two subpopulations of axons. The whisker map projects to the thalamus and cortex by both the ipsi and contra axons by proximity rules rather than obeying common gradients at the target. This result is considered &quot;unexpected&quot;; expand on the concept of proximity rules.</p><p>B) This result could also be explained by the distinct arrival times of ipsi versus contra axons. In fact, the map organized by the ipsi projections is better defined and arranged within the target, in both the thalamus and cortex. Moreover, rows B and A that are the latest rows to develop are less represented in the contralateral map, suggesting that they are formed later. Therefore, it is possible that ipsi axons arrive to the thalamus first, impose the whisker map representation in place and when contra axons arrive they take the remaining space and impose the second map in an ordered manner. This possibility should be tested or, at least considered and discussed, and if this scenario is true, this implies that competition among these axons is not the primary mechanism.</p><p>C) For the ipsi-contra aspect, the proportion of ipsi vs contra axons should be quantified in the <italic>Robo3-cKO</italic>. This would be an extremely important piece of information for understanding the phenotype of the duplication.</p><p>3) The role of spontaneous activity and activity-dependent competition is stressed in the process of innervation and mapping. While the study shows that the developmental program controlling the bilateral segregation of visual and auditory inputs is conserved and can be activated in thalamic nuclei for the somatosensory modality (with some differences in continuity of the map), the role of activity is not clear.</p><p>A) There are no direct experiments addressing the role of activity-dependence, except for the sensory deprivation paradigm. The last two lines of the Introduction beginning with &quot;the crossed and uncrossed sensory afferents compete for space in both the thalamic relay and the cerebral cortex&quot; are vague. Either add any experiments you have done or tone down this aspect in the manuscript.</p><p>B) Rebsam et al., 2009 (J Neurosci. 29(47):14855-63) could be cited as another example of mis-guidance at the midline. In this case, in the absence of the &quot;ipsi&quot; receptor implementing midline avoidance, some retinal ganglion cell axons cross the midline, target to the relatively correct site within the thalamus, but the final pattern of segregation in the normal target site is activity dependent. Compare results, especially in the Discussion, subsection “Orientation and competition of the representations”.</p><p>4) Molecular gradients vs. activity based rules:</p><p>A) In the subsection &quot;Orientation and polarity of the maps&quot;, two possibilities are posed: i). that afferents follow topographic guidance cues determined by molecular guidance cues in the cortex/thalamus, with the outcome of neighboring whiskers of the ipsi and contra map in register and ii). That activity-based rules lead to coordination of afferents such that they cluster together, and that nearest neighbor association is more relevant than molecular gradients. The last sentence of this section does not clearly state which of the two options is supported.</p><p>B) It is difficult to discern through the text and figure legends that deafferentation disrupts the segregation of ipsi and contra in the KO.</p><p>C) An assumption in the manuscript is that the gradients of molecules for patterning of target areas are unchanged in the <italic>Robo3-cKO</italic>, but has not been tested. Please clarify.</p><p>D) You do allude to &quot;tags on the axons&quot; (first paragraph of Discussion and molecular expression profiles in the subsection “Duplication and segregation of whisker maps”). But this comes in the Discussion, and in the latter section, whether these molecular entities would implement the formation of distinct functional units is not considered.</p><p>5) One missing point of discussion is whether molecular changes occur when axons cross (or do not cross) the midline, such that they are impaired in their final pattern of connectivity. Michalski et al., on which the senior author of the present paper is listed, and which addresses this issue in a Robo3 KO. The final pattern in the Michalski study, could also be due to molecular affinities of axons with each other (ipsi-contra) or with target cells.</p><p>6) Figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is difficult to comprehend and there seems to be erroneous representation. First, the data in the cKO panels and the quantification seem to be swapped between ipsi and contra, as written in the legend, and to make sense to what has been shown before. Moreover, it lacks the control <italic>Robo3-cKO</italic> intact panels for comparison. This is an essential component of this figure and it should be included.</p><p>7) Textual issues:</p><p>A) Throughout the manuscript there are sentences that are awkward and difficult to read and understand (e.g., at the end of the long last section: what is the conclusion from this part? And last sentence of the first paragraph of the Discussion).</p><p>B) The Discussion in general is complicated, repetitive and without a clear focus. Addressing some of the points in # 1-4 above would help in revising the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23494.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Major revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Although the experimental paradigm used is novel and interesting, a major concern is that it is difficult to identify a new principle beyond what is already known about the mechanisms underlying somatosensory map formation.

The whisker map projects to the thalamus and cortex by both the ipsi and contra axons by proximity rules rather than obeying common gradients at the target. This result is considered &quot;unexpected&quot;; expand on the concept of proximity rules.</italic> </p><p><italic>B) This result could also be explained by the distinct arrival times of ipsi versus contra axons. In fact, the map organized by the ipsi projections is better defined and arranged within the target, in both the thalamus and cortex. Moreover, rows B and A that are the latest rows to develop are less represented in the contralateral map, suggesting that they are formed later. Therefore, it is possible that ipsi axons arrive to the thalamus first, impose the whisker map representation in place and when contra axons arrive they take the remaining space and impose the second map in an ordered manner. This possibility should be tested or, at least considered and discussed, and if this scenario is true, this implies that competition among these axons is not the primary mechanism.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers make an important point here, as timing is an important issue that needs to be considered in the interpretation of our results. We thank the reviewing team for raising these questions. In our revised manuscript we expanded the text on these considerations (A and B), and added a paragraph on the timing of arrival of the axons in the Discussion (B). Technically, it is very challenging to compare the exact timing of arrival of ipsilateral versus contralateral axons because there are no constitutive markers for either population, and specifically targeting those projections before E11 with tracers would be quite challenging. However, we now provide a supplementary <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where such tracing was done at E15. This shows that the ipsi and contralateral trigemino-thalamic axons travel side by side in the lemniscus, and that they are both reach the VPM by E15. Moreover, at E18, the R3-derived trigemino-thalamic axons have all terminated in the VPM, forming what appear to be 2 separate domains in the mutants. Overall, these data support the contention that ipsi and contralateral trigeminal axons reach the VB at the same time in the Robo3-CKO.</p><p><italic>C) For the ipsi-contra aspect, the proportion of ipsi vs contra axons should be quantified in the Robo3-cKO. This would be an extremely important piece of information for understanding the phenotype of the duplication.</italic> </p><p>It is very difficult (or impossible) to quantify exactly the proportion of crossed versus uncrossed trigemino-thalamaic axons as for instance GFP is not only expressed in rhombomere 3 by PrV axons. However, we show that there should be about 3.3 times more ipsilateral axons than contralateral ascending from the PrV by quantifying (reported in the text, results section) the proportion of cell bodies retrogradely traced on each side of the PrV from VPM injections, which is an indirect, but fair, measure of the laterality of the projections.</p><p><italic>3) The role of spontaneous activity and activity-dependent competition is stressed in the process of innervation and mapping. While the study shows that the developmental program controlling the bilateral segregation of visual and auditory inputs is conserved and can be activated in thalamic nuclei for the somatosensory modality (with some differences in continuity of the map), the role of activity is not clear.</italic> </p><p><italic>A) There are no direct experiments addressing the role of activity-dependence, except for the sensory deprivation paradigm. The last two lines of the Introduction beginning with &quot;the crossed and uncrossed sensory afferents compete for space in both the thalamic relay and the cerebral cortex&quot; are vague. Either add any experiments you have done or tone down this aspect in the manuscript.</italic> </p><p><italic>B) Rebsam et al., 2009 (J Neurosci. 29(47):14855-63) could be cited as another example of mis-guidance at the midline. In this case, in the absence of the &quot;ipsi&quot; receptor implementing midline avoidance, some retinal ganglion cell axons cross the midline, target to the relatively correct site within the thalamus, but the final pattern of segregation in the normal target site is activity dependent. Compare results, especially in the Discussion, subsection “Orientation and competition of the representations”.</italic> </p><p>The reviewers make an important point. Our experiments tested the role of sensory inputs but not neural activity per se. Consequently, we toned down the discussion on the activity dependent mechanisms potentially at play in our study, and added references for the work of Rebsam et al. in the Introduction and Discussion, with more in depth comparisons between the somatosensory and visual systems.</p><p><italic>4) Molecular gradients vs. activity based rules:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) In the subsection &quot;Orientation and polarity of the maps&quot;, two possibilities are posed: i). that afferents follow topographic guidance cues determined by molecular guidance cues in the cortex/thalamus, with the outcome of neighboring whiskers of the ipsi and contra map in register and ii). That activity-based rules lead to coordination of afferents such that they cluster together, and that nearest neighbor association is more relevant than molecular gradients. The last sentence of this section does not clearly state which of the two options is supported.</italic> </p><p>In the revised version, this has been clarified at the end of the paragraph.</p><p><italic>B) It is difficult to discern through the text and figure legends that deafferentation disrupts the segregation of ipsi and contra in the KO.</italic> </p><p>We apologize for this lack of clarity: we do not think that the de-afferentiation affects the segregation of ipsi and contra inputs, or at least we don’t have evidence that it does. We observe fusion of the maps after de-afferentiation and show that the representation of the unlesioned map expands when the competing ipsi or contralateral inputs have been removed by deafferentiation. This has been clarified in the text.</p><p><italic>C) An assumption in the manuscript is that the gradients of molecules for patterning of target areas are unchanged in the Robo3-cKO, but has not been tested. Please clarify.</italic> </p><p>This is an important point: we have now added a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> showing the expression gradient of ephrin-A5 in the forebrain, which is not affected in the mutant. Discussions concerning this point have been added in the Results section and in the Discussion.</p><p><italic>D) You do allude to &quot;tags on the axons&quot; (first paragraph of Discussion and molecular expression profiles in the subsection “Duplication and segregation of whisker maps”). But this comes in the Discussion, and in the latter section, whether these molecular entities would implement the formation of distinct functional units is not considered.</italic> </p><p>This was confusing and has been deleted from the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>5) One missing point of discussion is whether molecular changes occur when axons cross (or do not cross) the midline, such that they are impaired in their final pattern of connectivity. Michalski et al., on which the senior author of the present paper is listed, and which addresses this issue in a Robo3 KO. The final pattern in the Michalski study, could also be due to molecular affinities of axons with each other (ipsi-contra) or with target cells.</italic> </p><p>This is a good point, which has now been added to the Discussion. We also added a reference to the Badura et al. study on the same mutants, analysing the olivo-cerebellar projections. The major difference of our current study with the results from Michalski et al. is that the uncrossing was complete in the case of the auditory system, instead of a mixed crossing phenotype as seen here. Therefore, the Michalski study was uniquely positioned to answer the question of synaptic maturation, whereas our current study would yield a more complex picture, akin to the Badura study, where results on the synaptic maturation at the target could be muddled by the presence of both ipsi and contra inputs in the local network.</p><p><italic>6) Figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> is difficult to comprehend and there seems to be erroneous representation. First, the data in the cKO panels and the quantification seem to be swapped between ipsi and contra, as written in the legend, and to make sense to what has been shown before. Moreover, it lacks the control Robo3-cKO intact panels for comparison. This is an essential component of this figure and it should be included.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out: there was indeed a mistake in the ordering of the panels between the ipsi and contra sides of the lesion. This has been corrected. Also, the unlesioned controls have been added to the figure for reference. Thank you for bringing this up and we apologize for this mistake.</p><p><italic>7) Textual issues:</italic> </p><p><italic>A) Throughout the manuscript there are sentences that are awkward and difficult to read and understand (e.g., at the end of the long last section: what is the conclusion from this part? And last sentence of the first paragraph of the Discussion).</italic></p><p><italic>B) The Discussion in general is complicated, repetitive and without a clear focus. Addressing some of the points in # 1-4 above would help in revising the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We hope the modifications and rewriting of the manuscript will have helped to solve those issues.</p></body></sub-article></article>
