suprachiasmatic nucleus, which mediates entrainment of rhythms to light, but the neural circuits that establish FAA remain elusive. In this study, we show that mice lacking the dopamine D1 receptor (D1R KO mice) manifest greatly reduced FAA, whereas mice lacking the dopamine D2 receptor have normal FAA. To determine where dopamine exerts its effect, we limited expression of dopamine signaling to the dorsal striatum of dopamine-deficient mice; these mice developed FAA. Within the dorsal striatum, the daily rhythm of clock gene <italic>period2</italic> expression was markedly suppressed in D1R KO mice. Pharmacological activation of D1R at the same time daily was sufficient to establish anticipatory activity in wild-type mice. These results demonstrate that dopamine signaling to D1R-expressing neurons in the dorsal striatum plays an important role in manifestation of FAA, possibly by synchronizing circadian oscillators that modulate motivational processes and behavioral output.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03781.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03781.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03781.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>If you have ever traveled a long distance by plane, you will likely be familiar with jet lag. This disorientating sensation occurs because our brains have ‘internal clocks’ that keep track of the day–night cycle and control when we feel most tired or most alert. Flying rapidly from one time zone to another causes this clock to fall out of sync with the local time. It then takes time for the brain's clock to slowly adjust by responding to the levels of light and dark in the new environment.</p><p>Humans—and other animals, plants, and even algae—have similar internal clocks, which are used to control behavior and predict events, such as the timing of a meal. These clocks can be set based on previous experiences of when food has been available and can be independent of those that follow the daily cycle of light and dark.</p><p>Mice, for example, have internal clocks that make them more active at night and sleep during the day. However, if food is only provided during the day—say, at 2 o'clock in the afternoon—hungry mice will quickly adjust when they are awake in order to get the food as soon it is provided. Also, for a few hours before their new feeding time the mice will tend to jump and move around more; this is known as ‘food anticipatory activity’. Researchers have been studying this activity for around 40 years, but the specific regions of the brain and the processes that support these rhythms of feeding behavior remained unknown.</p><p>Now, Gallardo et al. have shown that mice need dopamine—a neurotransmitter that is often called the brain's ‘feel-good chemical’—to maintain the internal clock that supports food anticipatory activity. Neurotransmitters are chemicals that carry signals between neurons; one neuron releases the chemical, and another detects it using proteins on the neuron's surface called receptors. Two main types of receptors—called D1 receptors and D2 receptors—detect dopamine. Gallardo et al. found that D1 receptors are important for maintaining feeding-related daily rhythms, but that D2 receptors are not. Additionally, dopamine only needs to be produced in a region of the brain called the dorsal striatum for food anticipatory activity to occur. This suggests that only D1 receptors in this region influence this activity, though there are many other regions of the brain that contain these receptors.</p><p>The next challenge is to unravel the neural circuits that control food anticipation behavior. For example, what ‘tells’ the neurons in the dorsal striatum that an animal is hungry? Which of the D1 receptor expressing neurons relay the information about the timing of food anticipatory behavior and to where? Also, if a similar clock operates in humans, testing to see if it is misregulated in people with eating disorders could help us to better understand these conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link

behavior and physiology are regulated by a distributed system of cell-autonomous circadian oscillators located in the brain and in most peripheral organs and tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bell-Pedersen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). In mammals, a population of coupled circadian clock cells in the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) function as a master pacemaker responsible for coordinating circadian oscillators elsewhere in the brain and other tissues with daily light–dark cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Welsh et al., 2010</xref>). Circadian clocks in many tissues, including multiple brain regions outside of the SCN, can also be entrained by daily cycles of food availability, independently of the SCN pacemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stokkan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mistlberger, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verwey and Amir, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mohawk et al., 2012</xref>). In rat and mouse, this is readily demonstrated by restricting food access to the middle of the light period, when nocturnal rodents normally eat little and are inactive. This induces a marked shifting of circadian oscillators and organ functions to align with the new daily feeding time, while the SCN remains coupled to the light-dark (LD) cycle. In many species, this is also associated with the emergence of a daily bout of locomotor activity that anticipates meal time by 1–3 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulos and Terman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stephan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mistlberger, 2011</xref>). Remarkably, this so-called food anticipatory activity (FAA) exhibits formal properties of circadian clock control, yet persists robustly after removal of the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stephan et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulos and Terman, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Marchant and Mistlberger, 1997</xref>). Anticipatory rhythms can also be induced by scheduled daily access to water, salt, palatable foods, an opportunity to mate, and psychostimulant drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mistlberger and Rusak, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mistlberger, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kosobud et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iijima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mendoza et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Honma and Honma, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Webb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hsu et al., 2010a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallardo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jansen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Landry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mohawk et al., 2013</xref>). The ability of animals to coordinate activity and physiology with access to critical resources is obviously adaptive. Similar circadian processes in humans could create daily windows of vulnerability to drug seeking, overeating, and other addictive behaviors.</p><p>A major knowledge gap in circadian neurobiology is the location of circadian oscillators that generate food (and other reward) anticipatory circadian rhythms. The stimuli and neural pathways that entrain these oscillators also remain unspecified. Conventional lesion experiments have ruled out a number of brain regions as the site of circadian oscillators necessary for FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mistlberger, 1994</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson, 2009</xref>). This includes the dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, an area that may nonetheless participate in the expression of daytime FAA by inhibiting output from the SCN pacemaker that normally opposes activity and promotes rest during the day in nocturnal rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acosta-Galvan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Landry et al., 2011</xref>). Induction of anticipatory rhythms by a range of ingestive and non-ingestive reward stimuli suggest that activation of reward circuits in the brain may play a role, perhaps as a final common entrainment pathway. This is supported by evidence that circadian clock genes exhibit daily rhythms of expression in components of the reward system, including the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wakamatsu et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Angeles-Castellanos et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Verwey and Amir, 2011</xref>). These rhythms are inverted by daytime feeding, and, in the dorsal striatum, can be induced or reset by dopaminergic stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Iijima et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hood et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Natsubori et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2014</xref>). Importantly, FAA rhythms can be shifted by a single injection of a dopamine D2 receptor agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smit et al., 2013</xref>) and can be attenuated by dopamine D1 and D2 antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, genetic deletion of factors that activate dopamine transmission (e.g., ghrelin receptors) can attenuate FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blum et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">LeSauter et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lamont et al., 2012</xref>), but see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Szentirmai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gunapala et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Patton et al., 2013</xref>) while deletion of factors that suppress DA transmission (e.g., leptin and 5HT1c receptors) can increase FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mistlberger and Marchant, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2010c</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ribeiro et al., 2011</xref>). Lesion experiments rule out the nucleus accumbens as the site of dopamine receptors that might be necessary for FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mistlberger and Mumby, 1992</xref>), but comparable experiments of the dorsal striatum have not been reported.</p><p>In this study, we used dopamine-deficient mice and dopamine receptor knockout mice to show that food-entrained circadian rhythms are markedly attenuated in the absence of D1 receptors but are spared in mice lacking D2 receptors and in mice that express dopamine only in the dorsal striatum. We further show that a D1 receptor agonist administered once daily in the light period can induce an anticipatory rhythm. Analyses of total daily activity, FAA as a proportion of daily activity, body temperature, and striatal clock gene expression suggest that the FAA phenotype of D1R KO mice may involve impaired synchronization of food-entrainable oscillators combined with an alteration in the strategy for maintaining metabolic homeostasis, favoring reduced total daily activity over nocturnal hypothermia.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Absence of the dopamine D2 receptor does not impair FAA</title><p>To determine the significance of the dopamine system in mediating FAA, we tested mice lacking either dopamine D1 receptors (D1R KO mice) or dopamine D2R receptors (D2R KO mice). First, we investigated whether mice lacking D2R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kelly et al., 1997</xref>) showed impairments in FAA. We measured the baseline home-cage behavior using automated video-based behavior analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steele et al., 2007</xref>) of D2R KO mice and wild-type (WT) littermates in their home-cage environment. Prior to any dietary intervention (‘day -7’), both groups of mice demonstrated normal nocturnal activity waveforms with no significant differences in any 1-hr bin and no increase in activity in the hours before Zeitgeber Time (ZT) 8 (on a 13:11 LD cycle, ZT 12 is lights-off by convention) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Next, we tested their ability to time a daily 60% CR meal fed at ZT 8 every day for 28 days, recording their behavior weekly. Data were normalized by dividing the amount of high activity behavior in each hour by the total seconds of activity over the 24 hr video recording to express a fraction of high activity per hour. Measurements taken at 14, 21, and 28 days of CR revealed that both WT and D2R KO mice had a large increase in high activity (hanging, jumping, walking, and rearing) behaviors during the 3 hr preceding feeding time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). In both D2R KO and WT mice fed 60% CR daily, we observed similar acquisition and maintenance of FAA defined as normalized high activity in the 3 hr before feeding (ZT 5–8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As expected, mice of either genotype with ad libitum (AL) access to food showed very little high activity behavior in the hours preceding scheduled feeding when they were given an additional food pellet as a control for handling and disturbance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Based on our prior work demonstrating that fatty foods are more potent inducers of FAA in mice than sugary foods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsu et al., 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallardo et al., 2012</xref>), we tested whether D1R KO mice would show FAA for a 60% CR diet consisting of a more palatable, fat-rich diet. We fed D1R KO and WT controls a 60% CR diet of ‘breeder’ chow (5015 mouse diet; LabDiet), which has 25.3% calories from fat (5001 rodent chow has 13.5% calories from fat) at ZT 8 daily. D1R KO mice failed to show FAA for breeder chow, exerting only 4–8% of their total daily high activity behaviors in the 3 hr preceding scheduled meal time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>). Interestingly, although WT mice showed FAA for breeder chow, it was attenuated compared to that observed with standard chow, as WT mice redistributed only ∼20% of high activity behaviors to the 3 hr preceding feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,C</xref>) compared to 30–40% on standard chow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We also tested an even higher fat content chow, rodent ‘high fat diet’ (HFD), in which 60% of the calories come from fat. A 60% CR diet of HFD fed once daily at ZT 8 failed to induce FAA in D1R KO mice and induced a very modest FAA in WT controls, which allocated only about 10% of total high activity behaviors to the 3 hr preceding meal time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,D</xref>). From these experiments, we concluded that D1R KO mice do not fail to anticipate scheduled meal time due to a lack of palatability of the CR food source.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03781.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Higher fat content diet FAA studies in D1R KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized high activity behavior of D1R KO (n = 6) and control (n = 8) mice on day 21 of 60% CR of breeder chow diet.

To address this issue, we employed an alternative assay for relating hunger status to activity levels by acutely fasting D1R KO and control mice. In previous studies of the home-cage behavioral response to acute fasting in WT C57BL/6J mice, mice increased their high-activity behaviors two-fold upon acute fasting as compared to AL food access (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gallardo et al., 2014</xref>). We measured the total high-activity behavior of D1R KO and WT controls over a 3-day period. During days 1 and 2, all mice had AL access to standard chow. As expected, D1R WT and D1R KO mice showed similar median levels of high activity behaviors over 3 days of AL diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). On the third day, mice were either maintained on an AL diet or had their food removed entirely (‘fasted’). D1R KO mice showed a strong increase in high-activity behaviors upon acute food deprivation, increasing their activity to a greater extent than fasted WT mice, with mean values of 270.5 min and 376.9 min of high activity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). To normalize these data, we plotted the ratio of activity on fasting day 3 over that of AL day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This ratio is expected to be around one for mice that were not food deprived, in that the activity of an individual mouse should not vary much from day-to-day. Indeed, the amount of high activity on day 2 vs day 3 was close to one for both D1R WT (0.96) and D1R KO mice (0.92) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). However, when food deprived, WT mice had an activity ratio of 1.9 and D1R KO mice had a ratio of 2.5 (both of which were statistically significant when compared within genotype to AL, p &lt; 0.01 Mann–Whitney). Importantly, this assay does not measure food timing, as these mice were naive to any feeding schedule. These results suggest that the D1R KO mice are capable of up-regulating activity in response to acute food deprivation (i.e., hunger), demonstrating an intact circuitry of detecting and responding to fasting and thus ruling out gross metabolic defects.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03781.011</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Activity of acutely fasted D1R KO and WT mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Total number of seconds of high intensity activity (walking, hanging, jumping, or rearing) for D1R KO (n = 6 KO) and WT (n = 12) mice on 3 consecutive days of ad libitum diet.

Both WT and D1R KO mice consumed their HFD meal in less than 1 hr, spending 10% of their food-bin entry time during the hour after palatable-diet feeding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We noted that preprandial food-bin entry, a hallmark of HFD meal entrainment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hsu et al., 2010b</xref>), was elevated in D1R KO mice by ZT 8 on the 14th day of scheduled palatable meals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). On day 14, both groups of mice exhibited similar activity patterns over the course of the day, with small, but similar, increases in activity preceding their HFD meal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Summing high activity in the 3 hr prior to feeding (ZT 6–9) shows a similar trend of increased fraction of high activity after 10 days of HFD meal treatment for both D1R KO and control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Given how poorly D1R KO mice expressed FAA for 60% CR meals, it is surprising that daily HFD meals elicited even modest FAA, leading us to retest FAA for 60% CR meals in the same cohort of mice.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03781.013</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Activity of D1R KO (n = 9–11) and WT (n = 14) mice on a palatable meal schedule.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Fraction of time spent entering the food bin in the hour after feeding (ZT 9) on days 4, 0, and 7.

On the first day of 60% CR, we did not observe any differences in behavior between D1R KO and control mice as neither group showed FAA, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). However, after just 1 week (‘day 28’) of 60% CR, the D1R KO mice that had previously been treated with HFD showed marked FAA for their daily feeding, with a notable FAA peak that was as high as the night time activity peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).

Visual observations at meal time provided no evidence for torpor in D1R KO mice. To rule out defects in thermoregulation as a reason why D1R KO mice do not show FAA, we placed D1R KO (n = 7) and WT (n = 7) mice at 30°C continuously. After 1 week at 30°C, we tested their behavioral response to 60% CR for the next 4 weeks and did not observe FAA in D1R KO mice and noted a marked reduction in FAA for the WT mice at this elevated temperature compared to ambient (22–24°C) temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To address body temperature regulation more directly, we implanted miniature radiofrequency transmitters (Minimitter) for continuous recording of body temperature by telemetry in D1R KO (n = 6) and WT (n = 8) mice, which were then maintained on 60% CR feeding at ZT 8. The 24-hr body temperature profiles showed identical waveforms for WT and KO groups before CR schedules were started (‘day -3’) with temperatures remaining close to 34.5°C during the daytime and increasing to up to ∼36°C at night-time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). By day 14 of CR, there was a similar redistribution of mean temperature waveforms in both D1R KO and WT mice, starting with a slightly elevated postprandial temperatures and steady temperature declines in the middle of the dark phase (ZT 19) that continues until about 6 hr before expected meal time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). Despite similar profiles in temperature waveforms, we did note that D1R KO mice tended to show a slightly higher temperature during the entirety of the dark cycle compared to WT controls during CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). We tested for an effect of genotype and day of measurement on nocturnal temperature, finding that there were no statistically significant differences between D1R WT and KO (genotype accounts for 5.63% of the total variance; F = 1.15; p = 0.3044) but there was a significant effect of day of experiment (interaction accounts for 4.43% of the total variance; F = 4.53; p = 0.0001; 2-way repeated measures ANOVA). However, there was no significant difference in average temperatures between D1R KO and controls during the 3 hr preceding feeding at any point during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). We also examined the fluctuation in temperature, ‘the ΔT’, in the 3 hr preceding meal time by subtracting the maximum and minimum temperature values within the FAA window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). By this metric, D1R KO and WT mice show increasing ΔT following the start of CR feeding schedules with values peaking by day 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9F</xref>). The D1R KO mice had a similar ΔT to control at all times except for days 14 and 17, where this difference was statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05, day 17). Given that the ΔT is similar again by day 21, we conclude that overall there are subtle differences in temperature entrainment in D1R KO mice but that overall their metabolism is effectively modulated by CR feeding; importantly, they do not fail to show FAA due to entering a torpor state.<fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03781.015</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Body temperature measurements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean (± SEM) body temperature of WT and D1R KO mice 3 days prior to initiating CR, (<bold>B</bold>) day 14, (<bold>C</bold>) day 17, and (<bold>D</bold>) day 21 of CR.

Localization of these oscillators and their entrainment pathways has been an enduring challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Davidson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mistlberger, 2011</xref>). Recent studies suggest a role for dopamine signaling in the expression and timing of food anticipatory rhythms in mice and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Smit et al., 2013</xref>). In this study, we provide comprehensive evidence supporting an important role for dopamine signaling via D1R in the expression of FAA in CR mice fed in the light period. Using video-based automated behavior analysis, motion sensors, and running discs, we demonstrated that anticipation of a daily meal is markedly attenuated in mice lacking D1R. By contrast, it is normal in mice lacking D2R and in dopamine-deficient mice with local production of dopamine in the dorsal striatum. The reduction in FAA in D1R KO mice is evident both in total counts and when normalized for total daily activity. We propose that attenuated FAA in D1R KO mice may involve three distinct processes; circadian oscillator entrainment, incentive motivation, and metabolic homeostasis.</p><p>Circadian clocks regulate the timing of behavior, but can also regulate the peak level of activity by variations in clock amplitude. Mammalian circadian clocks are comprised of populations of coupled circadian oscillators (clock cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colwell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mohawk and Takahashi, 2011</xref>). Disruption of coupling within a population of circadian oscillators can flatten aggregate clock output and attenuate rhythm peaks. A circadian oscillator entrainment interpretation of attenuated FAA in D1R KO mice is suggested by two observations. First, in parallel with attenuated FAA rhythms, D1R KO mice also exhibited a marked attenuation of a daily rhythm of clock gene (<italic>Per2</italic>) expression in the dorsal striatum. Second, a daily injection of the D1 agonist SKF-81257 was sufficient to induce a rhythm of anticipatory activity that was synchronized to the injection time and that persisted during a withdrawal day. These results converge on a hypothesis that dopamine signaling via D1R in the dorsal striatum entrains circadian oscillators that regulate the timing and amplitude of FAA. We speculate that a daily rhythm of dopamine release associated with food acquisition serves to coordinate the phase of circadian clock cells in the dorsal striatum, and that genetic deletion of D1R impairs this function, thereby reducing the amplitude of the population rhythm and the magnitude of the activity rhythm driven by these oscillators. In this respect, D1R signaling in food-entrainable oscillators of the dorsal striatum may be analogous to VPAC receptor signaling in the SCN, which is critical for coupling the population of circadian oscillators that constitute this light entrained circadian pacemaker (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harmar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aton et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Circadian clocks are thought to directly drive or gate output of neural systems that produce observable daily rhythms of rest and activity. Circadian clocks also generate internal time cues that animals can use to discriminate time of day; for example, to permit daily time-place learning, or time-compensated-sun-compass orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mistlberger, 1994</xref>). A representation of circadian clock phase, by repeated association with a fixed daily meal time, could acquire salience as an incentive stimulus and generate a daily rhythm of incentive motivation manifest as FAA. Such a model could account for the ability of some animals to anticipate two or more meal times per day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biebach et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Van der Zee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luby et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mistlberger et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mulder et al., 2013</xref>). It is therefore possible that attenuated FAA in D1R KO mice, which did not express FAA even when aroused 2 hr prior to meal time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), reflects impaired incentive motivation, due to a failure to attribute incentive salience to representations of circadian phase, due to degradation of the clock signals by striatal oscillator damping, or both.</p><p>An unexpected finding was that while a palatable HFD did not improve FAA in CR D1R KO mice, the same diet provided once daily did induce a weak FAA equivalently in KO and WT mice with AL access to regular chow throughout the day. Furthermore, upon transfer to the CR schedule, the KO mice showed a transient FAA that dissipated over the course of the first week. These observations suggest that enhanced palatability can compensate for deficits in oscillator entrainment or incentive motivation, but that this effect is masked by CR. We speculate that the activity phenotype in D1R KO mice reflects an additional metabolic factor. Although D1R KO mice, like WT mice, exhibited hyperactivity during acute food deprivation they were significantly less active throughout the day and night during the chronic CR schedules. This was not due to metabolic collapse, given that during chronic restriction, D1R KO mice maintained nocturnal body temperatures relative to WT mice, which were hypothermic at night and early in the light period. These results suggest a different strategy used by WT and KO mice to maintain metabolic homeostasis during CR. The WT mice may conserve energy by reducing metabolism at night and expend energy by raising body temperature and locomotor activity in anticipation of a regular daily meal time. The KO mice, by contrast, switch from an initial hyperactivity to a long-term hypoactivity of sufficient magnitude to support a more normal body temperature despite restricted calorie intake. This strategy results in low levels of activity both at night and prior to meal time. Nonetheless, the reduction in FAA is significant even when normalized against total daily activity. Thus, the food anticipation phenotype in CR D1R KO mice may be explained by an alteration in the strategy to maintain metabolic homeostasis, which damps activity non-specifically throughout the 24-hr cycle and an impairment in circadian entrainment and/or incentive motivation processes that results in a disproportionate reduction of activity in anticipation of meal time.</p><p>Another notable feature of the food entrainment phenotype in D1R KO mice is that despite the marked attenuation of FAA, the preprandial rise in body temperature is essentially normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Feeding schedules entrain circadian oscillators in many body tissues and brain regions. There is at present no direct evidence for a master food-entrainable pacemaker analogous to the retinorecipient light-entrainable pacemaker in the SCN, which in mammals is indispensible for entrainment to light:dark cycles. Indeed hypophysectomy eliminates preprandial temperature increases but not FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson and Stephan, 1999</xref>), a dissociation that we have also observed with mice showing temperature entrainment without FAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gallardo et al., 2012</xref>) and mice showing FAA without showing preprandial temperature increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luby et al., 2012</xref>). Food entrainment may involve multiple parallel entrainment pathways, acting on a fully distributed, non-hierarchical system of circadian oscillators in local circuits, each responsible for generating food-entrained rhythms in tissue specific functions. The differential effect of the D1R KO on behavior and body temperature is consistent with this model.</p><p>Evidence that daily rhythms of food anticipatory activity may reflect entrainment of circadian oscillations in the dorsal striatum by daily reward schedules and D1R signaling suggest new insights into the processes that may induce and sustain daily repetitive or even addictive behaviors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Ethics statement</title><p>These experiments were approved by the institutional animal care committees of California Institute of Technology (protocol number 1567); Keck Science Department of Claremont McKenna College, Pitzer College, Scripps Colleges; California State Polytechnic University, Pomona (13.029), University of Washington, Seattle; and Simon Fraser University.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Mouse strains and husbandry</title><p>For experiments performed at Caltech (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2">Figures 1, 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5 fig6 fig7 fig8 fig9">Figures 4–9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1 fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplements 1, 2</xref>) mice were maintained on a 13:11 Light:Dark cycle and their behavior was measured by computer vision of video recordings (described below).

There were, however, a number of substantial and minor concerns that need to be dealt with before this paper would be suitable for publication. The full reviews are appended below. The major issues, requiring re-review, are the following:</p><p>1) There are numerous apparent inconsistencies in the timing of the meals and the behavioral assessments and this compromises the clarity of the presentation. These inconsistencies prevent the reader from evaluating several of the key findings adequately (see Reviewer #2 and Reviewer 3# points 1-4). This is a crucial shortcoming that would need to be addressed for the paper to be reassessed by the reviewers.</p><p>2) The specificity of the viral manipulation needs to be established in a quantitative manner (see Reviewer #2 comments below).</p><p>3) There were no data on the pattern of Per2 expression in ad lib feeding. These data are important the authors' claims and need to be shown (see Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #3 point 5).</p><p>Further detail is provided below:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1</italic>:</p><p>This paper is a very thorough investigation of the nature of the circadian processes underlying food anticipation in mice. This phenomenon has been investigated for many years and has been a very difficult to understand mechanistically due to the fact that there are many extrinsic and intrinsic variables that animals integrate in making behavioral decisions. The authors do an excellent job of investigating what are probably the most important variables and come up with a very convincing story about DA in the striatum being the driver of the relevant peripheral oscillator. I think that this paper, because it answers a very long-standing question in a rigorous manner is an important contribution.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) The fact that there is a basal Per2 rhythm with peak at ZT23 is kind of buried. It is relevant that there is a 12h phase shift with CR entrainment and the authors might want to make this clearer.</p><p>2) In some figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> vs D) the Y axes are different on panels that the reader might want to compare. If you normalize the axes, the cross panel contrasts would be more obvious.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>This study by Gallardo and colleagues explores the role of DA in food anticipatory activity (FAA) in mice. These daily rhythms of FAA are of broad interest to the community as prior work has shown that the SCN is not involved. Prior work has indicated a role for DA in FAA still much is not known about the underlying mechanisms. In this study, the authors show that D1R KO mice do not show much FAA while the D2R KO mice have normal FAA. In an important advance, the authors report that use of a viral construct to express DA in the dorsal striatum of dopamine-deficient mice allows these mice to develop FAA. Finally, the administration of D1 agonist itself is sufficient to establish anticipatory activity in wild-type mice.</p><p>There are several strengths of this work: The topic is of interest, the writing is clear, and citations appropriate; The Introduction nicely sets up the problem; Some of the data are very clear including the impact of the loss of D1R and the rescue of FAA in dopamine deficient mice by injection of the virus in the dorsal striatum.</p><p>Still there are some weaknesses:</p><p>The Results need to be pruned. The authors present all of the data with equal weighting while there are clearly some experiments that are critical while others are more of controls.</p><p>The issue of the anatomical specificity of the virus-driven DA expression is critical. The authors want to claim that the dorsal striatum is important for this behavioral rescue but they do not present enough data for us to evaluate this claim. How many mice were injected? How was the expression of the DA quantified? They show us a nice picture but we need more information if we are to believe that the dorsal striatum is critical.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript reports a suppression of food anticipatory activity (FAA) in dopamine D1 receptor, but not D2 receptor, knockout (KO) mice. They also show that 24-hour scheduled D1R activation in the dorsal striatum leads to anticipatory-like activity in mice. The results are interesting and have potential implications for a wide range of biological processes. The authors also performed several different types of control and follow-up experiments, providing nuanced detail about the nature of FAA in the D1R KO mice. There are, however, several elements of the manuscript that raise questions and prevent the reader from drawing clear conclusions as to the role of D1 receptors in FAA. These and other concerns about the manuscript are detailed below.</p><p>1) The feeding times for the food restriction vary throughout the manuscript. This makes it difficult to accurately compare the data from figure to figure/experiment to experiment. Further, while quantitative analyses are said to be performed on the 3h prior to feeding, the figure labels consistently refer to a 2h interval (e.g., ZT5-7 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Additionally, the feeding time is not accurately reported for each set of data. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> appears to show the meal occurring at ZT8 (which is what is reported for this experiment in the text) and then <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> shows activity being score for ZT5-7 (a 2h interval), but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> supplement shows a meal at ZT8, with activity being scored ZT7-9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2G</xref>), and the figure legend states that these data are from the same mice as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. These details need to be corrected and clarified throughout the manuscript so that the reader can make clear comparisons between the figures presented.</p><p>2) The data presented in the figures, with the exception of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, are said to be median values. This is an unusual way to report the average. Do the average waveforms also use median values, or only the histograms? It is conventional to report mean value, and doing so (or reporting median values for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) would allow the reader to compare data across figures of this manuscript.</p><p>3) It is difficult to tell whether the D1R knockout mice completely lack FAA or whether it is merely attenuated. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (wheel-running), the mice appear to be showing FAA, but the “high activity” measure does not appear to capture this difference. Statistics are reported for differences between D1R and WT mice, but were within-subjects analyses done to determine whether WT and D1R mice were showing increased activity across time on restricted feeding? Please include these analyses.</p><p>4) The presentation of the activity waveform figures in all but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> makes it hard to view the FAA. Shifting the x-axis so that the meal time is closer to the center would allow the reader to view the data more easily. I would suggest making the x-axis for all activity figures match that of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3 (A-C)</xref>.</p><p>Additionally, the authors should include actograms (the original data) presenting the data for representative D1R KO and WT mice on restricted feeding.

The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>This revision has improved an already interesting manuscript. That said, there are still a few major concerns that have not been properly addressed.</p><p>1) Individual animal data. Authors only included individual records for day 21 of RF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>); there are no data from prior to RF. In the main figure, they present summary data for days -7, 0, 7,14, 21, &amp; 28.

If data are scored up until ZT8, this should be written as “ZT5-8.” ZT (zeitgeber time) is a form of time, and thus a continuous variable (not an integer). ZT5-7 is, by definition, 2h-ZT5:00-ZT7:00. Writing ZT5-7 when you intend to include all of hour 7 is the equivalent of saying an event occurs from 5:00am-7:00am when you mean it occurs from 5:00am to 8:00am. All of the figures and text should be updated to denote a 3h period. This notation of times must be corrected in the manuscript before acceptance of the paper.</p><p>The authors need to make explicit all the various differences in the experiments (sites, labs, equipment), and then they can use this as a 'strength' as they argue in their rebuttal.

These inconsistencies prevent the reader from evaluating several of the key findings adequately (see Reviewer #2 and Reviewer 3# points 1-4). This is a crucial shortcoming that would need to be addressed for the paper to be reassessed by the reviewers</italic>.</p><p>There are two reasons for inconsistencies in meal time presentation: 1) a mistake on our part in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (zt 5-7, not 7-9). We apologize for this error and have made the appropriate corrections in the revised manuscript. 2) The other reason for differences in feeding times was a result of the experiments being conducted over a 4+ year period in 5 separate laboratory settings (Caltech, Simon Fraser, Keck Science Department, UWash, and Cal Poly Pomona). For example, at some institutions the light:dark cycle was 13:11 and at others 12:12. For FAA studies mice were fed consistently during the middle-to-late portion of the light cycle and the range was different by only 3 hours; all mice were fed between ZT6 and ZT8 for our study. A great many restricted daytime feeding experiments have been done over the past ∼40 years, and these studies show that the parameters of food anticipatory activity (most importantly, its duration and amplitude) vary little or not at all with the time within the light period when the mealtime is initiated. In our experiments the mealtimes are consistent within experiments, which is the only methodological factor that is critical for interpreting differences between WT and KO mice. In fact, the variability of mealtimes across experiments can be viewed as a strength of the study, because we consistently observed the deficit in food anticipatory activity in caloric restriction experiments regardless of when the daily meal started in a particular experiment.</p><p>With respect for evaluation of behavior, we used several different methods (computer vision, running wheel, and motion sensors) to thoroughly characterize the D1R knockout mice and their deficit in FAA. <italic>Prima face</italic> this can be confusing, but it is actually a great strength of our study. To ensure that our results are reproducible across laboratories we tested KO mice in different settings with different techniques. The lack of FAA observed in D1R KO mice using computer vision was more pronounced than what was observed at Simon Fraser University using disc running wheels and motion sensors, and continuous daily recordings. Nonetheless, the defect was still significant at SFU. We replicated the D1R KO FAA study using computer vision data at Keck Science Department but did not present in our manuscript because the study was terminated at day 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Author response image 1</xref>):<fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p>replication of D1R KO CR phenotype at Keck Science Department using computer vision to measure activity levels. n=7-10 mice per group.</p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03781-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>In summary, across several laboratory settings with slight variations in feeding times, we observed a diminution or in some cases a complete lack of FAA in D1R KO mice. Further, detailed responses to the queries of reviewers 2 and 3 can be found below.</p><p><italic>2) The specificity of the viral manipulation needs to be established in a quantitative manner (see Reviewer #2)</italic>.</p><p>This model relies primarily on a behavioral “rescue” phenotype (ability to survive without daily L-DOPA injections).

These data are important the authors' claims and need to be shown (see Reviewer #1 and Reviewer #3 point 5)</italic>.</p><p>The data that we have available to report at the present time confirm that there is a daily rhythm of Per2 expression in the dorsal striatum of WT mice anticipating a daytime feeding opportunity, and show for the first time that this rhythm is severely attenuated (statistically absent) in D1R KO mice. These data permit a substantive conclusion that dopamine signaling at D1 receptors is necessary for a clock gene rhythm in the dorsal striatum of food-restricted mice. This conclusion does not require data on WT and KO mice on ad-lib food access. Ad-lib groups are only required if we were trying to make a novel claim that clock gene expression in the dorsal striatum is shifted by restricted daytime feeding schedules. That claim has already been made in the literature by several groups (dating back to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wakamatsu et al, 2001</xref>). While we do cite prior studies to suggest that the Per2 rhythm in the WT mice is shifted by comparison with ad-lib fed WT mice in previous studies, that is not the important point; rather, it is the loss of this rhythm in KO mice that is the critical, novel finding.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p><italic>1) The fact that there is a basal Per2 rhythm with peak at ZT23 is kind of buried. It is relevant that there is a 12h phase shift with CR entrainment and the authors might want to make this clearer</italic>.</p><p>The Results section here is worded as follows:</p><p>“WT mice exhibited a 24-hr rhythm with peak expression at ZT12 (lights-off), which is advanced by comparison with the daily rhythm in AL fed rodents (e.g., (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harbour et al., 2013</xref>)). KO mice exhibited a markedly attenuated daily rhythm of striatal <italic>Per2</italic> expression, due primarily to reduced expression at ZT12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).”</p><p>We believe that this is a clear statement of the results, and are not sure in what way it should be improved. Our goal was to compare WT and KO mice on restricted feeding, and thus while we do note that the timing of the rhythm in the WT group is consistent with a phase shift, that is a secondary point (as this has already been demonstrated in several prior studies).</p><p><italic>2) In some figures (e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref> <italic>vs D) the Y axes are different on panels that the reader might want to compare.

This makes it difficult to accurately compare the data from figure to figure/experiment to experiment. Further, while quantitative analyses are said to be performed on the 3h prior to feeding, the figure labels consistently refer to a 2h interval (e.g., ZT5-7 in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>). Additionally, the feeding time is not accurately reported for each set of data. For example,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>appears to show the meal occurring at ZT8 (which is what is reported for this experiment in the text) and then</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2E</italic></xref> <italic>shows activity being score for ZT5-7 (a 2h interval), but</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>supplement shows a meal at ZT8, with activity being scored ZT7-9 (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 2G</italic></xref><italic>), and the figure legend states that these data are from the same mice as</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref><italic>. These details need to be corrected and clarified throughout the manuscript so that the reader can make clear comparisons between the figures presented</italic>.</p><p>Please see response #1 to the major issues for an explanation of feeding times. We thank the reviewer for catching the mistake in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>’s supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>). To clarify, for all our experiments, a window of 3 hr prior to feeding time was used. For example, ZT 5-7 is inclusive of hours, 5, 6, and 7 and therefore represents the 3 hr prior to feeding. It is the sum of activity in each of the three hours prior to the feeding time, which occurs at ZT 8. In the first paragraph of the Results section we had stated our definition as follows: “In both D2R KO and WT mice fed 60% CR daily, we observed similar acquisition and maintenance of FAA, defined as normalized high activity in the 3 hr before feeding (ZT 5-7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).” If that is not clear enough then we are open to suggestions on how to avoid confusion.</p><p><italic>2) The data presented in the figures, with the exception of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>, are said to be median values. This is an unusual way to report the average. Do the average waveforms also use median values, or only the histograms? It is conventional to report mean value, and doing so (or reporting median values for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref><italic>) would allow the reader to compare data across figures of this manuscript</italic>.</p><p>Here we are running into different conventions for how data are presented; for data collected on home cage behaviors using computer vision we always present median +/- interquartile range (in our 6 previous FAA papers: <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> 5(9): e12903, <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> 5(11): e15429, <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> 6(3): e18377, <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> 7(5): e37992, <italic>PLoS ONE</italic> 7(7): e41161, <italic>PLOS ONE</italic> 9(5): e95990, PLOS ONE, e12903). Since our data does not fall on a normal distribution, the median is more reflective of the non-parametric statistical tests that we use. Essentially, the mean value has no meaning in terms of our statistics so it seems misrepresentative to present means +/- standard error.</p><p>For the wheel-running data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> the mean +/- standard error is used as following normal convention for this lab and this type of data.</p><p><italic>3) It is difficult to tell whether the D1R knockout mice completely lack FAA or whether it is merely attenuated. In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>(wheel-running), the mice appear to be showing FAA, but the “high activity” measure does not appear to capture this difference. Statistics are reported for differences between D1R and WT mice, but were within-subjects analyses done to determine whether WT and D1R mice were showing increased activity across time on restricted feeding? Please include these analyses</italic>.</p><p>The lack of FAA is more apparent when measured by computer vision than with disc-running behavior. This may reflect in part the fact that in the disc running experiments, data collection was continuous (as per convention with this measure), whereas the computer vision analyses (more computationally intense) were done on ∼1 day of 24h video recording/week. There are some D1R KO mice that completely fail to increase activity (measured by computer vision) for meal time but most mice do show a small increase in activity before meal time. The individual mouse data added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref> should help to clarify this and show the mouse-to-mouse variation. Within mice, after the first 1-2 weeks, FAA was typically stable across time, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>4) The presentation of the activity waveform figures in all but</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>makes it hard to view the FAA. Shifting the x-axis so that the meal time is closer to the center would allow the reader to view the data more easily. I would suggest making the x-axis for all activity figures match that of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3 (A-C)</italic></xref>.</p><p><italic>Additionally, the authors should include actograms (the original data) presenting the data for representative D1R KO and WT mice on restricted feeding. Because none of the actograms are shown, it is difficult to assess the quality of the activity records.

These actograms could go into the supplement if absolutely necessary, but it would be preferable to include representative examples in the main figures</italic>.</p><p>The x-axes are aligned to start with the beginning of video recording, which has a substantial impact on activity as the mice become very active for the 1-2 hr after we put them into the video recording room and a new cage. Thus, it would be confusing to replot the data as suggested because there would be a spike in activity at ZT 8, when the video recording was initiated, that is often as high or higher than the FAA peak.</p><p>Data from individual mice have been added as supplements to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2 and 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>5) The Per2 expression data presented in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11"><italic>Figure 11</italic></xref> <italic>are not interpretable without a similar time course of (control) data from animals fed ad lib</italic>.</p><p>See explanation above in response to major concern #3.</p><p><italic>6) There is no information in the figure legend for</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1F</italic></xref>.</p><p>We have added the text “(F) The fraction high activity in the 3 hr before feeding time (ZT 5-7) for mice on <italic>ad libitum</italic> diets.”</p><p>Finally, we also added one additional experiment to strengthen the dopamine receptor agonist data, adding a supplemental figure to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12–figure supplement 1</xref>). This figure replicates the data presented in the main text with an additional control measure: mice were not fed for 4 hr post-injection with drug to rule out the confounding factor that D1R agonist may increase feeding behaviors and thereby schedule feeding and entrain behavior due to the scheduled feeding. We also performed c-Fos staining to confirm that the drug was inducing activation of neurons in wild-type but not in D1R KO mice.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>[</italic>…<italic>] This revision has improved an already interesting manuscript. That said, there are still a few major concerns that have not been properly addressed</italic>.</p><p><italic>1) Individual animal data. Authors only included individual records for day 21 of RF (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2"><italic>Figure 2–figure supplement 2</italic></xref><italic>); there are no data from prior to RF. In the main figure, they present summary data for days -7, 0, 7,14, 21, &amp; 28. It would be nice to see at least the -7 (prior to RF) data for comparison, preferably from the same animals already shown in F2S2 (so we can actually see how an individual animal responds following RF)</italic>.</p><p>We have added an additional supplemental figure to show 6 individual mice on day 0, the first day of scheduled feeding, and 6 individual mice day 21. We chose day 0 because day -7 is what we consider the “habituation” day as it is the first time the mice have been transported to the video recording room and placed in front of the cameras. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, randomly selected wild-type mice are shown and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2–figure supplement 3</xref>, 6 randomly selected D1R KO mice are shown. While it is difficult to quantitatively define FAA (in the past we have used the ratio of night time activity peak to FAA peak greater than 0.5), it appears that 2 out of 6 D1R KO mice show some FAA whereas all WT mice show strong FAA on day 21. We do not intend to argue that D1R KO mice have no FAA just that it is attenuated and sometimes absent.</p><p><italic>2) Stats on FAA. The authors explain clearly the differences in analysis methods in the rebuttal, but they still either need to put in a statistical treatment of the data (showing WT animals had FAA and whether or not it was significant in D1RKO animals) or scale back claims. Either is acceptable</italic>.</p><p>Our analysis up to this point had concerned whether the amount of normalized FAA at individual time points was less in D1R KO mice compared to WT controls. But the reviewer brings up an interesting point, which is to ask the question of “do WT and D1R KO mice develop FAA over time?” Such a within group comparison had not been performed. To that end we performed a non-parametric ANOVA, Kruskal-Wallis test with post-test for the mice that were part of the computer vision study at Caltech comparing FAA on days 0, 7, 14, 21, and 28 for WT or D1R KO mice. We found that for WT mice p &lt; 0.0001 and the post-test showed that the difference between day 0 and 7 was not significant (p&gt;0.05) but the difference between day 0 and 14 was significant (p&lt;0.01), as was the differences between day 0 and day 21 (p&lt;0.001) and day 0 and day 28 (p&lt;0.001). For D1R KO mice P = 0.3145, indicating that there was not a significant difference in FAA over the time points measured.</p><p>For the running wheel/motion sensor study conducted at SFU, we performed statistical testing looking at each mouse. We added the following text:</p><p>“In only one KO mice were the FAA counts and the FAA ratios significantly increased during the last 10 days of restricted feeding compared to the last 10 days of ad-lib food access (counts: paired t(9)=6.52, p&lt;.001; ratios t(9)=5.22, p=.005), whereas the counts and ratios were significantly increased in all of the WT mice at p&lt;.00001.”</p><p><italic>3) The confusion about ZT7-9. The wave form and starting times for the recordings are the result of the authors' unusual way of assessing behavior for only one day at a time by moving the animal into the video apparatus. The confusion is occurring because ZT5-7 is a 2h period ending at ZT7. If data are scored up until ZT8, this should be written as “ZT5-8.” ZT (zeitgeber time) is a form of time, and thus a continuous variable (not an integer). ZT5-7 is, by definition, 2h-ZT5:00-ZT7:00. Writing ZT5-7 when you intend to include all of hour 7 is the equivalent of saying an event occurs from 5:00am-7:00am when you mean it occurs from 5:00am to 8:00am. All of the figures and text should be updated to denote a 3h period. This notation of times must be corrected in the manuscript before acceptance of the paper</italic>.</p><p>We have corrected the figures and associated text to more clearly indicate the 3-hour time bin that we have chosen for FAA.</p><p><italic>The authors need to make explicit all the various differences in the experiments (sites, labs, equipment), and then they can use this as a 'strength' as they argue in their rebuttal.
