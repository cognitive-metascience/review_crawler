However, most genome analysis is typically confined to the nuclear genome. We conducted a metabolomic QTL analysis on a reciprocal RIL population structured to examine how variation in the organelle genomes affects phenotypic variation. This showed that the cytoplasmic variation had effects similar to, if not larger than, the largest individual nuclear locus. Inclusion of cytoplasmic variation into the genetic model greatly increased the explained phenotypic variation. Cytoplasmic genetic variation was a central hub in the epistatic network controlling the plant metabolome. This epistatic influence manifested such that the cytoplasmic background could alter or hide pairwise epistasis between nuclear loci. Thus, cytoplasmic genetic variation plays a central role in controlling natural variation in metabolomic networks. This suggests that cytoplasmic genomes must be included in any future analysis of natural variation.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00776.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00776.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00776.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The vast majority of genes in plant and animal cells are located on chromosomes within the nucleus.

A key facet to this effort is to develop models that would allow directly inferring a species phenotypic variation from its genetic variation. This goal of mathematically linking genetic to phenotypic variation is central to all studies of quantitative genetics ranging from human genetics to plant breeding to ecology and has led to massive genome resequencing projects focused on developing the genomic databases to allow these studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Altshuler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2011</xref>). However, in most quantitative genomics studies, genome analysis is largely confined to the nuclear genome with much less attention paid to the organellar genome. This is in contrast to the central role that the organellar genome plays in controlling organismal metabolism and function and the developing body of literature suggesting that organellar genomic variation can modulate the effects of nuclear genomic variation.</p><p>Genomic variation in human organelles has been linked to several severe diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wallace et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Taylor and Turnbull, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schon et al., 2012</xref>). However, these organellar variants are typically rare with large phenotypic consequences such that they can be followed using simple maternal inheritance studies without consideration for quantitative variation in the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schon et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, quantitative studies on human diseases suggest that genetic variation in organellar genomes modify the quantitative effect of nuclear loci and disease phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Battersby and Shoubridge, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McRae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schon and Przedborski, 2011</xref>). Additionally, the use of structured populations in mice, yeast, and birds have shown that cytoplasmic genome variation can influence high order phenotypes including fitness, cognition, and biomass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Roubertoux et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zeyl et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Park et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dimitrov et al., 2009</xref>). Within ecological studies, mitochondrial variation has also been shown to alter fitness and create hybrid isolation in a variety of invertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Willett and Burton, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wade and Goodnight, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dowling et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wolf, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Willett, 2012</xref>). However, these studies didn’t directly interrogate the interaction of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes for quantitative traits or test the breadth of phenotypes affected.</p><p>In plants, genetic variation in mitochondria is also linked with large qualitative phenotypes, such as cytoplasmic male sterility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hanson, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schnable and Wise, 1998</xref>). Plant breeding has a long history of using diallele crosses to test for the presence of maternal effects (cytoplasmic genetic variation) on a phenotype and this was recently extended to a small reciprocal F2 family structure to show that the cytoplasmic effects could have significant impacts on plant height in maize (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tang et al., 2013</xref>). In rice, agronomic traits have also been shown to be influenced by interactions between cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes but the specific loci were not identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tao et al., 2004</xref>). However, these reciprocal F2 populations typically have generated the impression that cytoplasmic effects on phenotypic variation are quite small in plants possibly because of an inability to account for interactions between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crane and Nyquist, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eenink and Garretsen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Primomo et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast to the previous estimates of small effects, genomic sequencing within Arabidopsis has shown the presence of considerable genetic polymorphism in both the plastidic and mitochondrial genomes suggesting the potential for broad phenotypic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Moison et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The above studies have shown that cytoplasmic genome variation can influence phenotypic variation. Additionally, genes underlying qualitative interactions between the nucleus and cytoplasm leading to cytoplasmic male sterility and interspecific isolation have been identified. There are, however, numerous open questions remaining about how cytoplasmic variation influences quantitative phenotypic variation. What is the level of phenotypic variation influenced by genetic variation in the cytoplasm in comparison to individual nuclear loci? How much epistatic interaction is there between genetic variation in nuclear loci and the cytoplasmic genomes? What is the breadth of phenotypes that might be influenced by cytoplasmic variation?</p><p>To begin answering these questions, we utilized metabolomics to investigate how genetic variation in the cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes interacts to control metabolome variation in the reciprocal Arabidopsis Kas × Tsu recombinant inbred line (RIL) population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Juenger et al., 2010</xref>). We focused on metabolomics because it is cost effective for large sample numbers and because plant organelles, mitochondria and plastids, are central to the function of plant primary metabolism, as well as many specialized metabolites in both energy generation and biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fiehn et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Roessner et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fiehn, 2002</xref>). Within Arabidopsis, there are nearly 13,000 genes in the nuclear genome predicted to be involved in metabolic processes of which ∼3000 may be targeted to the mitochondria and the plastid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arabidopsis genome initiative, 2000</xref>). This included complete biosynthetic pathways for numerous amino acids and key energy production processes like respiration and photosynthesis. Aiding these processes are 88 total predicted genes in the plastidic genome and 121 in the mitochondrial genome; most of which function to facilitate the metabolic processes that occur in organelles using both nuclear and cytoplasmic-encoded proteins. Thus, variation in the organellar genomes could directly influence the function of any of nuclear gene functioning within the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etterson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wolf, 2009</xref>). This suggests that metabolism is an ideal phenotype to use for testing how cytoplasmic variation can influence phenotypic variation.</p><p>We measured the metabolome within the Kas × Tsu RIL population to test how cytoplasmic variation can affect quantitative variation within the metabolome. This population was generated from a reciprocal cross and approximately half of the resulting lines carry Kas organelles while the other half carry Tsu organelles allowing for explicit analysis of the influence of cytoplasmic genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKay et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Juenger et al., 2010</xref>). Analysis of the Kas × Tsu RIL population metabolome showed that genetic variation in the organelles influenced the accumulation of over 80% of the detectable metabolites. In contrast to previous observations suggesting that the cytoplasm has only small effects, phenotypic changes associated with cytoplasmic variation were as large and often larger than that found for individual nuclear loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crane and Nyquist, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eenink and Garretsen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Primomo et al., 2002</xref>). In addition, the cytoplasm was found to be a central hub in the epistatic network controlling natural variation in plant metabolism. This centrality led to the cytoplasmic background displaying the unexpected ability to hide or alter epistatic interactions between nuclear loci. Thus, genetic variation in the cytoplasmic organelles has widespread and large quantitative effects on natural phenotypic variation and can influence the link between nuclear loci.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative metabolome genetics across populations</title><p>To partition phenotypic variance between the effects of the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes upon the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> metabolome, we identified and measured metabolite levels, using non-targeted GC-TOF-MS, in leaf tissues of 316 lines of the Kas × Tsu <italic>A. thaliana</italic> RIL population harvested with fourfold replication across two separate experiments. Within the 316 lines for this population, 136 have the Kas cytoplasm and 180 have the Tsu cytoplasm. A total of 2435 metabolites were identified in over 25% of the RILs with 215 of these being known compounds and 2220 being unidentified compounds. Of these 2435 metabolites, 559 were identified in both experiments (161 known and 398 unknown) while the rest were specific to one of the two experiments.</p><p>Classical breeding studies utilize reciprocal crosses with linear modeling to partition heritability between the nuclear and cytoplasmic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Singh, 1965</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crane and Nyquist, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eenink and Garretsen, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Miura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Primomo et al., 2002</xref>). In line with the standard heritability calculations for classical breeding experiments with reciprocal crosses, we used a linear modeling approach to approximate the level of heritability in this population that can be statistically ascribed to the nuclear and cytoplasmic genome. The line heritability model simply partitions the RILs into two subpopulations based on the maternal parent and tests the level of reproducibility that is controlled by differences between the lines and between the subpopulations. Using the line heritability model, we focused on the 559 metabolites found in both experiments to estimate the broad sense heritability of the metabolome. This analysis showed that 361 metabolites had a significant (p&lt;0.01) line effect, of which 334 metabolites showed significant heritability based on the maternal parent subpopulation. This maternal effect was quite small with an average of 1.6 ± 0.1% (range 15–0%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In comparison, 77 metabolites had significant nuclear broad sense heritability with an average of 21.3 ± 0.3% (range 58–2%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). This is a similar level of variation to that found in a previous analysis of metabolomic variation in Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). The combined variance of the genetic components, both nuclear and cytoplasmic, explained approximately 19 times as much of the variance as the combination of experiment and block (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2010</xref>). This raises an apparent disparity between the nuclear genome having high heritability that is significant for a low fraction of metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). In contrast, the cytoplasmic effects have relatively low average heritability but significantly impact most metabolites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>). The most likely explanation for this disparity is the large difference in the degrees of freedom for the two factors, nuclear vs cytoplasmic used for the significance test. When conducting the ANOVA test, there are only two maternal subpopulations, Kas or Tsu, whereas there are 316 different nuclear genomes/RILs, and as such, the F value for the same level of variance will be very different in the two tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rowe and Kliebenstein, 2008</xref>). Thus, variation in most metabolites identifies a significant effect of cytoplasmic genetic variation, even though this effect appears to be smaller than that for the nuclear genome in the standard line heritability estimation approach.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00776.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Line estimation of heritability in nuclear and organellar genomes.</title><p>We compared the estimated metabolite heritability’s due to nuclear (solid line) and organelle (dashed line) variation across the lines of the Kas × Tsu (black) RIL populations.

We used this additive model to directly test all QTL hotspot-metabolite linkages and obtain the mean effect of variation at each hotspot on the metabolome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1 fig3s2 fig3s3 fig3s4 fig3s5 fig3s6 fig3s7 fig3s8 fig3s9 fig3s10 fig3s11 fig3s12">Figure 3—Figure supplements 1–12</xref>).

This analysis showed that there were polymorphisms spread out across a large number of genes including regulatory genes, such as <italic>rpoC2</italic> in the plastid, several unknown genes, and key energy genes, such as Rubisco large subunit. The most striking changes were the large number of polymorphisms within the NADH deyhdrogenases in both the mitochondria and the plastid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Specifically in the mitochondria, 32 of the 96 polymorphisms were within the NADH dehydrogenase 7 and a further 13 polymorphisms in four other NADH dehydrogenase complex genes. This is vastly more polymorphisms than would be expected by random chance suggesting a change in NADH and related metabolism between the Kas and Tsu organelles (hyper-geometric test, p&lt;0.001). This agrees with the widespread metabolic consequences of the cytoplasmic genetic variation on processes that require NADH like glutamine synthesis, lipid metabolism, and any other process that utilizes NADH requiring cytochromes P450. However, within this population the mitochondrial and plastidic genomes are perfectly co-inherited making it impossible to resolve the individual effects of the mitochondrial and plastidic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Joseph et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, it isn’t possible to ascribe metabolites to specific subcellular compartments using a whole tissue extract as most metabolites, even those synthesized in specific compartments, often accumulate in most compartments within a plant cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Krueger et al., 2011</xref>).

The M.I.83 nuclear locus had the highest level of interactions involving 7 of the other 13 nuclear loci but did not interact directly with the cytoplasmic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Thus, there is strong pairwise epistasis between the cytoplasmic and nuclear genetic loci. Further, the percent of genetic variation controlled by interactions of two nuclear loci was of similar scale to that involving a cytonuclear interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2 fig4s3 fig4s4 fig4s5 fig4s6 fig4s7 fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplements 1–8</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Cytoplasmic genetic variation has larger phenotypic effects on metabolite epistasis than the nuclear partner</title><p>The large number of significant epistatic interactions between nuclear and cytoplasmic genetic variation forms a cohesive network but the network approach does not let us visualize or directly quantify the effects of each locus in an epistatic pair.

We utilized the center of mass concept from physics to generate a description of epistatic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gartenhaus and Schwartz, 1957</xref>). In center of mass calculations across two dimensions, each individual objects mass is described in its x,y coordinates. For describing epistasis, we converted the x,y-cartography such that the alleles for one QTL with Tsu being -1 and Kas being 1 are along the x-axis. Similarly, along the y-axis are the alleles at the second QTL thus creating a calculable genotypic cartography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This effectively replaces the physical distance metric in the center of mass calculation with a genetic distance metric such that they represent a scaled allelic effect. We then replace the individual objects mass the in center of mass calculations with the unscaled average phenotypic value for each of the homozygous genotypic combinations of the two QTLs allowing a genetic centroid of the phenotype to be estimated for each metabolite and plotted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

To quantify how much the inclusion of the cytoplasm improved the genetic models in describing metabolomic variation, we analyzed our additive and pairwise epistasis model models with and without the cytoplasmic terms. For each metabolite for each model, we estimated the percent of variance explained by the significant terms in the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). This showed that including the cytoplasmic genome in the additive model nearly doubled the average variance compared to additive model containing only the nuclear loci. Adding the pairwise epistatic terms to the additive model without the cytoplasmic genome nearly tripled the fraction of metabolite variance explained by the genetic model without over-fitting the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Including the cytoplasmic genome into the pairwise model shifted the average model genetic variance from 38% to 53% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Thus, the inclusion of the cytoplasmic term into the pairwise model explained as much (15%), if not more, variance than could be explained from the simple additive model built with only nuclear loci (13%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).

Thus, we used the reciprocal Kas × Tsu Arabidopsis RIL population to directly quantify the role of cytoplasmic genetic variation in quantitative variation of metabolomics traits. Our analysis showed that the cytoplasmic genome variation affected the phenotypic variation for over 80% of metabolites. The affected metabolites included key parts of central metabolism and some of the most specialized metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig5 fig6">Figures 1, 5 and 6</xref>). Interestingly, the combined variance of the nuclear genome was larger than the variance due to cytoplasmic genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In contrast, cytoplasmic genetic variation affected more metabolites than any of the individual nuclear loci typically with larger effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1 fig4s2 fig4s3 fig4s4 fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplements 1–5</xref>). This is true even though the average nuclear locus spanned approximately the same number of genes as the organellar genomes combined.</p><p>We also identified a high level of significant epistatic interaction between cytoplasmic genetic variation and nuclear genetic variation, as cytonuclear epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Etterson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wolf, 2009</xref>). This cytonuclear epistasis explained as much, if not more, metabolic variation than the combined additive effects of the nuclear loci. In addition, the cytoplasmic genome controlled larger phenotypic changes than the nuclear locus within a cytonuclear interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This interaction between the cytoplasmic and nuclear loci was further extended to three-way interactions and showed that the cytoplasmic background could hide or alter the interaction between two nuclear loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, the cytoplasmic genetic background plays a key role in determining how natural variation within nuclear loci will function.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>What is the mechanistic basis of cytoplasmic genetic variation?</title><p>The effect of the cytoplasmic genetic variation was spread out across nearly all of primary metabolism making it impossible to ascribe a causal link with solely plastidic or mitochondrial genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Similarly analysis of genomic variation in the two organelles found a large number of SNPs that could be affecting numerous genes within the organelles with an observed bias towards genes involved in the NADH dehydrogenase complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Thus, organellar genomes could be playing a role in the cytoplasmic genetic influence on metabolite variation, but given their coinheritance, it is not possible to resolve the direct causal polymorphisms. Separating the two genomes to resolve their relative roles would require identifying rare individuals where the two organelles show bi-parental inheritance instead of the uni-parental/maternal mode of inheritance typical for Arabidopsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azhagiri and Maliga, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The plant cytoplasmic genomes contain only about 1% of the number of genes as found within the nuclear genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arabidopsis genome initiative, 2000</xref>). Yet genetic variation in this small fraction of genes has a large consequence upon the plants metabolic variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). This could be from genetic polymorphisms in organellar genes that are central to plant metabolism, such as those central to photosynthesis or NADH synthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Figure 5—source data 1</xref>). Alternatively, the polymorphisms could be within the organellar genes that are required to facilitate the function of the several thousand nuclear genes whose protein products are transported into the organelles and function there (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajjawi et al., 2010</xref>). Finally, it is possible that the polymorphisms in the organelle impact retrograde signaling pathways, thus altering the function of the nuclear regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Vinti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Larkin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Estavillo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xiao et al., 2012</xref>). Identifying the specific causal polymorphisms within the cytoplasmic genomes will require direct whole genome sequencing of the organellar genomes from all available genotypes to query the extent of natural variation in the organellar genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2011</xref>). An alternative may be to identify the causal genes underlying the nuclear loci involved in three-way interactions with the cytoplasm to triangulate the identity of the cytoplasmic gene.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3" sec-type="conclusion"><title>Conclusion</title><p>In this work, we report a first genomic survey of how genetic variation within cytoplasmic genomes influences metabolomic variation. Cytoplasmic genetic variation alters metabolite variation with effects that are equivalent to, if not greater than, individual nuclear loci. More importantly, the cytoplasmic background significantly influences the ability to detect epistasis between nuclear loci. Thus cytoplasmic genomes should be included in any future analysis of natural variation, either by being included as a genotype in GWA studies or by designing future populations as reciprocal populations to allow for direct analysis of the cytoplasmic genomic variation in controlling the phenotype. This inclusion will allow direct assessment of how cytoplasmic genomic variation influences other phenotypic classes, such as transcriptomics or broader physiological phenotypes. Natural genetic variation in the organellar genomes while frequently ignored will have to be kept at the front of future experimental approaches designed to understand the evolution and genetic architecture of organismal phenotypes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Growth of the Kas × Tsu RIL population</title><p>Seeds of the 341 lines of the Kas × Tsu recombinant inbred population were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, Columbus OH, USA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Juenger et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKay et al., 2008</xref>). We grew a total of four to five plants per line, split into two randomized complete blocks per experiment with two independent experiments separated by approximately 3 months. This provides four independent replicates per genotype. We grew plants in large planting trays with 156 individual wells (b × w × h: 30 × 25 × 100 mm), filled with standard potting soil (Sunshine Mix #1, Sun Gro Horticulture, Bellevue WA). Prior to sowing, we imbibed seeds in distilled water and cold stratified them at 4°C for 4 days. We placed approximately 3–5 seeds of a single genotype in the center of a well and covered the trays with a transparent plastic hood to retain humidity during germination. Plants from both reciprocal subpopulations where intermixed in the block design to allow direct statistical testing of cytoplasmic effects. After 1 week, we removed the transparent hoods and surplus plants to leave one seedling per well. We watered plants twice a week with nutrient-enriched water (0.5% N-P-K fertilizer in a 2-1-2 ratio, Grow More 4-18-38, Grow More Inc., Gardena CA) and kept them in a climate-controlled chamber at 22°C and a day/night cycle of 10 hr/14 hr.

The cytoplasmic genome was included as an additional single-locus marker to test for interactions between the cytoplasmic and nuclear genomes. p values, Type III sums-of-squares for the complete model and each individual term and QTL pairwise-effect estimates in terms of allelic substitution values were obtained as described for additive model ANOVA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fox and Weisberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">R Development Core Team, 2012</xref>). Significance values were corrected for multiple testing within a model using FDR (&lt;0.05). The main effect and epistatic interactions of the loci were visualized using cytoscape.v2.8.3 with interactions significant for less than 10% of the phenotypes were excluded from the network analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowe et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Smoot et al., 2011</xref>). The 10% threshold was chosen as an additional multiple testing correction to provide a more conservative image of the network. There are no pairwise locus segregation distortions within this population showing that the genotypes in this analysis are balanced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McKay et al., 2008</xref>). The same style of model was run to test for specific three-way interactions by including specific three-way terms as indicated (three-way epistasis model).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Plotting the epistatic center of phenotype</title><p>To plot the epistatic effect of QTLs upon a set of metabolites, we utilized the center of mass calculations. To do this we transitioned the physical distance metric in center of mass to a genetic distance metric for mapping the center of phenotype. In this, we classify one locus of each interaction as being on the x-axis and the other locus being positioned on the y-axis. On each axis, the allelic value of each specific genetic locus is plotted in relation to the heterozygote. For instance, in a two QTL situation the x-axis would be the alleles of QTL1 with the Kas having an allelic value of 1 and the Tsu having an allelic value of −1 while the other axis would be the same for QTL2 there by positioning each of the four homozygous genotypic class in one of the four quadrants. For each metabolite, the center of phenotype was calculated using center of mass calculations as <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">geno</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">geno</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true"><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo></mml:mstyle><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:msub><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>p</italic> is the average un-scaled phenotypic value for each of the four homozygous genotypic class and <italic>x</italic> is the x-coordinate of the corresponding genotypic class and <italic>y</italic> is the y-coordinate of corresponding genotypic class.

Your article has been favorably peer reviewed by Deputy editor Detlef Weigel and another reviewer.</p><p>The two reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and they have assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The main point of this paper, that cytoplasmic factors are likely to play an important role in phenotypic variation and should not be ignored, is important, and well substantiated in this paper. To support their claim with many phenotypes, the authors measured hundreds of metabolites in two <italic>A. thaliana</italic> recombinant inbred line populations, both from the same two accessions, but with one set having inherited the cytoplasm from one accession, and the other from the other accession. The authors convincingly show that inherited differences in the cytoplasm – almost certainly mutations in the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes – have measurable and non-negligible effects on metabolites, and that there is substantial epistatic interaction between organellar and nuclear genomes.</p><p>That said, several claims seem overstated. Starting with the title, “control” is clearly too strong. First, the authors should spell out what fraction of the genetic variation is attributable to cytoplasmic variants, what fraction is due to C×G interactions, and how does this compare to straight G effects? Second, how representative the findings of the paper are of other phenotypes remains unknown, and the authors should be more circumspect when extending their claims to phenotypes that might have no or only a very indirect connection to metabolites. Furthermore, both reviewers found the paper hard to follow – the presentation needs to be greatly simplified, so that the important points come across better.</p><p>Specific criticisms:</p><p>1) The authors’ explanation for the average heritability due to the organellar genome being much lower than the one coming from the nuclear genomes seems reasonable. However, both reviewers had a hard time trying to understand why there are apparently no metabolites that show cytoplasmic heritability greater than 0.15. Two different models were used to estimate nuclear and cytoplasmic heritability, but why? Along these lines, how do cytoplasmic and nuclear heritability compare for the metabolites significant for both? And on a related note, please explain why significant effects of the nuclear genome were estimated by partitioning the variance across 316 RIL genomes. These are not independent: surely you want the estimates produced by linkage mapping? Finally, that the complete cytoplasmic genome has a larger effect than individual nuclear loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) does not seem surprising, given that the mtDNA and cpDNA represent contain dozens of genes.</p><p>2) A substantial criticism is that the authors do not tell us anything about sequence differences in the organellar genomes of the RIL parents. The short read data are available, so it would not be too much of a burden to determine how many coding variants there are, and how the distribution of coding variants compares between biosynthetic genes in the organellar and nuclear genomes. We note that the Discussion states that differences have been found in the organellar genomes.</p><p>3) You discuss whether RILs have less phenotypic variation because they have less genetic variation. You write “A common concern of RIL populations is that they only sample two alleles per locus and thus might be limited in their genetic variation relative to species-wide diversity (Kim et al., 2007; Nordborg and Weigel, 2008).” This may or may not be common concern, but it is not the chief one, in our opinion, and it is also not the point made in the papers cited. As far as one can tell, Kim et al. (2007) does not discuss this issue at all, and Nordborg and Weigel (2008) make a completely different point, namely that RILs have greater power to detect rare alleles of large effect that “may not be important from an evolutionary perspective”. This is central to your paper because of the very real possibility that the observed QTL hotspots (which mostly differ from another RIL population) are due to rare alleles of large effect, which may well be deleterious. This does not invalidate the results, but changes their interpretation, in particular with respect to their evolutionary significance.</p><p>4) There is little consideration of existing knowledge of the contribution of organellar biosynthesis steps to metabolic pathways. An important question is whether metabolites that are known to be made in organelles are more likely to be affected by variation in the organellar genomes than those that are not.</p><p>Finally, the authors make the important point that the organellar genotypes would add greatly to GWA studies. We agree. Since the authors have metabolome data for 96 accessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chan et al., 2010</xref>), one wonders how much effort it would be to download existing read data, identify polymorphisms in the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, and include them in the GWA analysis. (A major unknown is what the distribution of shared polymorphisms in the organellar genomes is, since GWA studies rely on linkage having been broken up by recombination.) Such an analysis would greatly elevate the study and the authors are strongly encouraged to consider this very seriously.</p><p>Overall, the clarity of the manuscript should be improved considerably. The text is replete with jargon and technical terms that are not properly introduced. That the models used are not always clearly stated also contributes to the paper being hard to read. The main model(s) need to be in the main text, so it is clear where the results come from.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00776.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Starting with the title, “control” is clearly too strong</italic>.</p><p>We have changed the title to reflect influence rather than control.

This model uses the standard approach to estimate heritability in a RIL population where you use the proportion of line variation of the total variation to estimate genetic reproducibility. In a non-reciprocal RIL population the line variation accounts for the variance across all the lines in the population. We did this classical approach to provide a common entry point to the community into this analysis as well as a common linkage to most previous RIL analysis. We have also introduced a description saying that the second model is asking a different question than the per line heritability question asked by the model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>.</p><p>We are unsure as to why no metabolites had a cytoplasmic heritability above 0.15 using this analysis but this is what the data showed and by doing the classical approach we can now show that this number is misleading based upon the ensuing linkage mapping. To also help with the analysis, we have provided locus and interaction specific estimates of heritability (per locus/interaction R2) that is now discussed in the section on epistatic interactions. This analysis is shown in Figure 6–figure supplement 1. This analysis shows that if we parse the nuclear genetic variation into individual nuclear hotspot variation, the cytoplasmic heritability is actually greater on average than any specific nuclear hotspot.</p><p>Finally, we have also mentioned in the Discussion that the organellar genomes have roughly the same number of genes as an individual nuclear locus because given the genetic resolution of recombination these loci still represent a region of &gt;100 genes.</p><p><italic>2) A substantial criticism is that the authors do not tell us anything about sequence differences in the organellar genomes of the RIL parents. The short read data are available, so it would not be too much of a burden to determine how many coding variants there are, and how the distribution of coding variants compares between biosynthetic genes in the organellar and nuclear genomes. We note that the Discussion states that differences have been found in the organellar genomes</italic>.</p><p>We have obtained suitable short reads and provided a list of polymorphisms between the Kas and Tsu mitochondria and organelle as Figure 7–source data 1. This has been added into the section on cytoplasmic effects along with a commentary on how the changes are focused on NADH related metabolic genes, which would explain the widespread consequences in the metabolic grid of the organellar genetic variation because NADH is central to nitrate assimilation, the GOGAT cycle, lipid metabolism, and any process involving a cytochrome P450.</p><p><italic>3) You discuss whether RILs have less phenotypic variation because they have less genetic variation. You write “A common concern of RIL populations is that they only sample two alleles per locus and thus might be limited in their genetic variation relative to species-wide diversity (Kim et al., 2007; Nordborg and Weigel, 2008).” This may or may not be common concern, but it is not the chief one, in our opinion, and it is also not the point made in the papers cited.

This does not invalidate the results, but changes their interpretation, in particular with respect to their evolutionary significance</italic>.</p><p>We have worked to better clarify this section to reflect both the power and rarity concern. The specific paragraph in question now attempts to show that while the RIL population may be susceptible to the rare allele issues, we have similar if not greater phenotypic variation than the accessions, meaning that we actually have better power to detect loci and interactions.</p><p><italic>4) There is little consideration of existing knowledge of the contribution of organellar biosynthesis steps to metabolic pathways. An important question is whether metabolites that are known to be made in organelles are more likely to be affected by variation in the organellar genomes than those that are not</italic>.</p><p>We have added in a commentary in the first results section on the organellar variation of how most metabolites, even those specifically synthesized in a single compartment, are then transported throughout the plant cell even from one organelle to the other. Additionally, a number of metabolites are made in multiple compartments including the organelles and the cytosol, as such ascribing individual compartmental function is not as straightforward as is required for a hypergeometric test or the like. Additionally, our extraction protocol cannot differentiate between the different pools within a cell. Given that nearly all primary metabolites are influenced by the organellar genomic variation this analysis doesn’t have the power to refine the mechanistic basis of this change.</p><p><italic>Finally, the authors make the important point that the organellar genotypes would add greatly to GWA studies. We agree. Since the authors have metabolome data for 96 accessions (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13"><italic>Chan et al., 2010</italic></xref><italic>), one wonders how much effort it would be to download existing read data, identify polymorphisms in the mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes, and include them in the GWA analysis. (A major unknown is what the distribution of shared polymorphisms in the organellar genomes is, since GWA studies rely on linkage having been broken up by recombination.) Such an analysis would greatly elevate the study and the authors are strongly encouraged to consider this very seriously</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this would be nice, but for several reasons we feel that this is more appropriate for a follow-up study. The first is technical in that the available short read data were largely made with protocols to enrich the nuclear genomic DNA at the cost of the organellar sequences and as such, we had to identify specific Kas and Tsu samples prepped with a different protocol. The other available short read archive sequences did not provide us sufficient coverage on the organellar genomes to call polymorphisms. The second reason is genetic in that all published literature on the Arabidopsis organellar genetic variation using targeted gene analysis shows that the organelles do not show any evidence of independent assortment and instead they behave in a more clonal fashion which greatly complicates any potential for GWA as the entire organelles are essentially within complete LD. The final reason is for clarity, as the reviewers have rightly noted, we need to improve the manuscript’s clarity and adding a completely additional section on accessions and the organelles would require the equivalent of a full manuscript’s worth of analysis to assess the link between the organelle and population structure, LD, and then finally GWA with metabolites. Thus, we feel that this request is an excellent foundation for another complete manuscript, but it would not help to clarify this manuscript mechanistically, genetically, or editorially.</p><p><italic>Overall, the clarity of the manuscript should be improved considerably. The text is replete with jargon and technical terms that are not properly introduced. That the models used are not always clearly stated also contributes to the paper being hard to read. The main model(s) need to be in the main text, so it is clear where the results come from</italic>.</p><p>We have worked throughout to better clarify the text and more explicitly link to the proper model.</p><p>[Editors’ note: after re-review, the authors edited the article further to clarify the primary message and removed sections of the article relating to comparative analysis to other populations.]</p></body></sub-article></article>
