One such nucleoporin, Nup98, binds chromatin and regulates gene expression. To gain insight into how Nup98 contributes to this process, we focused on identifying novel binding partners and understanding the significance of these interactions. Here we report on the identification of the DExH/D-box helicase DHX9 as an intranuclear Nup98 binding partner. Various results, including in vitro assays, show that the FG/GLFG region of Nup98 binds to N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 in an RNA facilitated manner. Importantly, binding of Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9, and a transcriptional reporter assay suggests Nup98 supports DHX9-stimulated transcription. Consistent with these observations, our analysis revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 bind interdependently to similar gene loci and their transcripts. Based on our results, we propose that Nup98 functions as a co-factor that regulates DHX9 and, potentially, other RNA helicases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18825.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18825.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>nuclear pore complex</kwd><kwd>Nup98</kwd><kwd>gene expression and mRNA metabolism</kwd><kwd>DExH/D-box helicase</kwd><kwd>DHX9</kwd><kwd>RNA helicase A</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000145</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Studentship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Capitanio</surname><given-names>Juliana S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC Operating Grant Program,130231</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montpetit</surname><given-names>Ben</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC Operating Grant Program,106502</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wozniak</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MRC Operating Grant Program,36519</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wozniak</surname><given-names>Richard W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mechanistic insight into the role of intranuclear Nup98 in gene expression is revealed by functional interactions with the helicase DHX9.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The nuclear envelope (NE) forms a physical barrier between the DNA-containing nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. This membrane system in conjunction with macromolecular gateways, termed nuclear pore complexes (NPCs), regulate transport across the NE. Highly conserved across all eukaryotes, NPCs are composed of ~30 proteins, termed nucleoporins or Nups, which can be placed into two general categories. One set of Nups lie at or near the membrane and form the cylindrical eight-fold symmetrical NPC scaffold. Among its functions, the core scaffold acts as a binding surface for a second set of Nups (FG-Nups) that line the NPC channel and directly facilitate the movement of nuclear transport factors and their cargoes through the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Field et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While the roles of Nups in NPC structure and nuclear transport have been well established, numerous observations indicate that Nups also function outside of NPCs in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chatel and Fahrenkrog, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hou and Corces, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ptak and Wozniak, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Raices and D'Angelo, 2012</xref>). For example, various FG-Nups have been detected in the nucleoplasm, which have been shown to move between intranuclear sites and NPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Rabut et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to contributing to nuclear transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Sakiyama et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zahn et al., 2016</xref>), these intranuclear Nups have been reported to regulate gene expression through binding transcription sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kalverda et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Ptak et al., 2014</xref>), including immune response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Faria et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Panda et al., 2014</xref>), and influencing chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalverda and Fornerod, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liang and Hetzer, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ptak and Wozniak, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Among the most studied Nups exhibiting intranuclear localization is Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Iwamoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Radu et al., 1995</xref>). Nup98 binds to the mRNA export factors Rae1 and NXF1 (TAP) and it has been shown to mediate mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bachi et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blevins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Powers et al., 1997</xref>). Nup98 also participates in nuclear import and export of proteins though its interaction with importin-β family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allen et al., 2001</xref>) and the exportin CRM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Oka et al., 2010</xref>). Several distinct domains are present in Nup98, including an N-terminal region containing FG/GLFG repeats, a putative RNA-interacting domain, a binding site for Rae1, and a C-terminal region that interacts with other Nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chatel and Fahrenkrog, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Sun and Guo, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Immunofluorescence analysis revealed that Nup98 is visible throughout the nucleoplasm, but can accumulate at intranuclear structures termed GLFG bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>). Further, the mobility of NPC-associated and nucleoplasmic Nup98 is dependent on ongoing transcription in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>). Studies in Drosophila revealed the association of Nup98 with actively transcribed genes, especially those involved in development and cell cycle regulation, with modulation of cellular Nup98 levels (over-expression or knock-down) altering transcription of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kalverda et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, in mammalian cells, Nup98 has been shown to associate with chromatin and regulate gene expression during the differentiation of embryonic stem cells into neural progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). In these cells, Nup98 preferentially associates with the promoter regions of developmentally regulated genes, and changes in the levels of Nup98 are again found to alter gene expression.</p><p>Several recent observations have provided further insight into the role of Nup98 in transcription. Light and colleagues showed that mammalian Nup98 binds to <italic>HLA-DRA</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Light et al., 2013</xref>), an interferon-ɣ induced gene exhibiting transcriptional memory (i.e. a gene that displays rapid induction given a recent history of being activated). In the absence of Nup98, transcriptional memory was lost and the binding of RNA polymerase II at promoters poised for reactivation was reduced, which matched similar findings in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Light et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">2013</xref>). In Drosophila, Pascual-Garcia and colleagues showed binding of Nup98 to the promoter regions of certain active genes and a requirement for Nup98 in their transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). Nup98 binding to these genes was dependent on TRX and MBD-R2, a component of the NSL (nonspecific lethal) complex that directs histone H4K16 acetylation. However, the loss of Nup98 did not change H4K16 acetylation or TRX-mediated H3K4 trimethylation patterns, both of which are required for active transcription and transcriptional memory. Thus, the function of Nup98 in the transcription of these loci remains unclear.</p><p>More evidence for the role of Nup98 in gene expression regulation comes from studies of hematopoietic malignancies. More than twenty-eight different chromosomal rearrangements involving the <italic>NUP98</italic> gene have been identified. The resulting fusion proteins have been shown to alter transcription through fusing the N-terminal domain of Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kasper et al., 1999</xref>) to a C-terminal domain that usually contains a chromatin/DNA interacting region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Capitanio and Wozniak, 2012</xref>). The oncogenicity of several Nup98 fusions has been demonstrated in mouse models where Nup98 fusions lead to acute myeloid leukemia recapitulating the human disease phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gough et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Moore et al., 2007</xref>). Finally, Nup98 also impacts gene expression at the post-transcriptional level. A recent publication reported that Nup98 associates with the p21 mRNA 3'UTR preventing degradation by the exosome, with several other putative target mRNAs being similarly regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Singer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite the growing evidence linking Nup98 to the regulation of chromatin structure and gene expression, little is known about the mechanism by which Nup98 affects these processes. In this study, we have focused on identifying novel Nup98 binding partners and assembling a Nup98 interaction network. Of the Nup98 interactors, one of the strongest binding partners was the DExH/D-box protein DHX9 (RNA helicase A). We demonstrate that Nup98 binds DHX9 in the nucleoplasm, regulates the nuclear distribution of DHX9, and influences DHX9 RNA-binding and ATPase activity. Their interactions ultimately influence gene expression at the level of DHX9-mediated transcription and splicing. These data provide evidence for a novel mechanism by which the nucleoporin Nup98 can regulate gene expression away from NPCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Nup98 interacting partners</title><p>Nup98 is a component of NPCs, but it has also been shown to reside in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Griffis et al., 2002</xref>).

We compared the localization of these proteins and Nup98 in HEK293T cells using immunofluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Similar to previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Uhlen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>), DHX9 and hnRNP U were broadly distributed within the nucleoplasm in a punctate pattern, but appeared excluded from nucleoli. Neither protein appeared concentrated at the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, inset). Nup98 was also detected within the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>); however, the broad intranuclear distributions of Nup98, DHX9, and hnRNP U made it difficult to judge the significance of any signal overlap. As an alternative approach to assess the physical relationship between these proteins, we examined the consequences of depleting or overproducing Nup98 on the nuclear distribution of DHX9 and hnRNP U. Depletion of Nup98 resulted in no detectable changes in the distribution pattern of hnRNP U (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, the loss of Nup98 caused the appearance of bright DHX9 foci in the nucleoplasm. Moreover, the exclusion of DHX9 from nucleoli observed in mock-treated cells was less pronounced in Nup98-depleted cells, suggesting that DHX9 has greater access to the nucleolus in the absence of Nup98. In contrast, depletion of DHX9 (or hnRNP U; data not shown) did not noticeably alter Nup98 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18825.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Localization of Nup98 with DHX9 and hnRNP U.</title><p>The cellular distribution of Nup98, DHX9, and hnRNP U in HEK293T cells was examined by indirect immunofluorescence using antibodies directed against each protein as indicated.

To further test this model, HeLa cell nuclei were fractionated to make nucleoplasmic and NE enriched fractions, which could be used to further assess the location of the Nup98-DHX9 interaction. Consistent with localization data, DHX9 was primarily present in a nucleoplasmic fraction, while Nup98 was detected in both the nucleoplasmic and NE fractions, which were further validated with antibodies against other NE and nucleoplasmic proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Magnetic beads coupled to anti-DHX9 antibodies were incubated with GST-DHX9. GST alone or GST-Nup98 was then added to bead-bound GST-DHX9. Only the GST-Nup98 protein bound to the beads, suggesting a direct interaction between DHX9 and Nup98. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar results were obtained using DHX9 and Nup98 lacking the GST tags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As it was possible that RNA present within the <italic>E. coli</italic> extracts could contribute to the in vitro DHX9-Nup98 interaction, we also conducted binding reactions after pre-treating the recombinant proteins with RNase A (to remove any residual RNA) or adding excess RNA (poly I:C). Binding reactions conducted under these conditions reveal that the interaction of untagged or GST-tagged DHX9 with Nup98 was partially reduced by the addition of RNase A, while the addition of RNA (poly I:C) did not appear to alter the binding of DHX9 to Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>A second in vitro assay previously employed to assess Nup-Nup interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Patel and Rexach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>) was also used to evaluate the interaction of Nup98 with DHX9. Termed the ‘bead halo’ assay, protein (e.g. DHX9) is bound to beads and then incubated with a potential binding partner (Nup98). Binding of Nup98 to bead-associated DHX9 is detected using anti-Nup98 antibodies and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies. Interactions between the proteins are visualized by a fluorescent signal on the surface of the beads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The level of bead-associated fluorescence signal provides a relative measure of the strength of the interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Patel and Rexach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib146">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Using this assay, we detected and quantified the binding of recombinant Nup98 to DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and again the addition of RNA did not significantly alter the relative strength of this interaction, but the inclusion of RNase A reduced the level of DHX9 binding to Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The bead halo assay was also used to identify regions of DHX9 that interact with Nup98. GST-Nup98 bound to beads was incubated with three consecutive, non overlapping domains of DHX9 tagged with GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). We observed that an N-terminal region (residues 1–380), containing two double-stranded RNA binding motifs (DRBM1 and DRBM2), and a C-terminal segment (residues 821–1270), containing an (OB)-binding fold and a single-stranded RNA-binding RGG-box, bound to Nup98. Conversely, DHX9’s central region (residues 381–820), containing its ATP-dependent helicase domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhang and Grosse, 1997</xref>), did not bind GST-Nup98 under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The interactions of the N- and C-terminal domains of DHX9-GFP with GST-Nup98 appeared to be facilitated by the presence of RNA, as these interactions were sensitive to RNase A. Furthermore, the addition of RNA (poly I:C) prior to mixing of the two proteins stimulated binding of GST-Nup98 and the N-terminal domain of DHX9-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Cumulatively, these data lead us to conclude that DHX9 can directly bind Nup98 and that their association is augmented by RNA. The DHX9-Nup98 interaction is likely mediated by the N- and C-terminal domains of DHX9.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9</title><p>Like other RNA helicases, DHX9 can bind and hydrolyze ATP, which can promote unwinding of duplex RNA and remodelling of RNA–protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Fullam and Schröder, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fuller-Pace, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Zhang and Grosse, 1994</xref>). Binding partners of RNA helicases have been shown to regulate helicase function by inhibiting or stimulating their ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourgeois et al., 2016</xref>) and we hypothesized that Nup98 could play a similar role with DHX9. To test this, the ATPase activity of recombinant GST-DHX9 was examined in the presence and absence of GST-Nup98. We observed a basal ATPase rate for recombinant DHX9 that was stimulated by the addition of RNA to levels comparable to that previously reported for DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Schütz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib140">Zhang and Grosse, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">1997</xref>). In the presence of excess RNA (poly I:C), the addition of GST-Nup98 induced a dose-dependent increase in GST-DHX9 ATPase activity reaching levels approximately five-fold higher than GST-DHX9 and RNA alone at the highest GST-Nup98 concentration tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). A similar level of stimulation was also observed using untagged versions of DHX9 and Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). DHX9 ATPase activity was also increased upon addition of the N-terminal FG/GLFG domain of Nup98.

To directly test whether these proteins bind similar mRNAs, we immunoprecipitated DHX9 and Nup98 from cell lysates following crosslinking. By using stringent conditions that disrupt the DHX9-Nup98 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>), we could assess the ability of each protein to bind RNA independent of one another and determine whether they interact with similar RNA species.

For this analysis, genes encoding Nup98 or DHX9 fused to <italic>E.coli</italic> DNA methyltransferase (Dam) were introduced in to HEK293T cells. Modified DNA was then amplified, purified, and used in qPCR reactions to assess whether specific regions of the genome were bound to Nup98 and DHX9. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, both Nup98 and DHX9 mapped to the six gene loci whose transcripts were bound to Nup98 and DHX9. For <italic>JUND</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>, two regions within these genes were examined: a 5’ region containing the promoter and a region within the 3’ half of the ORF. For both Nup98 and DHX9, robust binding was detected to the 5’ promoter regions of these genes, while binding to regions within their ORFs were lower or absent. Similarly, no detectable binding was observed to the NHLH2 and HEXIM1 genes, consistent with our observation that the transcripts from these genes were not detected in association with Nup98 and DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Of note, DamID experiments performed with a fusion (Dam-Nup98<sup>1–504</sup>) containing only the N-terminal FG/GLFG domain of Nup98 shown to be sufficient for DHX9 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>) displayed a similar chromatin-binding profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This assay has been used to evaluate the role of DHX9 in transcription, including defining the contributions of its ATPase activity to its role in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aratani et al., 2001</xref>). Similar to previous reports, expression of exogenous DHX9 in cells containing the CRE-luciferase reporter increased production of luciferase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). Point mutants in DHX9 that reduce (DHX9<sup>I347A</sup>) or eliminate (DHX9<sup>K417R</sup>) ATPase activity show reduced stimulation of reporter expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aratani et al., 2001</xref>). Since our in vitro assays showed that Nup98 could stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9, we tested whether overexpression of Nup98 could stimulate the DHX9-mediated expression of CRE-luciferase. In the absence of exogenous DHX9, expression of Nup98 had no significant effect on the expression of luciferase. However, Nup98 expression stimulated luciferase production in the presence of DHX9 or the ATPase compromised DHX9<sup>I347A</sup> mutant, while having no significant stimulatory impact on luciferase expression in the presence of the ATPase dead mutant (DHX9<sup>K417R</sup>). These results are consistent with our in vitro observations showing Nup98 can stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9, and they suggest that the stimulatory effect of Nup98 binding to DHX9 supports its role in transcription.<fig-group><fig id="fig12" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18825.025</object-id><label>Figure 12.</label><caption><title>Nup98 stimulates the transcriptional activity of DHX9.</title><p>HEK293T cells transfected with the luciferase gene under control of a cAMP-regulatory element (CRE) were co-transfected with two plasmids, one containing <italic>GFP-NUP98</italic> or <italic>GFP</italic> and another containing either <italic>DHX9<sup>WT</sup></italic>, the point mutant <italic>DHX9<sup>I347A</sup></italic>, the point mutant <italic>DHX9<sup>K417R</sup></italic> or an empty plasmid.

DHX9 depletion altered the splicing of 866 genes, of these 217 genes also show altered splicing upon Nup98 depletion (p=2.03×10<sup>−43</sup>).

A similar increase in 12S and 11S isoform was detected in cells depleted of DHX9. DHX9 depletion also caused significant decreases in 9S and 13S abundance. These results suggest that the interactions of Nup98 and DHX9 with specific mRNAs, such as E1A, regulates their splicing.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18825.027</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Nup98 or DHX9 depletion affects alternative splicing of E1A mRNA.</title><p>HEK293T cells were transfected with a control shRNA or an shRNA targeting Nup98 or DHX9.

However, our understanding of the mechanistic role of Nup98 in this process has lagged due to our limited knowledge of Nup98 binding partners, most notably in the nucleoplasm, and the consequences of these interactions on the functions of the interacting partners. In this work, we focused on a possible mechanism by which Nup98 can alter gene expression through its interaction with, and regulation of, the RNA helicase DHX9. We have shown using a combination of in vitro and in vivo assays that Nup98 directly binds DHX9 in the nucleoplasm and this interaction is facilitated by RNA. Importantly, binding of Nup98 to DHX9 can stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9 and support the role of this DExH/D-box protein in the transcription and splicing of a subset of genes. Consistent with these observations, our analysis revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 bind to similar gene loci and mRNAs, and these interactions are interdependent upon one another. In aggregate, our observations lead us to conclude that intranuclear Nup98 functions as a regulator of DHX9.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The interaction of Nup98 with DHX9</title><p>Immunopurified Nup98 revealed associated proteins with known roles in mRNA metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>), mainly hnRNP proteins and RNA helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Han et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourgeois et al., 2016</xref>) suggesting a functional link between Nup98 and mRNA metabolism. We envisage that many of these proteins are components of Nup98-interacting protein complexes, but most are unlikely to bind directly to Nup98. As others have concluded from MS data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Cox and Mann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mazloom et al., 2011</xref>), we speculated that proteins directly interacting with Nup98 were more likely to be among those species most highly represented by unique peptides in our MS analysis, which led us to focus on DHX9. This seemed reasonable as previous studies have described interactions between RNA helicases and nucleoporins, including the interactions of yeast Dbp5 with Nup159 and human DDX19 with Nup214, and the role of these interactions in modulating ATP-dependent helicase activity and mRNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Montpetit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Napetschnig et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Noble et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">von Moeller et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Weirich et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>DHX9, also termed RNA helicase A (RHA), is a member of the helicase superfamily 2. Most of the proteins known to function as RNA chaperones or RNA-protein complex remodelers in this superfamily are found within the DEAD-box (DDX) and the DEAH/RHA (DHX) families (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>). Both DHX and DDX helicases contain a highly conserved helicase domain that mediates nucleotide binding and hydrolysis and is linked to binding of nucleic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Stevens, 2010</xref>). Flanking the helicase domain, DHX family members possess variable N- and C-terminal domains that, while often containing shared sequence motifs, contribute to the diverse functions of family members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Jankowsky and Fairman, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Linder and Jankowsky, 2011</xref>). DHX9 contains two double-stranded RNA binding domains (dsRBD) within the N-terminal third of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhang and Grosse, 1997</xref>), while the C-terminal third of the protein contains an oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide (OB)-binding fold and an RGG-box, a domain that characteristically binds single-stranded nucleic acids. Several proteins have been shown to bind the N-terminus, C-terminus, or both regions of DHX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee and Pelletier, 2016</xref>).</p><p>The N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 containing the dsRBDs and the RGG-box are thought to be spatially positioned in close proximity and contribute to the nucleic acid binding properties of DHX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib141">Zhang and Grosse, 1997</xref>). As mentioned above, these regions also contribute binding surfaces for interacting proteins, and in this study we show that both N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 bind the N-terminal FG/GLFG repeat region of Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). While the nature of these interactions remains to be examined in greater detail, studies of another DHX member, yeast Prp43, and its binding partner Ntr1 offer possible insights into the nature of the interactions between DHX9 and Nup98. Like DHX9, Prp43 contains an OB-binding fold, which binds to an intrinsically unstructured, N-terminal region of Ntr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, the C-terminal region of DHX9 contains an OB-binding fold that binds the unstructured FG/GLFG repeat region of Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Intriguingly, the unstructured regions of Ntr1 contain a ‘G-patch’ motif rich in glycines and bulky, hydrophobic residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Aravind and Koonin, 1999</xref>), a compositional property shared with the FG/GLFG repeats of Nup98. When Ntr1 binds to Prp43, the conformation imparted on the ‘G-patch’ motif facilitates its binding to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christian et al., 2014</xref>). We speculate that the binding of Nup98 to DHX9 may also impart structural features on the FG/GLFG repeat regions of Nup98 that facilitates binding to RNA. This idea is consistent with our observation that the binding of certain mRNAs to Nup98 is facilitated by DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>; see below).</p><p>Reciprocally, the binding of Nup98 to N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 increases the ATPase activity of DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Other factors also function similarly to regulate DHX9. For example, Werner Syndrome helicase interacts with both N- and C-terminal regions of DHX9 to inhibit DHX9 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Friedemann et al., 2005</xref>). In another case, the catalytic subunit of DNA-dependent protein kinase (PRKDC) interacts with DHX9 and increases ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mischo et al., 2005</xref>). Mechanistically, the binding of Ntr1 to Prp43 again offers a precedent for how these binding events could regulate DHX9 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tanaka et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Nup98 and DHX9 interact in the nucleoplasm</title><p>Previous analyses of the subcellular distribution of DHX9 suggest it is largely restricted to the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>), but it is excluded from nucleoli and shows no obvious accumulation at NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee and Pelletier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib142">Zhang et al., 1995</xref>). Several observations lead us to conclude that the Nup98-DHX9 complex also resides in the nucleoplasm. First, both depletion and overexpression of Nup98 altered the intranuclear distribution of DHX9, including the recruitment of DHX9 to intranuclear Nup98 foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, nuclear fractionation revealed that Nup98-DHX9 complexes are present primarily in the nucleoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Finally, DamID analysis established that the association of Nup98 and DHX9 with the same gene loci is interdependent on one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Together these results strongly support the existence of an intranuclear Nup98-DHX9 complex. Given that DHX9 appears to be a more abundant protein than Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Montague et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schaab et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Wilhelm et al., 2014</xref>), and that other DHX9 interacting partners appear to bind similar regions of DHX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkizan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nakajima et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pellizzoni et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Robb and Rana, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sadler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tetsuka et al., 2004</xref>), we assume that Nup98 binds and regulates a subpopulation of DHX9. Overall, the binding partners (e.g. Nup98, Werner Syndrome helicase, and PRKDC) of DHX9 are likely key to determining the localization of DHX9, the specific mRNAs it binds, and its overall involvement in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkizan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nakajima et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Pellizzoni et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Robb and Rana, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Sadler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Smith et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tetsuka et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Nup98-DHX9 complex functions to regulate transcription and mRNA processing</title><p>Nup98 and DHX9 have each independently been shown to play a role in regulating gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Capelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Kalverda and Fornerod, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lee and Pelletier, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liang et al., 2013</xref>). We propose that at least some of the regulatory functions ascribed to these proteins are performed by the Nup98-DHX9 complex. Several results support this conclusion including our findings that both proteins associate with similar gene loci and their RNA products. For example, our examination of previously published data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Erkizan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">G Hendrickson et al., 2016</xref>) revealed a strong correlation between gene loci bound to Nup98 and the association of Nup98 and DHX9 with the mRNA products of these genes. Specifically, of the gene loci that interact with nucleoplasmic Nup98, 70% produce transcripts that are also bound to Nup98 (p=6.14×10<sup>−215</sup>) and ~27% produce transcripts bound to both Nup98 and DHX9 (p=3.35×10<sup>−58</sup>). Furthermore, our analysis of several putative DHX9-interacting gene loci revealed that Nup98 and DHX9 at these gene loci have related properties, including (1) Nup98 and DHX9 require one another for binding to these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), (2) the loss of either protein alters the normal expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), and (3) the binding of Nup98 and DHX9 to the transcripts of these genes is interdependent on one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>Of note, many of the genes showing altered expression following depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 contain a putative cAMP-response element (CRE) (see Results). CRE regulated genes represent ~50% of the Nup98 interacting gene loci detected in Nup98-Dam-ID studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franks et al., 2016</xref>), and of these genes ~72% have their transcripts bound by Nup98 (p=4.2×10<sup>−205</sup>) and ~36% bound by DHX9 (p=2.3×10<sup>−5</sup>). Consistent with these observations, both Nup98 and DHX9 have been reported to bind to the CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aratani et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kasper et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Nakajima et al., 1997</xref>), a transcriptional co-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Vo and Goodman, 2001</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of their physical and functional links to CRE regulated genes, we used a CRE-luciferase reporter assay to assess the role of Nup98 in DHX9-mediated transcription. Aratani and colleagues previously used this assay to characterize two modes of DHX9-stimulated reporter expression, one dependent on, and the other independent of, DHX9 ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aratani et al., 2001</xref>). Using DHX9 point mutants that either reduce or eliminate its ATPase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aratani et al., 2001</xref>), we assessed the ability of Nup98 to stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9 and modulate its transcriptional activity. Importantly, the expression of Nup98, while itself unable to stimulate reporter expression, could suppress the transcriptional defects of the DHX9 point mutant with reduced ATPase activity (DHX9<sup>I347A</sup>), but not an ATPase dead mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). These results are consistent with our in vitro analysis showing Nup98 can stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9 and supports the hypothesis that Nup98 functions as a cofactor to regulate the ATPase-dependent transcriptional functions of DHX9.</p><p>Nup98 is also predicted to stimulate the cellular activities of DHX9 that facilitate efficient processing and release of mRNAs from DHX9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Jankowsky, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Jarmoskaite and Russell, 2014</xref>). The latter idea is supported by our data showing that depletion of Nup98 causes an increase in the binding of RNA to DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). It is worth noting that the Nup98-stimulated release of DHX9 from transcripts may be required to maintain the stable association of DHX9 with a gene locus by preventing it from leaving with the mRNA transcript. This idea is consist with our data showing that in the absence of Nup98 the occupancy of DHX9 at genes regulated by these proteins is reduced while DHX9 association with the corresponding mRNAs is increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Given the RNA binding properties of the Nup98-DHX9 complex, and that transcription and mRNA splicing are often coupled, we envisage that defects associated with disruption of this complex would alter splicing. This proved to be the case as the analysis of cells depleted of Nup98 or DHX9 revealed shared splicing defects at the level of E1A reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>) and throughout the transcriptome (see Results). Our observations are the first to suggest a role for Nup98 in mRNA splicing, and are consistent with a previously proposed role for DHX9 in splicing regulation in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartmuth et al., 2002</xref>) and Drosophila (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Pellizzoni et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Reenan et al., 2000</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Nup98 and RNA helicases beyond DHX9</title><p>Finally, we must make note that the role for Nup98 in regulating DHX9 may extend to other DExH/D-box proteins, since five other RNA helicases were identified as Nup98 interactors in our study, including DDX21, DDX5, DDX17, DHX15, and DDX3. DDX5 and DDX17 are highly similar proteins that act as corepressors and coactivators through their interaction and modulation of transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Fuller-Pace, 2013</xref>).

Thus the fold changes in the ratios of bound:total amount of any given transcript account for changes in the levels of that transcript in the depleted cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>DamID assay in mammalian cell culture</title><p>DamID assays were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franks et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">van Steensel</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Vogel et al., 2007</xref>). Nup98, Nup98<sup>1–504</sup>, and GFP cloned into MSCV-DamID-Gateway plasmid and the pCL-Ampho plasmid were kindly provided by Drs. Tobias Franks and Martin Hetzer (Salk Institute for Biological Studies, CA, USA) and have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Franks et al., 2016</xref>). To produce Dam-DHX9, the DHX9 ORF in a pShuttle vector (GeneCopoeia, GC-H1793) was recombined into the MSCV-DamID-Gateway plasmid using the Gateway LR Clonase II Enzyme Mix (ThermoFisher Scientific 11791020) per the manufacturer’s protocol.</p><p>Retroviruses encoding the Dam constructs described above were generated by co-transfection of pCL-Ampho plasmid and the MSCV-DamID vector of choice (5 µg of each plasmid) into HEK293T cells, using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific L3000008) with media replacement 6 hr after transfection. Two days after transfection, medium containing retroviruses was collected from HEK293T cells. Retroviruses were then added to naive HEK293T cells in six well plates (6 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/well) and incubated for 6 hr in the presence of hexadimethrine bromide (Sigma-Aldrich). To select cell lines stably expressing the Dam constructs, two days after transduction cells were switched to medium containing 1.5 µg/ml puromycin (Thermo Fisher Scientific A1113803) for a minimum of 10 days.</p><p>Stable cell lines expressing Dam constructs were transduced with lentiviral pseudoparticles encoding shRNAs targeting Nup98, DHX9 or a control sequence as described above. Protein depletion was allowed to proceed for 6 days and depletion was verified by western blotting. DNA was harvested from 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells using the Qiagen DNAeasy blood and tissue kit as described by the manufacturer (QIAgen 69504). Purified DNA (2.5 µg) was digested in a 10 µl reaction containing 0.5 µl of DpnI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs R0176S) and CutSmart Buffer overnight. DpnI-digested DNA was ligated with a DamID adapter primer duplex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>) in a 20 µl ligation reaction with T4 DNA ligase (New England Biolabs M0202S) for 4 hr at 16°C. The ligation reaction was digested with DpnII (New England Biolabs R0543S) in a 50 µl reaction for 1 hr. Ten microliters of the DpnII digested ligation sample was amplified by PCR with Expand High Fidelity PCR System as described by the manufacturer (Sigma-Aldrich 11732641001). The resulting amplified DNA was purified with QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (QIAgen 28104) and used as template for real-time PCRs, as described above. Data from DamID qPCR was normalized to background amplification of genomic gene desert regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1D</xref>) and is shown as Dam-Nup98, Dam-Nup98<sup>1–504</sup> or Dam-DHX9 enrichment over Dam-GFP control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Quantification of nuclear and cytoplasmic transcripts</title><p>HEK293T cells were transduced with lentiviral pseudoparticles encoding shRNAs targeting Nup98, DHX9 or a control sequence as described above. Four days after transduction, 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were collected and processed using the PARIS Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific AM1921). The manufacturer’s protocol for protein and RNA purification from cultured cells was used to produce protein and RNA samples from total cell extract and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. Fractionation efficiency was evaluated by western blotting. RNA samples were treated with DNase I and then reverse transcribed, before being used as template in real-time PCR reaction, as described above. Changes in the levels of each specific mRNA in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fraction are represented as a fold-change, between depleted and mock-depleted cells, in the ratio of the amount of an mRNA species present in the nuclear or cytoplasmic fraction to the total transcript amount present in cell lysates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Luciferase assay</title><p>HEK293T cells (10<sup>5</sup> cells per well in 24 well plates) were transfected with 455 ng of pGL4.29 [luc2P/CRE/Hygro] plasmid (firefly luciferase gene under control of a cAMP-response element (CRE); Promega E8471) and 45 ng of pGL4.75 [hRluc/CMV] plasmid (renilla luciferase gene under control of the CMV promoter) (Promega E6931). Cells were simultaneously co-transfected with 500 ng of pEGFP-C1 or pEGFP-NUP98<sup>1–920</sup> and 500 ng of pcDNA3 or pcDNA3-HA-DHX9 constructs (DHX9<sup>WT</sup>, DHX9<sup>I347A</sup>, DHX9<sup>K417R</sup>). The pcDNA3-HA DHX9 constructs were a kind gift from Dr. Toshihiro Nakajima (Tokyo Medical University, Japan) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aratani et al., 2001</xref>). Transfections were performed with Lipofectamine 3000. Samples were collected 24 hr after transfection in Passive Lysis Buffer as described by the manufacturer (Promega E1941). Luciferase activity was quantified in a BioTek Synergy four microplate reader using the Dual-Luciferase Reporter Assay System (Promega E1910) and data was analyzed as recommended by the manufacturer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schagat et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, the activity of firefly luciferase was normalized to the activity of renilla luciferase in the same sample. The normalized firefly luciferase activity of lysates from HEK293T cells, transfected with pGL4.29 and pGL4.75, were normalized to one and used to calculate the relative firefly luciferase activity for HEK293T cells co-transfected with pGL4.29, pGL4.75, and the various Nup98 and DHX9 constructs described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Quantitation of transcript abundance and E1A mRNA splice isoforms</title><p>HEK293T cells were seeded into 24 well plates (5 × 10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) 16 hr before transduction with lentiviral pseudoparticles.

The relative quantity of each E1A splice isoform was normalized to the total E1A transcripts present in the same sample (determined using an E1A primer amplifying all splice isoforms and pre-mRNA). Fold changes in the abundance of different E1A splice isoforms upon Nup98 or DHX9 depletion was calculated relative to isoform abundance in cells transduced with control shRNA (mock depleted cells).</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Comparative analysis of large scale sequencing datasets</title><p>Large scale datasets were obtained from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) repository (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_005012">SCR_005012</ext-link>), unless otherwise stated.</p><p>Genome-wide Nup98 interaction with chromatin was assessed through available DamID-seq data by comparing enriched DNA sequences from Dam-Nup98 or Dam-Nup98<sup>1–504</sup> expressing HeLa-C cells to those of Dam-GFP expressing cells (GSE83692).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.

They identify multiple RNA binding and DEAD-box proteins including DHX9. They follow up on this observation and show that Nup98 and DHX9 can directly interact in vitro and that this interaction is enhanced by the presence of RNA. Furthermore, they show that Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9. Using shRNA depletion experiments they then attempt to characterize the functional significance of the NUP98-DHX9 interaction. Depletion of either NUP98 or DHX9 leads to changes in the splicing pattern of E1A mRNA, which interacts with both proteins.</p><p>After discussion, the three reviewers agreed that this manuscript contains potentially interesting observations. However, there were concerns about the functional importance of the interaction between Nup98 and DHX9 and several aspects of the manuscript need further development. The following key issues were identified that would have to be addressed before the paper could be suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1) Clarification of the role of RNA for the interaction between DHX9 and NUP98 and demonstration that endogenous proteins interact directly. This is particularly important since in IPs with antibodies to Nup98 and DHX9, the two proteins do not appear to co-IP each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>2) Functional nature of the DHX9-NUP98 interaction.</p><p>The authors show that knock-down of either DHX9 or NUP98 causes splicing defects of the E1A mRNA. In order to show that the lack of interaction between these two proteins is responsible for this phenotype, the authors need to identify specific point mutants that interfere with the interaction, introduce them into cells and analyze the splicing defects.</p><p>3) A novelty of the manuscript lies in the potential off-pore or intranuclear function of Nup98, presumably in association with active genes. Yet there is no direct evidence that the interaction between Nup98 and DHX9 happens in the nucleoplasm, or that their interaction occurs in association with active genes. The authors have to test whether Nup98 or DHX9 bind to the genes of affected mRNAs or that their interaction is occurring in the nucleoplasm.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Overall this is a solid manuscript of high technical quality. However, the functional aspects of the manuscript are somewhat weak, and the significance of the NUP98-DHX9 interaction remains uncertain since each protein alone affects E1A mRNA splicing. Here it would be important to introduce specific mutants that interfere with the interaction between these proteins without altering their steady state levels.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Capitanio et al., &quot;Human Nup98 regulates localization and activity of DExH/D-box helicase DHX9&quot; introduces a novel mechanism by which nuclear pore proteins and specifically Nup98 can contribute to gene expression. The major findings of the manuscript include an identified direct interaction between Nup98 and an RNA helicase DHX9 and specific ways in which Nup98 contributes to known activities of DHX9, such as the ATPase activity, RNA binding and splicing. Importantly, the study also provides evidence for previously suggested but incompletely characterized functions of Nup98 in mRNA binding and RNA splicing. This is particularly interesting since Nup98 and other Nups have been repeatedly shown to contribute to transcription, and the reported roles of Nup98 in RNA processing may be part of this gene regulatory pathway. Although novel and potentially of wide interest, several conclusions in the manuscript require further evidence, controls and clarification, as detailed below.</p><p>Major points:</p><p>1) One of the conclusions in the paper (last sentence of the Summary, for example) states that the detected interactions between Nup98 and DHX9, and between Nup98 and RNA occur away from NPCs. This is based partly on the fact that DHX9 localizes primarily to the nucleoplasm and the Nup98-GFP and DHX9 co-localize in nucleoplasmic GLFG bodies (subsection “Nup98 as a positive regulator of the DBP DHX9” paragraph four, as an example). But the authors do not provide direct evidence that any of these interactions are not occurring at the nuclear pores. The IPs, which led to identification of DHX9 and of other interacting partners of Nup98, are carried out from whole cell lysates, thus it is quite possible that these interactions may represent events that occur at nuclear pores and as part of mRNA export. Furthermore, although Nup98-GFP appears to primarily localize to the intranuclear GLFG bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), Nup98 may still also localize to nuclear pores, just at lower levels than into GLFG bodies. It seems critical for the authors' conclusions to provide additional evidence that the Nup98-DHX9 interaction occurs in the nucleoplasmic pool and is not primarily occurring at the NPC. The authors can perhaps fractionate their whole cell lysates and test whether GFP-Nup98 can IP DHX9 (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) from nuclear soluble fractions or chromatin-enriched fractions.</p><p>A similar concern applies to presented interactions between Nup98, DHX9 and specific mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Can the authors also test that these interactions with RNA occur in the nucleus vs. the cytoplasm, and preferentially in the nuclear soluble fractions? Another approach may be to block nuclear pore transport or mRNA export and test whether these interactions still occur to a similar level.</p><p>2) Alternatively, the interactions presented here may be primarily occurring within GLFG bodies. In vivo interactions between Nup98 and DHX9 (and other interacting partners) are shown only for Nup98-GFP fusion. Although GLFG bodies may be related to some endogenous compartment of the nucleus, it is unclear how they relate to the endogenous functions of Nup98 since normally Nup98 is not seen in such large accumulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, for instance). The IPs of endogenous proteins, using antibodies to Nup98 and DHX9, do not appear to co-IP each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figures 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although the authors provide strong evidence that Nup98 and DHX9 interact directly, it is puzzling that endogenous proteins do not co-IP. Can co-IP between Nup98 and DHX9 be attempted under different conditions? Or can the authors at least comment on this discrepancy?</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows that interactions between specific mRNAs and Nup98 increase upon DHX9 depletion. Again, there seems to be a possibility that this is a consequence of altered mRNA export and accumulation of these mRNAs at NPC-bound Nup98. Furthermore, the decreased interaction between DHX9 and mRNAs upon depletion of Nup98 in 9B may be a consequence of decreased transcription of these mRNAs due to the function of Nup98 in gene activation. To help distinguish these possibilities, it is essential that the authors show total levels of these transcripts and preferably nascent transcripts in these conditions, in addition to the immunoprecipitated mRNA amounts shown in the figure. Furthermore, it would be helpful to determine if export of these mRNAs is disturbed upon Nup98 or DHX9 depletion, by single RNA FISH or by RT-PCR on nuclear vs. cytoplasmic fractions.</p><p>4) Similar concern applies to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>. The demonstrated role of Nup98 in alternative splicing is very interesting, but since the authors are focusing on gene expression mechanisms, they need to also assess transcription levels of E1A and whether Nup98 and DHX9 affect generation of the E1A nascent transcript or if their role is restricted to splicing regulation. This would be particularly informative in light of the known roles of Nup98 in binding to transcribing genes, which the authors discuss in the manuscript (subsection “Nup98 regulated gene expression via transcription and mRNA processing”). In fact, demonstration of binding of Nup98 or DHX9 to the E1A gene by ChIP-qPCR would also be highly supportive of the conclusions of the paper. Although perhaps not required for this work, it could provide an alternative means to provide further evidence that these interactions are not taking place at the nuclear pores as part of mRNA export.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This work in this manuscript investigates the nucleoporin protein Nup98 for roles beyond those linked to the nuclear pore. Nup98 is shown to co-immunoprecipitate with a large set of proteins, including DHX9 and other RNA helicase proteins. The rest of the work focuses mainly on the interaction with DHX9 and makes the case that the interaction of Nup98 and DHX9 is direct and functionally important. Although the topic and the work are quite interesting, in my opinion the work falls short of making a large advance because the functional nature of the interaction between Nup98 and DHX9 is not demonstrated clearly. This conclusion is made for the following reasons.</p><p>1) The interaction may be mediated or bridged by RNA. When the interaction with Nup98 is localized to the N- and C-terminal domains of DHX9, binding is eliminated upon RNase A treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), suggesting an RNA linker between the two proteins. For the interaction with the intact DHX9, treatment with RNase reduced but did not eliminate the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A-C</xref>), leading to the suggestion that the two proteins interact directly. However, it was not established in these experiments that the RNase treatment was complete, leaving open the possibility that a more extensive RNase treatment would have eliminated the interaction altogether by destroying a linker RNA. It is also possible that the interaction is relatively weak. In the in vitro binding experiments the protein concentrations appear to be rather high (based on my calculations using amounts and volumes from the Methods section), well into the micromolar range.</p><p>2) There is little information about potential specific functions of a Nup98-DHX9 complex. The two proteins bind an overlapping set of RNAs, but this does not indicate a function for the protein-protein complex. In the experiments probing splicing intermediates of E1A, depletion of each protein influences the ratios of splicing intermediates, but the effects are not the same. Thus, the experiment indicates that both proteins influence splicing of E1A, but not that the two proteins interact functionally to achieve these effects. This conclusion is accurately reached in the statement, &quot;Thus, both Nup98 and DHX9 appear to play a role in the regulation of E1A mRNA splicing.&quot;. The finding that Nup98 increases the RNA-dependent ATPase activity of DHX9 is interesting, but there is no information on how this acceleration is achieved or on the functional implications. It is also interesting that depletion of each protein influences the mRNAs that are bound to the other protein in vivo, but this relationship is not straightforward. Depletion of Nup98 decreases binding of several RNAs to DHX9, consistent with a simple mechanism of cooperative binding by the two proteins, but depletion of DHX9 increases mRNA levels bound to Nup98, contrary to the simplest model. Thus, one is left wondering about the functional implications or significance of these results.</p><p>Without clearer evidence for the nature and the functional roles of the Nup98/DHX9 complex, it is my opinion that the manuscript is probably better suited for a more specialized journal.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Human Nup98 regulates the localization and activity of DExH/D-box helicase DHX9&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved and all three reviewers support publication. However, there are three very minor remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>1) Subsection “Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9”, the authors state that the basal ATPase rate of their DHX9 was comparable to previous publications. An attempt by reviewer 3 to calculate the rate in one of these citations (Zhang &amp; Grosse), returned a value of ~15-30 s<sup>-1</sup> (depending on the RNA used), quite different from the 1 s<sup>-1</sup> in the current work. However, the other citation (Schütz et al) reported a rate constant very similar to the current work.

While I still see some issues the manuscript was strengthened by these additions.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>I believe the authors have addressed the majority of the issues in a satisfactory way. Specifically, they now provide evidence 1) for physical interaction between endogenous Nup98 and DHX9 in vivo, and within the nucleoplasm; 2) for chromatin binding of Nup98 and DHX9 to at least a group of candidate genes, using DamID-qPCR, and transcription and splicing of some of these target genes also appear to be affected by levels of Nup98 and DHX9; 3) for the functional role of this interaction in at least transcriptional output of target genes by analysis of several mutations, although this is done with a reporter gene. Overall, the manuscript has clearly improved in several ways and now provides a more convincing and clear demonstration for the functional relationship of Nup98-DXH9 complex in transcription and RNA processing. I recommend for publication.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors have made a serious effort to address the concerns of the previous reviews and the manuscript is improved substantially. In terms of the major points:</p><p>1) The role of RNA in the interaction of DHX9 and Nup98. I am satisfied that they have taken reasonable steps to rule out the presence of residual RNA in the RNase treated samples. The amount of RNaseA they used, 100 µg/ml for 10 min, is very likely to be sufficient to remove essentially all of the RNA, and they state that it removed all detectable RNA. They also state that pre-treating DHX9 and Nup98 with high concentrations of RNA does not block interaction as monitored by co-IP, which would be expected if each protein simply bound RNA independently.</p><p>2) Do Nup98 and DHX9 interact away from the nuclear pore? I am convinced here, both by the fractionation experiments and by the mutant Nup98 that does not associate with the pore but still binds DHX9.</p><p>3) Is the interaction of Nup98 and DHX9 functionally important? I think this is where the response is less convincing, and the case remains circumstantial. I found the experiments using ATPase mutants of DHX9 unconvincing, because although the authors conclude that increased production of luciferase activity by Nup98 required functional ATPase activity of DHX9, if one looks at the heights of the bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>, the extent of stimulation by Nup98 was really approximately the same for all versions of DHX9 and at least as large, in terms of the fold effect, for the empty vector. In other words this could be an effect of Nup98 that is completely independent of DHX9. However, there are several other pieces of data suggesting the co-localization of DHX9 and Nup98 within the genome, including in regions where they both function, and the two proteins are also shown independently to interact. I think this is a very strong circumstantial case for a functional interaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18825.040</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>After discussion, the three reviewers agreed that this manuscript contains potentially interesting observations. However, there were concerns about the functional importance of the interaction between Nup98 and DHX9 and several aspects of the manuscript need further development. The following key issues were identified that would have to be addressed before the paper could be suitable for eLife.</italic></p><p><italic>1) Clarification of the role of RNA for the interaction between DHX9 and NUP98 and demonstration that endogenous proteins interact directly. This is particularly important since in IPs with antibodies to Nup98 and DHX9, the two proteins do not appear to co-IP each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</italic></p><p>“The role of RNA for the interaction between DHX9 and NUP98”. This point appears to have been raised based on the concerns of reviewer 3 and their inquiry into the conditions we have used for RNase digestion in the evaluation of the contribution of RNA to the Nup98-DHX9 complex. For these experiments, we have used RNase concentrations (100 µg of RNase/ml) above that considered sufficient to degrade protein-bound RNA and used in other studies (Höck et al., 2007; Moore et al., 2014; Ule, Jensen, Mele, &amp; Darnell, 2005; Zhang et al., 2008). In fact, we observed that treatment of immunoprecipitated Nup98 or DHX9 with the RNase concentrations used in our experiments reduced RNA levels to non-detectable levels as assayed by gel electrophoresis or spectrometry. Thus, it seems reasonable to conclude that the RNase levels we have used in these experiments are sufficient to eliminate RNA. This is now discussed in the Results section.</p><p>Importantly, in each of the experiments in which we have examined the interactions of Nup98 and DHX9, including immunoprecipitations and in vitro analyses of recombinant proteins, we have observed that treatment of the complexes with RNase or inclusion of RNase in binding reactions, reduced, but did not eliminate, the amount of Nup98-DHX9 complex detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Furthermore, the inclusion of RNA in the in vitro binding reactions increased the amount of complex detected in these assays, but it was not required for their association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Moreover, pre-incubating the proteins with excess RNA did not block their association, which would be expected if these proteins were interacting by binding to RNA independently. We conclude that RNA directly or indirectly (e.g. by inducing a conformational change) augments the interactions of Nup98 with DHX9.</p><p>“Demonstration that endogenous proteins interact directly”. Reviewer 1 raised the question of whether endogenous Nup98 and DHX9 interact based on results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>. We have now included additional data to address the reviewer request and we have revised the Results section to clarify what was likely a misunderstanding in the interpretation of these supplemental figures. To summarize our data on the interactions of these proteins, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> we showed that DHX9 is bound to GFP-Nup98 immunopurified from cell extracts. This result was confirmed by western blotting using anti-DHX9 antibodies and this blot was presented in the initial submission and another iteration of this experiment is now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>. In the revised manuscript, we now present the immunopurification of endogenous Nup98 and DHX9, and evidence for their association with one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). These experiments were conducted using conditions that maintain protein-protein interactions. In contrast, the results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> are of immunoprecipitation experiments performed under conditions specifically designed to disrupt protein-protein interactions while allowing detection of cross-linked mRNA to the immunoprecipitated protein. These experiments were performed to examine the mRNA binding properties of Nup98 and DHX9 independent of one another. The conditions used in these experiments were described in the Material and Methods section, however, it was an oversight on our part not to clearly discuss the rational for, and results of, these experiments. This has now been corrected and we apologize to the reviewers for this confusion.</p><p><italic>2) Functional nature of the DHX9-NUP98 interaction.</italic></p><p><italic>The authors show that knock-down of either DHX9 or NUP98 causes splicing defects of the E1A mRNA. In order to show that the lack of interaction between these two proteins is responsible for this phenotype, the authors need to identify specific point mutants that interfere with the interaction, introduce them into cells and analyze the splicing defects.</italic></p><p>As suggested by the Editor and reviewers, we have worked to further examine the function of the Nup98-DHX9 interaction, but have taken a different approach from that suggested by reviewer 1. The suggestion that we generate point mutations that affect the interactions of Nup98 and DHX9 would require the production of a large number of mutations across the ~400 amino acid domains that mediate their association, for which we lack structural information. These many mutants would need to evaluated using in vivo assays to assess their expression, stability, and their association with their binding partner (by immunopurification). Importantly, even those mutants that appear to meet the required standards and disrupt the Nup98-DHX9 binding may also alter additional binding interactions and other cellular processes; making it necessary to show that any phenotype arising from a point mutant can be suppressed by the alterations in the structure or expression of the binding partner. As this extensive series of experiments represents a separate study in and of itself, we chose to focus on the analysis of existing DHX9 point mutations and assess the ability of Nup98 to suppress functional defects associated with mutations.</p><p>As DHX9 and Nup98 have been linked to transcription, we expanded our analysis of the functional relationships between these proteins to their role in transcription. Specifically, we tested the role of Nup98 in DHX9-mediated transcription using a CRE- luciferase reporter assay. This assay was previously used to evaluate the role of DHX9 in transcription, including defining the contributions of its ATPase activity (Aratani et al., 2006). Point mutants in DHX9 that reduce (DHX9I347A) or eliminate (DHX9K417R) ATPase activity show reduced stimulation of reporter expression. Since our in vitro assays showed that Nup98 could stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9, we tested whether overexpression of Nup98 could stimulate the DHX9-mediated expression of CRE- luciferase. Importantly, the expression of Nup98, while itself unable to stimulate reporter expression, could suppress the transcriptional defects of the DHX9 point mutant with reduced ATPase activity (DHX9I347A), but not an ATPase dead mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). These results are consistent with the ability of Nup98 to stimulate the ATPase activity of DHX9 and supports the hypothesis that Nup98 functions as a cofactor to regulate the ATPase-dependent transcriptional functions of DHX9. These data are now part of the manuscript.</p><p>In addition, we further extend the functional relationships between Nup98 and DHX9 in transcription and splicing by:</p><p>1) Demonstrating that several gene loci and their transcripts that interact with Nup98 and DHX9 have similar changes in transcript abundance upon Nup98 or DHX9 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><p>2) Showing, through the analysis of recently published RNA-Seq data (Chen et al., 2014; Franks et al., 2016), that a shared set of genes show altered transcription upon loss of DHX9 or Nup98 (287 genes with altered expression upon DHX9 or Nup98 depletion, p = 3.2 X 10<sup>-36</sup>). In addition, Nup98 and DHX9 depleted cells reveal a significant overlap in gene products exhibiting altered splicing upon depletion of each protein. DHX9 depletion altered the splicing of 866 genes, of these 217 genes also showed altered splicing upon Nup98 depletion (p = 2.0 x 10<sup>-43</sup>). See Results section.</p><p>3) Finding that many of the genes showing altered expression following depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 contain a putative cAMP-response element (CRE), consistent with reports that both Nup98 and DHX9 bind to the CREB-binding protein (CBP)/p300 (Aratani et al., 2001; Kasper et al., 1999; Nakajima et al., 1997). CRE regulated genes represent ~50% of the Nup98-interacting gene loci detected in Nup98- DamID studies, and transcripts from ~72% of these genes were detected bound by Nup98 (p = 4.2 X 10<sup>-205</sup>) and ~36% bound by DHX9 (p = 2.3 X 10<sup>-5</sup>). See Results section.</p><p>4) Reporting a significant correlation between gene loci bound to Nup98 and the association of Nup98 and DHX9 with the mRNA products of these genes. Specifically, of the gene loci that interact with nucleoplasmic Nup98, 70% produce transcripts that are also bound to Nup98 (p = 6.1 X 10<sup>-215</sup>) and ~27% produce transcripts bound to both Nup98 and DHX9 (p = 3.35 X 10<sup>-58</sup>). See Discussion section.</p><p><italic>3) A novelty of the manuscript lies in the potential off-pore or intranuclear function of Nup98, presumably in association with active genes. Yet there is no direct evidence that the interaction between Nup98 and DHX9 happens in the nucleoplasm, or that their interaction occurs in association with active genes. The authors have to test whether Nup98 or DHX9 bind to the genes of affected mRNAs or that their interaction is occurring in the nucleoplasm.</italic></p><p>We have now assembled several pieces of data, both previously presented and new, supporting our conclusion that Nup98 interacts with DHX9 in the nucleoplasm. First, we showed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> that production of GFP-Nup98 leads to its accumulation in multiple nucleoplasmic foci and DHX9 is recruited to these foci. Second, we showed that depletion of Nup98, while having no detectable effect on nuclear levels of DHX9, alters the intranuclear distribution of DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We have now performed additional experiments to further assess whether these proteins interact in the nucleoplasm.</p><p>1) As requested by the reviewers, we have fractionated nuclei derived from tissue culture cells into nucleoplasmic and nuclear envelope (NE) fractions and then immunopurified Nup98 and DHX9 from each fraction. We observed that Nup98 purified from nucleoplasm was associated with DHX9. By contrast, similar amounts of Nup98 immunopurified from NE fractions revealed only trace amounts of bound DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Consistent with these results, DHX9 purified from nucleoplasmic fractions was bound to Nup98.</p><p>2) We demonstrate that DHX9 binds a Nup98 mutant (GFP-Nup981-497) that is present in the nucleoplasmic but does not associate with NPCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>3) DamID analysis was performed to examine whether Nup98 and DHX9 bind to similar regions of the genome, an observation that would support the conclusion that these proteins interact within the nucleoplasm. As shown in the revised manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), DamID analysis detected Nup98 and DHX9 associated with overlapping loci. Moreover, the binding of each protein to these loci was dependent on the other (i.e. the chromatin interactions of Nup98 were reduced by depletion of DHX9, and vice versa). Together these multiple observations support the conclusion that Nup98 and DHX9 interact in the nucleoplasm.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p><italic>[…]</italic></p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref> shows that interactions between specific mRNAs and Nup98 increase upon DHX9 depletion. Again, there seems to be a possibility that this is a consequence of altered mRNA export and accumulation of these mRNAs at NPC-bound Nup98. Furthermore, the decreased interaction between DHX9 and mRNAs upon depletion of Nup98 in 9B may be a consequence of decreased transcription of these mRNAs due to the function of Nup98 in gene activation. To help distinguish these possibilities, it is essential that the authors show total levels of these transcripts and preferably nascent transcripts in these conditions, in addition to the immunoprecipitated mRNA amounts shown in the figure. Furthermore, it would be helpful to determine if export of these mRNAs is disturbed upon Nup98 or DHX9 depletion, by single RNA FISH or by RT-PCR on nuclear vs. cytoplasmic fractions.</italic></p><p>We have performed subcellular fractionation and examined levels of various mRNAs in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from cells depleted of Nup98 or DHX9. We observed no significant alterations between the mock-depleted cells and cells depleted of Nup98 or DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>We have now included a figure showing levels of various transcripts examined in this manuscript (including E1A) following depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). As discussed, we do observe changes in the levels of transcripts shown to bind Nup98 and DHX9, and we propose that these changes occur as a consequence of the role of these proteins in transcription. It is important to note that the change in the level of each specific mRNA bound to DHX9 or Nup98 is represented as a fold-change, between depleted and mock-depleted cells, in the ratio of bound:total mRNA of each species examined. Thus the fold changes in the ratios of bound:total amount of any given species account for changes in the levels of their transcript in the depleted cells.</p><p>You will note that depletion of Nup98 causes an increase in the binding of tested transcripts to DHX9, whereas depletion of DHX9 generally leads to a decrease in their binding to Nup98 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This is the reverse of what was reported in the initial submission due to an error in the calculation used, which has been thoroughly re- examined and corrected in the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>The manuscript has been improved and all three reviewers support publication. However, there are three very minor remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Subsection “Nup98 stimulates the ATPase activity of DHX9”, the authors state that the basal ATPase rate of their DHX9 was comparable to previous publications. An attempt by reviewer 3 to calculate the rate in one of these citations (Zhang &amp; Grosse), returned a value of ~15-30 s<sup>-1</sup> (depending on the RNA used), quite different from the 1 s<sup>-1</sup> in the current work. However, the other citation (Schütz et al) reported a rate constant very similar to the current work. The authors may want check this earlier work.</italic></p><p>In two other references from the same research group (Zhang and Grosse, 1994; Zhang and Grosse, 1997), the basal ATPase rate they reported for DHX9 in the presence of poly IC RNA is 1.16 s<sup>-1</sup> and 2.7 s<sup>-1</sup>. This is in good agreement with our results (1 s<sup>-1</sup>). We have changed the references.</p><p><italic>2) The citation to &quot;Aratani, 2006&quot; should be the 2001 paper.</italic></p><p>We have changed the references.</p><p><italic>3) Subsection “Nup98 and DHX9 interact with a shared subset of mRNAs and gene loci.”, &quot;Depletion of Nup98 or DHX9 significantly reduced the interactions of its binding partner with the target gene.&quot; This result here, with the DamID assay, seems not to fit in neatly with the result that &quot;depletion of Nup98 led to a significant increase in the amount of each of the six mRNAs bound to DHX9.&quot; This isn't really dealt with directly by the authors. Is their model that the proteins bind cooperatively to DNA but bind RNA in a more complicated way, as noted &quot;…consistent with a model in which DHX9 promotes the association of Nup98 with specific mRNAs, and Nup98 facilitates the release of these mRNAs from DHX9.&quot;</italic></p><p>The short answer to this question is yes; we envisage a more complex model in which two distinct mechanisms of interaction are used by the Nup98/DHX9 complex to bind chromatin and RNA. We propose that Nup98 and DHX9 bind directly to RNA. However, we are not suggesting that Nup98 or DHX9 use a similar mechanism to bind DNA, but rather, based on previous reports, that they interact with chromatin through their association with CBP/p300 or other transcriptional regulators (subsection “Nup98-DHX9 complex functions to regulate transcription and mRNA processing”). These ideas are part of a more complex working model that is consistent with our various observations. However, we have not discussed the details of this broader model in the manuscript, as portions of it remain speculative. In this model, DHX9 is primarily responsible for locus-specific targeting of the Nup98/DHX9 complex. At these loci, the Nup98/DHX9 complex binds RNA transcripts. By stimulating DHX9 activity, Nup98 stimulates release of DHX9 from transcripts, preventing it from leaving the gene locus with the RNA transcript and, thus, effectively stabilizing the interactions of DHX9 with the chromatin. Our data showing that depletion of Nup98 increases the binding of DHX9 to specific RNAs and decreases DHX9 binding to their genes are consistent with this model. A discussion of aspects of this model, necessary to clarify the confusion experienced by the reviewer, is now included.</p></body></sub-article></article>
