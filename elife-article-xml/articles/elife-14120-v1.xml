to the control of fear and anxiety. The hippocampus, however, has been treated as a unitary structure in anxiety and fear research despite mounting evidence that different hippocampal subregions have specialized roles in other cognitive domains. Using novel cell-type- and region-specific conditional knockouts of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor α2 subunit, we demonstrate that inhibition of the principal neurons of the dentate gyrus or CA3 via α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) is required to suppress anxiety, while the inhibition of CA1 pyramidal neurons is required to suppress fear responses. We further show that the diazepam-modulation of hippocampal theta activity shows certain parallels with our behavioral findings, suggesting a possible mechanism for the observed behavioral effects. Thus, our findings demonstrate a double dissociation in the regulation of anxiety versus fear by hippocampal microcircuitry.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14120.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14120.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14120.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fear and anxiety can be thought of as different but related emotional states. Fear is triggered by specific harmful situations, such as the immediate presence of a predator. Anxiety instead results from the possibility of an obscure threat, such as being in an exposed environment, which increases the chance of being detected by a predator. Evidence suggests that slightly different areas of the brain control fear and anxiety, but much remains unknown about the specific brain regions that help to regulate these two emotional states.</p><p>One brain region that has been implicated in both anxiety and fear – as well as in learning and memory – is the hippocampus. Named after the Greek word for seahorse because of its shape, the hippocampus is made up of three subregions: CA1, CA3 and the dentate gyrus. Each of these subregions has a distinct role in learning and memory. However, their individual contributions to the control of fear and anxiety were not known.</p><p>An inhibitory receptor protein found in the surface of some hippocampal neurons had previously been shown to be involved in controlling fear and anxiety. Now, Engin et al. have studied three different groups of genetically modified mice, each of which lacks the receptor protein in a different subregion of the hippocampus. The mice completed tests that stimulated anxiety or fear, some while under the influence of the anxiety and fear-reducing drug diazepam. Notably, diazepam failed to reduce fear in animals that lacked the inhibitory receptor protein in the CA1 subregion of the hippocampus, suggesting that this subregion participates in the fear response. However, mice that lacked the receptor in the dentate gyrus or CA3 responded normally to the drug (they showed reduced fear when given diazepam).</p><p>In tests of anxiety, the picture was exactly the opposite. Diazepam failed to reduce anxiety in animals lacking the inhibitory receptor in the dentate gyrus or CA3, indicating that these subregions are involved in the regulation of anxiety. However, the drug still reduced anxiety in mice that lacked the receptor protein in the CA1 subregion.</p><p>Further studies are now needed to clarify how manipulating specific subregions of the hippocampus alters how it communicates with other brain structures to generate changes in anxiety or fear-related behaviors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14120.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14120.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>fear</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>theta oscillations</kwd><kwd>diazepam</kwd><kwd>GABAA receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH080006</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudolph</surname><given-names>Uwe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000874</institution-id><institution>Brain and Behavior Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>19266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Engin</surname><given-names>Elif</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH095905</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudolph</surname><given-names>Uwe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The hippocampus features a double dissociation in its circuits with respect to the regulation of fear and anxiety, with CA3 and the dentate gyrus implicated in anxiety and CA1 in fear.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Fear and anxiety are distinct emotional states induced by different environmental triggers (acute, objectively harmful stimuli versus the possibility of unidentifiable, obscure threats, respectively) and resulting in distinguishable defensive behaviors (freezing, fight or immediate active avoidance versus alertness and risk-assessment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Davis et al., 2010</xref>]). Recent circuit-focused studies demonstrate that the neurocircuitry and neuronal cell populations mediating fear and anxiety show some overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Botta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jennings et al., 2013</xref>), but also significant divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kheirbek et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we investigated whether fear and anxiety converge or diverge at the level of microcircuits within the hippocampus (HPC).</p><p>The intra-HPC circuitry includes three subregions (CA1 and CA3 areas, and dentate gyrus (DG)), with predominantly unidirectional excitatory projections from DG to CA3 to CA1. Additionally, the principal neurons in each subregion are tightly regulated via activity of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs). Out of the five GABA<sub>A</sub>R subtypes expressed in the HPC, the α2-containing GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs (α2GABA<sub>A</sub>R) have been strongly and consistently implicated in anxiety and fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vollenweider et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Löw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are expressed on principal neurons in all three HPC subregions and mediate fast phasic inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fritschy and Mohler, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hörtnagl et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To address the question of how HPC microcircuits contribute to anxiety versus fear, we generated three gene-targeted mouse lines in which the α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs are deleted selectively in the pyramidal neurons of the CA1 or of the CA3, or in the granule cells of the DG. Reducing the expression of synaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs later than approximately 2–3 weeks postnatally typically causes no baseline anxiety phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Earnheart et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shen et al., 2012</xref>), in line with the concept of a developmental origin of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gross et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gross and Hen, 2004</xref>). The cre driver lines used in the current study express cre recombinase later in development, and our conditional knockout mice display no spontaneous anxiety or fear phenotype. To assess which part of intrahippocampal circuitry is essential for modulation of anxiety and fear, we thus used a mixed genetic-pharmacological approach: We systemically administered a nonselective positive allosteric modulator of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors, known to induce anxiolysis and fear reduction, in cell type- and region-specific α2 knockout mice. Our findings demonstrate a double-dissociation within the HPC with regards to fear and anxiety, where inhibition of CA3 and DG is required for anxiolysis, while the inhibition of CA1 is required for the reduction of fear.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Basic characterization of HPC conditional knockout mice</title><p>A floxed <italic>Gabra2</italic> allele was generated by placing two <italic>lox</italic>P sites 1 kb apart flanking exon 5 (221 bp) (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witschi et al., 2011</xref> for details; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

While it complicates the interpretation of the data, this effect of diazepam in C57BL/6J mice was documented previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2011</xref>). It should be noted that the startle magnitudes in “tone+startle” condition in diazepam-treated groups was not bound by a ceiling effect, as magnitudes up to 10a.u.’s were observed; thus, the reduction in% FPS in diazepam-treated α2F/F, α2CA3KO and α2DGKO mice is not simply a result of the increased startle in the “startle stimulus only” condition. Still, we conducted a second test of fear, Vogel Conflict Test (VCT), to further clarify these findings.</p><p>The genotype-linked contrast between the FPS and the findings from tests of anxiety could be due to different circuitry underlying fear and anxiety, or simply due to different circuitries being involved in unconditioned (EPM and LDB) anxiety versus long-term fear memory. Thus, we chose the VCT, which does not rely on long-term memory (although effects of within-session working memory cannot be eliminated), as our second test of fear. In VCT, water-deprived animals are allowed to drink from a spout which delivers electric shocks to the tongue, creating a conflict between the desire to drink and the desire to avoid a painful stimulus. A reduction in fear of the shock is reflected in increased drinking in the presence of shock. When drinking was unpunished, we found no difference between genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, Sect. 2). In contrast, on test day (punished drinking; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>, Sect. 2) elevation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity by diazepam significantly increased punished drinking in α2F/F, α2CA3KO and α2DGKO mice. Similar to FPS, the fear-reducing effect of diazepam was abolished in α2CA1KO mice. We also tested the possible effects of diazepam on unpunished drinking and found no nonspecific effects on water consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Our findings suggest that the double dissociation observed between FPS/VCT and EPM/LDB is likely due to a divergence in the HPC circuitry mediating fear versus anxiety rather than being a consequence of the involvement of memory processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Changes in HPC theta oscillations induced by enhanced GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity</title><p>Previous studies linked theta range oscillations in the HPC to behavioral manifestations of anxiety. For instance, theta activity is enhanced in the ventral HPC (vHPC) with anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>) and pharmacological manipulations that reduce anxiety also reduce the frequency of HPC theta elicited by brain stem stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McNaughton et al., 1986</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNaughton and Coop, 1991</xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Engin et al., 2009</xref> , <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yeung et al., 2012</xref> see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Wells et al., 2013</xref>).

As our tests of anxiety indicated that increasing GABA<sub>A</sub>R function can reduce anxiety in control and α2CA1KO, but not in α2CA3KO and α2DGKO mice, we next tested whether the effect of these manipulations on HPC theta range activity is consistent with the observed behavioral effects. Whereas our genetic manipulations span the whole HPC, previous studies implicated specifically the vHPC in anxiety-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bannerman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>).

Strikingly, as increased GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity was achieved through a systemic pharmacological manipulation, our findings suggest that even if GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity is simultaneously increased in all other parts of the circuitry underlying anxiety and/or fear responses, such as the amygdala, bed nucleus of the stria terminalis or the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tovote et al., 2015</xref>) (and in the hippocampus via other GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor subtypes), it is not sufficient to suppress anxiety and/or fear responses unless the corresponding HPC subregions are simultaneously inhibited via α2GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors.</p><p>The findings cannot be explained by changes in expression of the α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs outside of the hippocampus. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), the conditional knockouts were highly specific to the target regions in α2CA3KO and α2DGKO mice. In α2CA1KO mice, there are no significant changes in the expression of the GABA<sub>A</sub>R α2 subunit protein in the cortex or the amygdala, although there is an apparent change in expression in especially the medial regions of the basolateral amygdala (BLA) in some sections (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While this raises the possibility that the effects (or the lack thereof) observed in α2CA1KO mice may be partially due to changes in α2 protein expression in the BLA, our findings from ongoing studies indicate that knocking down α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in the BLA leads to a completely different pattern of results than that observed in α2CA1KO mice, making this possibility highly unlikely. Our findings also cannot be explained by confounding factors such as gross HPC dysfunction or nonspecific behavioral changes in the gene-targeted mice, as all genotypes showed normal baseline HPC function and response to diazepam, as measured by ex vivo electrophysiology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>) and HPC-dependent behavioral tasks (trace and context fear conditioning, Morris water maze; Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>We further report that the underlying mechanism for the suppression of anxiety and fear following the systemic elevation of GABA<sub>A</sub>R activity may be the effect of this manipulation on vHPC and dHPC theta range activity, respectively. All classes of clinically effective anxiolytic compounds reduce the frequency of evoked HPC theta activity, with no known false positives or false negatives, making this a strong physiological marker of anxiolytic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNaughton et al., 2007</xref>). While most systemic pharmacological manipulations that reduce anxiety also reduce fear, previous studies did not investigate whether the effects of anxiolytic and fear-reducing manipulations on theta range activity may be distinct in this specific model. There is some evidence, however, suggesting that theta range activity recorded from dHPC may be more relevant for fear, while vHPC theta may be more relevant for anxiety. For instance, theta range activity recorded from dHPC in CA1 and the amygdala is synchronized during expression of conditioned fear responses, but not during anxiety-related responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Seidenbecher et al., 2003</xref>). Conversely, in recordings from vHPC, increases in theta power and synchrony with mPFC in the theta band were observed during the exploration of anxiogenic arenas, while this was not the case for recordings from the dHPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikari et al., 2010</xref>). In a similar vein, we report that diazepam effects on vHPC theta were reduced in α2CA3KO and α2DGKO mice, while effects on dHPC theta were reduced in α2CA1KO mice, in parallel with the effects observed in behavioral tests of anxiety and fear, respectively. While our knockouts mostly span the septo-temporal axis of the hippocampus, these findings also point to the possibility that CA1 in the dHPC may be important for fear, while CA3 and DG in the vHPC may be important for anxiety, integrating our findings with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The role of HPC in anxiety and fear was recognized early on (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gray, 1982</xref>) and has been demonstrated using different approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Engin and Treit, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannerman et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maren, 2001</xref>).

Our experiments extend previous research, which to a large extent treated the HPC as a unitary structure except anatomical distinctions along its septo-temporal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fanselow and Dong, 2010</xref>), and ignored the possible specialization within the microcircuitry of the HPC. Furthermore, the distinction between anxiety and fear, and whether they are processes mediated by distinct neurocircuitry, has been a controversial question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perusini and Fanselow, 2015</xref>). Here we show that anxiety and fear, distinguished via experimental conditions that cause each state (we operationally define “tests of fear” as those involving a distinct harmful stimulus; e.g., an electric shock), are mediated by distinct subregions within the HPC, lending further credence to the distinction between the two states and the overlapping but distinct neurobiological underpinnings of fear and anxiety. In conclusion, in addition to demonstrating a surprisingly essential role of the hippocampus in the pharmacological modulation of anxiety and fear, our study indicates distinct molecular mechanisms underlying regulation of two distinct negative valence systems (i.e., anxiety and fear), and provides defined cellular entry points into neuronal circuitry underlying complex behavioral states.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All procedures were approved by the McLean Hospital and Yale University Medical School Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees, and were in compliance with the National Research Council Guide for Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (8<sup>th</sup> Edition, The National Academies Press, Washington, D.C.).</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>For the generation of the floxed <italic>Gabra2</italic> allele, see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Witschi et al., 2011</xref>) for details.

Local field potentials were recorded using two concentric stainless steel bipolar electrodes (NE-100X, Rhodes Medical Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA) lowered into the dorsal (−1.94 mm AP, 1.5 mm LM, and -1.4 mm DV) and ventral (−3.16 mm AP, 3.0 mm LM, and -4.2 mm DV) portions of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paxinos and Franklin, 2001</xref>). Anterior-posterior and medial-lateral coordinates were measured from bregma, while depth was calculated relative to brain surface. Additionally, a bipolar concentric stimulating electrode (NE-100X, Rhodes Medical Instruments, Woodland Hills, CA) was lowered into the nucleus pontis oralis (nPO; -4.0 mm AP, 1.2 mm ML, and -3.3 mm DV). Local field potentials were amplified using an A-M System (Carlsborg, WA) with filters set between 1 and 500 Hz. The signals were digitized at a rate of 1 kHz, and stored for subsequent analysis using Spike2 software package, version 7 (Cambridge Electronic Design, Cambridge, UK). Electrical stimulation of the nPO consisted of a train of 0.3 ms square pulses delivered over 6 s at a rate of 250 Hz, and was provided by an Isoflex stimulus-isolator (A.M.P.I.

The 6-s stimulation periods were repeated with an interval of 100 s; stimulating current began at 0.02 mA, and increased in 0.02 mA increments with successive stimulations, until a maximum of 0.10 mA was reached. In this way, a stimulus–response was obtained over a total period of 10 min. This pattern of stimulation was repeated without interruption for the duration of each experiment, and the first two stimulation trains were averaged to give baseline values. Fast Fourier transform analysis was performed on the last 5 s of the EEG during each 6-s stimulation period. The first second during stimulation was not included to avoid stimulus artifact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Siok et al., 2009</xref>).

Peak theta frequency was measured for each animal by determining where the peak power occurred in the 4–8 Hz frequency band of the power spectrum at a frequency resolution of approximately 0.24 Hz. Stimulating current inducing theta oscillation between 6–7 Hz frequencies was selected for power analysis. Absolute theta power was determined by summing the power in the 4 to 8 Hz frequency band, then normalized for each animal to the mean of the baseline responses prior to drug administration.

Following the exclusion of mice based on criteria explained above (see Materials and methods – In vivo electrophysiology), eventual sample sizes of 3–5 mice were used in statistical analyses.</p><p>Data were expressed as means and standard errors of the mean (S.E.M.) and analyzed using the SAS statistical software version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) and SigmaPlot software version 11.0 (Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL).</p><p>With the exception of in vitro electrophysiology, data were analyzed with Two-Way Analyses of Variance (ANOVAs) using genotype and drug dose as the factors, followed, where the initial test is statistically significant, by post hoc Holm-Sidak tests for multiple comparisons (unless noted otherwise). In vitro electrophysiology data were analyzed separately for each conditional knockout, with F/F Cre- littermates serving as controls. A two-way ANOVA was used for genotype and drug effects. The significance level for all tests was set at p&lt;0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Konstantin Bakhurin, Lauren Reynolds and Nishani Hewage (McLean Hospital) for assistance in genotyping; Dr. Susumu Tonegawa (MIT/HHMI) for providing CamKIIα-Cre (T29-1) and Grik4- Cre mice, and Dr. Bradford Lowell (Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Boston) for providing POMC-Cre mice.

This line of mice has been reported to show a high-anxiety phenotype (see Camp et al. 2009, Genes Brain Behav), which likely accounts for the lower levels of light-box time in this strain. Indeed, the differences in fear conditioning and extinction between C57 and 129S1 and 129X1 mice is well characterized. That said, the major concern is that all the measures (e.g., basal behavior, immunohistochemistry, RNA, in vivo and in vitro electrophysiology) used to establish the nature and pattern of α2 KO were performed in C57s (as near as I can tell). Of course, all of these parameters might differ markedly in the 129X1 animals (including the specificity for the KO).</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, immunohistochemical evidence is reported to support the claim that the KOs exhibited selective patters of α2 KO. These data appear to indicate that amygdala protein expression is lower in the CA1 and CA3 KO (quite dramatic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and apparent in the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although this difference apparently was not statistically significant, it nonetheless appears pronounced and raises questions about how α2 KO in the amygdala either alone or in combination with the hippocampal KOs contributes to the observed effects.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14120.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The most robust loss of diazepam sensitivity on tests of anxiety (e.g., LDB) were performed in mice bred on a 129X1/SvJ background.

There is also reason to believe that α2 expression levels may be different between the two strains e.g., SD Schlussman et al., 2013 Brain Res 1523: 49-58 shows that a different 129 strain, 129P3/J, has higher α2 mRNA expression compared to C57BL/6J) Other studies (MK Mulligan et al., 2012 PLoS ONE 7: e34586; R.W. Overall et al., 2009 Front Neurosci 3: 55) indicated that the C57BL/6J mice had the lowest level of α2 mRNA expression in the hippocampus out of 99 studied inbred strains. As repeating all experiments in the 129X1/SvJ strain is not practically possible, we have now included immunostaining for α2 subunit with the conditional knockouts on the 129X1/SvJ background to at least demonstrate the pattern of knockouts in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Please note that as the immunohistochemical procedures were not carried out in parallel, it is not possible to make direct comparisons of staining intensity between the sections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and those in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>. Thus, any apparent differences between C57 and 129 sections in terms of overall staining intensity in these figures are arbitrary. However, all sections shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> were processed in parallel and can be directly compared to each other. As seen, the pattern of knockdowns is highly similar to those observed in C57BL/6J animals. This is now also noted in the text (Results; Behavioral Tests of Anxiety). The only test that was carried out in the 129X1/SvJ strain was the LDB, while EPM was conducted in both strains in separate experiments, with comparable results.</p><p>FPS, VCT and in vivo electrophysiology were all conducted in C57BL/6J mice.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, immunohistochemical evidence is reported to support the claim that the KOs exhibited selective patters of α2 KO. These data appear to indicate that amygdala protein expression is lower in the CA1 and CA3 KO (quite dramatic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, and apparent in the quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although this difference apparently was not statistically significant, it nonetheless appears pronounced and raises questions about how α2 KO in the amygdala either alone or in combination with the hippocampal KOs contributes to the observed effects.</italic></p><p>We now discuss this possibility briefly in paragraph 2 of the Discussion. It should be noted that the quantification of neither the immunohistochemistry nor the RT-PCR data indicates a significant reduction in the amygdala, making it unlikely that the effects observed in α2CA1KO mice are due to expression changes in the amygdala. Furthermore, in an ongoing study, we are investigating the effects of a basolateral amygdala selective knockdown of α2GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in anxiety and fear-related behaviors. The pattern of effects observed when α2GABA<sub>A</sub>R expression is significantly reduced in the BLA is very distinct from those observed in α2CA1KO mice (e.g., lack of a diazepam effect in EPM; baseline% FPS significantly reduced to almost zero). As these studies are ongoing, we are unfortunately unable to report the results here, but we have mentioned that these studies reveal a distinct pattern of effects in our Discussion per the suggestion of the editors.</p></body></sub-article></article>
