of drugs widely prescribed to treat osteoporosis and other bone-related diseases. Although previous studies have established that N-BPs function by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway in osteoclasts, the mechanism by which N-BPs enter the cytosol from the extracellular space to reach their molecular target is not understood. Here, we implemented a CRISPRi-mediated genome-wide screen and identified <italic>SLC37A3</italic> (solute carrier family 37 member A3) as a gene required for the action of N-BPs in mammalian cells. We observed that SLC37A3 forms a complex with ATRAID (all-trans retinoic acid-induced differentiation factor), a previously identified genetic target of N-BPs. SLC37A3 and ATRAID localize to lysosomes and are required for releasing N-BP molecules that have trafficked to lysosomes through fluid-phase endocytosis into the cytosol. Our results elucidate the route by which N-BPs are delivered to their molecular target, addressing a key aspect of the mechanism of action of N-BPs that may have significant clinical relevance.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36620.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>As some people age, their bones may become weak, brittle, and break easily. This condition is called osteoporosis. To treat osteoporosis, doctors often prescribe drugs called nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates (NBPs). These drugs destroy cells called osteoclasts, which break down bone. This helps restore bone mass. To kill osteoclasts, the drugs must enter these cells. First, they must pass through an oily protective layer called a membrane. It is not completely clear how NBPs, which prefer to stay in water-like environments, can cross this oily membrane and enter osteoclasts.</p><p>Understanding how NBPs cross the membrane is important to ensure the drugs work effectively. If NBPs do not efficiently cross the membrane, they will not work properly and may cause harmful side effects. Many patients who take NBPs suffer from side effects such as abnormal fractures.</p><p>Now, Yu et al. show that two proteins help NBPs cross the membrane. In the experiments, proteins were removed from human cancer cells one at a time using a technique called CRISPRi. CRISPRi enabled the researchers to systematically turn off the genes for each protein and track what affect this had on the NBPsâ ability to cross the membrane. When one of the two genes called SLC37A3 and ATRAID was turned off, NBPs could not get into cells. The protein produced by the SLC37A3 gene opens a gate in the cell membrane allowing NBPs to enter osteoclasts. The protein made by the ATRAID gene helps this gate protein, and without it, the SLC37A3 proteins are unstable and NBPs cannot enter.</p><p>Some people have variations of the SLC37A3 and ATRAID genes. Testing whether these genetic variations may alter NBPsâ ability to cross the membrane of osteoclasts in mice, might one day help physicians predict which patients with have side effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mechanism of action</kwd><kwd>membrane transporter</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd><kwd>genome-wide screening</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Zhou</given-names></name><name><surname>Surface</surname><given-names>Lauren E</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Chong Yon</given-names></name><name><surname>Horlbeck</surname><given-names>Max A</given-names></name><name><surname>Wyant</surname><given-names>Gregory A</given-names></name><name><surname>Abu-Remaileh</surname><given-names>Monther</given-names></name><name><surname>Sabatini</surname><given-names>David M</given-names></name><name><surname>Weissman</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name><name><surname>O'Shea</surname><given-names>Erin K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Identification of a transporter complex comprised of SLC37A3 and ATRAID is required for nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates to enter the cytosol from lysosomes and exert their therapeutic effects on bone.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>N-BPs are the most commonly prescribed drugs used to treat osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drake et al., 2008</xref>). They have two negatively charged phosphonate groups that bind to hydroxyapatite crystals with high affinity and enable efficient accumulation of N-BPs on the bone surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drake et al., 2008</xref>). Osteoclasts, the major cell type responsible for bone resorption, release N-BPs from the bone matrix by dissolving bone mineral and then take up N-BPs through fluid-phase endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drake et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>). N-BPs subsequently inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FDPS) in the mevalonate pathway and reduce protein prenylation, an essential post-translational lipid modification required for the function of numerous proteins such as Ras, Rab and Rho, thereby inducing apoptosis in osteoclasts and diminishing their bone-resorption activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drake et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dunford et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fisher et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hughes et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kavanagh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Luckman et al., 1998a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Luckman et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">van Beek et al., 1999</xref>). However, it is not known how highly charged N-BPs exit the endocytic pathway to target FDPS, which is localized to the cytosol and peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">MartÃ­n et al., 2007</xref>). It has been proposed that the acidification of endocytic compartments might neutralize the negative charges on the phosphonate groups and allow N-BPs to diffuse across the vesicle membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Thompson et al., 2006</xref>), but this model does not address the issue that the amine groups in N-BPs become positively charged in acidic environments. An alternative model is that a transporter exists that facilitates the exit of N-BPs from endocytic vesicles.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>To gain further insight into the mechanism of action of N-BPs, including the mechanism by which N-BPs are delivered to their molecular target, we implemented an unbiased genome-wide screening approach based on CRISPR-mediated interference (CRISPRi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gilbert et al., 2014</xref>). We transduced a genome-scale CRISPRi single-guide RNA (sgRNA) library into K562 human myeloid leukemia cells that stably express a dCas9-KRAB fusion protein, which functions as an sgRNA-guided transcription inhibitor. The cells were split into a population treated with alendronate (ALN), a representative N-BP, and an untreated control population. Through deep sequencing, we quantified the enrichment/depletion of each sgRNA in the treated population compared to the control population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), and designated the target genes of those sgRNAs enriched in the treated population as resistance hits and those depleted as sensitizing hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Consistent with the current model for the action of N-BPs, enzymes, co-factors, and regulators of the mevalonate pathway are enriched in top hits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1CâD</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1CâD</xref>).

However, in contradiction with the current model of N-BP action, we observed that silencing of numerous enzymes in the pathway upstream of <italic>FDPS</italic> in fact conferred strong resistance to ALN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A recent genome-wide genetic interaction study may resolve this paradox (Horlbeck et al.,Â unpublished). That work demonstrated that isopentenyl-5-pyrophosphate (IPP), the substrate of FDPS, is a toxic intermediate that interferes with DNA synthesis and causes DNA damage, suggesting that inhibition of enzymes upstream of <italic>FDPS</italic> protects cells from ALN by preventing ALN-induced accumulation of IPP.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36620.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>An unbiased CRISPRi screen identifies genetic targets of alendronate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustrating the workflow of the genome-wide CRISPRi screen.

To the best of our knowledge, the physiological function of SLC37A3 has remained elusive.

Indeed, when we expressed SLC37A3 in the KO<sup>2</sup> cells, we observed a substantial decrease in the protein level of SLC37A3 compared to that when expressed in the <italic>SLC37A3</italic><sup>KO</sup> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>), even though the mRNA levels of <italic>SLC37A3</italic> in both backgrounds are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). The protein level of SLC37A3 was restored by complementation with either isoform of ATRAID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). (Note that the reduction in SLC37A3 expression in the absence of ATRAID is not clearly observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> due to the over-expression of SLC37A3. Indeed, in samples analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, SLC37A3 exists predominantly in an un-glycosylated form, suggesting saturation of machineries required for the post-translational processing of SLC37A3 (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>, also see discussion below).) In reciprocity, we also observed reduced protein levels of both isoforms of ATRAID in the KO<sup>2</sup> background that cannot be explained by changes in transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2BâC</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). As the translation efficiency of <italic>SLC37A3</italic> transcripts is not significantly altered in the absence of ATRAID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2DâE</xref>), the decreased SLC37A3 protein level in the KO<sup>2</sup> background is likely caused by shortened protein half-life, suggesting that ATRAID and SLC37A3 are mutually dependent for their stability. Intriguingly, the deletion of ATRAID also altered the glycosylation pattern of SLC37A3. In the absence of ATRAID, the mature, glycosylated population of SLC37A3 (around 50kD) became undetectable, whereas a population of un-glycosylated SLC37A3 (around 40kD) emerged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F</xref>). Moreover, in cells overexpressing SLC37A3, although a significant proportion of SLC37A3 remained un-glycosylated, only the glycosylated population of SLC37A3 interacted with ATRAID (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2G</xref>), suggesting that the interaction with ATRAID is crucial for the expression of correctly modified SLC37A3.</p><p>Finally, we explored the mechanism by which the knockout of <italic>SLC37A3</italic> and <italic>ATRAID</italic> conferred resistance to N-BPs. Given the predicted function of SLC37A3 as a transporter, we hypothesized that ATRAID and SLC37A3 transport N-BP molecules across the lipid bilayer to inhibit FDPS. Indeed, we observed that SLC37A3 resides on the membrane of vesicles in which internalized fluorescently-labeled zoledronate (AF647-ZLN) accumulates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), supporting its role as a transporter of N-BPs. This hypothesis is also consistent with our finding that the role of <italic>SLC37A3</italic> and <italic>ATRAID</italic> in the mechanism of action of N-BPs is specific to the chemical properties of N-BPs. We implemented radioactive uptake assays to test this hypothesis. When we incubated wild-type, <italic>ATRAID</italic><sup>KO</sup> and <italic>SLC37A3</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells with radioactive ALN (<sup>3</sup>H-ALN) and measured total intracellular radioactivity, we observed no significant difference in whole-cell accumulation of radioactivity between the knockouts and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As N-BP molecules accumulate in SLC37A3-positive vesicles and SLC37A3 localizes to lysosomes, we further hypothesized that N-BP molecules traffic to lysosomes and that SLC37A3 and ATRAID, together as a lysosomal complex, might function to release N-BP molecules from the lumen of lysosomes into the cytosol. This model predicts that the total amount of intracellular <sup>3</sup>H-ALN will remain the same in wild-type, <italic>SLC37A3</italic><sup>KO</sup> and <italic>ATRAID</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells, but <sup>3</sup>H-ALN will not be able to exit lysosomes in knockout cells. To detect this potential shift in the subcellular distribution of <sup>3</sup>H-ALN in knockout cells, we used digitonin to selectively permeabilize the plasma membrane of <sup>3</sup>H-ALN treated cells and generated a cytosolic fraction and a membranous fraction, which contained intact membrane-bound organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liu and Fagotto, 2011</xref>). We observed that the distribution of radioactive signal changed from being primarily in the cytosolic fraction in wild-type cells to being predominantly in membranous fractions in <italic>SLC37A3</italic><sup>KO</sup> and <italic>ATRAID</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that <sup>3</sup>H-ALN cannot be released from membrane-bound organelles in knockout cells. As our model specifically predicts that <sup>3</sup>H-ALN will be trapped in lysosomes in the absence of SLC37A3 or ATRAID, we affinity-purified lysosomes from <sup>3</sup>H-ALN treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1BâD</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Wyant et al., 2017</xref>) to assess the lysosomal accumulation of <sup>3</sup>H-ALN. As our model predicted, we observed a significant enrichment of <sup>3</sup>H-ALN in lysosomes purified from knockout cells compared to those from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Additionally, consistent with the observation that ATRAID is required for the stable expression of SLC37A3, <italic>ATRAID</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells phenocopied <italic>SLC37A3</italic><sup>KO</sup> cells in these uptake assays. Taken together, our results suggest that N-BPs traffic to lysosomes after internalization through endocytosis, and SLC37A3 and ATRAID form a lysosomal transporter complex that releases N-BP molecules from the lumen of lysosomes into the cytosol.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36620.011</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>SLC37A3 and ATRAID transport N-BPs from the lumen of lysosomes into the cytosol.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live imaging of HEK 293 T cells that express Halo tagged SLC37A3 (SLC37A3-Halo) and have internalized AlexaFlour 647 labeled zoledronate (AF647-ZLN).

In summary, K562 cells stably expressing dCas9-KRAB were transduced in duplicate with the v1 CRISPRi sgRNA library to achieveÂ ~30% infection to ensure no more than one viral integration event per cell. Two days after transduction, cells were selected with 0.75 Âµg/mL of puromycin for 2 days and then kept with fresh puromycin-free medium for 2 days for recovery. At this point (t<sub>0</sub>), 250 million cells (ensuring a minimum of 1000Â ÃÂ library coverage) were harvested from each replicate and the remaining cells in each replicate were split into two populations for untreated growth and alendronate-treated growth. For alendronate treatment, cells were cultured in medium containing 250 ÂµM alendronate for 24 hr, spun down to remove the drug and re-suspended in fresh medium. Cells were cultured for another 13 days to allow the untreated population to double seven more times than the alendronate-treated population. 250 million cells were then harvest from each group (two replicates for each condition, four groups in total). Cells were maintained at a density of 500,000 to 1,000,000 cells/mL in 2-liter cultures to ensure a library coverage of at least 1000 cells per sgRNA during the entire screening period.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Identification of a transporter complex responsible for the cytosolic entry of nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Philip Cole as the Senior/Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Bruno Gasnier (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors performed a genome-wide CRISPR interference screen to identify new genes involved in the mechanism of action of nitrogen-containing-bisphosphonates used to treat osteoporosis. These drugs impair osteoclast function by inhibiting the mevalonate pathway and protein prenylation. The authors now identify the orphan membrane transporter SLC37A3 as a novel key factor, unrelated to the mevalonate pathway, for the cellular effects of N-BPs.</p><p>SLC37A3 forms a complex with ATRAID, a monotopic membrane protein identified in a companion study. This complex is required for the cellular action of N-BPs, it localizes to lysosomes and it exports N-BPs internalized by endocytosis (or phagocytosis) from the lysosomal lumen to the cytosol, where these drugs exert their effect.</p><p>The study is rigorously designed and executed. It provides compelling evidence for the roles of SLC37A3 and ATRAID in the cellular entry of N-BPs, a key mechanism which remained elusive thus far, with potential clinical importance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Concerning: &quot;â¦. SLC37A3, but it is predicted based on sequence homology to be a sugar-phosphate antiporter (Chou et al., 2013).&quot;</p><p>The related SLC37 proteins are strictly speaking glucose-6-phosphate: phosphate antiporters. However, SLC37A3 has been tested in similar experimental set ups, and it was found not to be a glucose-6-phosphate: phosphate antiporter (Pan et al., 2011). To the best of our knowledge, its physiological transport specificities have not been determined. It would be important to add this information.</p><p>2) Concerning: &quot;â¦ we expressed functional, epitope-tagged SLC37A3 and ATRAID from near-endogenous levels of transcripts (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B-C and Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A) and characterized their localization with immunofluorescence (IF).&quot;</p><p>It is a little confusing that the authors in the Materials and methods section refer to single rescues with either sATRAID-V5, lATRAID-V5 or SLC37A3-HA as sub-endogenous expression levels and the KO2+SLC37A3-HA with co-expression of sATRAID-V5 or lATRAID-V5 as near-endogenous expression levels, and then in the sixth paragraph of the Results and Discussion generalize and refer to all situations as near-endogenous levels of transcripts. Especially, since more of the results in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A, respectfully, do not look like near-endogenous levels. Indeed, curiously, the expression of SLC37A3-HA in KO2+SLC37A3-HA seems to be downregulated when co-expressed with as well sATRAID-V5 as lATRAID-V5.</p><p>The reduced expression of SLC37A3-HA in the KO2+SLC37A3-HA cells co-expressing either sATRAID-V5 or lATRAID-V5 might explain why these cells show a response to high concentrations of alendronate between those of WT cells and KO2 and KO2+SLC37A3-HA cells in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B.</p><p>To sum up, it would be preferable just to relate to the actual expression levels observed in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A.</p><p>3) Concerning: &quot;In the absence of ATRAID, the mature, glycosylated population of SLC37A3 (around 50kD) became undetectable, whereas a population of un-glycosylated SLC37A3 (around 40kD) emerged (Figure 3G and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F).&quot; And &quot;Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F legend, the band corresponding to an unglycosylated population of SLC37A3 that is present in the absence of ATRAID but not in the presence of ATRAID is marked with an asterisk.&quot;</p><p>The statements do not seem to be consistent with the data in Figure 3F. In Figure 3F &quot;Input IB: HA&quot;, the glycosylated form seems to be at the same level with (SLC37A3-HA + ATRAID-V5) and without (SLC37A3-HA +GFP-V5) ATRAID expression, while the unglycosylated form is the most prominent form in both lanes.

Instead we emphasize that in rescue experiments we have taken care to avoid over-expression of SLC37A3 and ATRAID (Results and Discussion, sixth paragraph). Readers are referred to Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A for specific information on expression levels of SLC37A3 and ATRAID in rescue strains. We chose not to comment on the impact of ATRAID expression on SLC37A3 transcript levels and other minor consequences of lower-than-endogenous expression levels of SLC37A3 (such as those observed in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B) because they are not essential to our main arguments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Concerning: &quot;In the absence of ATRAID, the mature, glycosylated population of SLC37A3 (around 50kD) became undetectable, whereas a population of un-glycosylated SLC37A3 (around 40kD) emerged (Figure 3G and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F).&quot; And &quot;Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F legend, the band corresponding to an unglycosylated population of SLC37A3 that is present in the absence of ATRAID but not in the presence of ATRAID is marked with an asterisk.&quot;</p><p>The statements do not seem to be consistent with the data in Figure 3F. In Figure 3F &quot;Input IB: HA&quot;, the glycosylated form seems to be at the same level with (SLC37A3-HA + ATRAID-V5) and without (SLC37A3-HA +GFP-V5) ATRAID expression, while the unglycosylated form is the most prominent form in both lanes. Please explain why, or modify the interpretation of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>A note has been added in the main text to clarify this apparent discrepancy (Results and Discussion, seventh paragraph). In Figure 3F, the cell lines used for the reciprocal-IP experiment express SLC37A3 at a much higher level compared to the endogenous level. Such over-expression may have saturated the machinery required for SLC37A3 degradation and attenuated the difference in SLC37A3 expression between cell lines expressing SLC37A3 with or without ATRAID. In Figure 3G, all cell lines express SLC37A3 at either the endogenous level or lower-than-endogenous levels (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A). Therefore, the pattern shown in Figure 3G, which is not complicated by artifact caused by over-expression, is more likely to represent the physiological truth.</p><p>Indeed, in cells over-expressing SLC37A3 with or without ATRAID, SLC37A3 exists predominantly in the un-glycosylated form. However, the ATRAID dependent glycosylation of SLC37A3 in these cells is still partially preserved. Although glycosylated SLC37A3 molecules can be observed both in cells over-expressing SLC37A3 with and without ATRAID, the specific 50 kD band that corresponds to the major band observed in lane 2, 4 and 5 of Figure 3G is only present in cells co-expressing SLC37A3 and ATRAID. (We do not know the exact identities of those SLC37A3 bands that migrate slower or faster than the 50 kD band.) This pattern is not particularly clear in Figure 3F because samples in Figure 3F were analyzed on 4-20% SDS-PAGE gels, which offer good overall size separation but not specifically at around 50 kD. Other immunoblots against SLC37A3, such as Figure 3G and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F-G, were performed using 10% SDS-PAGE gels, which offer excellent size separation at around 50 kD. We have analyzed the samples used in Figure 3F with the protocol used in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F and confirmed the statements above. We chose not to include this piece of data due to its lack of new information.</p><p>In summary, as cell lines used in Figure 3G and Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F do not over-express SLC37A3 and more faithfully represent the physiological state, we formulated our interpretation based largely on these two figures.</p></body></sub-article></article>
