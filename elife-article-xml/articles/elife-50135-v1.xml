enzymes can complicate the development of new drugs, owing to the potential to cause drug-drug interactions (DDIs) leading to changes in pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy. The development of a human-relevant model of the adult intestine that accurately predicts CYP450 induction could help address this challenge as species differences preclude extrapolation from animals. Here, we combined organoids and Organs-on-Chips technology to create a human Duodenum Intestine-Chip that emulates intestinal tissue architecture and functions, that are relevant for the study of drug transport, metabolism, and DDI. Duodenum Intestine-Chip demonstrates the polarized cell architecture, intestinal barrier function, presence of specialized cell subpopulations, and <italic>in vivo</italic> relevant expression, localization, and function of major intestinal drug transporters. Notably, in comparison to Caco-2, it displays improved CYP3A4 expression and induction capability.

High affinity of certain drugs for cellular transporters combined with the extensive activity of metabolic enzymes present in the human intestine are the main factors limiting drug bioavailability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dietrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thummel, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shugarts and Benet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peters et al., 2016</xref>). After decades of research, the hepatic drug clearance is well-understood and relatively well predicted by pre-clinical models, while the accurate prediction of the first-pass extraction of xenobiotics in human intestinal epithelium still remains elusive. This is due to a number of confounding factors that affect oral drug absorption including the properties of the compound (solubility, permeability), physiology of the intestinal tract (transit time, blood flow), and patient phenotype (including age, gender, polymorphism in drug metabolizing enzymes, disease states) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang, 2003</xref>). Species differences in the isoforms, regional abundances, differences in substrate specificity of drug metabolism enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Martignoni et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Paine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Komura and Iwaki, 2011</xref>) and transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tucker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gröer et al., 2013</xref>), and mechanism regulating transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeCluyse, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackowiak et al., 2018</xref>), precludes accurate extrapolation of the data from animal models to the clinic. In mice, for example, there are 34 cytochrome P450 (CYPs) in the major gene families involved in drug metabolism, that is the <italic>CYP1A</italic>, <italic>CYP2C</italic>, <italic>CYP2D</italic>, and <italic>CYP3A</italic> gene clusters, while in humans, there are only eight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nelson et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, three human enzymes, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4, account for ∼75% of all reactions, with CYP3A4 being the single most important human CYP450 accounting for ∼45% of phase one drug metabolism in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guengerich, 2008</xref>). In addition, the expression levels of many of the major human CYP450 enzymes and drug transporter (which determine levels and variability in drug exposure) are controlled by multiple transcription factors, primarily the xenosensors: constitutive androstane receptor (CAR), pregnane X receptor (PXR), and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR). These nuclear receptors also exhibit marked species differences in their activation by drugs and exogenous chemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mackowiak et al., 2018</xref>). For example, rifampicin and SR12813 are potent agonists for human PXR (hPXR) but not for mouse PXR (mPXR), whereas the potent mPXR agonist 5-pregnen-3β-ol-20-one-16α-carbonitrile (PCN) is a poor agonist for hPXR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kliewer et al., 1998</xref>). On the other hand, 6-(4-chlorophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b][1,3]thiazole-5-carbaldehyde-O-(3,4-dichlorobenzyl)oxime (CITCO) is a strong agonist for human CAR (hCAR) but not mouse CAR (mCAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maglich et al., 2003</xref>), while 1,4-bis-[2-(3,5-dichloropyridyloxy)]benzene,3,3′,5,5′-tetrachloro-1,4-bis(pyridyloxy)benzene (TCPOBOP) is more selective for mCAR than hCAR. Such species differences together with the complex interplay between drug metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters in the intestine and liver, as well as the overlap of substrate and inhibitor specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi and Li, 2014</xref>), make it difficult to predict human pharmacokinetics at the preclinical stage of drug development.</p><p>Numerous <italic>in vitro</italic> models have been developed and applied routinely for characterization and prediction of absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) of potential drug candidates in humans. Among these is a Caco-2 monolayer culture on a transwell insert, which is one of the most widely used models across the pharmaceutical industry as an <italic>in vitro</italic> representation of the human small intestine. However, inherent limitations, such as lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> relevant three-dimensional (3D) cytoarchitecture, lack of appropriate ratio of cell populations, altered expression profiles of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes, especially CYP450s, and aberrant CYP450-induction response, challenge the use of these model for predicting human responses in the clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sun et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>A promising alternative to conventional cell monolayer systems emerged with the establishment of the protocols for a generation of 3D intestinal organoids (or enteroids) from human biopsy specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Eglen and Randle, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2016a</xref>). Using these methods, organoids derived from all regions of the intestinal tract can be established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2015</xref>) and applied into different areas of research including organ development, disease modeling, and regenerative medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fatehullah et al., 2016</xref>). However, the characterization of the pharmacokinetic properties of this system, as well as the validation for its use in drug discovery and development, is still very limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Dekkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van de Wetering et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vlachogiannis et al., 2018</xref>). This could be due to the substantial technical challenges associated with the use of organoid technology for ADME applications. The 3D spherical architecture of the organoid restricts access to its lumen, which is crucial for assessing intestinal permeability or drug absorption. Indeed, exposure of the apical cell surface of intestinal organoid to compounds requires the use of time-consuming and labor-intensive procedures, such as microinjection. The presence of relatively thick gel of extracellular matrix (Matrigel) surrounding organoids, might limit drug penetration. While heterogeneity of organoids in terms of their size, shape, and viability, can also impede studies in ADME and adequate interpretation of the results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fatehullah et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In addition, none of these models have fully recapitulated critical aspects of an organ microenvironment such as the presence of microvasculature, mechanical forces of fluid flow (shear stress) and peristalsis, all of which contribute to the complex and dynamic nature of <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gayer and Basson, 2009</xref>). For these reasons, there is an urgent need for new <italic>in vitro</italic> models able to accuretely predict human ADME and to identify early the risk for DDIs mediated by intestinal CYP450s and drug transporters in the clinic.</p><p>We have recently developed a human Duodenum Intestine-Chip that combines healthy intestinal organoids with our Organs-on-Chips technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasendra et al., 2018</xref>) to overcome the existing limitations of current systems. Here, we demonstrated that Duodenum Intestine-Chip provides a human-relevant model for the studies of drug transport, drug metabolism, and DDIs, which is much closer to the human tissue, compared to organoids, as supported by the comparison of RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) expression profiles. Presence of the mechanical forces, which we apply in this system in order to recapitulate the blood flow and shear stress, showed to improve the formation of polarized cytoarchitecture and the appearance of intestinal microvilli on the apical cell surface. In addition, Duodenum Intestine-Chip supported successful maturation of all major intestinal epithelial cell types in the physiologically relevant ratios and demonstrated low paracellular permeability. Importantly for its use in pharmacokinetic studies, it showed closer to <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of drug uptake and efflux transporters, as compared to Intestine-Chip developed with Caco-2 cells. Additionally, we were able to show that the Duodenum Intestine-Chip exhibits the correct luminal localization and functional activity of MDR1 (P-gp), and supports high expression of the cytochrome CYP450 (CYP) 3A4 - close to the levels observed in the human duodenal tissue. Importantly, exposure of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip to known CYP450 inducers in humans, such as rifampicin and 1, 25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, resulted in significantly increased CYP3A4 mRNA, protein levels, and drug metabolism activity. Our results indicate that the organoid-derived intestinal cells can be combined with Organs-on-Chips technology to provide a robust and human-relevant system for preclinical assessment of CYP450-mediated metabolism, activity of drug transporters, and the potential risk of DDIs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of the adult Duodenum Intestine-Chip</title><p>We have previously developed a human primary Intestine-Chip, referred at the time as the ‘Small Intestine-on-a-Chip’, which combined the use of intestinal organoids isolated from pediatric donors and Organ-Chips (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasendra et al., 2018</xref>) to recapitulate critical features of intestinal morphology and associated functions. Here, we sought to establish a Duodenum Intestine-Chip from adult organoid-derived cells to serve as a platform in the preclinical assessment of drug transport and metabolism. In brief, we first established organoid cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; top) from crypts isolated from endoscopic biopsies of three different healthy adult individuals, the organoids were then dissociated into fragments and seeded on the top of the Extracellular Matrix (ECM)-coated porous flexible polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membrane of the chips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; 3: indicates the epithelial tissue). Primary human intestinal microvascular endothelial cells (HIMECs, Cell Biologics), derived from the human small intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; bottom), were used to populate the other surface of the PDMS membrane in the vascular channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; 4: indicates the endothelial cells). Next, the Duodenum Intestine-Chip was perfused continuously through the luminal and vascular compartment with fresh cell culture medium. Once the epithelial monolayers reached confluency they were subjected to cyclic mechanical strain (10% strain, 0.2 Hz) in order to emulate physiologically relevant forces of intestinal peristalsis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Duodenum Intestine-Chip: a microengineered model of the human duodenum.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Brightfield images of human duodenal organoids (top) and human microvascular endothelial cells (bottom) acquired before their seeding into epithelial and endothelial channels of the chip, respectively.

To this end, we used multiple endpoints including immunofluorescent staining for apical (villin) and basolateral (E-cadherin) cell surface markers and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for the identification of apical microvilli. Exposure of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip to flow for 72 hr resulted in accelerated polarization of the epithelial cells and formation of apical microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), what is in line with our previous findings reported for the Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). We observed that culture of primary intestinal epithelial cells in the chips maintained under static conditions resulted in the formation of a monolayer of flat (14.8 ± 2.6 μm) squamous cells with poorly defined cell-cell junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and sparsely distributed microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, cells cultured under flow (30 μl/hr) with or without concomitant application of cyclic stretch (10% strain, 0.2 Hz), exhibited a well-polarized and cobblestone-like morphology with increased cell height (27.0 ± 1.3 μm), strongly delineated junctions, and densely packed microvilli. In line with our previous observations, application of the constant flow (shear stress) was critical for promoting maturation of a well-polarized epithelium, while short-term application of cyclic strain did not show any additional effect. Moreover, prolonged cell exposure to flow and cyclic strain resulted in the spontaneous development (around day 6 of culture) of epithelial undulations (‘villi-like structures’) extending into the lumen of the epithelial channel and covered by continuous brush border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunofluorescence confocal analysis confirmed the establishment of confluent epithelial and endothelial monolayers across the entire length of the chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), with well-defined epithelial tight junctions, as demonstrated by ZO-1 protein staining and endothelial adherent junctions visualized using antibodies against VE-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dawson et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, these culture conditions resulted in a time-dependent improvement of intestinal permeability as indicated by the low permeability coefficient (Papp) of fluorescently labeled dextran recorded in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip generated from organoid-derived cells of three different individuals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

In addition, we compared the expression levels of these genes in a chip and in freshly isolated adult duodenal tissue (Duodenum). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, expression of most of the markers tested, with the exception of lysozyme, increased over time in culture. Notably, on day 8 of chip culture the mRNA expression of alkaline phosphatase and mucin two reached levels similar to those detected in RNA isolated directly from the human duodenal tissue. Lysozyme expression showed the opposite trend (declined expression over time in culture) suggesting a reduction in Paneth cell population, which is in line with the observed increased differentiation of the villus epithelium and decreased stemness. In addition, immunostaining followed by quantitative image analysis confirmed the presence of all major differentiated intestinal epithelial cell types and revealed that the relative abundance of these cell types within the chips is similar to their ratios observed in <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Indeed, the ratios of absorptive enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine and Paneth cells observed in the chips on day 8 of fluidic culture, were close to those reported following histopathological evaluation of sections from normal human duodenum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Karam, 1999</xref>).

The significantly smaller number of differentially expressed genes identified with this analysis, as compared to the DGE performed between organoids and adult duodenal tissue, suggests that combining organoids with Organs-on-Chips provides significant advantages to the emulation of the human duodenal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3s1sdata2">Figure 3—figure supplement 1—source data 2</xref>).

This time, we assessed the differences between Duodenum Intestine-Chip and organoids, and examined these differences relative to those that exist when comparing the adult human duodenal tissue and organoids (Duodenum Intestine-Chip versus Organoids and human Adult duodenum versus Organoids). We identified genes that were significantly up- and down-regulated in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip relative to the organoid culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>) and identified the proportion of these genes that were also significantly different in adult duodenal tissue relative to organoids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref>). We found 305 genes which were common for Duodenum Intestine-Chip and adult duodenum but different from organoids, representing 39.25% of differentially expressed genes in Duodenum Intestine-Chip versus organoids comparison, and 21.22% of differentially expressed genes in human adult duodenal tissue versus organoids comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata3">Figure 3—source data 3</xref>). To further explore overlapping genes, we used the Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Pathway Analysis to examine biological processes and pathways that are enriched in this gene list (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kanehisa and Goto, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thomas et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, we used the well-established Reduce and Visualize Gene Ontology (REVIGO) tool to reduce redundancies by clustering semantically related GO terms and outputting them as a scatter plot for visualization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Supek et al., 2011</xref>).

A large number of genes involved in the nutrient absorption, digestion, as well as, metabolism of xenobiotics were highly expressed in Duodenum Intestine-Chip (Chip) and adult duodenum tissue (<italic>In vivo</italic>), but expressed at the low level in organoids (Organoids).</p><p>Cumulatively, this data demonstrated an increased similarity in the global gene expression profile between Duodenum Intestine-Chip and human adult duodenal tissue, compared to organoids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Intestinal drug transporters and MDR1 efflux activity in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip</title><p>Encouraged by the results of transcriptomic analyses detailed above we sought to focus further on the characterization of the expression, localization and function of the main intestinal drug transporters. First, we assessed the expression and localization of these transporters in Duodenum Intestine-Chip established from the organoid-derived cells of three independent donors by qRT-PCR and immunofluorescent imaging. The average gene expression levels of efflux (MDR1, BCRP, MRP2, MRP3) and uptake (PepT1, OATP2B1, OCT1, SLC40A1) drug transporters, were assessed at day 8 of chip culture and compared with their levels observed in the freshly isolated human duodenal tissue (Duodenum) and the previously described Intestine-Chip model based on the use of Caco-2 cells (Caco-2 Intestine-Chip) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The expression profiles of these genes in Duodenum Intestine-Chip were similar to those observed in human duodenal tissue. Although a similar pattern of gene expression was also found in the Caco-2 Intestine-Chip (day 8 of culture), expression of a couple of important organic anion and cation transporters, including OATP2B1 and OCT1, were markedly increased in comparison to the human duodenum. This data confirms that the well-known differences between Caco-2 cells and normal human intestinal tissue are maintained also in the case of on chip culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maubon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ölander et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, although not statistically significant, notable differences in the expression of MDR1, BCRP and PEPT1 were found in Caco-2 Intestine-Chip in comparison to Duodenum. In line with the trends previously reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sun et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Maubon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Harwood et al., 2016</xref>), a 3.5-fold higher expression of MDR1, 3.6-fold and 24-fold lower expression of BCRP and PEPT1, respectively, were found in Caco-2 cells compared with the human duodenum. On the other hand, much smaller differences in respect to native human tissue were observed for Duodenum Intestine-Chip: with ~1.5 fold and ~2.6 fold increased expression of MDR1 and BCRP, respectively, and no differences noted in the expression of PEPT1. These results demonstrate that by combining duodenal organoids with Organs-on-Chips technology we enabled a closer emulation of human <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue gene expression profile, than with the previously described Caco-2 Intestine-Chip.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Duodenum Intestine-Chip shows the presence of major intestinal drug transporters and correct localization and function of efflux pump MDR1 (P–gp).</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Comparison of the relative average gene expression levels of drug efflux (MDR1, BCRP, MRP2, MRP3) and uptake (PEPT1, OATP2B1, OCT1, SLC40A1) transporters in Caco-2 Intestine-Chip, Duodenum Intestine-Chip, both assessed on day 8 of culture, and RNA isolated directly from the duodenal tissue (Duodenum).

This was confirmed on the cross-sectional confocal images of the duodenal epithelium cultured on chip showing a co-localization (merge channel; white) of the fluorescent signal of MDR1, BCRP or PEPT1 with that of villin staining. Similarly, line plots depicting the distribution of fluorescence intensities of each transporter and villin along the basal-apical cell axis revealed the presence of significant overlap between the two channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, the physiologically relevant localization of MDR1, BCRP1 and PEPT1 at the luminal surface of intestinal epithelium was confirmed at two different time-points of Duodenum Intestine-Chip culture – when the cells have formed a confluent monolayer (around day 4 of culture) and after the villi-like structures morphogenesis has occurred (at day 8 of culture). The MDR1 activity was confirmed by measuring the intracellular accumulation of rhodamine 123 in the presence and absence of specific MDR1 inhibitor, vinblastine, across Duodenum Intestine-Chip at day 8 of their culture. In addition, the obtained results were compared to MDR1 activity assessed in the Caco-2 Intestine-Chip model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Exposure to the inhibitor induced a ~ 2 fold increase in intracellular accumulation of rhodamine (1.84-fold increase in Duodenum Intestine-Chip and 2.14-fold increase in Caco-2 cells-based model), confirming the presence of active MDR1 efflux pumps in both cell systems.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Drug-mediated CYP3A4 induction in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip</title><p>Induction of CYP450 drug metabolizing enzymes in human intestine is a major concern for the pharmaceutical industry, as it is known to impact the pharmacokinetics and bioavailability of various orally administered drugs, as well as, mediate DDIs. Therefore, we evaluated the capability of our Duodenum Intestine-Chip to be applied for CYP3A4 induction studies and to help identify risk for DDIs in the clinic. This is not feasible in pre-clinical species, such as rat and dog, due to marked species differences in the expression and regulation of cytochrome P450, as well as substrate specificity of the nuclear receptors, such as PXR, responsible for the transcriptional regulation of CYP3A4 and several drug transporters. Caco-2 Intestine-Chip has been previously reported to possess an increased activity of the CYP450 enzymes when compared to the conventional static culture of Caco-2 cells on transwell inserts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Ingber, 2013</xref>).

Treatment of Duodenum Intestine-Chip from all three donors with RIF and VD3 resulted in 5.3-fold and 4.1-fold induction of <italic>CYP3A4</italic> expression, respectively, relative to that in the DMSO-treated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left). Alternatively, Caco-2 Intestine-Chip was shown to respond to VD3, but not RIF treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right), which is consistent with the previously published reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schmiedlin-Ren et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ozawa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Negoro et al., 2016</xref>). Dramatically low baseline expression of <italic>CYP3A4</italic> in Caco-2 cells derived system showed to increase by 316-fold in the presence of VD3. However, it did not reach the levels observed in the human tissue and remained undetectable at the protein level as assessed by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, below graph). The metabolism of testosterone to 6β-hydroxytestosterone (6β-OH-T), was used to evaluate CYP3A enzyme activity in Caco-2 and Duodenum Intestine-Chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Consistent with the gene and protein expression data, the formation of 6β-OH-T was higher in Duodenum Intestine-Chip (55.6 ± 7.8 pmol/min/mg protein) compared with Caco-2 Intestine-Chip (4.9 ± 0.64 pmol/min/mg protein), and was further increased by RIF (214.4 ± 106.5 pmol/min/mg protein) and VD3 treatment (198.0 ± 41.9 pmol/min/mg protein). The average increase in the metabolic activity of Duodenum Intestine-Chip was 3.9-fold for RIF and 3.6-fold for VD3 compared with DMSO controls. On the other hand, none of the studied prototypical inducers showed an effect on CYP3A4-mediated hydroxylation of testosterone in Caco-2 Intestine-Chip. The observed differences between drug-mediated induction of CYP3A4 between Duodenum and Caco-2 Intestine-Chip could be attributed to differences in gene expression levels of intestinal nuclear receptors, including PXR and vitamin D receptor (VDR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The gene expression levels of <italic>PXR</italic> and <italic>VDR</italic> in Duodenum Intestine-Chip were significantly higher and closer to human duodenal tissue than those in Caco-2 Intestine-Chip. The demonstrated lack of <italic>PXR</italic>, known to be one of the key transcriptional regulators of CYP3A4 induction in humans, in Caco-2 cells may explain the differences between the Duodenum Intestine-Chip and other Caco-2 cells–based systems, including Caco-2 Intestine-Chip. Altogether, our findings support the conclusion that the Duodenum Intestine-Chip represents an improved human-relevant model for predicting CYP3A4-mediated drug-drug interactions in the intestine for orally delivered drugs, than the commonly used Caco-2 cell-based models.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>A number of <italic>in vitro</italic> and animal models have been developed and routinely applied for characterization and prediction of absorption, metabolism, and excretion of xenobiotics in humans. Among these, one of the most widely used models is the conventional Caco-2 monolayer culture, considered as the current ‘gold standard’ in studying intestinal disposition of drugs <italic>in vitro</italic>. However, inherent limitations, such as lack of <italic>in vivo</italic> relevant 3D cytoarchitecture, lack of appropriate ratio of cell populations, altered expression profiles of drug transporters and drug metabolizing enzymes, especially CYP450s, and aberrant CYP450 induction response, challenge the use of these model for predicting ADME in the clinic. On the other side of the spectrum, animal models, while retaining proper physiological conditions, exhibit species differences in both drug metabolism and drug transport, as well as substrate specificity for nuclear receptors regulating CYP450s and transporters. For these reasons, there is a need for new models for predicting human ADME and determining risk for DDIs mediated by intestinal CYP450s and drug transporters.</p><p>Current preclinical models are not able to fully recapitulate the complex nature and function of human intestinal tissue, leading to a limited accuracy and poor predictability in drug development. In this study, we leveraged Organs-on-Chips technology and primary adult duodenal organoids to emulate multicellular complexity, physiological environment, native intestinal tissue architecture and functions and to create an alternative human-relevant model for the assessment of ADME of orally administered drugs. Since clinical pharmacology studies are typically conducted in adult individuals and it is well known that pharmacokinetics in children are very different than in adults with respect to drug absorption, distribution, metabolism, and elimination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimsrud et al., 2015</xref>), we used organoids isolated from adult healthy donors to develop Duodenum Intestine-Chip. Our new findings, presented here, complement the methodology and characterization of the Intestine-Chip model established in our previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasendra et al., 2018</xref>) using children biopsies-derived organoids. We demonstrate that the physiological mimicry of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip is excellent and superior to the organoids in their original form (static, not on chip). The synergistic use of organoid-derived cells and Organs-on-Chips enables the establishment of intact tissue-tissue interface formed by adult intestinal epithelium and small intestinal microvascular endothelial cells. The application of mechanical stimulation in the form of continuous luminal and vascular flow, showed to exert beneficial effects on the intestinal tissue architecture. Increased epithelial cell height, acquisition of cobblestone-like cell morphology, formation of well-defined cell-cell junctions, and dense intestinal microvilli were attributed to the presence of flow. We confirmed the development of comparable levels of intestinal barrier function to hydrophilic solute (dextran) across Duodenum Intestine-Chip cultures established from organoid-derived cells of three independent donors. This functional feature of intestinal tissue becomes critical when studying drug uptake, efflux, and disposition in polarized organ systems. Although many studies have demonstrated that Caco-2 transwell allow good prediction of transcellular drug absorption, they showed to be unreliable in the assessment of passive diffusion of polar molecules such as hydrophilic drugs and peptides. This is related to much smaller, in respect to small intestinal villi, effective area of the monolayer and its higher tight junctional resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Press and Di Grandi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>). Organoids have quickly become a model of interest in drug discovery and development applications, yet the use of organoids for the studies of intestinal permeability has been linked with major technical difficulties related to their 3D structure, limited access to lumen, and the need for the use of sophisticated microinjection techniques for the application of the compound at the apical cell surface. On the other hand, Duodenum Intestine-Chip emulates complex intestinal tissue architecture, as evidenced by the presence of 3D villi-like structures on scanning electron micrographs acquired on day 8 of fluidic culture, while allowing a direct exposure of apical cell surface to test compounds. This represents a major technological advantage over Caco-2 transwell and organoids and might provide a valid alternative for the preclinical studies of intestinal drug absorption.</p><p>Immunofluorescent imaging and gene expression analysis demonstrated that Duodenum Intestine-Chip possess specialized intestinal cell subpopulations that are absent in tumor-derived cell lines including Caco-2. Importantly, they are present in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip at the physiologically relevant ratios, similar to the ones observed in the native human duodenum. Expression of the markers specific for the intestinal types that naturally reside in the villus compartment – alkaline phosphatase for absorptive enterocytes, mucin two for goblet cells, chromogranin A for enteroendocrine cells – showed to increase up to day 8 of Duodenum Intestine-Chip culture. This has been accompanied by the decline in the expression of genes specific for crypt-residing cells – lysozyme for Paneth cells and Lgr5 for stem cells (data not shown) suggesting the acquisition of terminally differentiated cell phenotype by all of the cells present in the chip. This is in line with well-known effect of Wnt3a withdrawal on organoids-derived primary intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sato et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sato et al., 2011</xref>). Because human intestinal cells do not produce significant amounts of Wnt3a, EGF, or several other growth factors essential for stem cell division and cell proliferation, removal of Wnt3a supplementation leads to a loss of Lgr5-positive cells, decreased cell proliferation, appearance of secretory cell lineages, including goblet and enteroendocrine cells, and the transformation of immature crypt-like enterocytes into differentiated nutrient-absorptive cells. The presence of differentiated cell subpopulations is critical for modeling various aspects of intestinal biology and function, including mucus production, antimicrobial response, host-microbiome interaction, secretion of intestinal hormones, nutrients digestion and absorption. Given that we have shown that the Duodenum Intestine-Chip recapitulates faithfully the physiologically relevant ratios of these cells it could be readily applied beyond ADME applications in development of new approaches and therapeutics that target specific cell populations. For example, it could serve to evaluate specific targeting of Paneth cells, which through a series of genetic studies have been implicated in inflammatory bowel disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xavier and Podolsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Khor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adolph et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>We compared global RNA expression profiles, obtained by RNA-seq, of Duodenum Intestine-Chip, duodenal organoids and human native duodenal tissue in order to determine which of the two models better reflects their natural counterpart. Surprisingly, although chips and organoids were established with the cells of the same origin (donors, source of the tissue) their transcriptomic profiles were shown to significantly differ from each other – the total number of 472 up- and down-regulated genes were found in this comparison. Moreover, several different analyses demonstrated that the transcriptome of Duodenum Intestine-Chip more closely resembles global gene expression in human adult duodenum than do the organoids, strongly suggesting that Duodenum Intestine-Chip constitute a closer approximation of human <italic>in vivo</italic> tissue. Importantly, the subset of 305 genes were found to be common for Duodenum Intestine-Chip and human tissue but different from organoids, highlighting the beneficial changes in the transcriptional profile of duodenal organoids achieved by combining them with Organs-on-Chips. These genes showed to be associated with important biological functions including: digestion, transport of nutrients and ions, extracellular matrix organization, wound healing, metabolism, detoxification, and tissue development. In addition, several genes involved in drug metabolism, including but not limited to drug metabolism enzymes: <italic>CYP3A4, UGT1A4, UGT2A3, UGT2B7, UGT2B15, UGT2B17</italic>, were observed to exhibit similar pattern of expression in Duodenum Intestine-Chip and adult duodenal tissue while they differed from organoids, suggesting the improved potential of this system to study biotransformation of xenobiotics and DDIs.</p><p>Intestinal efflux and uptake transporters are key determinants of absorption and subsequent bioavailability of a large number of orally administered drugs. <italic>In vivo</italic>-like expression of the major intestinal drug transporters, including clinically relevant <italic>MDR1, BCRP</italic> and <italic>PEPT1</italic>, was demonstrated in Duodenum Intestine-Chip system. Additionally, we confirmed their apical localization, which is known to be crucial for the unique gatekeeper function of these proteins in controlling drug access to metabolizing enzymes and excretory pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shugarts and Benet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Estudante et al., 2013</xref>), within the plasma membrane of intestinal epithelial cells grown on chip. Functional assessment of MDR1 efflux revealed similar level of activity as observed in Caco-2 Intestine-Chip and its successful inhibition by vinblastine. Notably, in comparison to Caco-2 Intestine-Chip the chip system established using duodenal organoid-derived cells showed improved relative mRNA expression levels of organic anion and cation transporters: <italic>OATP2B1</italic> and <italic>OCT1</italic>. These transporters are responsible for the uptake of numerous xenobiotics, including statins, antivirals, antibiotics, and anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roth et al., 2012</xref>). While significantly higher expression of these proteins, in comparison to human duodenal tissue, was observed in Caco-2 model, their levels showed to be closer to <italic>in vivo</italic> in Duodenum Intestine-Chip. Our findings suggest that Duodenum Intestine-Chip system could be applied to assess the specific contribution of efflux transporters to drug disposition, to evaluate the active transport of xenobiotics across intestinal barrier, as well as, modeling increased absorption by targeting of specific uptake transporters such as PEPT1 or OATP2B1.</p><p>Evaluation of the expression, activity and drug-mediated induction of the CYP3A4, a major enzyme involved in human metabolism of xenobiotics, revealed a key advantage of Duodenum Intestine-Chip over Caco-2 models. Significantly higher and much closer to <italic>in vivo</italic> expression of CYP3A4 along with increased metabolism of testosterone (6β-hydroxylation) were observed in Duodenum Intestine-Chip in comparison to Caco-2 cells-based system. Consistent with the results of others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Negoro et al., 2016</xref>) CYP3A4 was undetectable at the protein level in Caco-2 cells and remained unchanged upon stimulation with RIF (a PXR agonist). Additionally, while vitamin D3 stimulation led to a significant increase in the mRNA expression of cytochrome P450 in Caco-2 Intestine-Chip, it showed no effect on the metabolic activity of this enzyme. In contrast, successful and reproducible modulation of the expression and enzymatic activity of CYP3A4 using agonists specific for PXR and VDR, rifampicin and vitamin D3, respectively, was achieved in Duodenum Intestine-Chip engineered individually from the organoid-derived cells of three independent donors. CYP3A4 induction levels observed were similar to those shown for intestinal slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van de Kerkhof et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting suitability of this model for the studies of drug metabolism that cannot be supported by the previous Caco-2 models.</p><p>In conclusion, Duodenum Intestine-Chip provides a closer to <italic>in vivo</italic> model of the human duodenum, compared to organoids or Caco-2 cells, and represents a potential tool for preclinical drug assessment in a more human-relevant model. Moreover, as it is composed of cells isolated from individual patients, it could be personalized as needed, in order to assess interindividual differences in drug disposition and responses, study the effect of genetic polymorphisms on pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, as well as decoupling the effect of various factors such as age, sex, disease state, and diet on metabolism, clearance, and bioavailability of xenobiotics. This system could also help us to better understand the basic biology of human intestinal tissue in healthy and disease states and potentially enable novel therapeutic development as we further our understanding of the mechanisms driving key disease phenotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

The chip contains two parallel microchannels (a 1 × 1 mm epithelial channel and a 1 × 0.2 mm vascular channel) that are separated by a thin (50 μm), porous membrane (7 μm diameter pores with 40 μm spacing) coated with ECM (200 µg/ml collagen IV and 100 µg / ml Matrigel at the epithelial side and 200 µg / ml collagen IV and 30 µg / ml fibronectin at the vascular side). Chips were seeded with intestinal epithelial cells obtained from enzymatic dissociation of organoids, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kasendra et al., 2018</xref>), and incubated overnight before being washed with fresh media. The next day, chips were connected to the culture module instrument (inside the incubator), that can hold up to 12 chips and allows for control of flow and stretching within the chips using pressure driven flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vatine et al., 2019</xref>). Chips were maintained under constant perfusion of fresh expansion medium at 30 µl/hr through top and bottom channels of all chips until day 6. Human Intestinal Microvascular Endothelial Cells (HIMECs; Cell Biologics) were than plated on the vascular side of the ECM-coated porous membrane in EGM-2MV medium, which contains human epidermal growth factor, hydrocortisone, vascular endothelial growth factor, human fibroblastic growth factor-B, R3-Insulin-like Growth Factor-1, Ascorbic Acid and 5% fetal bovine serum (Lonza Cat. no. CC-3202). At this time, the medium supplying the epithelial channel was switched to differentiation medium. Differentiation medium consisted of the same components as those of Expansion Medium with 50% less Noggin and R-spondin-1 and devoid of Wnt3a and SB202190. Media supplying both chip channels were under continuous flow. Cyclic, peristalsis-like deformations of tissue attached to the membrane (10% strain; 0.2 Hz) were initiated after the formation of a confluent monolayer at ~4 days in culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Permeability assays</title><p>In order to evaluate the establishment and integrity of the intestinal barrier, 3 kDa Dextran, Cascade Blue was added to the epithelial compartment of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip at 0.1 mg/ml on the day of their connection to flow. Effluents of the endothelial compartment were sampled every 48 hr to determine the concentration of dye that had diffused through the membrane. The apparent paracellular permeability (Papp) was calculated based on a standard curve and using the following formula:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mi/></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi> <mml:mi/></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mi>x</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>C<sub>output</sub></italic> is the concentration of dextran in the effluents of the endothelial compartment, <italic>A</italic> is the seeded area, and <italic>C<sub>input</sub></italic> is the input concentration of dextran spiked into the epithelial compartment.

Briefly, Duodenum Intestine-Chip and Caco-2 Intestine-Chip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim and Ingber, 2013</xref>) were perfused apically with rhodamine 123, a fluorescent transport substrate of MDR1. Intracellular accumulation of dye was detected by fluorescent imaging (Olympus IX83) and measured in the presence and absence of MDR-1-specific inhibitor vinblastine (22 µM). Three independent experiments were performed for Caco-2 Intestine-Chip and Duodenum Intestine-Chip, each using chips established from a different donor of biopsy-derived organoids. At least three different chips were used per condition. Images of each were taken at three different fields of view, digitally processed and quantified using Fiji software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>CYP3A4 induction</title><p>Duodenum Intestine-Chip and Caco-2 Intestine-Chip were treated with 100 nM 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (Sigma) or 20 µM rifampicin (Sigma), which are known to induce CYP3A4, for 48 hr. Controls were treated with DMSO (final concentration 0.1%). CYP3A4 enzyme activity was determined using prototypical substrate testosterone (Sigma). Duodenum Intestine-Chip was incubated with 200 µM testosterone for 1 hr under a flow rate of 300 µL/hr. The reaction was stopped using acetonitrile with 0.1% formic acid, and formation of 6β-hydroxytestosterone was measured using LC-MS at In Vitro ADMET Laboratories, Inc (IVAL). Specific activity of CYP3A4 was determined by dividing the total metabolite formed by the incubation time and normalized to protein contents (pmol/min/mg protein). In order to assess the level of CYP3A4 induction at the gene and protein level cells in the epithelial channel were harvested either for RNA isolation and gene expression analysis or for western blotting, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Western blotting</title><p>RIPA cell lysis buffer (Pierce) supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitors (Sigma) was used for the extraction of total protein from epithelial cells in the chips.

Equal amounts (15 µg) of protein lysates were heat denatured and separated on a 4–10% Mini-Protean Precast Gel (Bio-Rad), followed by transfer on a nitrocellulose membrane (Bio-Rad). After blocking with 5% nonfat milk, membranes were probed with primary antibodies for CYP3A4 (mouse monoclonal, Santa Cruz Biotechnology) and GAPDH (rabbit polyclonal, Abcam) and incubated overnight at 4°C, followed by incubation for 1 hr with IRDye-conjugated secondary antibodies against rabbit and mouse immunoglobulin G (LI-COR), at room temperature.

system, which they have described previously, and demonstrate its physiological relevance to real human duodenum tissue. The work will be interesting to a broad community of researchers interested in tissue biology and drug development.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Organoid-derived Duodenum Intestine-Chip for preclinical drug assessment in a human relevant system&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Anna Akhmanova as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper provides a model of duodenum on a chip that uses human cells derived from organoids. The key element of the method appears to be the use of duodenum organoid fragments during the seeding process, which was applied in both the previous work and this current work. The physiologic mimicry of the duodenum intestine-chip proved to be excellent, and was superior to the organoids in their original form (not in a chip). Figure 3D is particularly impressive, with transcriptomic signatures between chip and duodenum tissue almost identical, and completely different to the signatures from non-chip organoids.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In many cases the authors conclude that there is no difference between native duodenum and duodenum on a chip, but this might just be due to a low N combined with relatively large data variability The reviewers suggest to provide power analysis to determine if significant differences have been missed. Rather than the new model being equivalent to native duodenum, a claim of being &quot;closer to in vivo&quot; than in the other conditions is much more appropriate.</p><p>While Figure 3D is impressive in many ways in terms of the underlying message, the authors need to address what appears to be some mislabeling and/or duplication of the data. Two of the heatmaps, for &quot;metabolism of xenobiotics&quot; and &quot;chemical carcinogenesis&quot; have exactly the same heatmap. Also, there are labels for genes in the &quot;retinol metabolism&quot; heatmap that are the same genes as those in the &quot;metabolism of xenobiotics&quot; heatmap, but have different results (for example, compare the heatmaps for CYP3A4, UGT2B17, UGT2B15). While it is possible for some genes to belong to more than one pathway, it is confounding that the heatmaps are entirely identical in one case, and then have differential expression patterns for a subset of overlapping genes in another case.</p><p>The authors used organoids for the differentiation of their cells and use cells derived from oranoids as a basis for their chips. The authors should rephrase it in the manuscript (e.g. to &quot;organoid-derived cells&quot;) since the current wording leaves the impression that they integrate entire organoids.</p><p>The authors should clarify in more detail what discriminates this study from their previous one reported in Kasendra et al. Scientific Reports (2018) (DOI:10.1038/s41598-018-21201-7) and what the level of novelty is.</p><p>The gene expression data (Figure 2A) shows that the physiological &quot;maturation&quot; stops at day 8 and the chips then seems to degrade. Can the author explain this?</p><p>It is often unclear at what timepoints, the various endpoint analysis is performed. This is important information and should be included in each figure caption as well.</p><p>In general, the authors provide a very nice and comprehensive characterization of their model. Yet, they do not look at actual CYP3a4 activity, which would seem like an easy and straight forward assay that should be added. It is well known that amount of RNA and protein do not directly relate to amount of enzymatic activity.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.50135.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In many cases the authors conclude that there is no difference between native duodenum and duodenum on a chip, but this might just be due to a low N combined with relatively large data variability The reviewers suggest to provide power analysis to determine if significant differences have been missed.

Indeed, in the first version of the manuscript we often used the above or similar term (e.g. “closer to <italic>in-vivo</italic>, … as compared to, “closer to human duodenal tissue than” etc.) in order to describe with accuracy, the system that we have developed. Please find specific examples below</p><p>- closer to in vivo, …as compared to Caco2 cells (Introduction section)</p><p>- closer similarity … to human duodenum tissue in comparison to organoids (subsection “Transcriptomic comparison of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip versus organoids”)</p><p>- closer emulation of human in vivo tissue than … (subsection “Intestinal drug transporters and MDR1 efflux activity in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip”)</p><p>- closer to human duodenal tissue than … (subsection “Drug-mediated CYP3A4 induction in the Duodenum Intestine-Chip”)</p><p>- closer to human duodenal tissue … in comparison to … (Discussion paragraph five)</p><p>- increased similarity … between Duodenum Intestine-Chip and human adult duodenum tissue in comparison to … (subsection “Transcriptomic comparison of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip versus organoids”)</p><p>Importantly, we have never referred to Duodenum Intestine-Chip as being “equivalent” or “equal” to native duodenum. Moreover, we would like to highlight that in the first and revised version of the manuscript we have reported the exact differences identified, using RNA sequencing, between Duodenum Intestine-Chip and adult duodenal tissue, including the number of genes that differ in between the two and the biological processes associated with the identified gene set (Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). Following reviewers comment, we have revised the manuscript thoroughly to clarify our claims and remove any unintentional overstatements.</p><p>Additionally, in order to address the concerns raised by the reviewers in respect to the small sample size of the present study, we now include a more detailed description of the strict statistical methods used for the RNA-seq data analysis, which strongly supports the validity of the presented results. More specifically, for the DGE analyses we used the limma R-package (Ritchie et al., 2015) with a proven excellent performance at low sample numbers and strict thresholds (i.e. adjusted p-value &lt; 0.05 and |log fold change| &gt; 2) for the selections of differentially expressed genes. Additionally, in all statistical hypothesis testing performed (in DGE and pathway analyses) we used as a threshold an adjusted p-value (instead of the p-value), which reduces the false discovery rate and increases the statistical power of the findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While Figure 3D is impressive in many ways in terms of the underlying message, the authors need to address what appears to be some mislabeling and/or duplication of the data.

As correctly pointed out by the reviewers, a subset of overlapping genes identified through DGE showed to belong to two different KEGG pathways “metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450” and “chemical carcinogenesis” resulting in the generation of two identical heatmaps (Figure 3D). Since these pathways belong to two different categories in KEGG Orthology (please refer to https://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html): “Metabolism” and “Human diseases”, we have included both heatmaps in the first version of the manuscript. Based on the feedback received from the reviewers we decided to combine these results and present them in a clear and concise format (Figure 3D).</p><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the “different expression patterns for a subset of overlapping genes” (e.g. <italic>CYP3A4, UGT2B17, UGT2B15</italic>) across different heatmaps (e.g. &quot;retinol metabolism&quot; and “metabolism of xenobiotics”) that helped us to better explain the results and improve the figure caption to avoid confusion from the readers. Below we provide a brief clarification and description of the changes introduced to the manuscript.</p><p>In order to generate Figure 3D we have used the R-function “pheatmap”, which automatically selects the optimal range of values for creating the color scale of each heatmap ensuring construction of high-quality graphics. The differences in the automatically selected range of log<sub>e</sub>(FPKM) values used to create the color scale of each heatmap explains the observed differences in the colors representing the expression of the same gene in between different graphs. For example, comparing the expression levels of UGT2B17 in the “Metabolism of xenobiotics by cytochrome P450” (see the color bar on the left site of the heatmap) we can see that it’s expression in organoids ranges between log<sub>e</sub>(FPKM) 0.73 to 2.20, similarly to its expression in “metabolism of retinol” (see the color bar on the left site of the heatmap), although they are represented by different colors ranging between light and dark blue or white to light blue, respectively. In the revised manuscript we clarify that different range of log<sub>e</sub>(FPKM) values and corresponding to them color scales have been used for generation of different heatmaps.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used organoids for the differentiation of their cells and use cells derived from oranoids as a basis for their chips.

While in our previous proof-of-concept study (Kasendra et al., 2018), we demonstrated that biopsy-derived intestinal organoids and Organs-on-Chips are complementary technologies which, when combined enable the development of a physiologically relevant model of human small intestine. In this study, we provide a comprehensive functional and phenotypic characterization of this model to show the clear advantages for the synergistic use of the two technologies and we demonstrate how it can be applied for drug discovery and development applications. In more details, we were able to demonstrate that the physiological mimicry of the Duodenum Intestine-Chip is excellent and superior to the organoids in their original form (not in a chip). We showed the critical contribution of mechanical forces emulating intestinal blood flow (fluid flow) and peristalsis (stretch) for the establishment of correct intestinal tissue cytoarchitecture (polarization, junction integrity, presence of intestinal microvilli), which underlie its main biological functions such as nutrient absorption, digestion and transport, drug transport and metabolism. Using RNA sequencing approach, we identified a subset of genes and associated with them biological pathways/processes which are responsible for the closer, compared to organoids, resemblance of Intestine-Chip system to human duodenal tissue. Moreover, we demonstrated an improved, as compared to Caco-2 cells or organoids, expression of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4 in Duodenum Intestine-Chip, which along with the successful modulation of its expression by the prototypical inducers (rifampicin and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) makes its a better suited model for studying intestinal first-pass metabolism and drug-drug interactions.</p><p>Following the reviewer's suggestion, we have clarified in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript what discriminates this work from our previous study, both in terms of the methodology used as well as novel findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The gene expression data (Figure 2A) shows that the physiological &quot;maturation&quot; stops at day 8 and the chips then seems to degrade.

These findings suggest the progress in epithelial cell differentiation over the time of culture on-chip. The withdrawal of the growth factors (Wnt3A, EGF) from the culture media, is followed by the physiological shedding, that together with the lack of a renewable stem cell niche accounts for the gradual “degradation” of the chip after day 8-10. In other words, with given culture conditions, the expansion of organoid-derived cells toward differentiated, polarized intestinal epithelial monolayers come at the expense of “indefinite” maintenance of stem cells. Thus, limiting the capability of the system to model the perpetual self-renewal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is often unclear at what timepoints, the various endpoint analysis is performed.
