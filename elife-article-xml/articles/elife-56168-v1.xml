manipulate the behavior of insect vectors has largely been described as indirect manipulation through modifications of the host plant. However, little is known about the direct interaction of the plant virus on the nervous system of its insect vector, and the substantial behavioral effect on virus transmission. Using a system consisting of a <italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV) and its insect vector whitefly, we found that TYLCV caused caspase-dependent apoptotic neurodegeneration with severe vacuolar neuropathological lesions in the brain of viruliferous whitefly by inducing a putative inflammatory signaling cascade of innate immunity. The sensory defects caused by neurodegeneration removed the steady preference of whitefly for virus-infected plants, thereby enhancing the probability of the virus to enter uninfected hosts, and eventually benefit TYLCV spread among the plant community. These findings provide a neuromechanism for virus transmission to modify its associated insect vector behavior.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When a plant becomes infected by a virus, its defenses get weakened, which attracts insects that are looking for an easy meal. Insects detect which plants are infected based on the color of the sickened plant and the smell of chemicals it releases. Once an insect leaves the infected plant, it may carry the virus to new plants, allowing the virus to spread.</p><p>Insects, however, prefer the easy pickings of plants that are already infected, making them less likely to spread the virus. Plant viruses have found ways to overcome this preference, but how they do this was not fully understood. Learning more about how plant viruses manipulate insects into helping them spread could allow scientists to develop new ways of protecting food crops from viral diseases.</p><p>Viruses that infect insects can trigger excessive immune system responses that damage insects’ nerves and cause them to behave differently. For example, their senses may become impaired, they may move less, or be less able to remember things. This has led scientists to wonder whether plant viruses that use insects to spread might manipulate the insects’ behaviors using a similar mechanism.</p><p>Now, Wang et al. have investigated whether the tomato yellow leaf curl virus –TYLCV for short – changes the behavior of whiteflies, which are known to spread the virus. The experiments showed that whiteflies typically prefer tomato plants infected with the virus, but after carrying TYLCV, they displayed equal preference for both infected and uninfected plants. Analyzing which genes were active in the whiteflies revealed that TYLCV triggers a harmful immune response which turns on genes that cause cells in the brain to die. This impairs the whiteflies' sight and sense of smell, making it harder for them to distinguish between infected and uninfected plants.</p><p>These findings suggest that the immune response triggered by the virus may be essential for the spread of TYLCV. It also identified a protein that causes the death of brain cells, leading to behavioral changes in the whiteflies. This suggests that targeting this protein, or other steps in this process, could help stop the spread of TYLCV in tomato plants.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>whitefly</kwd><kwd>TYLCV</kwd><kwd>neurodegeneration</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd><kwd>sickness behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>the National Key R&amp;D Program of China (no. 2017YFD0200400)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ge</surname><given-names>Feng</given-names></name><name><surname>Sun</surname><given-names>Yucheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program (no.

Among the plant-virus-vector associations, insect vectors are the only organisms that can freely disperse and closely interact with both host plants and plant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Over the past decades, many studies on virus-induced changes on the behavior of insect vectors have been published, where the underlying mechanisms were typically attributed to modifications of plant nutritive and defensive metabolites in response to virus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mauck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauck et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the persistently transmitted viruses (PTVs), rather than non-persistently or semi-persistently transmitted viruses, manage to cross the physical barriers, circulate within the hemolymph, and even replicate in insect vectors. Therefore, it has been speculated that PTVs utilize a direct neuromanipulation mechanism to induce behavioral changes in insect vectors; however, the molecular mechanism remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eigenbrode et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jia et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Olfactory signaling, the most extensively investigated pathway, may be hijacked by plant viruses to modulate the behavior of insect vectors and their associations with host plants. For example, <italic>Rice stripe virus</italic> and <italic>Southern rice black-streaked dwarf virus</italic> were able to directly regulate the gene transcripts of odorant receptor coreceptor (ORco) and odorant-binding protein (OBP) of their insect vectors <italic>Laodelphax striatellus</italic> and <italic>Sogatella furcifera,</italic> respectively, and reversed their odorant preferences between virus infected and uninfected host plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). Some rhabdoviruses have been reported to cross the salivary gland barrier through neurotrophic routes possibly due to neuroinvasion of the virus into the brain and nerve ganglia of its insect vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ammar and Nault, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ammar and Hogenhout, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, studies on insect viruses demonstrate that the virus infection in the brain could impair the learning and memory function leading to sensitivity deficit and response lag in its insect host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>). These relevant behavioral changes in infected insect hosts, including a reduction in mating and locomotor activities, were typically defined as sickness behavior resulting from immune activation and nervous system dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jenkins et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Patot et al., 2009</xref>). For instance, replication of the deformed wing virus (DWV, <italic>Iflaviridae</italic>) in the brain of <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> especially in the regions associated with vision and olfaction resulted in an insensitive responsiveness to food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iqbal and Mueller, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shah et al., 2009</xref>). Likewise, some plant viruses induced a similar sickness behavior in insect vectors, possibly believing that sickness behavior could be also utilized by plant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eigenbrode et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mauck et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, the sickness behavior is the result of neuroinflammation induced by activation of the innate immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Godbout et al., 2005</xref>). The toll-like receptor (TLR) and nod-like receptor (NLR) cascades that are triggered by pathogens amplify the signal of several inflammatory programmed cell death formats in the central nervous system (CNS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dantzer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heneka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heneka et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">LeBlanc and Saleh, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Man et al., 2017</xref>). With the loss of neurons, the motor and sensory deficits become irreversible in the case of permanent tissue damage to the host of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glass et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shattuck and Muehlenbein, 2015</xref>). By contrast, plant viruses theoretically cause limited or no physical damage to insect vectors, but some cases of severe lesions leading to slower behavior and recognition dysfunction have been reported previously, suggesting that nerve damage and immune activation may be involved in the interaction between plant virus and its insect vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ingwell et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mauck et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno-Delafuente et al., 2013</xref>). Intriguingly, it has been shown that some intracellular immune responses of insect vectors, such as apoptosis and autophagy, benefit virus propagation and transmission, which is contrary to the established antiviral function in the virus-host interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wang et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p><italic>Tomato yellow leaf curl virus</italic> (TYLCV, Geminiviridae), a type member of the genus <italic>begomovirus</italic>, is exclusively transmitted by <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> (whitefly) in a persistent circulative manner, and causes epidemic outbreaks worldwide resulting in extensive crop yield losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Czosnek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pakkianathan et al., 2015</xref>). TYLCV could enhance the odorant attractiveness of the plant to non-viruliferous Mediterranean (MED, also named as biotype Q) whitefly by suppressing the repellent volatile emission. After acquiring TYLCV, the whitefly displays no special preference for TYLCV-infected relative to uninfected tomato plants. This suggests that the loss of host preference in whitefly is possibly due to direct manipulation of TYLCV, but the underlying mechanism has not been fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, we aimed to understand the neural mechanisms of viruliferous whitefly underlying this direct behavioral manipulation of host preference, as well as the resulting virus transmission. Here, we present the evidence that TYLCV induces caspase-dependent apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of whitefly, leading to sensory deficits in whitefly and promotes TYLCV transmission among the plant community.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TYLCV reduces whitefly preference to virus-infected plant</title><p>Our previous field experiments have shown that non-viruliferous whitefly prefers to settle on TYLCV-infected plants, while the viruliferous whitefly does not exhibit a preference for TYLCV-infected relative to uninfected plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Due to the complexity of the host seeking behavior of whitefly, a short-term free-choice assay was used to compare the host preference between viruliferous and non-viruliferous whiteflies, and the result showed that whiteflies tended to prefer TYLCV-infected plants before acquiring the virus, while they exhibited an equal preference for virus-infected and uninfected plants after acquiring TYLCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Two sets of dual-choice experiments were conducted to separate the vision and olfaction cues from host plants, and the results revealed that a less number of viruliferous whiteflies preferred yellow light and odors released from virus-infected plants, suggesting TYLCV acquisition defected both the visual and olfactory sensitivities of whiteflies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>TYLCV impairs the host selectivity of whitefly between infected and uninfected host plants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Whitefly preferences change after TYLCV acquisition.

Only two caspase genes have been characterized in the genome of whitefly, namely, <italic>BtCaspase1</italic> and <italic>BtCaspase3b</italic>, which were demonstrated to be involved in cell death to initiate apoptotic response to UV stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).

Canonical effector caspase cleavage in model species has been well characterized and represents the initiation of apoptosis. Full-length effector caspase can be cleaved by initiator caspase into three subunits including a short prodomain, a p10 domain subunit, and a p20 domain subunit. The p20 and p10 subunits closely associate with each other to form a caspase monomer, and then, two monomers combine into an active homodimer that executes the apoptosis activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riedl and Shi, 2004</xref>). However, it remains unclear whether Caspase3b of whitefly has the same/similar function with mammals or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> because whitefly loses many apoptosis-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McIlwain et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishide et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Riedl and Shi, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Using a time-course UV treatment experiment and non-reduced denaturing western blot assay with a p10 antibody, we found that inactive Caspase3b existed as 49 KDa monomer in whitefly (most effector caspases usually exist as homodimer), and the cleavage process is the same as the canonical manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Once apoptosis was induced by UV, cytoplasmic inactive Caspase3b rapidly decreased in 5 min, indicating cleavage initiation. Afterward, the full-length inactive Caspase3b was recovered in 15–30 min, and increased in 60–120 min, since the transcriptional expression was also induced. Cleaved p10 and monomer increased during apoptosis activation in 5–30 min, and afterward, these monomers formed the active homodimer (60–120 min) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the decrease of full-length Caspase3b, and increase of p10 and monomer, as well as the increase of active homodimer represent the apoptosis activation in whitefly; however, they are shown in different stages of Caspase3b cleavage. This Caspase3b cleavage was also confirmed by another anti-Caspase3b p20 antibody, which displayed a similar result using p10 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The changes in defensive metabolites and nutritive values of host plants were empirically responsible for improving the feeding efficiency and oviposition of viruliferous whitefly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McKenzie, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moreno-Delafuente et al., 2013</xref>). The disease symptoms of TYLCV-infected plants, such as yellow curl leaves and less repellent volatiles, enhanced the attractiveness to non-viruliferous whitefly to acquire TYLCV virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2013</xref>). It has been reasonably speculated that sustaining a strong attractiveness to viruliferous insect vectors was a disadvantage for the virus spread. In this study, we found that TYLCV was able to eliminate the unfavorable attractiveness from virus-infected plants by directly impairing the host selection ability of viruliferous whitefly. This virus-induced sickness behavior of whitefly was triggered by caspase-dependent apoptotic neurodegeneration, which was the outgrowth of the activation of innate immune response in whitefly. Our finding reveals the virus-induced immune-neuro-behavior communication in viruliferous insect vector, which promoted the virus transmission among plants.</p><p>In most cases, host preferences between viruliferous and non-viruliferous vectors are opposite, in which the non-viruliferous vector preferred virus-infected plants, while the viruliferous vector preferred uninfected plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eigenbrode et al., 2018</xref>). These opposite preferences benefit the virus spread during both the virus acquisition and transmission stages, and these have been reported to be regulated by the olfaction signaling cascades of insect vectors, including the transcriptional regulation of <italic>OR</italic>s and <italic>OBP</italic>s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2019</xref>). By contrast, our results show that viruliferous whitefly exhibits an unbiased preference between TYLCV-infected and uninfected plants, suggesting that the manipulation of TYLCV on the host preference of whitefly could differ in the modifications of olfaction signaling. Likewise, it appears that TYLCV suppressed the perception of whitefly to olfactory or visional cues from host plants, in terms of behavioral choice assays. The TYLCV-induced sensory deficits in viruliferous whitefly were similar to typical sickness behavior, even though this was a coordinated symptom of behavioral changes that responded to the infection. Furthermore, the sickness behavior was considered as an adaptive means of redirecting energy from disadvantageous behavior to an effective immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shattuck and Muehlenbein, 2015</xref>). The insect virus-induced sickness behavior reduced the sexual activity and feeding of the insect host, which were beneficial for insect population, thereby deterring the virus spread from healthy individuals but negatively affecting the sexually transmitted pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, viruliferous whitefly that exhibited the sickness behavior efficiently transmitted the TYLCV, when compared to those without sickness behavior, suggesting that the sickness behavior of viruliferous whitefly facilitates the spread of PTVs.</p><p>Neurodegenerative disorders accompanied by CNS cell loss are responsible for the sickness behavior in insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Godbout et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McCusker and Kelley, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ransohoff, 2016</xref>).

Interestingly, we found that the acquisition of PTVs induced neuropathological lesions in the brain of insect vectors, suggesting that whitefly could be directly infected by TYLCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is noteworthy that apart from insect viruses, few plant viruses have been found to infect or replicate in the brain of insects. However, in this study, both the coat protein and DNA of TYLCV can be stained by fluorescence confocal microscopy in the brain, eyes, and antenna of whitefly, indicating that an undiscovered nerve route of whitefly may exist for the infection of TYLCV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Similar to mammals, caspase-dependent CNS cell death is also responsible for TYLCV-induced neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). For virus-vector interactions, apoptosis is an effective weapon of the innate immunity to eliminate the virus infection, replication, and dissemination within the insect vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen and Wei, 2019</xref>). These results revealed that the silencing of apoptosis-related caspases was behaviorally unfavorable to TYLCV transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). Likewise, for leafhoppers, <italic>Rice gall dwarf virus</italic> activates the caspase-dependent apoptosis by targeting the mitochondria, and inducing mitochondrial degeneration to promote viral infections within the insect vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). These findings suggested that vector apoptosis could be utilized by PTVs to promote the virus spread. Furthermore, compared with wild-type TYLCV, the mutant TYLCV was unable to induce the sickness behavior in whitefly, suggesting that the successful entry into the hemolymph was a preliminary step for the stimulation of whitefly innate immunity. Furthermore, the immune response was activated by TYLCV only after 12 hr of virus acquisition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>), while 24–48 hr is usually required for TYLCV to cross the salivary gland barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown and Czosnek, 2002</xref>). It has been suggested that the initiation of the innate immune response in whitefly is essential for TYLCV to cross the physical barrier of the midgut. In addition, the immune deficiency (IMD) pathway is involved in the neurodegeneration of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, but this is exceptionally absent in some hemipteran insects, such as <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic>, <italic>Diaphorina citri,</italic> and <italic>B. tabaci</italic>, suggesting that whitefly quite differs from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, in terms of regulation of neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Myllymäki et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nishide et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>NLRs, which cascade the inflammatory signaling, are required to amplify the immune activation, and causes neurodegeneration in human. Remarkably, conserved NLRs are the most abundant cytoplasmic innate immune receptors in plants and animals, other than insects. In the present study, a putative NLR, <italic>BtNLRL4</italic>, was found to be necessary for the TYLCV-induced neurodegeneration of whitefly, even though the architecture differed from NLRs in mammals or plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). Considering the DD domain of initiator <italic>BtCaspase1</italic> and the putative DD/DED domain of <italic>BtNLRL4</italic>, the direct interaction of <italic>BtCaspase1</italic> and <italic>BtNLRL4</italic> might exist in whitefly rather than the constructing inflammasome in mammals.

A mathematic model concluded that the host preference of insect vectors could lead to a dramatic difference in plant virus epidemic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Roosien et al., 2013</xref>). For single species of plants, viruliferous whitefly preferably chooses uninfected plants, which appears to be beneficial to the TYLCV spread, while the unbiased host preference is more practical and has more efficacy to the plant community, in terms of the complexity and diversity of the volatile components released from a broad range of host plants of TYLCV. Although TYLCV-induced immune responses are favorable for virus spread, it has been shown that the activation of autophagy leads to degradation of the coat protein and genome DNA of TYLCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). It has been suggested that merely the optimal degree of immune responses triggered by the virus could maximize the benefits of TYLCV in balancing the virus replication and transmission. In summary, TYLCV changes the host preference of whitefly to promote its spread by inducing the caspase-dependent apoptotic neurodegeneration in the insect vector. A deep understanding of the innate immunity and utilization of the antagonistic effect between apoptosis and autophagy in insect vectors could be an efficient approach to control the transmission and spread of PTVs in the future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or <break/>reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Tomato yellow leave curl virus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Tomato yellow leave curl virus</italic> isolate SH2 infectious clone</td><td valign="top">Xueping Zhou, Institute of Plant Protection, CAAS</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Tomato yellow leave curl virus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Mutant <italic>Tomato yellow leave curl virus</italic> isolate SH2 infectious clone</td><td valign="top">Xiaowei Wang, Zhejiang University</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-TYLCV CP</td><td valign="top">Jianxiang Wu, Zhejiang University</td><td valign="top"/><td>IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal anti-GAPDH</td><td valign="top">Proteintech</td><td valign="top">Cat# 60004–1-Ig; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2107436">AB_2107436</ext-link></td><td>WB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-Caspase3b p10</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>Immunogen: YFRPKRPAIDL*C <break/>WB (1:3000) <break/>IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal anti-Caspase3b p20</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td>Immunogen: LSQEDHSDADC <break/>WB (1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa 488 goat anti-mouse IgG</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#ab150113; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2576208">AB_2576208</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td valign="top">Alexa 555 goat anti-rabbit IgG</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">Cat#ab150078; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2722519">AB_2722519</ext-link></td><td>IF (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">One Step TUNEL Apoptosis Assay Kit</td><td valign="top">Beyotime</td><td valign="top">Cat#C1088</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit</td><td valign="top">Agilent</td><td valign="top">Cat#400753</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">RoomTemp Sample Lysis Kit</td><td valign="top">Vazyme</td><td valign="top">Cat#P073</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">TRIzol Reagent</td><td valign="top">Ambion</td><td valign="top">Cat#15596018</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">FastQuant RT Kit with gDNase</td><td valign="top">Tiangen</td><td valign="top">Cat#KR106</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">PowerUp SYBR Green Master Mix</td><td valign="top">Applied Biosystems</td><td valign="top">Cat#A25742</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">T7 RiboMAX Express RNAi System</td><td valign="top">Promega</td><td valign="top">Cat#P1700</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SPSS</td><td valign="top">SPSS</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_002865">SCR_002865</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism software</td><td valign="top">GraphPad Prism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://graphpad.com/">https://graphpad.com</ext-link>)</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_015807">SCR_015807</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insect rearing</title><p>The Mediterranean (MED)/Q whitefly (mtCOI GenBank accession no: GQ371165) of the <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> species complex were reared on cotton plants (<italic>Gossypium hirsutum</italic> cv Guo-Shen 7886) placed in insect-proof cages between 26°C and 28°C, with a photoperiod of 16:8 hr (light/dark).

The infectious clone was inoculated into plants at the 3–4 true leaves stage, and plants with both obvious symptoms and a positive result in the PCR analysis were used in the experiments as TYLCV infected plants.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioral assays</title><p>A total of 30 whiteflies from the same treatment were collected in a clean pipet tip as one biological replicate for all behavioral assays. The free-choice assay was performed in an insect-proof cage (40 × 40 × 40 cm<sup>3</sup>), with two TYLCV infected and two uninfected tomato plants placed diagonally. Then, the number of whiteflies on each plant was counted after a 10 min choosing. Any whitefly that settled on the ground or hung on the cage was recorded as ‘no choice’.</p><p>For the olfactory related dual-choice assay, two hermetical-sealed glass chambers (40 cm in height, 23 cm in diameter) that contained the test plants were connected to two branch arms of a glass Y-tube olfactometer (24 cm in length for each arm), respectively. A purified airflow was equally and continually pumped from the glass chamber to the olfactometer at 300 ml/min. For the visual-related dual-choice assay, two branch arms of the olfactometer were connected to the same glass chamber and equally illuminated by green and yellow light, respectively. For the responding test, one branch arm of the Y-tube was connected to the glass chamber that contained the tomato plant, and another branch arm was connected to the clean airflow. The Y-tube olfactometer was rotated at 180° after each replicate to avoid positional bias, and all tests were conducted between 15:00 and 20:00, in case of the circadian difference. Whiteflies were released in the main olfactometer arm for up to 10 min. A choice for one of the two branch arms was considered as valid when the whitefly moved &gt;5 cm onto either arm, and stayed in that arm for at least 15 s. This experiment design has been modified from Fereres’ and Li’s works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fereres et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Whitefly preference was quantified with an attraction index (AI), calculated as: AI = (<italic>V - N</italic>)/30, where <italic>V</italic> is the number of viruliferous whiteflies, <italic>N</italic> is the number of non-viruliferous whiteflies, and 30 is the sum of whiteflies was used in one test.

The brief protocol was previously described and modified in the present experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pakkianathan et al., 2015</xref>). One gram of fresh weight leaf tissue was homogenized in 2.4 ml of ice-cold lysis buffer (pH 8.0, 100 mM trisodium citrate, 18.5 mM ascorbic acid, 60 mM sodium sulfite, 5 mM EDTA, and 1% [wt/vol] β-mercaptoethanol) and produced in 2.5% (vol/vol) Triton X-100, stirred overnight, filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and clarified by 10 min centrifugation at 8000 g. The supernatant was filtered through 0.2 μm of Supor membrane Non-Pyrogenic (PALL) and centrifuged for 3 hr at 90,000 g in a SW41Ti rotor with a coulter optima XPN-80 ultracentrifuge (Beckman). The pellet was resuspended in buffered (pH 8.0) CEM buffer (10 mM trisodium citrate, 1 mM EDTA, and 0.1% β-mercaptoethanol), and loaded onto a 10.5 ml linear 10–50% sucrose gradient in CEM buffer. The sucrose gradient was fractionated (1 ml per fraction) after 3 hr of centrifugation at 90,000 g. The positive fractions (determined by PCR) were diluted with CEM buffer, and centrifuged for 3 hr at 90,000 g, and the final pellet was suspended in 15% sucrose in CEM buffer (without β-mercaptoethanol). The presence of viral particles was confirmed by staining with 2% phosphotungstic acid, and observed using a Tecnai G2 F20 TWIN transmission electron microscope. Then, about 12 g of fresh weight leaves was finally suspended in 1 ml of CEM buffer for whitefly artificial diet feeding.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>mRNA sequencing and data analysis</title><p>A total of eight whitefly samples were respectively collected from TYLCV infected or uninfected tomato plants for sequencing, and each sample contained approximately 300 dissected heads. The RNA was extracted using an Absolutely RNA Nanoprep Kit (Agilent). The concentration and quality of the total RNA were determined using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (Thermo) and by gel electrophoresis. Beads that contained oligo (dT) were used to isolate the poly(A) mRNA from the total RNA. The purified mRNA was fragmented in the fragmentation buffer, and used as templates to synthesize the first-strand cDNA. Then, the second-strand cDNA was synthesized using a buffer, dNTPs, RNase H, and DNA polymerase I. The short fragments with additional ‘A’ base were ligated to the Illumina sequencing adaptors. The selected size DNA fragment was amplified by PCR, and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing machine. The dirty raw reads were removed before analyzing data. Then, the resulting reads were aligned to the MED whitefly reference genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://gigadb.org/dataset/100286">http://gigadb.org/dataset/100286</ext-link>) from the Giga Database, and the fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped (FPKM) were estimated. DEseq2 was used to filtrate the differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Then, the enrichment analysis of KEGG was performed to identify the regulation pathways represented by these DEGs.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option.

The progression of experiments presented in this paper is good and quite clear. This work is novel and has a lot of merits as it looks at the molecular mechanisms that underlie sickness behavior in whiteflies that eventually aid a plant virus in its spread from infected plant hosts to healthy plant hosts. The authors show that there is neurodegeneration of the whitefly brain that seems to be causing this vector to not show a preference for infected plants anymore (like uninfected vectors). To reveal the mechanisms involved in and as a result of the neurodegeneration-driven change in whitefly behavior, the authors take an integrative approach by combining behavioral assays, with histology (i.e., histology, TUNEL, FISH and immunofluorescence), gene expression analyses, and functional genetics analyses. However, the overarching goal/rationale of the paper is not particularly well-defined in the Introduction, and the text at present lacks a clear flow making the data a bit difficult to interpret at first.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a good amount of background in the Introduction, but it was a bit difficult to follow in terms of flow leading up to the rationale for the paper and the description of the findings. It would help add to the strength of the paper to tighten the Introduction and ensure the justification for the present study is clear up front.</p><p>2) Figures within Figure 1 appear to be incorrectly referenced in the text. Figure 1E-F is referenced and said to show that TYLCV infection (acquired through diet) impairs visual and olfactory preference of insect vectors, similar to what is observed in Figure 1B-D (subsection “TYLCV reduces whitefly preference to virus-infected plant”). However, Figure 1E demonstrates that the reaction of infected whiteflies to plant odors slows as feeding time increases (subsection “TYLCV impairs whitefly host selection ability by dysfunctioning the nervous system” – this data appears to be incorrectly referenced as Figure 1G in the text).</p><p>3) Figure 1F and G demonstrate that whiteflies artificially infected with TYLCV through the diet demonstrate similar behavioral shifts as to what is observed in vectors that were infected with TYLCV from contact with infected plants…this is determined by the free-choice and odor preference behavioral tests (e.g., Figure 1B-C). However, Figure 1 does not include data on whether or not there are similar shifts in visual preference in artificially infected vectors as is observed in whiteflies that are infected via contact with plants. Were experiments performed looking at the effects of diet acquired TYLCV infection on visual preference as well? Or only free-choice and odor? If it wasn't assessed, why not? Also, data on visual preferences of vectors infected with mutant virus (mTYLCV) were not shown. Were these experiments performed?</p><p>4) The Western blots and demonstration of Caspase activation are not clear. In the text, it is stated that the functional caspase unit is a homodimer, and that a reduction in the presence of full length Caspase3b and an increase in the presence of the homodimer are indicative of apoptosis in whiteflies (subsection “TYLCV induces apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of whitefly”). While elevated immunoreactivity of the homodimer is evident, it appears marginal, and changes in full length Caspase 3b are more difficult to discern. It may help to quantitate these changes to aid in interpretation.</p><p>5) For experiments using the mutant virus mTYLCV, was it confirmed that the virus does not cross the gut barrier? For example, were viral genomes quantitated in different locations throughout the body (e.g., the head versus the gut) and compared between whiteflies infected with wildtype virus versus those infected with mutant virus? Are there any differences in viral replication between the two strains? If this is known, or if it has been demonstrated before that this specific mutation in the coat protein of TYLCV inhibits virus from crossing the gut barrier, adding the appropriate references would suffice.</p><p>6)The functional genetics analyses combined with (fluorescent) histological assessments look very convincing. We are assuming that the RT-QPCR data does too, though there is not enough information given about the reference genes used, their stability across samples and the efficiency of the primers. This makes it impossible to assess if the RT-QPCR data is valid because these are all things that influence the data presented and if the ΔCT method can be even applied. We are also not sure why the authors log transformed their RT-QPCR data. Is this perhaps a form of p-hacking? If the RT-QPCR data has been dealt with accordingly (which we assume for now) this data is nicely in line with the histology, behavior and functional gene assays.</p><p>7) The other aspect that is difficult to interpret were the immunodetection protein gels that would confirm caspase activity related to apoptosis. Those gels do not look convincing but it might be partly due to the explanation that the authors provided, which could be better stated.</p><p>8) The authors have not provided enough data and information with regards to their RNASeq experiment. Read size, number of reads, % coverage, number of DEGs and a supplementary file with DEGs does not seem to have been given. The authors should at least report their RNASeq stats. However, they have also not fully explored the dataset it seems, or given the reader more of an interpretation making this just &quot;a list of genes&quot; which is so often said of transcriptomics datasets while a more extensive analysis would make them useful for researchers besides those publishing them. At the moment, the RNASeq data feels more like an add on that doesn't have much to do with the manuscript because the authors mostly go by RT-QPCR finds. The work is pretty complete without the RNASeq data but it seems like this powerful data could be exploited more by doing for instance a WGCNA or PCA + loading plot analysis to get more from it.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56168.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a good amount of background in the Introduction, but it was a bit difficult to follow in terms of flow leading up to the rationale for the paper and the description of the findings.

Figure 1 has been replaced by a new version that contains the result of visual preference (acquired through diet, Figure 1G), and removes the data of responding experiment to Figure 1H. The relevant descriptions within manuscript have also been corrected. Here refers to: “Figure 1E-G” (subsection “TYLCV reduces whitefly preference to virus-infected plant”, last paragraph), “Figure 1H” and , “Figure 1I” (subsection “TYLCV impairs whitefly host selection ability by dysfunctioning the nervous system”, first paragraph), “Figure 1J”(see the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection), and the figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1F and G demonstrate that whiteflies artificially infected with TYLCV through the diet demonstrate similar behavioral shifts as to what is observed in vectors that were infected with TYLCV from contact with infected plants…this is determined by the free-choice and odor preference behavioral tests (e.g., Figure 1B-C).

We did not further determine the functions of caspases, NLRL4, and spaetzle1&amp;2 of whitefly by visual preference experiments.</p><p>The first reason is that we preferred olfactory preference as our main phenotype rather than visual preference in current study since the non-viruliferous whitefly preference to infected plant were dominantly affected by plant volatiles. A previous study found that TYLCV infection can suppress the repellent terpenes emission and increased plant attractiveness to whitefly (Fang et al., 2013). Besides, despite yellow leaf is one of the typical symptoms of TYLCV infection, it is difficult to quantify such changes during the virus infection and replication process. The second reason is that the visual experiments conducted with artificial yellow and green illuminations may not fully represent the natural visual difference between infected and uninfected host plants (i.e. a mild infection symptom might not be distinguishable enough). We expect our newly added Figure 1G is acceptable for this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The Western blots and demonstration of Caspase activation are not clear.

Reviewer #2 also mentioned that the result of Western Blots made reader confused. All the blotting in our study were performed in a non-reduced denaturing manner (already mentioned in the Materials and methods), which could not dissociate the polymer to monomer and allowed us to monitor the cleavage of caspase once upon apoptosis initiation.</p><p>Canonical effector caspase cleavage in model species has been well characterized and represents the initiation of apoptosis. Full length effector caspase can be cleaved by initiator caspase into three subunits including a short prodomain, a p10 domain subunit, and a p20 domain subunit. The p20 and p10 subunits closely associate with each other to form a caspase monomer, and then, two monomers combine into an active homodimer that execute the apoptosis activation (McIlwain et al., 2013; Riedl and Shi, 2004). It however remains unclear that Caspase3b of whitefly has the same/similar function with the mammals or <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, because whitefly loses many apoptosis-related genes.</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56168-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>In our study, inactive caspase3b existed as 49KDa monomer in whitefly (most effector caspases usually exist as homodimer), and the cleavage process is the same as the canonical manner (Figure 2E). Once apoptosis was induced by UV, cytoplasmic inactive caspase3b rapidly decreased in 5min, indicating the cleavage was initiated. Afterwards, the full-length inactive caspase3b recovered in 15-30min, and increased in 60-120min, because the transcriptional expression was induced. Cleaved p10 and monomer increased during apoptosis activation in 5-30min, and afterward, these monomers formed the active homodimer (60-120min) (Figure 2E). In our experiments, each protein sample was extracted from a mixture bio-sample which consistent of more than 100 whiteflies, and the status of virions acquisition of each individual whitefly could not be accurately sampled. In other words, the decrease of full length caspase3b, and increases of p10 and monomer, as well as the increases of active homodimer represented the apoptosis activation in whitefly respectively, but they displayed in different stages of caspase3b cleavage. Therefore, we need to determine the caspase3b cleavage by a time-course experiment.The revised paragraph can be found in the subsection “TYLCV induces apoptotic neurodegeneration in the brain of whitefly”: “Canonical effector caspase cleavage in model species has been well characterized and represents the initiation of apoptosis. […] These results demonstrated that TYLCV virions directly induced caspase3b cleavage in whitefly (Figure 2F).”</p><p>We also noticed that our most concerning data is Figure 2F (diet feeding treatment), and here, another two replicates (different bio-samples) of this treatment were attached. Both p10 and monomer increased in replicate 2, while only monomer increased in replicate 3 and no significant change was shown among homodimer bands. Considering the individual variations in virion acquisition, the quantification of the mixture samples of whiteflies may not be helpful to detect the differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) For experiments using the mutant virus mTYLCV, was it confirmed that the virus does not cross the gut barrier?

A 141 aa fragment (aa 82-222) of TYLCV CP region was replaced with a 140 aa fragment (aa 82-221) of the PaLCuCNV CP region (Wei et al., 2017). Guo et al. found that MED whitefly (the same biotype used in our experiments) had similar TYLCV acquisition ability with MEAM1 whitefly (Figure 1A in Guo et al., 2018), but acquired less mTYLCV than MEAM1 (Figure 7B in Guo et al., 2018). TYLCV was detected in both midgut (MG) and hemolymph (HL) of MED whitefly (Figure 5D and E in Guo et al., 2018). Although mTYLCV can also be detected in the midgut of MED whitefly, it was barely detected in hemolymph (Figure 8D and E in Guo et al., 2018). We rewrote this part: “The mTYLCV, a coat protein mutant of TYLCV in which a partial sequence of CP was replaced by the Papaya leaf curl China virus and hardly penetrated the whitefly gut barrier, was used to determine whether the gut barrier could prevent the impairment of host preference of viruliferous whitefly (Guo et al., 2018; Wei et al., 2017).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6)The functional genetics analyses combined with (fluorescent) histological assessments look very convincing.

Actually, we did not transform our QPCR data and the sentence was removed. All CT values were analyzed by relative quantification with the 2<sup>-ΔΔCT</sup> method, and the replication numbers of the samples in each treatment were annotated in each figure legend. We believed that the ΔCT method was appropriate, because most of our QPCR results were in agreement with our transcriptome data (the excel files of differently expressed genes and all genes FKPM named Supplementary file 2 and Supplementary file 3 were attached in the revised manuscript). We therefore did not further determine the primer efficiency because many of the primers were described in previous documentations, and others were designed by the software Primer Premier 6 with appropriate parameters. The availability of all primers had also been tested in preliminary experiments. (See subsection “PCR and quantitative real-time PCR).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The other aspect that is difficult to interpret were the immunodetection protein gels that would confirm caspase activity related to apoptosis.
