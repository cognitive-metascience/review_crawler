Invasion involves discharge of rhoptries, specialized secretory organelles. Once intracellular, parasites induce increased nutrient uptake by generating new permeability pathways (NPP) including a <italic>Plasmodium</italic> surface anion channel (PSAC). RhopH1/Clag3, one member of the three-protein RhopH complex, is important for PSAC/NPP activity. However, the roles of the other members of the RhopH complex in PSAC/NPP establishment are unknown and it is unclear whether any of the RhopH proteins play a role in invasion. Here we demonstrate that RhopH3, the smallest component of the complex, is essential for parasite survival. Conditional truncation of RhopH3 substantially reduces invasive capacity. Those mutant parasites that do invade are defective in nutrient import and die. Our results identify a dual role for RhopH3 that links erythrocyte invasion to formation of the PSAC/NPP essential for parasite survival within host erythrocytes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23239.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23239.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23239.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Malaria is a life-threatening disease that affects millions of people around the world. The parasites that cause malaria have a complex life cycle that involves infecting both mosquitoes and mammals, including humans. In humans, the parasites spend part of their life cycle inside red blood cells, which causes the symptoms of the disease. In order to survive and multiply, malaria parasites need to make the red blood cell more permeable so that it can absorb nutrients from the blood stream and get rid of the toxic waste products they generate.</p><p>It remains unclear how the parasites do this, but previous research has shown that the parasites produce channel-like proteins that make red blood cells more permeable to nutrients. One of the proteins involved in this process forms part of a complex with two other proteins, called RhopH2 and RhopH3. It is not known what these other two proteins do, and whether they are necessary for creating the new nutrient channels.</p><p>Sherling et al. studied the RhopH3 protein to see if it is required to make red blood cells more permeable. The experiments used a genetically modified version of the parasite, in which RhopH3 no longer interacted with the two other proteins. The findings show that RhopH3 has two important roles: first, parasites need it to invade the red blood cells, and second, parasites cannot get nutrients into the red blood cell without RhopH3.</p><p>Most antimalarial drugs work by preventing parasite replication in red blood cells, but parasites are becoming increasingly resistant to these drugs. Understanding which proteins allow parasites to invade and grow within blood cells will further the development of new malaria medication. The next step will be to understand the molecular mechanisms by which RhopH3 promotes invasion and subsequently facilitates nutrient uptake, and will help researchers to explore its potential as a drug target.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.23239.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.23239.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group

the causative agents of malaria, a disease that claims nearly 600,000 lives each year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">WHO, 2014</xref>). Of the five <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species that infect humans, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> is responsible for nearly all the mortality associated with malaria. The disease is the result of asexual replication of the parasite in erythrocytes. For approximately the first half of the 48 hour <italic>P. falciparum</italic> intraerythrocytic life cycle, the parasite exists in a mononuclear trophozoite form (the earliest stages of which are generally referred to as ring stages), during which the parasite grows rapidly. During this phase, <italic>P. falciparum</italic>-infected erythrocytes gain the capacity to adhere to host vascular endothelium, a process that depends on the export of parasite proteins to form adhesive structures called knobs at the host erythrocyte surface. Nuclear division then commences, initiating differentiation into a schizont (a process called schizogony). This multinucleated form eventually undergoes segmentation to form invasive merozoites that egress upon rupture of the infected erythrocyte to invade new erythrocytes.</p><p>Egress and erythrocyte invasion involves the regulated discharge of several sets of apical merozoite secretory organelles that are unique to apicomplexan parasites. The largest of these organelles, called rhoptries, contain several proteins involved in adhesion to the host cell. Rhoptries are also thought to mediate formation of the nascent parasitophorous vacuole (PV), a membranous compartment that surrounds the parasite after entry has been completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carruthers and Sibley, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the importance of rhoptries in invasion and subsequent host cell remodeling, a detailed understanding of the function of many rhoptry proteins is lacking. Rhoptries comprise at least two subdomains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>) referred to as the rhoptry neck and the rhoptry bulb. The contents of these subdomains likely mediate different functions, as reflected by evidence suggesting that they are released sequentially during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zuccala et al., 2012</xref>). Proteins of the rhoptry neck are well conserved between <italic>Plasmodium spp.</italic> and the related apicomplexan parasite <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic>, suggesting conserved functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Proellocks et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, proteins of the rhoptry bulb appear to be genus-specific, perhaps reflecting functions unique to each parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>). A function for several <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> rhoptry bulb proteins has been proposed, such as a role for a protein called RAMA in transport of proteins to the rhoptry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Richard et al., 2009</xref>), but the inability to produce mutants lacking these proteins has precluded conclusive assignments of function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kats et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, the molecular functions of most rhoptry proteins remain unknown.</p><p>One component of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> rhoptry bulb that has received particular attention is the so-called high molecular weight (HMW) rhoptry or RhopH complex, which consists of three proteins called RhopH1/Clag, RhopH2, and RhopH3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holder et al., 1985a</xref>). Whilst RhopH2 and RhopH3 are each encoded by single-copy genes, RhopH1/Clag, the largest component of the complex, exists in five isotypes encoded by separate genes entitled <italic>clag2</italic>, <italic>clag3.1</italic>, <italic>clag3.2</italic>, <italic>clag8</italic> and <italic>clag9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaneko et al., 2001</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">2005</xref>). RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2 are nearly identical proteins that are expressed in a mutually exclusive manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comeaux et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cortés et al., 2007</xref>). Each RhopH complex contains only one form of RhopH1/Clag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kaneko et al., 2005</xref>), so each parasite has the potential to produce four different RhopH complexes, differentiated by the particular RhopH1/Clag isotype bound. All members of the RhopH complex are expressed late in the intraerythrocytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 1988</xref>). The complex is then released during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2003</xref>) and inserted into the nascent PV membrane (PVM) soon after parasite entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ling et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sam-Yellowe et al., 1988</xref>).</p><p>Genetic and chemical genetic investigation has revealed a role for the RhopH1/Clag3 proteins in the function of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> surface anion channel (PSAC), a new permeability pathway (NPP) induced in host erythrocytes following parasite entry and involved in nutrient acquisition by the intracellular parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguitragool et al., 2011</xref>). Pharmacological inhibition of RhopH1/Clag3.2 function was found to block PSAC/NPP activity, and selection for drug-resistant mutants revealed that part of the protein is exposed at the surface of the erythrocyte and that it may form the channel itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguitragool et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>). However, parasites that do not produce either RhopH1/Clag3.1 or RhopH1/Clag3.2 display only a small growth disadvantage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comeaux et al., 2011</xref>) and inhibition of the function of these proteins has only a small effect on parasite growth rates <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>). Parasites lacking RhopH1/Clag9 are viable, and an early report suggested that loss of the <italic>clag9</italic> gene resulted in loss of binding to CD36 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Trenholme et al., 2000</xref>). However, this has been disputed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nacer et al., 2011</xref>), as a subsequent study identified another gene closely linked to the <italic>clag9</italic> gene that is important for CD36 binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nacer et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, whilst the function of RhopH1/Clag9 remains to be determined, like RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag 3.2, it is not essential. There are no reports describing a deletion, or attempted deletion, of <italic>clag2</italic> or <italic>clag8</italic>.</p><p>Much less is known of the function of the RhopH2 and RhopH3 components of the complex. There is no report of attempted disruption of the <italic>rhopH2</italic> gene, but the <italic>rhopH3</italic> gene is refractory to deletion in the haploid blood stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowman et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting an essential role. Hints that this might include a function in invasion derive from studies showing that antibodies to RhopH3 can inhibit invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cooper et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doury et al., 1994</xref>). However, whether RhopH3 plays other essential roles that involve all forms of the RhopH complex is unknown.</p><p>Here we use a conditional mutagenesis approach to modify the <italic>rhopH3</italic> gene in a manner that prevents formation of the RhopH complex. The resulting mutant parasites show two distinct phenotypes: a significant decrease in the level of erythrocyte invasion and a complete block in intracellular development at the trophozoite stage. Our findings reveal that RhopH3 and the RhopH complex have essential roles in two distinct stages of the erythrocytic lifecycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Efficient conditional truncation of the <italic>rhopH3</italic> gene</title><p>Previous attempts to disrupt the <italic>P. falciparum rhopH3</italic> gene using conventional genetic techniques were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cowman et al., 2000</xref>), suggesting an indispensable role in asexual blood stages. To gain insights into this role we therefore adopted the DiCre conditional recombinase system recently adapted to <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2013</xref>) to examine the consequences of functional inactivation of RhopH3. For this, we used Cas9-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ghorbal et al., 2014</xref>) to introduce synthetic introns containing <italic>loxP</italic> sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jones et al., 2016</xref>) into the <italic>rhopH3</italic> gene such that they flanked an internal region spanning exons 4–6, the region of the gene that shows the highest level of conservation across <italic>Plasmodium rhopH3</italic> orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Subsequent limiting dilution cloning of the modified parasites resulted in the isolation of parasite clones <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> 5F5 and <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> 4B11, which were derived from independent transfections using different guide RNAs. Modification of the native <italic>rhopH3</italic> locus in the expected fashion was confirmed in both parasite clones by diagnostic PCR and Southern blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Upon splicing of this intron exons 3 and 7 are placed in frame, producing a modified RhopH3 gene product (called RhopH3△4–6) that retains wild type N-terminal and C-terminal segments but lacks residues encoded by exons 4–6. Extracts of the rapamycin-treated and control parasites were analyzed by immunoblot ~44 hr following treatment using antibody anti-Ag-44, which recognizes an epitope within the C-terminal segment of RhopH3 encoded by exon 7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coppel et al., 1987</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, rapamycin treatment produced the expected change in mass, converting the ~110 kDa wild type RhopH3 to a ~70 kDa RhopH3△4–6 product. This conversion was highly efficient, with no residual full-length protein detected in the rapamycin-treated schizonts.

Immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) showed that, as expected, RhopH3 colocalized with the rhoptry marker RAP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bushell et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crewther et al., 1990</xref>) in mature schizonts of control <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

To evaluate the effects of RhopH3 modification and mistrafficking on longer-term parasite viability, we first exploited a recently developed assay in which parasite replication is assessed in 96-well microplates over a period of 5 – 7 erythrocytic cycles by visualization of the localized lysis of host erythrocytes in static cultures in 96-well microplates. Under these conditions, successful parasite growth results in formation of microscopically discernible zones of clearance of erythrocytes referred to as plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thomas et al., 2016</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, in three separate assays DMSO-treated <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> parasites seeded at ~10 parasites per well produced plaques in nearly every well, with a mean average of ~8 plaques per well for clone 5F5 and ~5 plaques per well for clone 4B11 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Cultures of the parental 1G5DC parasites as well as the DiCre-defective RhopH3 NE clone were similarly treated and monitored in parallel. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, whilst replication of the 1G5DC and RhopH3 NE parasites was unaffected by rapamycin treatment, the rapamycin-treated 5F5 and 4B11 clones showed a dramatic decrease in growth rate. However in both clones the appearance of replicating parasites was evident by cycle 3, suggesting that these might correspond to a minor population of normally-replicating non-excised parasites. Diagnostic PCR analysis of the 5F5 culture supported this notion. At the end of cycle 1, PCR using primers that distinguish between the excised and non-excised locus showed the expected highly efficient excision of the floxed <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> sequence in the rapamycin-treated culture, with the non-excised locus undetectable. However, periodic examination of the parasites by diagnostic PCR over the ensuing 6 erythrocytic cycles showed a time-dependent increase in the proportion of non-excised parasites in the rapamycin-treated culture, suggesting that the initially undetectable population of non-excised parasites gradually overgrew the cultures. This occurred likely as a result of a selective advantage conferred on them by the replication defect displayed by the RhopH3△4–6 parasites. By cycle 5, the excised locus was hardly detectable in the rapamycin-treated culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Together with the results of the plaque assay, these results allowed us to conclude that truncation of RhopH3 results in complete loss of long-term parasite viability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Loss of the RhopH complex leads to an invasion defect</title><p>The severe growth defect displayed in the plaque and growth assays could result from an inability of mutant parasites to egress from the host erythrocyte, a block in invasion, or a developmental arrest during intracellular growth.

The PSAC/NPP is also responsible for the permeability of parasite-infected erythrocytes to the alcohol sugar sorbitol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguitragool et al., 2011</xref>), leading to the capacity of sorbitol solutions to mediate osmotic lysis of infected erythrocytes.

This compound is excluded from uninfected erythrocytes but is taken up by infected erythrocytes and converted to fluorescent protoporphyrin IX (PPIX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sigala et al., 2015</xref>). Import of 5-ALA has previously been shown to be sensitive to furosemide, a small molecule inhibitor of PSAC/NPP, and is also blocked upon downregulation of parasite export and PSAC/NPP activity in transgenic <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sigala et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Staines et al., 2004</xref>).

This block in development is a lethal event; no parasites carrying the mutant form of the <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> gene were recovered in a plaque assay and parasites with an intact <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> gene quickly outgrew the mutant parasites after rapamycin treatment. These results represent the first published evidence that RhopH3 is essential and mark the first time a rhoptry protein has been shown to have two separate, seemingly unrelated functions at different stages of the erythrocytic life cycle. RhopH3 is also the first rhoptry bulb protein to be directly assigned a role in invasion; other rhoptry proteins previously experimentally implicated in invasion are located in the rhoptry neck. The release of rhoptry neck proteins is considered the step at which the parasite commits to host cell entry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Srinivasan et al., 2011</xref>), so the discovery of an important invasion factor that is presumably released later in the invasion pathway is important.</p><p>Whilst it was surprising that loss of the function of the RhopH complex leads to two different, seemingly unrelated, phenotypes, previous results had hinted at a role for RhopH3 and the complex in both processes. RhopH3, and proteolytic fragments of RhopH3, can bind to erythrocytes and to liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sam-Yellowe and Perkins, 1990</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">1991</xref>). This appears to occur even in the absence of other members of the RhopH complex, indicating that, for its role in invasion, RhopH3 may not require the function of the other proteins of the complex. Further supporting a role for RhopH3 in invasion is the finding that anti-RhopH3 antibodies can block invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doury et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sam-Yellowe and Perkins, 1991</xref>). Nonetheless it is curious that ~50% of the parasites still enter the erythrocyte in the absence of full-length RhopH3. RhopH3△4–6 may retain sufficient activity in 50% of the parasites to allow invasion to take place. Alternatively, these parasites could use a RhopH3-independent pathway. Invasion by <italic>P. falciparum</italic> relies on several redundant pathways and there is precedent for a partial reduction of invasion by mutant parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tham et al., 2012</xref>). It will be of interest to determine whether invasion pathways that are currently thought to be redundant become essential in the absence of wild type RhopH3. A third possibility is that RhopH3 is involved in a post-invasion process. However, the invasion assay used here would detect all intracellular parasites that have completed invasion. We therefore favor the interpretation that the observed decrease in the number of newly invaded <italic>rhopH3-loxP</italic> parasites indicates that the invasion process is not completed in the mutants.</p><p>The other phenotype displayed by the RhopH3△4–6 mutants, the block in development during the early trophozoite stage, is likely the result of a defect in nutrient intake owing to improper trafficking ablating the function of RhopH1/Clag. The loss of sorbitol sensitivity of erythrocytes infected with the RhopH3△4–6 mutants and their impermeability to 5-ALA indicate that RhopH1/Clag3.1 (the RhopH1/Clag3 isotype expressed in these 3D7-derived parasites) and RhopH1/Clag3.2 are not functioning at the erythrocyte surface. RhopH1/Clag3 proteins are transported to the erythrocyte surface in a PEXEL-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>) and are exposed on the surface of the erythrocyte (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nguitragool et al., 2014</xref>), but the mechanism by which these proteins are transported from the rhoptry, beyond the PVM and to the erythrocyte plasma membrane is unknown. RhopH3 and RhopH2 are have been detected in the PVM immediately after invasion, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sam-Yellowe et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hiller et al., 2003</xref>), as well as in the erythrocyte at later developmental stages of the intraerythrocytic parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vincensini et al., 2008</xref>). It is likely that mislocalization of RhopH3△4–6 in merozoites prevents the proper, or properly timed, release of the complex during invasion and prevents RhopH1/Clag from being delivered to its correct location. As the RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2 in the trophozoite stage parasite derives entirely from protein that is introduced during invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ling et al., 2003</xref>), mislocalization at the merozoite stage likely cannot be corrected by additional subsequent protein synthesis.</p><p>The complete arrest in development of the RhopH3△4–6 mutants in the cycle following gene modification (cycle 2) also provides insight into the potential roles of the RhopH1/Clag proteins. Little is known about these proteins other than the importance of the RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2 proteins in the PSAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nguitragool et al., 2011</xref>). However, chemical inhibition of RhopH1/Clag3.2 function and PSAC activity in parasites cultured in rich medium (RPMI 1640, the same medium used in this study) leads to only a small decrease in parasite viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, parasites that do not produce RhopH1/Clag3.1 or RhopH1/Clag3.2 have only a minimal growth disadvantage compared to wild type parasites in a competition assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comeaux et al., 2011</xref>). Parasites lacking RhopH1/Clag9 have no apparent growth phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> (the gene is absent from the D10 and T9-96 laboratory strains that lack part of chromosome 9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaiyaroj et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Day et al., 1993</xref>). In contrast, parasites lacking RhopH1/Clag2 or RhopH1/Clag8 have not been reported so the essentiality of these proteins is unknown. We speculate that the RhopH3△4–6 mutants very likely transport none of the RhopH1/Clag proteins to the erythrocyte surface. If so, the observed growth phenotype is therefore essentially that of a disruption of all the <italic>clag</italic> genes. The striking growth phenotype of this mutant is in stark contrast to the mild phenotype of RhopH1/Clag3.2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>) or the absence of both the RhopH1/Clag3 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comeaux et al., 2011</xref>) when the parasites are grown in RPMI. This may indicate that RhopH1/Clag2 and RhopH1/Clag8 play important roles in nutrient uptake as well, as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pillai et al., 2012</xref>), and that RhopH complexes containing several different RhopH1/Clag proteins together mediate the uptake of the nutrients required for parasite growth in the infected erythrocyte. Interestingly, most <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species encode fewer RhopH1/Clag proteins than <italic>P. falciparum</italic>; some species possess only two <italic>clag</italic> genes, comprising a <italic>clag9</italic> orthologue and a second orthologue more closely related to the other <italic>P. falciparum clag</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Counihan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaneko et al., 2001</xref>). In conclusion, our results raise the intriguing possibility that, in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, other RhopH1/Clag proteins, in addition to RhopH1/Clag3.1 and RhopH1/Clag3.2, function in nutrient import.</p><p>Together the results presented in this study provide new insights into the role of the rhoptry in the malarial blood stages and reveal that rhoptry proteins can function in multiple, distinct processes.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Michael Marletta (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Dominique Soldati-Favre (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p><italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> modifies host erythrocytes to render them permeable to nutrient uptake. The mechanisms underlying formation of plasmodial surface anion channel /permeability pathways (PSAC/NPP) are not fully understood. Using an elegant inducible Cre-lox approach to truncate RhopH3, Sherling et al. show that RhopH3 plays a critical role during <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> growth inside erythrocytes, and provide data supporting a role of the RhopH complex in the function of NPPs.</p><p>First, the authors showed that truncation of RhopH3 led to mis-targeting of other members of the RhopH complex but that RhopH1 and RhopH2 can still interact with each other. These parasites mutants were not defective in egress but partially affected in their ability to invade new host cells. Examination of these mutants in the second cycle of infection clearly uncovered a block in intraerythrocytic development. Importantly, the export of parasite proteins into the host cell and Maurer's cleft formation were not altered in the erythrocytes infected with parasites lacking full-length RhopH3 however they became resistant to sorbitol lysis, consistent with a lack of NPP activity, and showed an impairment in the update of 5-aminolevulinc acid.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The manuscript is clearly written. The study is very well performed, and provides novel and important insights into the function of a critical protein complex involved in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> growth inside erythrocytes. However, some issues have been raised by the three reviewers and in order to improve the manuscript, the authors should address a number of points listed below. In particular, the study provides genetic evidence supporting a role of the RhopH complex in NPP function, but evidence supporting a role during invasion is much weaker.</p><p>1) The authors claim that RhopH3 mutants are impaired during invasion. However, there is not sufficient direct evidence to support this conclusion. Invasion was analyzed 48 hours after addition of fresh erythrocytes to rapamycin-treated trophozoites, thus during cycle 2. The observed decrease in infection may be a consequence of growth arrest or parasite death (due to nutrient depletion) during the 48h window rather than reduced invasion. The assay used to assess invasion efficiency is a nice one but it does not discriminate with an indirect invasion defect. The authors should use live cell microscopy (as they did to investigate egress) to look at the ability of the egressed parasites to invade new erythrocytes.</p><p>2) The floxed parasites need to be better characterized. Are the levels of RhopH3 (and other Rhop) proteins in floxed parasites normal in comparison to parental WT? Do these parasites grow normally in the absence of rapamycin treatment?</p><p>Also, the fate of RhopH components, including RhopH3 itself full length versus truncated over the course of rapamycin treatment should be documented for correct interpretation of the phenotypic assays. In particular, at end of cycle 1 (egress/invasion assays) or cycle 2 (electron microscopy), do parasites express truncated RhopH3 only? Is truncated RhopH3 (and other component of RhopH) complex detectable in extracellular merozoites after treatment with rapamycin?</p><p>3) The wording around the defect in nutrient import (in the Abstract and in the relevant Results heading (&quot;Import pathways are not functional…&quot;) is too strong and too general, given that only sorbitol entry and 5-ALA entry were examined, using indirect methods. It would be relevant to know if RhopH3Δ4-6 are defective in the uptake of isoleucine. Measuring the uptake of radiolabelled isoleucine by erythrocytes infected with the different parasite lines would be ideal and would certainly strengthen the paper. Alternatively, the authors should use more cautious wording (e.g. that their results are consistent with a defect in the activity of the NPPs).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.23239.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>The manuscript is clearly written.

The authors should use live cell microscopy (as they did to investigate egress) to look at the ability of the egressed parasites to invade new erythrocytes.</italic> </p><p>With the benefit of hindsight, we agree that the assay as originally performed to examine invasion efficiency in the RhopH3 mutant parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref> in the original manuscript) was not optimal for the reasons given above. This issue has now been redressed in the revised manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) by including a more ‘standard’ invasion assay, in which mature synchronous schizonts of rapamycin-treated or control RhopH3 mutants were purified, added to fresh red blood cells, then parasitaemia levels of newly invaded ring stage parasites determined just 4 h later. This method measures the efficiency of new ring formation over a very short period, and is therefore much more suitable for determining invasion efficiency, independent of the capacity of the intraerythrocytic parasites to subsequently develop. Note that these revisions have also required some minor textual changes to the main text (subsection “Loss of the RhopH complex leads to an invasion defect”, last paragraph) and to the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> legend.</p><p>We respectfully suggest that the reviewers’ suggestion to use live cell microscopy to determine the efficiency of invasion is unsuitable for this purpose. We already know that the parasites form rings at the beginning of cycle 2, proving that some of them (~50%) do successfully invade. However, the technical challenges of imaging invasion in real time means that very few individual invasion events can be monitored per egress event (see for example Gilson and Crabb Int J Parasitol 39:91-96, 2009), with the result that it is not a suitable approach for <italic>quantifying</italic> invasion efficiency.</p><p><italic>2) The floxed parasites need to be better characterized. Are the levels of RhopH3 (and other Rhop) proteins in floxed parasites normal in comparison to parental WT? Do these parasites grow normally in the absence of rapamycin treatment?</italic> </p><p>We accept that this issue was not formally addressed in the original manuscript. The revised manuscript now contains an additional supplementary figure (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) showing that; (1) the non-rapamycin-treated 5F5 and 4B11 parasites produce wild type levels of RhopH3 and RhopH1; and (2) that they grow normally, as compared to the parental 1G5DC parasites. This confirms that floxing the <italic>rhopH3</italic> gene did not detectably affect RhopH3 expression, nor impact on parasite viability.</p><p><italic>Also, the fate of RhopH components, including RhopH3 itself full length versus truncated over the course of rapamycin treatment should be documented for correct interpretation of the phenotypic assays. In particular, at end of cycle 1 (egress/invasion assays) or cycle 2 (electron microscopy), do parasites express truncated RhopH3 only?</italic> </p><p>We realize that in our original manuscript, the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> was not explicit enough. This text has now been amended to make it clear that only truncated RhopH3 was detectable by the end of cycle 1 in schizonts of rapamycin-treated parasites. Since the cycle 2 parasites were all derived from the cycle 1 schizonts, we assume that the cycle 2 parasites also expressed exclusively truncated RhopH3. Note that this could not be formally proven by Western blot since the cycle 2 parasites never reached schizont stage (at which RhopH3 levels are maximal); however, the prominent phenotype displayed by the cycle 2 parasites is consistent with them expressing the mutant RhopH3 as expected.</p><p><italic>Is truncated RhopH3 (and other component of RhopH) complex detectable in extracellular merozoites after treatment with rapamycin?</italic> </p><p>We appreciate that this is a pertinent question, since the mislocalisation induced by truncation of RhopH3 could potentially result in merozoites that entirely lack the RhopH proteins. To address this, we have now performed immunofluorescence analysis of naturally egressed merozoites of the RhopH3 mutants. The results, showing mislocalisation and loss of RhopH3 from many free merozoites, have now been appended to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) to produce a modified form of that figure in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) The wording around the defect in nutrient import (in the Abstract and in the relevant Results heading (&quot;Import pathways are not functional…&quot;) is too strong and too general, given that only sorbitol entry and 5-ALA entry were examined, using indirect methods. It would be relevant to know if RhopH3Δ4-6 are defective in the uptake of isoleucine. Measuring the uptake of radiolabelled isoleucine by erythrocytes infected with the different parasite lines would be ideal and would certainly strengthen the paper. Alternatively, the authors should use more cautious wording (e.g. that their results are consistent with a defect in the activity of the NPPs).</italic> </p><p>We entirely accept the reviewers’ point, and have now modified the text of this subtitle to: ‘Import pathways are defective in rhopH3 mutant parasites’. We trust that this is acceptable.</p></body></sub-article></article>
