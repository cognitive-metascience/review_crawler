It is presumed that these precursors integrate cortical networks where they act as sensors of neuronal activity. We show that NG2 cells of the developing somatosensory cortex form a transient and structured synaptic network with interneurons that follows its own rules of connectivity. Fast-spiking interneurons, highly connected to NG2 cells, target proximal subcellular domains containing GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors with γ2 subunits. Conversely, non-fast-spiking interneurons, poorly connected with these progenitors, target distal sites lacking this subunit. In the network, interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity maps exhibit a local spatial arrangement reflecting innervation only by the nearest interneurons. This microcircuit architecture shows a connectivity peak at PN10, coinciding with a switch to massive oligodendrocyte differentiation. Hence, GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells is temporally and spatially regulated from the subcellular to the network level in coordination with the onset of oligodendrogenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06953.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06953.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06953.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Neurons are outnumbered in the brain by cells called glial cells. The brain contains various types of glial cells that perform a range of different jobs, including the supply of nutrients and the removal of dead neurons. The role of glial cells called oligodendrocytes is to produce a material called myelin: this is an electrical insulator that, when wrapped around a neuron, increases the speed at which electrical impulses can travel through the nervous system.</p><p>Neurons communicate with one another through specialized junctions called synapses, and at one time it was thought that only neurons could form synapses in the brain. However, this view had to be revised when researchers discovered synapses between neurons and glial cells called NG2 cells, which go on to become oligodendrocytes. These neuron-NG2 cell synapses have a lot in common with neuron–neuron synapses, but much less is known about them.</p><p>Orduz, Maldonado et al. have now examined these synapses in unprecedented detail by analyzing individual synapses between a type of neuron called an interneuron and an NG2 cell in mice aged only a few weeks. Interneurons can be divided into two major classes based on how quickly they fire, and Orduz, Maldonado et al. show that both types of interneuron form synapses with NG2 cells. However, these two types of interneuron establish synapses on different parts of the NG2 cell, and these synapses involve different receptor proteins.</p><p>Together, the synapses give rise to a local interneuron-NG2 cell network that reaches a peak of activity roughly two weeks after birth, after which the network is disassembled. This period of peak activity is accompanied by a sudden increase in the maturation of NG2 cells into oligodendrocytes. Further experiments are needed to test the possibility that activity in the interneuron-NG2 cell network acts as the trigger for the NG2 cells to turn into oligodendrocytes, which then supply myelin for the developing brain.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06953.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06953.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>interneuron</kwd><kwd>NG2 cell</kwd><kwd>synapse</kwd><kwd>GABAergic transmission</kwd><kwd>cortical development</kwd><kwd>paired-recording</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R14193KK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angulo</surname><given-names>Maria Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federation pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R13227KK</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Angulo</surname><given-names>Maria Cecilia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ecole des Neurosciences de Paris</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maldonado</surname><given-names>Paloma P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Nerf ile de France</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orduz</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Federation pour la Recherche sur le Cerveau and Rotary Club</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emiliani</surname><given-names>Valentina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During the second postnatal week, a temporary circuit made up of specific types of neurons plus the precursors of oligodendrocytes is established in the brain, and may promote the maturation of oligodendrocytes in preparation for myelination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The discovery of bona fide synapses formed on non-neuronal NG2-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergles et al., 2000</xref>), the progenitors of myelinating oligodendrocytes, has challenged the dogma that synapses are a unique feature of neurons in the central nervous system. Since then, the existence of functional synapses between neurons and NG2 cells is recognized as a major physiological feature of these cells throughout the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maldonado and Angulo, 2014</xref>). In the somatosensory cortex, NG2 cells receive a major synaptic input from local GABAergic interneurons that disappears after the second postnatal (PN) week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vélez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>). Cortical NG2 cells are, therefore, believed to be transiently embedded in GABAergic microcircuits at a period known to undergo oligodendrocyte differentiation in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baracskay et al., 2002</xref>). However, while the connectivity patterns between neocortical interneurons and their neuronal partners begin to be elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>), the rules governing the GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells in the network are elusive.</p><p>Cortical GABAergic interneurons are one of the most heterogeneous populations of neurons in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cauli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Petilla Interneuron Nomenclature Group et al., 2008</xref>). Their diversity has been a matter of intense investigation for several decades and is known to impact synaptic signaling and computational capacities of neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Klausberger and Somogyi, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fishell and Rudy, 2011</xref>). Different types of interneurons target specific subcellular compartments of their postsynaptic neuron. Such compartmentalization creates a specific distribution of channels, receptors, and signaling mechanisms and allows for an effective regulation of synaptic integration, plasticity, and spiking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). For instance, it has been observed that the localization of different GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs) in neocortical pyramidal neurons is input-specific since presynaptic parvalbumin (PV)-positive, fast-spiking cells innervate proximal postsynaptic sites with GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs-containing α1 subunits, whereas bitufted interneurons contact postsynaptic sites with GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs-containing α5 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Thomson, 2008</xref>). At a higher level, the connectivity patterns of neocortical interneurons in the network also appear to be highly specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). PV-positive interneurons strongly inhibit one another but provide little inhibition to other subtypes of interneurons, whereas somatostatin-positive interneurons strongly inhibit all other interneurons but are poorly interconnected with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeffer et al., 2013</xref>). Despite the existence of specific connectivity patterns among interneurons, this heterogeneous cell population carves out unspecific and dense connections with pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Packer et al., 2014</xref>). Hence, the connectivity of interneurons cannot be generalized and categorized in a simple way.</p><p>Is interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity governed by any specific rule? Our knowledge of NG2 cell synaptic physiology and connectivity is still very limited because it derives exclusively from studies based on spontaneous synaptic activity or on averaged synaptic currents generated by the stimulation of unidentified neurons. No information exists on the identity of presynaptic inputs impinging on NG2 cells, the dynamics of their individual synapses, and their microcircuit architectures.</p><p>Here, we investigate the properties of unitary interneuron-NG2 cell connections during the critical period of NG2 cell differentiation in the somatosensory cortex of Slc32a1-Venus;Cspg4-DsRed transgenic mice (hereafter called VGAT-Venus;NG2-DsRed mice). By combining immunohistochemistry, paired recordings, and holographic photolysis for circuit mapping, our results reveal that interneuron-NG2 cell connections in the developing neocortex form a transient and organized local network that is functional only during the most critical days of cortical oligodendrogenesis. A local microcircuit architecture with interneuron-NG2 cell intersomatic distances never exceeding 70 µm is accompanied with a specific subcellular arrangement of inputs from fast-spiking interneurons (FSIs) and from non-fast-spiking interneurons (NFSIs). These two classes of interneurons target different segregated postsynaptic domains containing distinct GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs. In conclusion, these progenitors form their own structured network with interneurons whose properties are temporally and spatially regulated in concordance with the onset of oligodendrocyte differentiation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FSIs are highly connected to NG2 cells</title><p>To test whether NG2 cells are wired by interneurons in a specific manner, we searched for presynaptic and postsynaptic principles governing individual interneuron-NG2 cell synapses. We performed paired recordings between layer V Venus<sup>+</sup> interneurons and DsRed<sup>+</sup> NG2 cells in acute somatosensory cortical slices of VGAT-Venus;NG2-DsRed mice from PN8 to PN13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1A—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Paired recordings allowed us to characterize the action potential firing behavior of the interneuron, the characteristic conductance profile of the NG2 cell, and the specific synaptic properties of the connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1A—figure supplement 1B–G</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). In 38 out of 147 pairs, action currents elicited in presynaptic interneurons induced inward postsynaptic currents (PSCs) sensitive to the GABA<sub>A</sub>R antagonist SR95531 in NG2 cells recorded with a CsCl-based intracellular solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1A—figure supplement 1D</xref>). All unitary connections displayed currents with small amplitudes and showed paired-pulse depression without recovery within 250 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1A—figure supplement 1D–G</xref>).</p><p>FSIs and NFSIs can be distinguished by their firing properties even if they have not attained maturity at this developmental stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daw et al., 2007</xref>). To investigate the identity of recorded interneurons in all tested pairs, we analyzed nineteen different electrophysiological parameters in current-clamp mode (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). FSIs were primarily distinguished from NFSIs by their narrow action potential waveforms with profound after-hyperpolarizations (AHPs), a negligible spike broadening and spike amplitude reduction during trains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,D,E</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cauli et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Daw et al., 2007</xref>). Other seven parameters were also statistically different between FSIs and NFSIs and clearly separated these neurons in two distinct groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The identity of FSIs was further confirmed by the expression of PV in biocytin-labeled interneurons, a reliable marker for this cell class that was absent in NFSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1C—figure supplement 2</xref>). As expected for these two classes of interneurons, FSIs appeared as a relatively homogeneous population with restricted distributions of the main discriminative parameters, whereas NFSIs encompassed different subtypes as revealed by the large distribution of their electrophysiological values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1E—figure supplement 3A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cauli et al., 1997</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06953.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FSIs are highly connected to NG2 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Paired recording between a presynaptic fast-spiking interneuron (FSI) and a NG2 cell.

Firing frequency was calculated for the entire pulse as the number of spikes divided by the pulse duration (F<sub>total</sub>). Three instantaneous discharge frequencies were also calculated: (1) between the first pair of spikes (F<sub>initial</sub>); (2) at 200 ms from the beginning of the pulse (F<sub>200</sub>); and (3) at the end of the pulse (F<sub>final</sub>). These values were used to quantify both early and late accommodations in accordance with the following formulas: (F<sub>initial</sub> − F<sub>200</sub>/F<sub>initial</sub>) and (F<sub>200</sub> − F<sub>final</sub>/F<sub>initial</sub>), respectively. We also dissected the spike morphology from action potentials elicited by 80-ms suprathreshold pulses from −70 mV (150–200 pA). From these recordings, the spike threshold corresponded to the voltage at which the derivative of the AP (dV/dt) experienced a twofold increase. The amplitudes, the first and the second AP (A<sub>1</sub> and A<sub>2</sub>), were calculated from the threshold to peak. Their duration (D<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub>) corresponded to the full-width at half maximum (FWHM) from a Gaussian fit of the depolarized face of the AP immediately after the threshold. Both amplitude reduction and duration increase were calculated by the formulas A<sub>1</sub> − A<sub>2</sub>/A<sub>1</sub> and D<sub>2</sub> − D<sub>1</sub>/D<sub>1</sub>, respectively. The amplitude of the after-hyperpolarization (AHP) was calculated as the difference between the threshold and the peak of the fast hyperpolarization. We also estimated the AHP width as the FWHM and the latency of AP peak to AHP trough. We extracted the positive and negative peaks from the derivative of the AP waveform to quantify the maximal speed excursion of the membrane voltage during both depolarizing and hyperpolarizing faces of the AP. Finally, the input resistance (R<sub>in</sub>) was measured in current clamp by applying hyperpolarizing pulses from −60 mV (−200 pA). The three major parameters to differentiate FSI from NFSI appeared in bold. Note that seven other parameters also easily differentiate these interneurons.

However, the proportion of connected FSIs was high compared to the FSI abundance in tested pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) or within the population of tested FSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Conversely, the proportion of connected NFSIs was low compared to the NFSI abundance in tested pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) or within the population of tested NFSIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest that connection probabilities of FSIs and NFSIs are different. To determine whether differences in the connection probabilities for FSIs (p = 0.43) and NFSIs (p = 0.21) did not arise by chance, we modeled each of the two data sets as observations from two binomial distributions. The estimated connection probabilities at 90% confidence intervals for FSIs and NFSIs were 0.30–0.57 and 0.15–0.27, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Brown et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). If the two populations have the same connection probabilities, we expect non-overlapping intervals in at most 1% of the cases (0.1 × 0.1). No overlap was observed between these two intervals, indicating that FSIs and NFSIs have different connection probabilities (p &lt; 0.01). We obtained a similar result using a chi-square test (Pearson's chi-square of 6.93; p &lt; 0.01). In another hand, it is noteworthy that no significant differences of main discriminative electrophysiological parameters were found between tested and connected NFSIs, indicating that NFSIs innervating NG2 cells constitute a heterogeneous population of interneurons as observed in the tested population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that NFSIs are by far more abundant and diverse but poorly connected to NG2 cells, whereas FSIs are less abundant but highly connected to NG2 cells in the developing GABAergic network.</p><p>Finally, we previously demonstrated that NG2 cells receive a transient GABAergic synaptic input from interneurons that disappears after the second PN week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vélez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>). We, thus, tested how this transient connectivity occurs for FSI and NFSI separately. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> illustrates the connection probability of these interneurons at three different postnatal stages. A transient peak of connectivity occurred at PN10-11 for both FSI and NFSI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), indicating that the connectivity of these two classes of interneurons is not differently affected by the stage of development.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FSIs and NFSIs target specific segregated subcellular domains</title><p>We next investigated whether FSI-NG2 cell connections could be distinguished from NFSI-NG2 cell connections by their synaptic properties. Paired-pulse ratios, PSC1 and PSC2 amplitudes with or without failures, coefficients of variation, and probabilities of response were not significantly different between FSI-NG2 cell and NFSI-NG2 cell connections, suggesting that presynaptic mechanisms of GABA release did not participate in the selectivity for presynaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). However, we observed a significant difference in current kinetics with rise and decay times faster for unitary FSI-NG2 cell connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). These kinetic differences could result from two main causes: (1) FSI-NG2 cell and NFSI-NG2 cell synapses are distributed at different subcellular locations with FSI-NG2 cell conductances at proximal contact sites being properly clamped during whole-cell recordings, and NFSI-NG2 cell conductances at more distal contacts being electrotonically filtered; (2) the subunit composition of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs is different according to the presynaptic identity of the interneuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pearce, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Thomson, 2008</xref>).

We considered that VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>−</sup> puncta corresponded to FSI and NFSI contacts, respectively. VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta were more abundant than VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>−</sup> on the soma, whereas their proportion was relatively similar in NG2 cell branches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>).

To rule out that the specific segregation of inputs was caused by their uneven distribution around recorded NG2 cells rather than a specific subcellular targeting, we analyzed the distribution of puncta surrounding these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; see ‘Materials and methods’). VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta were homogeneously distributed in the space at the vicinity of analyzed NG2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>). These results indicate that FSIs contact preferentially NG2 cell somata and proximal branches, whereas NFSIs mainly contact distal branches. This is consistent with the faster current kinetics observed for unitary FSI-NG2 cell connections and demonstrates a differential distribution of presynaptic inputs on NG2 cells, according to the interneuron identity.</p><p>In interneuron–neuron connections, the subunit composition of postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs can change according to both the location of the receptors in the somato-dendritic compartment and the identity of the presynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali and Thomson, 2008</xref>). Differences on postsynaptic GABA<sub>A</sub>R subunit composition in NG2 cells may also account for input specificity. We recently showed that GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs of NG2 cells in the second PN week had a variable and complex subunit composition with around 40% of cortical NG2 cells expressing mRNAs for the GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs containing γ2 subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>). In agreement with transcript expression, the effect of the positive modulator diazepam (DZP; a benzodiazepine acting on receptors containing the γ2 subunit) on extracellularly evoked currents is also very variable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Passlick et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>).

This cage compound is one of the most efficient in terms of release of glutamate by light and of stability at physiological pH and temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Matsuzaki et al., 2001</xref>). However, as many other cages, it has a blocking effect on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs in brain slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fino et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). For this reason, we first searched for an appropriate concentration of MNI-glutamate for which the effect on GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs of NG2 cells is minimal while triggering efficiently action potentials in interneurons at a single-cell resolution. We found that a concentration of 50 µM MNI-glutamate fulfilled these two prerequisites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>To build GABAergic connectivity maps of recorded cells, interneurons were sequentially photostimulated in the excitation field using a 5-µm light spots, while patched cells were recorded with CsMeS-based intracellular solution at 0 mV, the reversal potential of their ionotropic glutamatergic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). Outward GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated PSCs, sensitive to SR95531, were induced in recorded cells by photostimulation of nearby interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We considered as connected pairs those showing both PSCs detected in averaged traces with a threshold of 2 times the standard deviation of the noise and an increased occurrence probability of individual PSCs within 100 ms after photostimulation when visualized in raster plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D</xref>). This time window corresponds to the latency after photostimulation required to trigger an action potential in interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Indeed, action potential generation with light through the activation of glutamate receptors cannot be precisely controlled as with patch-clamp recordings. In most cases, action potential generation of interneurons was delayed with respect to the photostimulation time and displayed a spike jitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). As a consequence, there is also a variable latency and jitter in photo-evoked PSCs during mapping experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>, insets). Nevertheless, to confirm irrefutably the monosynaptic nature of the connections, the photo-activated interneuron inducing PSCs in a postsynaptic cell was patched with a second pipette to test its connectivity with paired recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>).

In order to take into account different action potential thresholds, we systematically increased or decreased the duration of the laser pulse for each interneuron. Furthermore, to ensure the spatial selectivity of the system, we displaced the spot away from the soma, resulting in the disappearance of the response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5A–D—figure supplement 3D</xref>). This allows us to reveal false positive and negative connections, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,C,F</xref>). Only in rare cases, the unambiguous discrimination of connected interneurons was not possible, and thus, these targeted interneurons were not considered in cell maps (2.8% of all tested interneurons). The online evaluation of each photostimulated interneuron allowed us to set reliable maps of connectivity for recorded cells.</p><p>As expected for connections with a limited number of release sites, the amplitudes of PSCs induced in NG2 cells by photostimulation were smaller than those in pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5 fig6">Figures 5A,C, 6B–E</xref>). Either in the sample of tested cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>) or in maps showing at least one connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>), the probability to find a connected pair was lower for NG2 cells than for pyramidal neurons.

Moreover, the connection probability highly decreased after intersomatic distances of 50 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>).

The local architecture of interneuron-NG2 cell connections, thus, did not result from the impossibility to detect connections over 70 µm with holographic photolysis.

The density of CC1<sup>+</sup>/Olig2<sup>+</sup> cells was low at PN9 and PN10 and significantly increased from PN11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–F</xref>). Therefore, the peak of synaptic connectivity of cortical NG2 cells at PN10 coincides with a switch to a massive NG2 cell differentiation occurring between PN10 and PN11 in cortical layer V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). To further analyze whether the transient GABAergic connectivity of NG2 cells and the switch to oligodendrocyte differentiation were related processes, we tested whether the Na<sup>+</sup> current density of NG2 cells correlates with the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events at different postnatal days. Indeed, it has been shown that both the amplitude of Na<sup>+</sup> currents and the synaptic current frequency decrease when these progenitors undergo differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">De Biase et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kukley et al., 2010</xref>). As expected from paired recordings and previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vélez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>), the frequency of spontaneous synaptic activity increases from PN8 to PN10 and then decreases at PN13 (0.12 ± 0.02 Hz, 0.24 ± 0.05 Hz, 0.12 ± 0.02 Hz, respectively; p &lt; 0.05 for PN10). However, no statistical differences were observed either on the averaged amplitudes of spontaneous synaptic currents or Na<sup>+</sup> current densities between PN8, PN10, and PN13 (amplitude of synaptic currents: −10.45 ± 1.04 pA, −12.75 ± 1.27 pA, −12.07 ± 0.90 pA, respectively; Na<sup>+</sup> current densities: 22.59 ± 2.99 pA/pF, 23.46 ± 3.56 pA/pF, 26.10 ± 3.72 pA/pF, respectively; p &gt; 0.05). Interestingly, while no correlation was observed between the Na<sup>+</sup> current density and the frequency of spontaneous synaptic events at PN8 and PN13 when connectivity is low, a positive correlation was observed at PN10 when connectivity is high and the switch to differentiation starts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). These data suggest that interneurons build up a large number of functional synapses in more immature NG2 cells at the onset of massive oligodendrocyte differentiation (PN10) and then, GABAergic synapses disassemble. The transient NG2 cell-synaptic connectivity is thus not only spatially, but also temporally regulated in coordination with the active differentiation phase of these progenitors in the second PN week.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our findings uncover both spatially and temporally structured interneuron-NG2 cell connections, from the subcellular level to the cortical network during a critical period of NG2 cell differentiation. We demonstrate that NG2 cells form a transient and highly organized network with interneurons that is characterized by a high-connection probability at PN10, a specific distribution of synaptic inputs on cell bodies and branches, a restricted number of contacts per interneuron, and very local connectivity maps. GABAergic innervation of NG2 cells, thus, appears as a finely regulated process that follows its own logic, which cannot be inferred from previous studies on NG2 cells and on classical neuronal synapses.</p><p>In the neocortex, different classes of interneurons, guided by genetically determined mechanisms, are known to target distinct subcellular domains of pyramidal neurons, allowing a differential compartmentalized signal processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Huang et al., 2007</xref>). We demonstrate that input-specific projections also exist for interneuron-NG2 cell connections. NG2 cells compartmentalize FSI- and NFSI-input regions as revealed by distinct anatomical locations of PV<sup>+</sup> and PV<sup>−</sup> contacts and by a different distribution of GABA<sub>A</sub>Rs with or without γ<sub>2</sub> subunits at postsynaptic sites. FSIs and NFSIs impinging on these glial progenitors, thus, probably encode distinct information that regulates different cellular NG2 cell processes. Located at proximal sites and somata, FSI synapses could regulate NG2 cell differentiation by controlling gene expression, whereas distal NFSI synapses could affect motility or migration. Indeed, it has been suggested that GABA probably promotes NG2 cell migration through the activation of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tong et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>NG2 cells receive inputs from both FSIs and NFSIs, but FSIs are proportionally more connected to these progenitors, suggesting that they play a major role in controlling NG2 cell activity during early stages of postnatal development. Compared to adult animals, immature FSIs possess different electrophysiological properties, such as high-input resistance, relatively low-membrane time constants, and a certain degree of spike-frequency adaptation, and are thus unlikely to perform the same function that in mature circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Okaty et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, FSIs probably do not contribute to coordinating cortical neuronal activity in the perinatal period since FSI-pyramidal cell connections are detected only from PN5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</xref>). FSIs start to influence cortical activity only during the second postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pangratz-Fuehrer and Hestrin, 2011</xref>), and as shown here, it is also at this period that they constitute a significant, transient presynaptic input to NG2 cells. Synaptic communication between FSIs and NG2 cells could, therefore, play a role in the maturation of FSIs in the developing neuronal network.</p><p>Although local cortical interneurons are believed to lack myelin because they possess relatively short axons that do not project outside the cortex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Somogyi et al. (1983)</xref> demonstrated the presence of myelin enwrapping the axon of basket cells, most probably FSIs, in cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Somogyi et al., 1983</xref>). Since myelination is an activity-dependent process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zalc and Fields, 2000</xref>), an interesting possibility would be that the restricted point-to-point GABA release at unitary interneuron-NG2 cell connections encodes a signal that triggers NG2 cell differentiation and myelination of the presynaptic interneuronal axon, preferentially that of FSIs. Myelination of neocortical FSIs is likely to occur since myelin is important for the organization of Kv1 channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rasband et al., 1998</xref>), and these channels have been proposed to mediate the variability in FSI-firing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Golomb et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, axonal signals are essential to regulate oligodendrocyte production and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barres et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Trapp et al., 1997</xref>), and interneuronal axons transiently contact NG2 cells during active-cortical oligodendrogenesis.</p><p>Many one-photon uncaging systems have been used to study the synaptic connectivity patterns in brain regions, but their low-spatial resolution does not allow for photo-stimulating neurons at a single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dantzker and Callaway, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shepherd et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yoshimura et al., 2005</xref>). On the contrary, we show that one-photon holographic photolysis is a suitable alternative tool to elicit action potentials in neurons at single-cell resolution and find unitary connections. Using this technique, we demonstrate that interneuron-NG2 cell connections display a very local arrangement in the network. This difference cannot be explained exclusively by the small volume occupied by NG2 cells. Indeed, axons of interneurons that ramify extensively and travel long did not innervate NG2 cells over 70 µm. In fact, the connectivity of NG2 cells already decreases at interneuron-NG2 cell intersomatic distances of 50 µm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). It has been reported that no specificity exists between the spatial profiles of interneuron-pyramidal cell connectivity maps, and thus, that pyramidal cells do not form specific networks in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fino and Yuste, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Packer et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, interneuron-NG2 cell connectivity maps follow a local spatial arrangement, reflecting a focal control of NG2 cell activity by interneurons. This microarchitecture supposes a close relationship between the proximal part of interneuronal axons and NG2 cells. The existence of a local network formed by interneurons and NG2 cells, embedded within the developing neuronal network, implies the involvement of selective molecular and cellular mechanisms ensuring this local connectivity. These mechanisms remain to be elucidated.</p><p>In the developing postnatal brain, the proper maturation of interneuron–neuron microcircuits requires the interactions between intrinsic genetic programs and neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cossart, 2011</xref>). We demonstrate that the emergence of properly organized GABAergic neuronal microcircuits is not only confined to neurons, but also includes a non-neuronal cell type. Interestingly, after the peak of synaptic connectivity at PN10, the decrease of GABAergic synaptic innervation of NG2 cells is accompanied by other relevant physiological changes in these progenitors: (1) there is a decrease in the amplitude of GABA<sub>A</sub>R-mediated miniature events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>); (2) Kir channels start to be upregulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kressin et al., 1995</xref>); and (3) the first wave of oligodendrocytes arising from Nkx2.1-expressing precursors of MGE and the anterior entopeduncular area is eliminated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kessaris et al., 2006</xref>). An intriguing question for future research is whether cortical NG2 cell development onto oligodendrocytes occurs under the control of interneuronal activity in the developing neuronal network. The GABAergic synaptic input probably does not control per se cortical oligodendrocyte production, which is a protracted process that occurs during several weeks, even after the loss of functional synapses. However, the coincidence between the peak of connectivity (PN10) and the switch to a massive NG2 cell differentiation from PN10 raises the possibility that the interneuron-NG2 cell network sets precisely the onset of oligodendrogenesis occurring in deep layers of the neocortex during the second postnatal week. This would explain why a transient and structured NG2 cell connectivity is necessary.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Acute slice preparation and electrophysiology</title><p>All experiments followed European Union and institutional guidelines for the care and use of laboratory animals. Acute parasagittal slices (300 µm) of the barrel cortex with an angle of 10° to the sagittal plane were obtained from a double VGAT-Venus;NG2-DsRed transgenic mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ziskin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2009</xref>), as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vélez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>). Excitation light to visualize Venus and DsRed fluorescent proteins was provided by Optoled Light Sources (Blue and Green Optoleds; Cairn Research, UK), and images were collected with an iXon+ 14-bit digital camera (Andor Technology, UK) through an Olympus BX51 microscope equipped with a 40× fluorescent water-immersion objective. Excitation and emission wavelengths were obtained by using, respectively, 470- and 525-nm filters for Venus and 560- and 620-nm filters for DsRed. The Imaging Workbench 6.0 software (Indec Biosystems, USA) was utilized to acquire and store images for off-line analysis. Patch-clamp recordings were performed at RT or 33°C using an extracellular solution containing (in mM): 126 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 20 glucose, 5 pyruvate, 3 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (95% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>). NG2 cells were recorded with different intracellular solutions according to the experiment and containing (in mM): either 130 CsCl or 125 CsCH<sub>3</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>H (CsMeS), 5 4-aminopyridine, 10 tetraethylammonium chloride, 0.2 EGTA, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, 2 Na<sub>2</sub>-ATP, 0.2 Na-GTP, and 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH ≈ 7.3).

Potentials were corrected for a junction potential of −10 mV when using CsMeS and KGlu-based intracellular solutions. Whole-cell recordings were obtained using Multiclamp 700B, filtered at 4 kHz, and digitized at 20 kHz.

To test for a functional connection, paired-pulse stimulation was applied to the interneuron in voltage-clamp mode to elicit action currents at 8-s intervals (1 ms, 80 mV pulse; 50 ms paired-pulse interval). This protocol allows for a precise timing of action potential generation in interneurons. We considered as a unitary connection, those pairs showing averaged PSCs in NG2 cells larger than 2 times the standard deviation of the noise. To evaluate the recovery from depression, we applied two test pulses using interstimulus intervals ranging from 10 ms to 250 ms. Paired-pulse ratios were calculated as PSC2/PSC1. Quantal analyses were performed on 18 out of 38 connections for which 100 or more traces were recorded, and individual PSCs in single traces could be differentiated from the noise using a detection threshold of 2 times the standard deviation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Holographic photolysis</title><p>The holographic setup was adapted to the Olympus microscope as previously described (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lutz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zahid et al., 2010</xref>). Briefly, a 405-nm diode CW-laser (CUBE 405-100, Coherent) was used for uncaging experiments. The output beam was expanded (6×) to match the input window of a LCOS-SLM (X10468-01, Hamamatsu), which operates in reflection mode. The device was controlled by a custom-designed software described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lutz et al. (2008)</xref> that calculated the corresponding phase hologram and addressed the pattern to the LCOS-SLM, given a target intensity distribution at the focal plane of the microscope objective. The SLM plane was imaged at the back aperture of the microscope objective through a telescope (L1, f1 = 350 mm; L2, f2 = 180 mm). The undiffracted component (zero-order spot) was masked at the focal plane of L1 using a coverslip with a black dot.</p><p>Acute slices transferred into the recording chamber were perfused with the extracellular solution at 2–3 ml/min using a recycling bubbled system (10 ml) that allows for the continuous perfusion of the caged MNI-glutamate (50 µM). Selective photostimulation of interneurons during patch-clamp recordings of either NG2 cells or pyramidal neurons was obtained with 5-µm illumination spots during 3–8 ms and a laser power of ∼12 mW under the objective. Patched cells were recorded with CsMeS-based intracellular solution and held at 0 mV to minimize the direct photo-activation of their glutamatergic receptors in the excitation field. The protocol consisted in using an initial photostimulation of 3 ms that photo-evoked single or few action potentials in most targeted interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C</xref>). False negative and false positive connections were discerned by changing the laser time pulse and by moving the illumination spot outside the soma of the targeted interneuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–D,F</xref>). We considered as photo-induced unitary PSCs those that: (1) showed an increased occurrence probability of individual PSCs within 100 ms after photostimulation when visualized in raster plots (this time window corresponded to the time needed for interneurons to spike after the photostimulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>); and (2) were detected in averaged traces with a threshold of 2 times the standard deviation of the noise.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Immunostainings and puncta analysis</title><p>For CC1 and Olig2 immunostainings, NG2-DsRed mice of the same litters were perfused intracardially with phosphate buffer saline (PBS) alone followed by 0.15 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 (PB) containing 4% paraformaldehyde at PN9–PN13 (n = 6 litters and 5–7 animals per age). Brains were removed and placed in a 4% paraformaldehyde solution overnight. Then, brain slices (50 µm) were prepared in PBS ice-cold solution (4°C), permeabilized with 0.2% triton X-100 and 4% Normal Goat Serum (NGS) for 1 hr, and incubated one night with antibodies diluted in a 0.2% triton X-100 solution and 2% NGS. For VGAT, γ2, and NG2 triple immunostainings, animals were similarly perfused, and brains placed in 4% paraformaldehyde solution for 1 hr. Then, brain slices (100 µm) were prepared in PBS ice-cold solution (4°C), permeabilized with 1% triton X-100 and 4% NGS for 1 hr, and incubated three nights with antibodies diluted in a 0.2% triton X-100 solution and 2% NGS. Double immunostainings were performed by combining rabbit anti-Olig2 (1:400; ref. AB9610, Millipore) with mouse monoclonal anti-CC1 (1:100; ref. OP80, Calbiochem) antibodies. Puncta were immunostained with guinea pig anti-VGAT (1:500; ref. 131 004, Synaptic Systems) and mouse anti-γ2 (1:500; ref. 224011; Synaptic Systems) and NG2 cells with rabbit anti-NG2 (1:400; ref AB5320, Millipore).

Negative controls for immunostainings were performed by omitting all primary antibodies or by incubating a primary antibody with a secondary antibody against an omitted primary antibody.</p><p>Optical sections of confocal images were sequentially acquired using a 10× or 63× oil objectives (NA = 1.4) with the LSM-710 software (Zeiss). Images were processed and analyzed using ImageJ and Imaris softwares. For counting layer V Olig2<sup>+</sup>/CC1<sup>+</sup> cells, we analyzed 270 × 270 µm of 10–20 Z-sections (each 1 µm). For counting layer V PV<sup>+</sup> interneurons, we analyzed 225 × 225 µm of 55 Z-sections (each 0.5 µm) from PV immunostainings of barrel cortex of Venus<sup>+</sup> mice. Co-localization of biocytin-loaded NG2 cells and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV puncta as well as NG2<sup>+</sup> cells and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/γ2<sup>+</sup> was assessed on 125 × 125 µm 60 Z-sections (each 0.32 µm). 3D surfaces were created for all channels after applying a median filter to reduce noise. First, we quantified the number of VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta per NG2 cell somata and branches. For this, we extracted the fluorescent profiles for VGAT puncta and biocytin-loaded NG2 cells by tracing a line crossing both the puncta and the biocytin-loaded region. We considered as a contacting puncta those showing more than 23% overlapping of fluorescent profiles. Finally, we checked whether or not those VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta on NG2 cells colocalized with PV. Countings were performed for 4 biocytin-loaded NG2 cells and on 6–8 branches per NG2 cell. Similar colocalization parameters were applied for VGAT<sup>+</sup>/γ2<sup>+</sup> on NG2<sup>+</sup> cells (n = 8 cells from two mice). To determine the spatial distribution of all VGAT<sup>+</sup> and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta around biocytin-loaded NG2 cells, we first obtained the 3D coordinates for all puncta (Imaris tools). Then, puncta densities (number of puncta per µm<sup>3</sup>) were calculated in increasing eccentric volumes from the center of the stack where the NG2 cell soma was located. Each volume corresponded to a sphere to which spherical caps were removed to remain inside the stack (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The first volume was calculated from a sphere of 5-µm radius around the center of the field. The next volume was calculated from a sphere of 10-µm radius to which we subtracted the previous smaller volume. We repeated this volume calculation until we attained the x, y axis boundaries of the field. For each calculated volume, we determined all VGAT<sup>+</sup> and VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup> puncta densities.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are expressed as mean ± SEM.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The paper by Oduz, Maldonado et al. uses several methods to demonstrate a surprising selectivity in functional connections between fast spiking interneurons and NG2 cells. The view of the reviewers is that the work is interesting and potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, you will need to provide additional data to convincingly demonstrate some of the claims, which we believe can be collected quite quickly.</p><p>One of the reviewers was concerned that the dataset remains too descriptive for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> and does not yet demonstrate a causal link. This reviewer suggested additional experiments using pharmacological or genetic interventions to address the roles of either the γ2 subunit-containing synapses or the innervation by FSI (vs. NFSI), but our view overall is that these experiments would be beyond the scope of the paper. Therefore, we would ask you to address the following points in a resubmission, along with the minor changes:</p><p>1) The glutamate uncaging experiments to map the distribution of INs that synapse onto NG2 cells demonstrate a very transient peak of connectivity between INs and NG2 cells, with a 45% connection at P10, but only 20-25% on P8-9 and P11-13. This brings up a major question: if there is such a difference in total connectivity by varying recording by one day, the authors need to clarify the exact time points that were used for determining IN subtype connection in the earlier experiments. The text says experiments were done in the second postnatal week, which would include poorly and highly connected cells/days. This has implications for understanding whether the difference in connection probability of FSI vs NFSI is affected by the stage of development. For example, the proportion of FSI and NFSI that are connected to NG2 cells on each day, and the region of the NG2 cell that they synapse onto. This can be addressed by re-analyzing the already collected data by age to see if there is any variation across development.</p><p>2) For the immunostaining to show the distribution of inputs onto biocytin filled NG2 cells the authors should provide some sort of postsynaptic label, even if it is GABA receptors, to more convincingly show that the presynaptic puncta are likely to be forming connections with the NG2 cells rather than on nearby neurons. Similarly, EM analysis of a subset of filled neurons could convincingly show that the fast spiking inputs are forming bonofide synapses onto NG2 cells with the appropriate labeling of the presynaptic and postynaptic cells, this may not be necessary if more immunostaining analysis is done. This becomes even more relevant in regards to the claims that these synapses are transient and rapidly disappear prior to oligodendrocyte myelination. Similarly, using immunolabeling to look at presynaptic and postsynaptic markers onto the NG2 cells at the three ages described electrophysiologically would provide some insight into how connections are lost just prior to oligodendrocyte differentiation.</p><p>3) In addition, for the holographic stimulation to map inputs it would be helpful to know whether the mapping of inputs is greatly altered if shorter latency cut offs are used, especially because the connectivity peaks at 40us. Thus, do the distributions look similar even if the number of inputs decreases? This could also help counter any concerns about inadvertently measuring di-synaptic inputs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06953.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>One of the reviewers was concerned that the dataset remains too descriptive for publication in</italic> eLife <italic>and does not yet demonstrate a causal link.

We tested 147 NG2 cells with paired recordings compared to 32 with uncaging. With 20 or more tested NG2 cells per day, paired recordings give us a clearer picture of the connectivity probability with respect to the age.</p><p>We realize from the reviewers’ comment that presenting the transient connectivity at the end of the results raises several questions about the experiments described before. Therefore, we included a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> with the connectivity probability of FSI and NFSI with respect to the age. We pooled the data obtained at PN8-9, PN10-11 and PN12-13 to increase the number of connected pairs for each of the two groups of interneurons (3 or more for FSI and 6 or more for NFSI for a total tested pairs of 45, 44 and 44 at PN8- 9, PN10-11 and P12-13, respectively). Note the peak of connectivity at PN10-11 for both FSI and NFSI in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>. The transient increase in connectivity occurs for both groups of interneurons at PN10-11 and is not differently affected by the age of the animal (see the last paragraph of the subsection headed “Fast-spiking interneurons are highly connected to NG2 cells”). We also clarify at which ages were performed all the experiments throughout the text (particularly in the Results section). The transient connectivity does not impact electrophysiological properties such as the kinetics of postsynaptic events of FSI-NG2 cell and NFSI-NG2 cell connections (see subsection “FSIs and NFSIs target specific segregated subcellular domains”) and single vs. double release sites (see “Restricted number of release sites per interneuron”).</p><p><italic>2) For the immunostaining to show the distribution of inputs onto biocytin filled NG2 cells the authors should provide some sort of postsynaptic label, even if it is GABA receptors, to more convincingly show that the presynaptic puncta are likely to be forming connections with the NG2 cells rather than on nearby neurons. Similarly, EM analysis of a subset of filled neurons could convincingly show that the fast spiking inputs are forming bonofide synapses onto NG2 cells with the appropriate labeling of the presynaptic and postynaptic cells, this may not be necessary if more immunostaining analysis is done. This becomes even more relevant in regards to the claims that these synapses are transient and rapidly disappear prior to oligodendrocyte myelination. Similarly, using immunolabeling to look at presynaptic and postsynaptic markers onto the NG2 cells at the three ages described electrophysiologically would provide some insight into how connections are lost just prior to oligodendrocyte differentiation</italic>.</p><p>The postsynaptic protein assemblies of NG2 cells have not been studied yet and could be substantially different from those found in neurons. For instance, the expression of gephyrin, a major marker of neuronal postsynaptic sites, has not been observed in NG2 cells (Seifi et al., 2014, Front Anat). Therefore, to answer the reviewers’ comment, we used the γ2 subunit of GABA<sub>A</sub> Rs as a postsynaptic marker since we know from our present and previous studies that this subunit is expressed at many NG2 cell GABAergic synapses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>, Cerebral Cortex). First, we performed triple immunostainings against VGAT, PV (presynaptic markers) and γ2 (postsynaptic marker) in DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells of NG2-DsRed mice at PN10, the age previously used to analyze VGAT/PV puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). We observed the presence of VGAT<sup>+</sup>/PV<sup>+</sup>/γ2<sup>+</sup> puncta on DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells, but co-localization with the cell was sometimes ambiguous because the DsRed protein is not homogeneously expressed in soma and branches, resulting in cell borders difficult to define. We thus performed triple immunostainings against VGAT (the presynaptic marker), γ2 (the postsynaptic marker) and NG2 (a marker of NG2 cell membranes) in DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells of NG2-DsRed mice at PN10. Note that NG2 and PV cannot be combined in these experiments since both are rabbit polyclonal antibodies. This is not a real limitation since all considered PV<sup>+</sup> puncta were also VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-E</xref>). The PV/VGAT colocalization is mandatory since PV can also be expressed outside synapses. New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> illustrates the presence of numerous VGAT<sup>+</sup>/γ2<sup>+</sup> synaptic puncta on NG2 <sup>+</sup> cell membranes of the soma and branches as previously observed in biocytin-loaded cells (same co-localization parameters; see Materials and methods, subsection headed “Immunostainings and puncta analysis”). In addition, VGAT<sup>+</sup>/γ2<sup>+</sup> synaptic puncta on neurons can be clearly distinguished from those present on NG2 cells at this developmental stage (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These results confirm that VGAT<sup>+</sup> puncta analyzed previously are formed on NG2 cells and not on nearby neurons, and provide in addition a protein confirmation of the presence of γ2 at many NG2 cell synapses (see subsection entitled “FSIs and NFSIs target specific segregated subcellular domains ”). Finally, we also examine VGAT<sup>+</sup>/γ2<sup>+</sup> synaptic puncta in NG2<sup>+</sup> membranes of DsRed<sup>+</sup> cells at PN8 and PN13 and, in line with our electrophysiological data showing functional synapses at these stages, we also observed VGAT<sup>+</sup>/ γ2<sup>+</sup>/NG2<sup>+</sup> co- localization. However, we believe that a reliable study comparing the three ages to provide some insight into how connections are anatomically lost during oligodendrogenesis is technically challenging. The variability of the number of puncta from cell to cell, the small size of a synaptic puncta to observe any possible morphological modification, the lack of a more general postsynaptic marker and the loss of NG2 and DsRed expression when NG2 cells undergo differentiation constitute major technical difficulties to properly address this question. Although challenging, the study of anatomical changes occurring during the transient connectivity would be interesting to do in future studies. Nevertheless, we have already provided some insight into how functional connections are lost in previous reports by combining different electrophysiological, pharmacological and molecular experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vélez-Fort et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balia et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) In addition, for the holographic stimulation to map inputs it would be helpful to know whether the mapping of inputs is greatly altered if shorter latency cut offs are used, especially because the connectivity peaks at 40us. Thus, do the distributions look similar even if the number of inputs decreases? This could also help counter any concerns about inadvertently measuring di-synaptic inputs</italic>.</p><p>The GABAergic responses induced in NG2 cells by holographic photo -stimulation of Venus<sup>+</sup> interneurons cannot be di-synaptic because these neurons are inhibitory (GABA has already a hyperpolarizing effect in neurons in the second postnatal week). Upon photo-activation, interneurons will inhibit rather than excite other surrounding neurons. It is also highly unlikely that our photo-stimulation activates other structures such as dendrites of excitatory neurons which may indirectly activate an interneuron and generate di-synaptic response in NG2 cells. Indeed, when we displaced the light spot outside the targeted interneuron to the neuropil where many dendrites are axons are laying, we got ambiguous responses in only 2.8% of the cases (see subsection entitled “Local spatial arrangement of interneuron-NG2 cell connections”). Finally, we also confirmed the mono-synaptic nature of the connections by patching the targeted presynaptic interneuron and performing paired recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D, E</xref>).</p><p>However, we agree that this is a critical point for the study. We thus performed the analysis proposed by the reviewers with a cut-off at 50 ms which corresponds to the delay of action potential generation of around 80% of interneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>; x-axis labels were changed to better appreciate this proportion). The distributions of connected and unconnected cells were still different for NG2 cells (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, D=0.2513, P&lt;0.05) . We also compared the new distributions with those reported in the previous manuscript. We found no significant differences of the mean inter-somatic distance of connected interneurons (43.9±2.4 µm <italic>vs</italic> 42.9±3.5 µm; Mann -Whitney U test, P&gt;0.05) or the distribution of inter-somatic distances of connected interneurons between the two different cut-offs (Kolmogorov- Smirnov test, D=0.060, P&gt;0.05). Similarly, no changes were observed in the case of pyramidal cells (P&gt;0.05). We concluded that the mapping of inputs is not altered when shorter latency cut-offs are used. We would prefer to keep our previous analysis because, in our opinion, a 50 ms cut-off will cause an underestimation of the number of connected interneurons.</p></body></sub-article></article>
