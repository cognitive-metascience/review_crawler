ubiquitin-proteasome system quality control pathway comprising the E2 enzymes Ubc4/Ubc5 and the ubiquitin ligase Tom1. <italic>tom1</italic> cells show reduced ubiquitination of multiple RPs, exceptional accumulation of detergent-insoluble proteins including multiple RPs, and hypersensitivity to imbalances in production of RPs and rRNA, indicative of a profound perturbation to proteostasis. Tom1 directly ubiquitinates unassembled RPs primarily via residues that are concealed in mature ribosomes. Together, these data point to an important role for Tom1 in normal physiology and prompt us to refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for excess ribosomal protein quality control. A similar pathway, mediated by the Tom1 homolog Huwe1, restricts accumulation of overexpressed hRpl26 in human cells. We propose that ERISQ is a key element of the quality control machinery that sustains protein homeostasis and cellular fitness in eukaryotes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.19105.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.19105.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19105.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Ribosomes are the molecular machines in cells that produce proteins. The ribosomes themselves are composed of almost 80 different proteins that are held together by scaffolds made from molecules of RNA. Each protein is present in one copy, and so equal numbers of all proteins are needed to assemble a ribosome. However, because it takes many steps to produce a protein and biological processes are inherently imprecise, it is essentially impossible for a cell to produce exactly the same number of copies of all the proteins in a ribosome. Much research suggests that, to overcome these issues, a cell will make more of certain ribosomal proteins than it needs, and then degrade the leftovers that are not used. However, it was not clear how this happens, nor was it known what are the consequences of failing to degrade the leftovers.</p><p>Now, Sung et al. show that yeast cells use an enzyme named Tom1 to attach a protein-marker called ubiquitin to ribosomal proteins that are made in excess and not assembled into ribosomes. The ubiquitin serves as a tag that marks proteins for degradation, and yeast cell that lack Tom1 fail to degrade any excess ribosomal proteins. Consequently, the mutant yeast become sensitive to any factors that alter the balance of the protein and RNA building blocks used to assemble ribosomes.</p><p>The human equivalent of Tom1 is known as Huwe1, and the data of Sung et al. suggest that this enzyme acts in a similar pathway. Further experiments are now needed to explore the role of Huwe1 in greater depth, and investigate if problems with this enzyme are associated with any human diseases. Finally, working out the exactly how Tom1 recognizes unassembled ribosomal proteins will be another important challenge for future studies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

Defects in the cellular machinery that governs PQC cause multiple human diseases including multisystem proteinopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandmeir et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Watts et al., 2004</xref>) and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johnson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kabashi and Durham, 2006</xref>). Other diseases, such as cancer, can exhibit heightened dependency on PQC pathways, which underlies the hypersensitivity of multiple myeloma cells to proteasome inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cenci et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deshaies, 2014</xref>). Therefore, a deeper understanding of PQC will advance our understanding of both normal physiology and pathological states, and may enable novel approaches to treat multiple diseases.</p><p>Ribosome biogenesis is an intricate process involving many chaperones and assembly factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kressler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Warner, 1999</xref>). Ribosomal proteins made in excess over rRNA and other ribosomal proteins are among the most rapidly degraded proteins in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abovich et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dephoure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gorenstein and Warner, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Torres et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warner, 1977</xref>), suggesting that proper coordination of synthesis and assembly is critical. Newly-synthesized human ribosomal proteins are subject to degradation by the proteasome in the nucleolus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lam et al., 2007</xref>), and we recently found that overexpressed yeast ribosomal proteins that fail to assemble are conjugated with ubiquitin and degraded by the proteasome in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sung et al., 2016</xref>). Insoluble material that accumulates upon transient inhibition of the proteasome in yeast is strongly enriched for ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sung et al., 2016</xref>), pointing to PQC of unassembled ribosomal proteins as a major pathway of proteostasis. However, the PQC pathway that mediates ERISQ remains unknown – an important gap in our understanding of PQC that we set out to address.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of Ubc4/5 and Tom1 as the E2 and E3 for ERISQ</title><p>We evaluated 115 mutant yeast strains, each lacking a different non-essential ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) gene, for those that accumulated non-essential ribosomal protein Rpl26a tagged with a FLAG epitope (Rpl26a<sup>FLAG</sup>) upon its overexpression from the <italic>GAL10</italic> promoter.

We next sought to test whether Tom1 promoted degradation of unassembled ribosomal proteins in cells in which they were not deliberately overexpressed.

Moreover, of the ubiquitinated peptides derived from ribosomal proteins, &gt;50% (51 of 101) decreased in abundance in <italic>tom1∆</italic>. By comparison, of 837 non-ribosomal sites identified, only 11% decreased in abundance in <italic>tom1∆</italic>. SILAC analysis of the unfractionated cell lysates indicated that the reduction in ribosomal ubiquitin conjugates in <italic>tom1∆</italic> was not due to reduction in total ribosomal protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

However, upon inhibition of the proteasome with MG132 or bortezomib, Rpl26a-4E<sup>FLAG</sup> accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>) and was detected in the low MW fractions of a sucrose gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom panels), where it was ubiquitinated, albeit to a lesser extent than unassembled WT Rpl26a<sup>FLAG</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Strikingly, Rpl26a-4E<sup>FLAG</sup> exhibited poor association with <sup>3xHA</sup>Tom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and showed only very weak accumulation in <italic>tom1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), suggesting that it is not primarily a Tom1 substrate but is re-directed to another QC pathway. Consistent with this idea, Rpl26a-4E<sup>FLAG</sup> accumulated in <italic>doa10</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The failure of Rpl26a-4E<sup>FLAG</sup> to be targeted by Tom1 was not due to a defect in its nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We suggest that upon its import into the nucleus, Rpl26a-4E becomes a substrate for Doa10 that is localized to the inner nuclear membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng and Hochstrasser, 2006</xref>). Taken together, our results suggest that residues of Rpl26a that mediate interactions with rRNA and are buried when incorporated into the ribosome are also required for ubiquitination by Tom1 when Rpl26a fails to assemble.</p><p>To pursue this observation further and probe its potential generality, we focused on Rpl4, because assembly of Rpl4 has been studied in some depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>). Upon its synthesis, Rpl4 binds the dedicated chaperone Acl4. The Rpl4–Acl4 then recruits the karyopherin Kap104, for import into the nucleus. Importantly, a crystal structure is available for Rpl4–Acl4 (F.H. and A.H., submitted), and the binding site of Kap104 on the complex has been mapped ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>]; F.H. and A.H., submitted). In our GlyGly profiling efforts, measurements were obtained for three ubiquitination sites on Rpl4: K55, K308, and K338 (10-, 8-, and 1.6-fold decrease in <italic>tom1∆</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 3B</xref>). The crystal structure of the ribosome indicates that K55 and K308, whose ubiquitinations exhibited the strongest dependence on Tom1, contact rRNA and are not accessible for modification in the mature ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Shem et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the crystal structure of the Acl4–Rpl4 complex revealed that Acl4 conceals K55, and a structural model of Kap104 docked to Acl4–Rpl4 indicates that it protects K308 and K338. Upon import of Rpl4–Acl4–Kap104 into the nucleus, Kap104 is dissociated through the action of Ran-GTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kressler et al., 2012</xref>)(F. H. and A. H., submitted). To test if this exposes the C-terminal region of Rpl4 to Tom1 (as would be the case if assembly of Rpl4 was delayed following nuclear import and release of Kap104), we performed an in vitro ubiquitination assay with purified substrates. <sup>3xHA</sup>Tom1 immunoprecipitates readily ubiquitinated Rpl4 in binary Acl4–Rpl4 complexes but not in ternary Acl4–Rpl4–ctKap104 complexes, despite the fact that at least eight lysines of Rpl4 should remain exposed in the ternary complex (red circle, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Ubiquitination of Rpl4 within the binary complex required its extended C-terminus because it was eliminated when the C-terminal region was truncated at residue 276 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). These data, along with those on Rpl26a, suggest that Tom1 selectively recognizes and ubiquitinates ribosomal proteins via residues that are only accessible in the unassembled state. Notably, pulse-chase labeling of yeast cells revealed that Rpl4∆63–87, which lacks the loop region that binds Acl4, transiently associates with Tom1 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>). However, it is unclear if loss of Tom1 during the chase was due to degradation or incorporation of Rpl4∆63–87 molecules into ribosomes.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19105.014</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Tom1 acts through residues that are normally inaccessible in the structure of the mature ribosome.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Structure of Rpl4 within the mature ribosome (PDB ID 4V88).

For this analysis, we used the structure of the HECT domain of Rsp5 covalently conjugated to both a donor ubiquitin and a substrate acceptor (pdb 4LCD). We asked whether the epsilon amino group of a given lysine within the mature large subunit could conceivably make contact with the active site cysteine of Rsp5. Of the 18 lysines that could be observed in the 4V88 structure, 13 in the free 60S and 15 in the assembled 80S were not accessible to the probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We refer to this pathway as ERISQ, for Excess Ribosomal protein Quality control.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>How are substrates recognized by the ERISQ pathway?</title><p>For ERISQ to work, two major challenges must be met. First, Tom1 has to detect many different ribosomal proteins. Second, it has to be able to distinguish their assembled versus unassembled forms. Although the exact structural basis for this discrimination remains to be determined, our analysis reveals that for Tom1 to act upon ribosomal proteins, residues that are normally concealed in the mature ribosome must be accessible. This was shown in vivo for the model substrate Rpl26 and in vitro for Rpl4. In addition, mapping of the major Tom1-dependent ubiquitination sites on the structure of the ribosome large subunit revealed that nearly 83% (15 of 18) of the sites on 12 different ribosomal proteins are no longer available to Tom1 following incorporation into the 80S ribosome. This suggests a very simple kinetic competition between Tom1 and rRNA for binding to ribosomal proteins newly arrived in the nucleolus. If the kinetic parameters for this race normally favor rRNA, the correct outcome would dominate and only those proteins that fail to assemble would be targeted.</p><p>Tom1 has also been implicated in the degradation of unassembled histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Singh et al., 2009</xref>), in which case a similar kinetic competition could apply. Although the domain employed by Tom1 to bind its substrates remains unknown, we note that the previously-described Tom1 substrates Dia2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim and Koepp, 2012</xref>), Hht2 (Singh et al., 2009) and Yra1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Iglesias et al., 2010</xref>) have pI values ranging from 9.3–12. Thus, Tom1, which is overall acidic (pI 4.8) may have a negatively-charged region that interacts electrostatically with basic substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conservation of the Tom1 eRISQ pathway in humans</title><p>Seminal studies from Warner indicated that human cells, like yeast, are unable to accumulate ribosomal proteins made in excess over rRNA due to rapid turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Warner, 1977</xref>), and subsequent proteomic studies revealed that a substantial fraction of newly-synthesized human ribosomal proteins are rapidly degraded by the proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lam et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether the mechanism we described in yeast also operates in human cells, we first demonstrated that the human ortholog (hRpl26) of yeast Rpl26 fails to accumulate upon transient overexpression, and then established that both ubiquitination and degradation of excess hRpl26 require Huwe1, which is the closest human homolog of Tom1. A recent proteome-wide profiling of ubiquitination sites that exhibit diminished occupancy upon depletion of Huwe1 revealed that, excluding Huwe1 itself, six of the top ten affected sites and seventeen of fifty-six that exhibited ≥two-fold decreased occupancy were from ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thompson et al., 2014</xref>). These data point to a very general role for Huwe1 in ubiquitination of ribosomal proteins, similar to what we show here for yeast Tom1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological significance of Tom1/Huwe1 and ERISQ</title><p>Cells lacking Tom1 exhibit a variety of phenotypes besides ERISQ including cell cycle arrest, nucleolar fragmentation, defective mRNA export from the nucleus, reduced Ngg1/Ada3-dependent transcription, reduced polysomes, reduced rate of rRNA processing/maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duncan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Saleh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tabb et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Utsugi et al., 1999</xref>), and sensitivity to paromomycin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). On the one hand it is possible that all but one of these phenotypes are mainly secondary consequences of the primary defect. On the other hand, they may all arise independently from stabilization of different substrates. We can rule out that ERISQ is an indirect consequence of cell cycle arrest, nucleolar fragmentation, defective mRNA export, or a reduced rate of rRNA processing, because the defect in ERISQ is observed at temperatures that are permissive for growth of <italic>tom1</italic> mutants, whereas the other defects are only seen (or in the case of rRNA processing rate, is strongly enhanced) at the non-permissive temperature and thus are more likely to arise indirectly from exacerbation of a primary defect upon imposition of heat stress. It remains unclear to what extent a defect in ERISQ, when coupled to heat stress, might underlie these other phenotypes.</p><p>Some of the <italic>tom1</italic> phenotypes noted above are suggestive of a potential positive role for Tom1 in the assembly of functional ribosomes. However, this does not conflict with our observation that Tom1 plays a direct role in ubiquitinating and promoting the degradation of ribosome proteins that are overexpressed relative to their assembly partners. A speculative possibility is that Tom1 ubiquitinates a broad range of ribosomal proteins to promote their assembly (much as fusion to ubiquitin promotes assembly of Rps31; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Finley et al., 1989</xref>]), but if they fail to assemble within a given time interval, the ubiquitin conjugated by Tom1 serves to initiate degradation. However, the observation that genetic reductions of protein kinase A activity (which are predicted to diminish synthesis of ribosome proteins) suppress <italic>tom1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) seems inconsistent with the idea that Tom1 plays a direct positive role in ribosome assembly.</p><p>A phenotype of <italic>tom1<sup>CA</sup></italic> cells that we describe here that is particularly notable is that they are exquisitely sensitive to perturbations that alter the balance between production of individual ribosomal proteins or total ribosomal proteins and rRNAs. Specifically, <italic>tom1<sup>CA</sup></italic> mutants are unable to sustain growth upon overexpression of <italic>RPL26</italic>, are sensitive to loss of the Rpl4-specific chaperone Acl4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Stelter et al., 2015</xref>), are sensitive to reduction in expression (through deletion of one of two alleles) of a single ribosomal protein, and are hypersensitive to reduction of function in three different proteins involved in transcription by RNA polymerase I. Moreover, <italic>tom1</italic> mutants accumulate high levels of insoluble ribosomal proteins (which is consistent with their inability to degrade excess ribosomal proteins that may exist at any given point in time), and combining <italic>tom1</italic> with a mutation that causes an imbalance in ribosome production (e.g. <italic>tom1<sup>CA</sup> acl4∆</italic>) leads to an enormous increase in insoluble protein, suggestive of a collapse in cellular proteostasis. Notably, even the <italic>tom1∆</italic> single mutant accumulates more insoluble protein than any other PQC mutant that we examined, including the ERAD mutants <italic>doa10∆</italic> and <italic>hrd1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vembar and Brodsky, 2008</xref>), the ribosome QC mutant <italic>ltn1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bengtson and Joazeiro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Defenouillere et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Verma et al., 2013</xref>), the nuclear QC mutant <italic>san1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardner et al., 2005</xref>), or the cytosolic QC mutant <italic>ubr1∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eisele and Wolf, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heck et al., 2010</xref>). Taken together with our observations that Tom1 directly binds and ubiquitylates unassembled ribosome proteins, these data point to a direct and critical role for Tom1 in the cellular proteostasis network.</p><p>The hypersensitivity of <italic>tom1<sup>CA</sup></italic> cells to stoichiometric imbalances in ribosome components raises interesting questions as to why unassembled ribosomal proteins would be toxic, and whether feedback mechanisms exist to monitor and respond to failures in ERISQ. Regarding the first question, given that ribosomal proteins are highly expressed, positively charged nucleic acid binding proteins, their accumulation might interfere with RNA biology. Regarding feedback mechanisms, it is interesting to note that in human cells, reduction of rRNA expression by low-dose actinomycin D treatment results in poor assembly of several ribosomal proteins including Rpl5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dai and Lu, 2004</xref>), Rpl11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lohrum et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zhang et al., 2003</xref>), Rpl26 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), Rps7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2007</xref>) and Rps14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). These unassembled ribosomal proteins bind to and titrate ubiquitin ligase Mdm2, which leads to stabilization and accumulation of the Mdm2 substrate p53. This provides a sensitive feedback loop to reduce cell growth in response to stresses that impede ribosome assembly. It will be of great interest to determine whether a similar feedback mechanism operates in yeast, and how Huwe1 activity relates to the Mdm2–p53 feedback pathway described in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Is ERISQ relevant to cancer?</title><p>Dysfunctional ribosomal proteins and ribosome biogenesis has been linked to many diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Narla and Ebert, 2010</xref>). Particularly, given that one of the characteristic features of cancer is an increase in the overall rate of protein synthesis, it is clear that regulation of ribosome biogenesis is closely associated with tumor progression. Consistent with this expectation, RNA Pol I activity is highly elevated in many cancer cells and it leads to the enlargement of the nucleolus, which has been used as a marker for cancer for over 100 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Derenzini et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, two major human tumor suppressor proteins, pRB and p53, have been shown to repress the production of rRNA and the loss of these factors cause an up-regulation of ribosome biogenesis in cancer tissues, consistent with a close relationship between cancer and ribosome synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Montanaro et al., 2008</xref>). Up-regulation of ribosome production in cancer cells implies an enhanced dependency on QC mechanisms that survey ribosome assembly. However, the molecular pathway that mediates ERISQ in human cells has, up to now, remained unknown. Interestingly, several observations link Huwe1 function to cancer. Huwe1 is overexpressed in multiple human tumors, is essential for proliferation of a subset of tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adhikary et al., 2005</xref>), and is required for activation of Myc-inducible target genes including ribosomal proteins in colon carcinoma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peter et al., 2014</xref>). Our data suggest the intriguing hypothesis that accumulation of unassembled ribosomal proteins would titrate Huwe1, resulting in reductions in both Myc activity and transcription of genes that encode ribosomal proteins. Insights into the detailed molecular basis underlying ERISQ afforded by the discovery reported here will enable investigations into the biological relevance of ERISQ in human pathologies, including cancer, which may lead to novel concepts for therapy.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, growth conditions, and transformation</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>) were derived from BY4741 (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>his3∆1 leu2∆0 met15∆0 ura3∆0</italic>) or W303a (<italic>MAT</italic>a <italic>leu2-3,112 trp1-1 can1-100 ura3-1 ade2-1 his3-11,15</italic>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, including Davis Ng (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by Wade Harper as the Reviewing Editor and Randy Schekman as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Ribosomes represent a major site of protein quality control for newly synthesized proteins, and multiple mechanisms have been described for identifying various types of misfolded or incorrectly translated proteins emerging from the ribosome. By comparison, much less is known concerning quality control mechanisms for formation of the ribosome itself. It was initially found in 1977 by Warner that reduced ribosomal RNA expression did not affect the rate of production of many ribosomal proteins but that the &quot;excess&quot; ribosomal proteins were rapidly degraded. At the time, the mechanism of turnover of excess ribosomal proteins wasn't addressed and in fact, very little is known about how excess ribosomal proteins are degraded. This is in spite of the fact that production (and rapid turnover) of supernumerary ribosomal proteins has been linked with aneuploidy by the Amon lab and may also be a consequence of MYC overproduction for example.</p><p>This manuscript now identifies a major ubiquitin ligase in budding yeast responsible for turnover of excess ribosomal proteins as the HECT E3 TOM1. Using cells engineered to overexpress a ribosomal protein, the authors screened for non-essential E2s and E3s that stabilize the supernumerary ribosomal proteins – yielding TOM1 – and then performed a number of biochemical and genetic experiments to examine various aspects of the mechanism. Together with earlier work indicating degradation in the nucleus and the known location of TOM1 there, the model is that TOM1 is a factor that directly interacts with residues of ribosomal proteins that would normally be buried in an assembled ribosome. The authors also provide an initial series of experiments suggesting that HUWE1 is a potential ortholog for the E3 in mammals.</p><p>This is clearly and interesting and timely topic and both reviewers were pretty positive about the paper. Both reviewers felt that the evidence for the involvement of TOM1 in the process is clear. As indicated below, there were 4 major areas that the reviewers feel need to be addressed. These have to do, in part, to interpretation of the data and the possibility that other models for the basis of TOM1 function may not have been fully vetted. Some aspects of the study were somewhat unexplained or not entirely convincing, although in an initial study of a new quality control pathway, one would not expect everything to be resolved. It may be that some data already exists that will address the concerns and in some cases, specific controls or changes to the conclusions could address the issues.</p><p>We would very much like to see a revised version that addresses these issues.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Have the authors considered the possibility that the function of Tom1 is in ribosome assembly? This might explain its: 1) transient association in pulse-chase studies of Stelter et al. (Mol. Cell, 2015), 2) the preferential association with unassembled protein, 3) the major consequences of its deletion on protein homeostasis, 4) the accumulation of aggregated ribosomal proteins, 5) the synthetic genetic interactions with other assembly factors, and 6) the sensitivity to paromomycin. Indeed, the pattern of insoluble proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> of a Tom1 mutant is very similar to a deficiency of a known ribosomal assembly factor (Acl4). The assembly factor idea might better explain the bias for 60S proteins in the ubiquitination and mass spectrometry data. This is probably worth discussing, and if there is clear reasons to favor the QC function, to articulate/show those.</p><p>2) The experimental conditions used to analyze protein aggregation may be sub-optimal. The authors have co-opted a protocol from a chaperone paper, but the buffer is not great if one is analyzing ribosomal proteins: it has very low salt, no Magnesium, and 1 mM EDTA. Thus, under these conditions, the integrity of ribosomes and assembly intermediates will possibly be compromised (due to Magnesium chelation), with the low salt perhaps favoring aggregation. It may therefore be possible that the aggregation phenotype is perhaps exaggerated, especially if the consequence of Tom1 is the accumulation of ribosome assembly intermediates (see point 1 above). One possible experiment would be to perform sucrose gradients (where the conditions are more suitable) using <italic>tom1</italic> deletion cells to more directly visualize and separate intact ribosomes/polysomes from aggregates so a reader can assess the extent of aggregation? If the authors are concerned about the large size of polysomes interfering with the analysis, the sample could be digested with nuclease first to convert everything to monosomes.</p><p>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, it seems that an important control would be test whether overexpression of the 4E mutant of L26A (which is not a TOM1 client) would not be synthetic with tom1CA. In the absence of this, the effect might not be specific to an unassembled ribosomal protein, but just any misfolded protein.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors test the HECT domain E3 HUWE1 for its role in supernumerary ribosomal protein turnover in mammalian cells. There are 2 issues with the data that make it sub-optimal. First, the RNAi experiments do not meet the typical standards of two or more shRNAs or a rescue experiment (which would obviously be challenging in this case). Second, the authors examine accumulation of Rpl26 with HUWE1 depletion but they don't look at turnover. The authors should perform turnover assays to definitely demonstrate an effect on turnover. This is important for completeness and to maintain appropriate standards. Alternatively, the reviewers think that the paper could stand on its own with just the yeast data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.19105.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Have the authors considered the possibility that the function of Tom1 is in ribosome assembly?

The assembly factor idea might better explain the bias for 60S proteins in the ubiquitination and mass spectrometry data. This is probably worth discussing, and if there is clear reasons to favor the QC function, to articulate/show those.</italic> </p><p>This possibility was hotly debated within the lab. First of all we would like to note that there is not an appreciable bias towards 60S proteins in the insolubility assay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The argument that Tom1 is involved in degradation of ribosomal proteins that do not assemble seems inescapable to us, based on the evidence provided. To recap: Tom1 associates with unassembled ribosomal proteins, it is required for their ubiquitination and degradation in cells, and it directly ubiquitinates them in vitro. This is pretty straightforward evidence that it is an ubiquitin ligase that degrades ribosomal proteins that fail to assemble, which is what we claim. What is less straightforward is whether it might be partly to blame for assembly failures in <italic>tom1</italic> cells; i.e. does Tom1 also have a chaperone function that promotes assembly of ribosomal proteins? We believe we can rule out an ubiquitination-independent chaperone function resides in Tom1, because the ligase-dead point mutant behaves much like the deletion mutant (although in some assays the deletion has a modestly greater defect which could be due to an E3-independent chaperone function).</p><p>That leaves one possibility, which is that Tom1 ubiquitinates ribosomal proteins as they arrive in the nucleolus, and this ubiquitination serves to facilitate assembly in some way. If assembly does not occur, perhaps the ubiquitin then serves to nucleate assembly of an ubiquitin chain, leading to degradation. According to this idea, Tom1 has a dual role in promoting assembly and degrading what does not assemble. It is an intriguing idea but difficult to test in a compelling manner. To test it in trans would require an extremely fast-acting conditional mutation that wipes out Tom1 function. Otherwise, in any comparison of wild type and <italic>tom1Δ</italic> cells, one would be left with the problem of how to untangle an observed defect with a direct role for Tom1 in chaperoning the process, versus an indirect effect of undegraded, unassembled ribosomal proteins causing interference. Unfortunately, such a mutant does not exist. The alternative would be to make a cis mutant in a ribosomal protein. However our analysis of two different ribosomal proteins suggested the sites of ubiquitination are, at least in the two cases shown, on residues that are normally concealed in the assembled structure (and hence potentially of functional significance, making their mutation problematic). Adding to this problem is that ribosomal proteins are quite rich in ubiquitination sites. To address this important comment, we have added the following text to the Discussion: “Some of the <italic>tom1</italic> phenotypes noted above are suggestive of a potential positive role for Tom1 in the assembly of functional ribosomes. […] However, the observation that genetic reductions of protein kinase A activity (which are predicted to diminish synthesis of ribosome proteins) suppress <italic>tom1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>) seems inconsistent with the idea that Tom1 plays a direct positive role in ribosome assembly.”</p><p> <italic>2) The experimental conditions used to analyze protein aggregation may be sub-optimal. The authors have co-opted a protocol from a chaperone paper, but the buffer is not great if one is analyzing ribosomal proteins: it has very low salt, no Magnesium, and 1 mM EDTA. Thus, under these conditions, the integrity of ribosomes and assembly intermediates will possibly be compromised (due to Magnesium chelation), with the low salt perhaps favoring aggregation. It may therefore be possible that the aggregation phenotype is perhaps exaggerated, especially if the consequence of Tom1 is the accumulation of ribosome assembly intermediates (see point 1 above). One possible experiment would be to perform sucrose gradients (where the conditions are more suitable) using tom1 deletion cells to more directly visualize and separate intact ribosomes/polysomes from aggregates so a reader can assess the extent of aggregation? If the authors are concerned about the large size of polysomes interfering with the analysis, the sample could be digested with nuclease first to convert everything to monosomes.</italic> </p><p>We used low salt because the hydrophobic effect (which is thought to underlie most aggregation) is well-known to be exaggerated in high salt, and we were concerned that a high-salt buffer might exacerbate matters. Please note also that our method included a wash of the insoluble fraction with 500 mM salt to try to rule out aggregation of highly-charged proteins. Nevertheless, to address this comment more thoroughly we repeated an analysis of <italic>tom1Δ</italic> and wild type cells lysed in three different buffers: one that contains high salt and magnesium and two others that were used in previous reports (Kaganovich et al., 2008; Lu et al., 2014). In addition, we generated lysates by bead-beating of intact cells instead of detergent solubilization of spheroplasts. The new data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>. The amount of protein in the pellet fraction is greater in these experiments than what was observed with our previous method. Two factors may account for this: either bead-beating causes more denaturation during cell lysis, and/or the omission of a pellet wash step in new protocol leads to greater contamination of the pellet fraction by soluble proteins. Regardless, the amount of protein in the pellet fraction is consistently greater in <italic>tom1Δ</italic> cells, indicating that the observations we made previously were not an artifact of the buffer or lysis conditions employed.</p><p> <italic>3) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, it seems that an important control would be test whether overexpression of the 4E mutant of L26A (which is not a TOM1 client) would not be synthetic with tom1CA. In the absence of this, the effect might not be specific to an unassembled ribosomal protein, but just any misfolded protein.</italic> </p><p>To address this clever point, we repeated the spot assay shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> with <italic>tom1CA</italic> cells expressing Rpl26a-4E. Unlike Rpl26a-WT, Rpl26a- 4E did not cause growth inhibition of <italic>tom1CA</italic> cells when it was constitutively overexpressed from the <italic>GAL10</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p> <italic>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, the authors test the HECT domain E3 HUWE1 for its role in supernumerary ribosomal protein turnover in mammalian cells. There are 2 issues with the data that make it sub-optimal. First, the RNAi experiments do not meet the typical standards of two or more shRNAs or a rescue experiment (which would obviously be challenging in this case).

This is important for completeness and to maintain appropriate standards. Alternatively, the reviewers think that the paper could stand on its own with just the yeast data.</italic></p><p>To address these valid points, we repeated the analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> with <italic>HUWE1</italic> knockout cells, which were recently generated (Choe et al., 2016). Consistent with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, hRpl26<sup>FLAG</sup> made in excess accumulated in <italic>HUWE1</italic> knockout cells, while it remained at a low level in WT cells. In addition, we performed a cycloheximide-chase experiment, which showed that excess hRpl26FLAG in WT was unstable with a half-life of ~60 minutes, whereas the same protein was stabilized in <italic>HUWE1</italic> knockout cells. Overall, our additional data further supports the idea that Huwe1 mediated the ERISQ pathway in human cells.</p></body></sub-article></article>
