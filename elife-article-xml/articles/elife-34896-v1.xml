Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance. To distinguish direct effects of Cl<sup>-</sup> on the transporter from indirect effects via the driving force Δψ, we used whole endosome recording and report the first currents due to glutamate flux by the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs). Chloride allosterically activates the VGLUTs from both sides of the membrane, and we find that neutralization of an arginine in transmembrane domain four suffices for the lumenal activation. The dose dependence suggests that Cl<sup>-</sup> permeates through a channel and glutamate through a transporter. Competition between the anions nonetheless indicates that they use a similar permeation pathway. By controlling both ionic gradients and Δψ, endosome recording isolates different steps in the process of synaptic vesicle filling, suggesting distinct roles for Cl<sup>-</sup> in both allosteric activation and permeation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vesicular glutamate transport</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter packaging</kwd><kwd>endosome recording</kwd><kwd>allosteric activation</kwd><kwd>chloride</kwd><kwd>chloride conductance</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008568</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Roger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS09229-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chang</surname><given-names>Roger</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeckfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R77-6780</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eriksen</surname><given-names>Jacob</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37 MH50712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007100</institution-id><institution>Sandler Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Basic Sciences</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01 NS089713</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R01 NS08971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Edwards</surname><given-names>Robert H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Whole endosome recording shows that chloride interacts with vesicular glutamate transporters as both allosteric activator and permeant ion, and although the mode of permeation differs, chloride and glutamate use a related conduction pathway.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulated release of classical neurotransmitters by exocytosis requires their transport into synaptic vesicles. A H<sup>+</sup> electrochemical gradient (Δµ<sub>H+</sub>) generated by the vacuolar-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase provides the driving force for vesicular uptake of all classical neurotransmitters, and uptake of the principal excitatory transmitter glutamate depends primarily on the electrical component Δψ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naito and Ueda, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maycox et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tabb et al., 1992</xref>). Although Cl<sup>-</sup> entry dissipates Δψ, low concentrations of cytosolic Cl<sup>-</sup> nonetheless stimulate vesicular glutamate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Naito and Ueda, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maycox et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tabb et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartinger and Jahn, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wolosker et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Juge et al., 2010</xref>). Lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> has also been shown to stimulate glutamate uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schenck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Preobraschenski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>), but it has remained unclear whether this reflects a direct interaction with the transporter or an indirect effect through regulation of the driving force Δψ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>). Further, the vesicular glutamate transporters (VGLUTs) themselves exhibit a Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellocchio et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schenck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Preobraschenski et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>) that has the potential to increase the driving force Δψ when lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> is high, or dissipate Δψ when lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, the plasma membrane excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) that clear glutamate from the synaptic cleft also exhibit an associated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance. Glutamate activates the conductance associated with the EAATs, but these currents are not stoichiometrically coupled to transport, and Cl<sup>-</sup> is not required for glutamate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wadiche et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriza et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>). The Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance associated with the VGLUTs suggests functional resemblance to the EAATs even though these two protein families show no similarity at the level of primary sequence or tertiary structure.</p><p>The available radiotracer and fluorescence-based flux assays have greatly limited our understanding of vesicular glutamate transport. Synaptic vesicles from the brain accumulate radiolabeled glutamate in vitro, but reliance on the H<sup>+</sup> pump, the presence of other proteins and shifting ionic gradients make it difficult to determine the properties of the VGLUTs from this native preparation. Heterologous expression of the VGLUTs does not confer the robust activity observed with native synaptic vesicles, forcing reliance on the reconstitution of purified protein into artificial membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Juge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schenck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Preobraschenski et al., 2014</xref>). However, dependence of virtually all the available assays on a H<sup>+</sup> pump inextricably links the driving force Δψ to ionic gradients, making it impossible to disentangle the effects of Cl<sup>-</sup> on Δψ from direct effects on the transporter.</p><p>The electrophysiological analysis of transport-associated currents provides a way to circumvent these limitations. The independent control of Δψ in voltage clamp recordings provides a way to distinguish between ionic coupling and allosteric control by ions such as Cl<sup>-</sup>. In addition, dependence on Δψ as the driving force indicates that the VGLUTs are electrogenic and hence capable of producing detectable currents. However, slow turnover may limit the magnitude of transport-associated currents, and the VGLUTs are almost entirely intracellular, limiting access to electrophysiological recording. In previous work, we used misexpression of internalization-defective VGLUTs at the plasma membrane of <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes to demonstrate allosteric activation of the VGLUT-associated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance by external (lumenal) H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> independent of any effects of Cl<sup>-</sup> on the driving force that may occur under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>). However, we did not detect glutamate currents in this preparation, raising questions about the role of these mechanisms in vesicular glutamate transport. Since expression at the plasma membrane does not enable direct addition of glutamate to the cytosolic face of the VGLUTs, we have now used patch clamp recording from more physiologically relevant endosomal membranes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Whole endosome recording detects glutamate currents by the VGLUTs</title><p>Similar to other synaptic vesicle proteins, the wild type VGLUTs target to endosomes when expressed in non-neural cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foss et al., 2013</xref>). To produce enlarged endosomes amenable to the patch clamp technique, we cotransfected HEK293 cells with a constitutively active version of early endosome Rab5 (Q79L) as well as VGLUT fused to EGFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stenmark et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dong et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cang et al., 2013</xref>). After mechanical isolation of the enlarged GFP<sup>+</sup> endosomes, we performed whole endosome recording with a pipette solution containing 140 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> at pH 5 since this maximally activated the VGLUT-associated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and mimics the conditions in recycling synaptic vesicles. To minimize background currents due to endogenous conductances, we eliminated permeant cations from all solutions. We also included the Cl<sup>-</sup> channel blocker 5-nitro-2-(3-phenylpropylamino)benzoic acid (NPPB) in the pipette to inhibit endogenous Cl<sup>-</sup> currents since we had previously found that NPPB does not affect the VGLUT-associated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>). Using voltage ramps from −100 to +100 mV in endosomes expressing VGLUT1, we observe small but substantial inwardly rectifying currents in the absence of external Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,C</xref>). In the absence of permeant cations, these currents most likely reflect the efflux of Cl<sup>-</sup>. Controls expressing Q79L Rab5 alone show no inward currents due to the suppression of an endogenous Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance by lumenal (pipette) NPPB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). The addition of external Cl<sup>-</sup> (140 mM) does not consistently affect the inward current but substantially increases the outward currents associated with VGLUT1, with no effect observed in Q79L Rab5 controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The small size of the currents enables the low background to interfere with the precise determination of reversal potential, but shifts in the appropriate direction are consistent with the behavior of Cl<sup>-</sup> as a permeant ion. The currents also vary in magnitude, which might reflect differences in the expression on individual endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> insets). Analysis of the other two isoforms (VGLUT2 and 3) shows behavior similar to VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). It is possible that the isoforms differ in current amplitude but the selection of GFP<sup>+</sup> endosomes for recording makes it difficult to assess a role for differences in transporter expression. Like the VGLUTs expressed in oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>), VGLUTs expressed in endosomes thus exhibit a Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34896.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Chloride and glutamate currents in endosomes expressing VGLUT1.</title><p>(<bold>A,D</bold>) Whole endosome patch clamp recording configuration, with 140 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> at pH 5.0 and NPPB in the pipette, showing outward currents at positive lumenal potentials and inward currents at negative potentials.

Glutamate (20 mM) produces similar but slightly smaller outward currents than Cl<sup>-</sup> added to the same endosomes, with a negative shift in reversal potential supporting behavior as a permeant ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). To test specificity, we used the closely related amino acid aspartate, which is not recognized by the VGLUTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Maycox et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlson et al., 1989</xref>). In contrast to glutamate, aspartate produces no outward currents and cells expressing mutant Rab5 alone show no response to glutamate or aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>). VGLUT2 and 3 exhibit outward currents similar to VGLUT1 in response to glutamate and not aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D–F</xref>). Further, the dye Evans Blue, which is known to block vesicular glutamate transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhry et al., 2008</xref>), inhibits both Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate currents with submicromolar potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The residual currents despite Evans Blue presumably reflect endogenous HEK cell conductances. Despite the difficulty inherent in recording transport-associated currents from intracellular membranes, we show that endosome recording can thus detect glutamate transport currents mediated by the VGLUTs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Allosteric activation of the VGLUTs by lumenal and cytosolic Cl<sup>−</sup></title><p>To understand how Cl<sup>-</sup> stimulates vesicular glutamate transport, we first used endosome recording to characterize the role of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>. As anticipated, reduction of the lumenal (pipette) Cl<sup>-</sup> to 10 mM effectively eliminates the inward currents (due to Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux) mediated by VGLUT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). However, the reduction also prevents outward currents due to both external Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate, and 30 mM lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> has a similar effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

However, this mutation spares the inward currents, indicating that the residue has a specific role in uptake of both anions but not Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux. It is more difficult to evaluate the baseline inward currents due to Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux than the outward currents due to anion addition, but all three isoforms (including R88A in VGLUT2 and R93A in VGLUT3) exhibit the same phenomenon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C,E,H</xref>). Efflux of Cl<sup>-</sup> may thus involve a mechanism distinct from glutamate translocation or even Cl<sup>-</sup> entry. Alternatively, this arginine may affect rectification of the currents.</p><p>Third, we neutralized the conserved arginine in TM4 (Arg176 in VGLUT1, Arg184 in VGLUT2 and Arg189 in VGLUT3). As previously shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), both inward and outward currents require lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Despite the absence of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>, R176A VGLUT1 allows robust outward currents due to the external addition of Cl<sup>-</sup> or glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>), and R184A and R189A have the same effects in VGLUT2 and 3, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C,F,I</xref>). To test the role of the positive charge in recognition of Cl<sup>-</sup>, we replaced Arg176 in VGLUT1 by the similarly cationic amino acid lysine (R176K) or by neutral glutamine (R176Q). Like wild type VGLUT1, R176K exhibits currents in the presence but not the absence of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the R176Q mutant does not exhibit currents even with lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>, making it difficult to assess the impact on Cl<sup>-</sup> recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Western analysis indicated that all of the VGLUT1 mutants are expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2F</xref>); although the levels vary, we selected GFP<sup>+</sup> endosomes for all of these experiments and the functional R176K mutant was expressed at levels similar to nonfunctional R80A and R176Q. To test further the role of Arg176 in Cl<sup>-</sup> recognition, we took advantage of an internalization-defective form of VGLUT2 previously used to assess Cl<sup>-</sup> currents across the plasma membrane in HEK cells as well as <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>). As previously shown, whole cell recording of HEK cells expressing internalization-defective but otherwise wild type VGLUT2 exhibit inwardly rectifying Cl<sup>-</sup> currents that depend on high external Cl<sup>-</sup> as well as low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). In contrast, R184A VGLUT2 exhibits inward currents independent of external Cl<sup>-</sup>. In both whole endosome and whole cell configurations, dependence on Cl<sup>-</sup> thus requires a cationic residue at this position in TM4, strongly suggesting that lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> normally binds at this site, and neutralization of this residue suffices to fulfill the allosteric activation required for both Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance and glutamate transport. Anion permeation persists despite this mutation, further indicating that this residue is required only for allosteric activation by Cl<sup>-</sup>. Allosteric activation and permeation thus involve distinct interactions of Cl<sup>-</sup> with the transporter.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Chloride and glutamate translocate using distinct mechanisms but compete for permeation</title><p>Many of the same factors (such as Δψ and lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>) activate both glutamate and Cl<sup>-</sup> currents, raising questions about the relationship between the two permeant anions.

Originally suggested on the basis of VGLUT coreconstitution with a H<sup>+</sup> pump that might have reflected an effect of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> on Δψ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Schenck et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>), the use of voltage clamp to measure currents at the plasma membrane demonstrated allosteric regulation of the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>). Endosome recording now demonstrates that allosteric regulation by lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> extends to glutamate transport. Remarkably, the analysis of mutations shows that lumenal activation appears to depend on the interaction of Cl<sup>-</sup> with a single, highly conserved arginine in TM4. This does not exclude a role for other residues in the recognition of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> but neutralization of the TM4 arginine appears sufficient to confer the activation normally provided by Cl<sup>-</sup>. The results predict that this basic residue normally faces the vesicle lumen and that in the absence of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>, it prevents both vesicular glutamate transport and the associated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance.</p><p>Comparison of the currents due to Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate supports a fundamental difference in the mode of permeation. The Cl<sup>-</sup> currents do not saturate with increasing concentration of external Cl<sup>-</sup>, consistent with permeation through an ion channel. In contrast, glutamate saturates with a Km ~0.5 mM (in 10 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>), very similar to that observed for glutamate uptake by synaptic vesicles and for synaptic vesicle acidification by glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>). Despite these differences, Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation and glutamate flux both depend on lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> for allosteric activation (as well as on Δψ for the driving force).</p><p>Consistent with similar requirements for activation of the conductances, endosome recording now shows that Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate compete for permeation. The inhibition of glutamate uptake by high concentrations of Cl<sup>-</sup> has generally been interpreted as reflecting dissipation of the driving force Δψ. Recording endosome currents under voltage clamp now shows that Cl<sup>-</sup> exerts a dramatic effect on glutamate permeation independent of Δψ. The apparent affinity for glutamate shifts by ~100 fold despite only a 10-fold change in Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration, raising the possibility of multiple Cl<sup>-</sup> binding sites. Consistent with this possibility, Cl<sup>-</sup> allosterically activates the VGLUTs from both cytoplasmic and lumenal sides of the membrane. The cooperativity for glutamate also differs in 1 and 10 mM Cl<sup>-</sup>, further supporting the possibility of interaction at two sites. The precise relationship between the Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate remains unclear and they permeate using distinct mechanisms, but the two anions thus appear to use a similar permeation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) subject to the same regulation by lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>, through neutralization of the arginine in TM4. Although Cl<sup>-</sup> does not influence glutamate transport by the plasma membrane EAATs, they also exhibit an uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Wadiche et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arriza et al., 1997</xref>). In contrast to the VGLUTs, however, recent work on the EAATs has suggested that the permeation pathway for Cl<sup>-</sup> is entirely distinct from that for glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ryan and Mindell, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cater et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Machtens et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To determine the role of the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance in synaptic vesicle filling with glutamate, a recent study used the dye Rose Bengal as a specific inhibitor of glutamate transport but not the VGLUT-associated Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>). However, the concentration of dye used to test the effect on Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance was 10-fold lower than that used to inhibit glutamate transport. We now find that the established VGLUT inhibitor Evans Blue reduces both Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate currents with a similar IC<sub>50</sub> ~0.2 µM. The results indicate conservation of the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance among all VGLUT isoforms, consistent with its importance. However, understanding its physiological role requires more specific tools to inhibit Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation by the VGLUTs.</p><p>What is the relationship between allosteric activation and permeation by Cl<sup>-</sup>? Since neutralization of the lumenally oriented arginine in TM4 confers both Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate currents, this residue cannot be required for permeation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that cytosolic Cl<sup>-</sup> allosterically activates from within the permeation pathway.</p><p>The manipulation of ionic gradients independent of Δψ at both the plasma membrane and the endosome has also enabled us to isolate different stages in the process of synaptic vesicle filling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), in a way that is not possible in the presence of an active H<sup>+</sup> pump and changes in the ionic gradients across the synaptic vesicle membrane, such as those recently reported for Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>). Initially, the Cl<sup>-</sup> trapped in recycling vesicles by endocytosis confers the allosteric activation required for glutamate transport. In addition to the H<sup>+</sup> pump, the efflux of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> might contribute to the Δψ that drives glutamate uptake, but since the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance associated with VGLUTs requires allosteric activation by low lumenal pH, other anion carriers may be responsible for the Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux that immediately follows endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Martineau et al., 2017</xref>). At the same time, cytosolic Cl<sup>-</sup> (~20 mM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Price and Trussell, 2006</xref>]) might be expected to compete with glutamate for permeation. However, cytosolic Cl<sup>-</sup> also provides allosteric activation of the VGLUTs and the outwardly directed Cl<sup>-</sup> gradient will impede Cl<sup>-</sup> influx. In addition, the higher affinity of VGLUTs for glutamate predicts that ~10 mM cytosolic glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Storm-Mathisen and Ottersen, 1990</xref>) should produce maximal uptake despite even higher cytosolic Cl<sup>-</sup>. As glutamate entry dissipates Δψ, disinhibiting the H<sup>+</sup> pump, the resulting drop in lumenal pH activates the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance associated with VGLUTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksen et al., 2016</xref>). The robust inward currents observed by endosome recording suggest that the resulting Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux will support Δψ despite the accumulation of lumenal H<sup>+</sup>, and so maintain the driving force for glutamate uptake. The differences in permeation by Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate would further serve to retain the glutamate as vesicles fill, but allow Cl<sup>-</sup> efflux to sustain Δψ. Indeed, we previously found that synaptic vesicles acidified in glutamate exhibit a more stable ΔpH than vesicles acidified in Cl<sup>-</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hnasko et al., 2010</xref>) and these results indicate the mechanism: the loss of lumenal H<sup>+</sup> requires loss of lumenal anion for charge balance, and glutamate uses an alternating access mechanism whereas Cl<sup>-</sup> permeates through channel. Finally, the replacement of lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> by glutamate effectively inactivates the VGLUTs, preventing the leakage of glutamate from filled vesicles.</p><p>Taken together, the results suggest that the Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance associated with vesicular glutamate transport serves to maintain Δψ despite the accumulation of ΔpH, and allosteric regulation serves to coordinate flux of the two anions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>VGLUT1</td><td>Edwards lab</td><td>NM_053859.2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>VGLUT2</td><td>Edwards lab</td><td valign="bottom">NM_053427.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>)</td><td>VGLUT3</td><td>Edwards lab</td><td valign="bottom">NM_153725.1</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>HEK293T cells</td><td>UCSF Cell Culture Fac.</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Transfected construct</td><td>pEGFP-N1</td><td>Clontech</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Mouse anti-actin</td><td>Sigma</td><td>MAB1501R</td><td>(1:3000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Guinea pig anti-VGLUT1</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>AB5905</td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>PolyJet</td><td>SignaGen</td><td>SL100688</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>Lipofectamine 2000</td><td>Gibco Life Technologies</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Prism 5.0</td><td>GraphPad</td><td/><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Constructs</title><p>All three isoforms of the <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> vesicular glutamate transporters (NCBI Reference Sequences: NM_053859.2, NM_053427.1, NM_153725.1) were amplified by PCR using primers designed to include a Kozak sequence (5’-CGCCACC-3’) at the 5’ end as well as the necessary restriction sites for subcloning: NheI/AflII for pVGLUT1- and pVGLUT2-EGFP and NheI/AgeI for pVGLUT3-EGFP.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Richard Aldrich (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christof Grewer (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This manuscript from the Edwards lab presents a very nice, and important new approach to studying the VGLUT vesicular glutamate transporters. The authors take advantage of a method, developed for studying organellar channels, to patch clamp genetically enlarged endosomes that express the VGLUT transporter. The data shown here demonstrate the method and provide convincing, well-controlled arguments that the measured currents indeed reflect the activity of VGLUT transporters. Using the method, the authors then tackle a long-standing vexation in the field, the effects of Cl<sup>-</sup> on the transport process. Previous work suggests that the role of Cl<sup>-</sup> is complex, but the previously available experimental systems have not had the resolution to definitively separate the multiple effects of Cl. Here, though, the authors present strong evidence for both an uncoupled Cl<sup>-</sup> conductance and an allosteric activation of glutamate transport by Cl<sup>-</sup>. Furthermore, they show that Cl<sup>-</sup> competes with glutamate for the transport pathway, for the first time convincingly arguing that the pathways for the two substrates overlap. Finally, mutations of several arginine residues have differing effects on VGLUT properties, with one of them (R176) seeming to abolish the requirement for luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> to activate outward currents.</p><p>All three reviewers expressed enthusiasm for the work. There were, however, several concerns that the authors need to address.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It should be possible to convert the currents in response to voltage ramps to actual I-V plots. This would make it much easier for the reader to assess reversal potentials and whether the current are rectifying or not.</p><p>2) Interpretation of data in Figure 4C is problematic. If Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate competed for the same binding site, then 10 fold change in Cl<sup>-</sup> concentration should lead to 10-fold change in the affinity for Glu, not 100. Either there are two Cl ions competing with glutamate cooperatively or something else is going on. Additionally, what causes the much higher cooperativity of the glutamate dose response at 10 mM chloride vs. 1 mM chloride? The Hill coefficients should be stated in the text.</p><p>3) Is there a reason why Evans Blue does not result in complete inhibition of the VGLUT currents?</p><p>4) How is the expression level of VGLUTs controlled? Is the quantification in Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 2D, where the currents through distinct VGLUTs are compared valid? Similarly, how can currents through mutant transporters be compared if they are not controlled quantitatively for protein expression?</p><p>5) Luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> produces allosteric activation with very low apparent affinity in 50 mM range. That seems quite low for a binding reaction, though possible. It would be important to show that this is, indeed a saturable process and to construct a complete activation curve.</p><p>6) Potentiation of glutamate currents in the presence of 10 mM external chloride is less than 2 fold. This hardly can be called &quot;great&quot; potentiation. In fact, it almost appears that the glutamate and Cl<sup>-</sup> currents are additive. Could that be the case? How would one establish glutamate that the cytoplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> potentiates glutamate transport through an allosteric effect?</p><p>7) I do not see the data showing that Br<sup>-</sup> activates glutamate currents. Figure 2—figure supplement 1 does not seem to show this. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the reversal potential changes going from 20 mM glutamate to 140 mM Br<sup>-</sup> are vastly different for distinct VGLUTs, which is confusing.</p><p>8) Mutation in TM4 appears to effectively inhibit inward currents. Thus, it must affect the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway. In fact, it is difficult to understand how the same mutation inhibits Cl<sup>-</sup> current in one direction (outward) but not the other (inward).</p><p>9) Generally speaking, the data on TM4 mutants seem limited. The conclusion that neutralization of R176 is the mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> allosteric action seems premature. At the very least, one would consider making more subtle mutations, such as R to Q and R to K to further validate the hypothesis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34896.017</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It should be possible to convert the currents in response to voltage ramps to actual I-V plots.

Cooperativity for Cl<sup>-</sup> is distinctly possible, and there appear to be two sites for allosteric activation by Cl<sup>-</sup>, one cytosolic and the other lumenally oriented. We have now included this point in the text of the Results and Discussion. We have also included Hill coefficients for glutamate under the two conditions—they do show a substantial difference in cooperativity which might be related to the large shift in affinity due to Cl<sup>-</sup>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Is there a reason why Evans Blue does not result in complete inhibition of the VGLUT currents?</p></disp-quote><p>We presume that this reflects endogenous (background) conductances that would not be inhibited by Evans Blue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How is the expression level of VGLUTs controlled?

We agree that fluorescence does not provide a quantitative estimate of expression, but the isoforms do not show major differences in the currents (Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2, Figure 2—figure supplement 2), reducing the likelihood of a major difference in expression. In the case of point mutants, we have nonetheless used quantitative western analysis to assess average expression for each mutant construct. Figure 3—figure supplement 2F now shows both a representative immunoblot (above) and quantitation of multiple transfections (below). The results indicate expression equivalent to wild type of the inactive R314A (TM7) mutant, and expression by the active R176K mutant similar to the inactive R80A and R176Q. In addition to the use of GFP<sup>+</sup> endosomes, average expression of the different constructs thus does not correlate with activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Luminal Cl<sup>-</sup> produces allosteric activation with very low apparent affinity in 50 mM range.

Although comparison of different lumenal contents requires different endosomes, we have now added Figure 2—figure supplement 1 which presents the inward and outward currents in different external Cl<sup>-</sup>. The inward currents do not saturate, presumably because they represent efflux of Cl<sup>-</sup> and higher lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> confers larger efflux and inward currents. However, the outward currents do not increase from 50 to 140 mM, consistent with a role for lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> in allosteric activation rather than permeation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Potentiation of glutamate currents in the presence of 10 mM external chloride is less than 2 fold. This hardly can be called &quot;great&quot; potentiation. In fact, it almost appears that the glutamate and Cl<sup>-</sup> currents are additive. Could that be the case? How would one establish that the cytoplasmic Cl<sup>-</sup> potentiates glutamate transport through an allosteric effect?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the measurement of currents makes it difficult to distinguish which of the two ions is responsible. This is why we included Figure 2G. This shows that 10 mM Cl<sup>-</sup> has a much bigger effect on outward current magnitude in the presence of glutamate than its absence, excluding additivity and arguing for allostery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) I do not see the data showing that Br<sup>-</sup> activates glutamate currents. Figure 2—figure supplement 1 does not seem to show this. In Figure 2—figure supplement 1, the reversal potential changes going from 20 mM glutamate to 140 mM Br<sup>-</sup> are vastly different for distinct VGLUTs, which is confusing.</p></disp-quote><p>We have interpreted the results with lumenal Br<sup>-</sup> in light of the finding that 0 and 10 mM lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> do not suffice to confer the outward Cl<sup>-</sup> and glutamate currents (Figure 2 and Figure 2—figure supplement 1). Both glutamate and Br<sup>-</sup> shift reversal potential in the negative direction, but the extent varies depending on the magnitude of inward currents, making it difficult to draw conclusions from the extent of shift, as noted in point #1 above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Mutation in TM4 appears to effectively inhibit inward currents. Thus, it must affect the Cl<sup>-</sup> permeation pathway. In fact, it is difficult to understand how the same mutation inhibits Cl<sup>-</sup> current in one direction (outward) but not the other (inward).</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 3G (R176A) shows minimal inward currents because the lumen contains no permeant anion. External Cl<sup>-</sup> still produces outward currents, so the permeation pathway appears intact. Perhaps the concern is instead with Figure 3D, which shows persistent inward but no outward currents with the R80A mutant. It is difficult to understand how the same mutation might affect flux unidirectionally, but it is also more problematic to evaluate the constitutive inward currents than the outward currents due to addition of Cl<sup>-</sup> or glutamate. The effect of this mutation thus remains less certain than the others, but the effect nonetheless persists in all three isoforms, and we have included these considerations in the text of the Results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Generally speaking, the data on TM4 mutants seem limited. The conclusion that neutralization of R176 is the mechanism of Cl<sup>-</sup> allosteric action seems premature. At the very least, one would consider making more subtle mutations, such as R to Q and R to K to further validate the hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have now analyzed both the charge-preserving R176K and neutralizing R176Q mutations. Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, E now shows that R176K still requires lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup>, consistent with a role for this cationic residue in Cl<sup>-</sup> recognition. However, R176Q does not confer any currents even with high lumenal Cl<sup>-</sup> (Figure 3—figure supplement 2C, and the lack of activity makes it impossible to assess Cl<sup>-</sup> dependence. These two mutants also express at similar levels, making it unlikely that a difference in expression accounts for the difference in activity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
