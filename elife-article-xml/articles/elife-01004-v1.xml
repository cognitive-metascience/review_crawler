We identified a novel mode of communication by which apoptotic cells induce additional apoptosis in the same tissue. Strong induction of apoptosis in one compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc causes apoptosis of cells in the other compartment, indicating that dying cells can release long-range death factors. We identified Eiger, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog, as the signal responsible for apoptosis-induced apoptosis (AiA). Eiger is produced in apoptotic cells and, through activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway, is able to propagate the initial apoptotic stimulus. We also show that during coordinated cell death of hair follicle cells in mice, TNF-α is expressed in apoptotic cells and is required for normal cell death. AiA provides a mechanism to explain cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.01004.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.01004.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01004.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The tissues of developing organisms can be shaped by apoptosis, a form of regulated cell killing.

This process plays a major role in development and tissue homeostasis, and abnormal regulation of apoptosis is associated with a variety of human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>). Dying cells can secrete signals that will stimulate the recruitment of phagocytes (find-me signals) as well as expose signals on their surface to facilitate their engulfment (eat-me signals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lauber et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ravichandran, 2003</xref>). However, apoptosis has been traditionally regarded as a silent process that does not affect surrounding tissues. Only more recently has it become clear that apoptotic cells are the source of signals that can have profound effects on their neighbors. Cells that undergo apoptosis in response to stress and injury can secrete mitogenic and morphogenetic signaling proteins to stimulate growth and tissue repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann and Steller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Greco, 2013</xref>). These factors include Wnt, Dpp/Bmps and Hedgehog (Hh) proteins, which all play major roles in the regulation of growth and patterning during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perez-Garijo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ryoo et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fan and Bergmann, 2008</xref>). Mitogenic signaling by apoptotic cells has been reported for a diversity of animals, from <italic>Hydra</italic>, to flat worms, <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates, and it has been implicated in regeneration, wound healing and tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tseng et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chera et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergmann and Steller, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Li et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pellettieri et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). This mechanism appears well suited to communicate cellular loss to stem and progenitor cells in the tissue environment to stimulate proliferation and tissue repair. On the other hand, large groups of cells often undergo coordinated death during development and under conditions of severe tissue injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glucksmann, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobson et al., 1997</xref>). Classic examples for such group suicide behavior in normal development include the elimination of the tadpod tail during amphibian metamorphosis, and the removal of interdigital membranes during digit individualization in vertebrates. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, apoptosis plays a crucial role in several morphogenetic events, sculpting tissues and organs, removing a large number of cells in a coordinated manner and inducing cellular reorganization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lohmann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Link et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Manjon et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Suzanne et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Suzanne and Steller, 2013</xref>). In vertebrates, another example of communal death is the regressive phase of the hair follicle (HF), which undergoes cycles of growth (anagen), degeneration (catagen) and rest (telogen) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hardy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fuchs, 2007</xref>). In catagen, all the cells in the lower portion of the HF are eliminated by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lindner et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Botchkareva et al., 2006</xref>). In all these cases, cell death takes place in a very rapid and highly synchronized manner. However, it is not known how this cohort behavior is achieved. Likewise, many pathological states are associated with extensive cell death, which leads to severe damage and can have grave consequences for patients. Examples include alcohol-/drug-induced liver failure, viral infection, cardiac infarction, ischemic stroke and cachexia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sharma and Anker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kang and Izumo, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guicciardi and Gores, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yuan, 2009</xref>). In all these pathologies, apoptosis accounts for widespread cell loss and is thought to contribute to patient mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Favaloro et al., 2012</xref>). One possible explanation for all these ‘mass suicide’ phenomena is that apoptotic cells may release signals to coordinate their ‘communal death’.</p><p>Here we investigated whether apoptotic cells are able to produce signals that can explain the coordinated behavior of groups of dying cells. We observed that massive induction of apoptosis in the posterior compartment of <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs caused non-autonomous apoptosis at a considerable distance in the anterior compartment. Moreover, apoptosis of cells in the anterior compartment requires signaling from apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment, indicating that apoptosis-induced-apoptosis (AiA) is an active phenomenon. We next explored the mechanism underlying AiA and found that apoptotic cells produce Eiger, the TNF homolog in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Eiger activates the JNK pathway in neighboring cells and induces them to die. Finally, we examined whether AiA also occurs in vertebrates and whether it plays a physiological role for the coordinated death of groups of cells. We found that during the regressive phase (catagen) of the HF, apoptotic cells produce TNF-α. Inhibition of TNF-α disrupts the coordinated death of HF cells in catagen, indicating that this mechanism plays a physiological role to maintain synchronicity in the HF cycle. Taken together, these observations reveal a novel mechanism to coordinate cohort behavior of dying cells that is seen both in normal development and under pathological conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Undead cells promote non-autonomous apoptosis</title><p>To reveal novel types of signaling induced by apoptotic cells we made use of ‘undead’ cells: apoptotic cells that are kept alive by the expression of the baculovirus caspase inhibitor p35 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hay et al., 1994</xref>). Under these conditions, cells initiate the apoptotic cascade but cannot execute cell death because the activity of effector caspases is blocked. Although apoptotic cells are normally very rapidly cleared in living tissues, undead cells persist for long times and thereby permit analysis of signaling events associated with the induction of apoptosis. We used the Gal4/UAS system for transgene expression of the pro-apoptotic gene <italic>hid</italic> and the caspase inhibitor <italic>p35</italic> in the posterior compartment of wing imaginal discs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brand and Perrimon, 1993</xref>). As expected, we observed ectopic Wg expression and discs with abnormal and in many cases overgrown posterior compartments due to increased cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Undead cells contain high levels of cleaved caspases and were visualized by staining with activated caspase-3 antibody, which recognizes cleaved effector caspases as well as the activity of the initiator caspase Dronc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan and Bergmann, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, we also observed large numbers of apoptotic cells in the anterior compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Under these conditions, we typically saw two large clusters of dying cells in the wing pouch. It appears that cells in this region of the wing disc are more susceptible to apoptosis, as indicated by the fact that higher rates of cell death within this region were also observed after X-irradiation and <italic>hid</italic> over-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moon et al., 2005</xref>). Interestingly, caspase-3 staining of apoptotic cells in the anterior compartment differed significantly from that seen in undead cells. Although active caspase-3 immunoreactivity was cytoplasmatic and diffuse in undead cells, the staining of cells in the anterior compartment was punctate and intense, indicating that these cells are dying (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To confirm this idea, we performed TUNEL labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, undead cells in the posterior compartment did not show TUNEL staining, but caspase-3-positive cells in the anterior compartment also displayed distinct TUNEL labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These findings indicate that undead cells in the posterior compartment of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc have the ability to stimulate the induction of apoptosis at a distance in a different compartment.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01004.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Undead cells promote apoptosis in neighboring cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wing disc of the genotype <italic>hh-Gal4&gt;UAS-GFP</italic> showing wild-type <italic>wg</italic> expression (blue in <bold>A</bold>, white in <bold>A</bold>′) and normal levels of apoptosis, visualized by cleaved-caspase-3 (casp) staining (red in <bold>A</bold>, white in <bold>A</bold>′′).

Furthermore, non-autonomous apoptosis is not restricted to the wing imaginal disc, as we also observed apoptosis in the anterior compartment of other discs, such as the haltere or the leg discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). On the other hand, we did not observe apoptosis in the eye-antennal discs, suggesting this is not a general systemic response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

(1997)</xref> reported non-autonomous apoptosis upon ricin overexpression, which they explained as being an indirect consequence of changes in proliferation during compartment size accommodation. Since in our experiments posterior compartments were usually enlarged, we considered the possibility that non-autonomous apoptosis is the consequence of a size compensation mechanism across compartments to maintain the overall size of the disc. To investigate this possibility, we manipulated the size of the posterior compartment by downregulation of dMyc. dMyc is a key regulator of tissue growth, and downregulation of dMyc leads to a reduction of cell and tissue size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Johnston et al., 1999</xref>). We reasoned that if non-autonomous apoptosis is the consequence of the increased size of the posterior compartment, then this phenomenon should not take place under conditions where the size of the posterior compartment is normal or reduced. Therefore, we generated posterior compartments that express <italic>hid</italic> and <italic>p35</italic> together with dMyc RNAi. Under these conditions, we still observed undead cells, as revealed by cleaved caspase-3 staining, in a compartment with significantly reduced size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).

Here, we demonstrate that signaling by apoptotic cells is not limited to the production of proliferative signals: dying cells can generate pro-apoptotic signals that induce apoptosis in neighboring cells. We show that the induction of this apoptosis is triggered by Eiger, the ortholog of TNF in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which in turn activates the JNK pathway and leads to cell death in a non-autonomous manner. Furthermore, we were able to provide evidence for the existence of AiA under physiological conditions in mice. We found that during catagen, the regressive phase of the hair cycle, apoptotic cells in the lower and transient portion of the HF also express TNF-α. Significantly, TNF-α is required for coordinated cell death in the HF. Taken together, these results suggest that AiA plays an important physiological role for the coordination of cohort cell death.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Apoptosis-induced-apoptosis as a mechanism to propagate cell death within a tissue</title><p>Our experiments demonstrate that induction of apoptosis in one compartment results in induction of non-autonomous apoptosis in the neighboring compartment. This is true under many different conditions: both when we generate undead cells (expressing <italic>rpr</italic>/<italic>hid</italic> and <italic>p35</italic>) or upon induction of genuine apoptosis (expressing <italic>rpr</italic>/<italic>hid</italic> alone); once there is ectopic expression of mitogens that leads to excessive proliferation and growth or while blocking mitogenic production or growth of the compartment.</p><p>One intriguing observation is that this non-autonomous cell death usually displays a pattern consisting of two groups of cells in the wing pouch. One possible explanation for this is that the affected cells are the most susceptible to the death signal. In fact, the regions of the wing pouch where we observe the non-autonomous cell death are also more prone to cell death as a response to different apoptotic stimuli, such as irradiation or <italic>hid</italic> over-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Milan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moon et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Another possibility to explain why we observe cell death at a distance would be that dying cells are producing other signals that inhibit apoptosis. This protective signal would diffuse only short range, and in this way the distance of cells to the border would determine the ratio between the pro-apoptotic and the protective signal, tipping the balance in favor of death or survival. In fact, it has been shown that cells neighboring apoptotic cells downregulate Hippo pathway and consequently activate Diap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grusche et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sun and Irvine, 2011</xref>). Another good candidate for such an anti-apoptotic signal would be Wg, as it is expressed in an opposite pattern from the non-autonomous apoptosis and is also diffusing from apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment. However, we tried to modify Wg levels in different ways and we did not observe any change in the apoptosis pattern (data not shown).</p><p>On the other hand, in physiological conditions such as the coordinated cell death of HF cells observed in mice, it would be expected that signaling between apoptotic cells would occur at a much shorter range, probably affecting the immediate neighbors. In any case, the observation that TNF-α is exclusively detected in apoptotic cells and the fact that its inhibition leads to desynchronization of the HF cycle strongly suggests that AiA can be a mechanism to coordinate cell death within a tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The TNF and JNK pathways are required for apoptosis-induced-apoptosis</title><p>In our experimental systems, AiA requires both the TNF and JNK signaling pathways. Eiger is produced by apoptotic cells in the posterior compartment of the wing disc and it activates JNK in cells of the neighboring compartment, inducing them to die. Downregulation of Eiger in the posterior compartment or JNK in the anterior compartment was able to suppress AiA. However, it remains to be elucidated whether Eiger directly diffuses to the cells in the anterior compartment, or if some other mechanism is responsible for the activation of JNK in dying cells in the anterior compartment. Recently, it was shown that, upon wounding, JNK activity can be propagated at a distance through a feed-forward loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wu et al., 2010</xref>). Significantly, AiA is not restricted to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing disc. We obtained evidence for a role of TNF-α-mediated AiA during the destruction of the hair follicle (HF) in catagen, the regressive phase of the hair cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). TNF-α plays a known role to promote cell death and has been previously implicated in HF progression, wound healing and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Werner and Grose, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tong and Coulombe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bohm et al., 2010</xref>). However, the cellular source of TNF-α remained unknown and it was previously not appreciated that apoptotic cells can be the source of these signals. Our results suggest that AiA and at least some of the underlying mechanism have been conserved in evolution to promote coordinated cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Significance of AiA in development and disease</title><p>The observation that apoptotic cells can signal to other cells in their environment and instruct them to die has potentially many important implications. On the one hand, there are situations where propagation of an apoptotic stimulus may be a useful mechanism to achieve the rapid and coordinated death of large cell populations. Our experiments in mice show that this can be the case during the catagen phase of the HF cycle. There are many other examples of cell death being used during development to sculpt tissues and organs, including the removal of structures during metamorphosis (tadpole tail, larval organs in insects, elimination of inappropriate sex organs in mammals, deletion of the amnio serosa during insect embryogenesis) and the separation of digits through apoptosis of the interdigital webbing in many vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glucksmann, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fuchs and Steller, 2011</xref>). In all these cases, AiA may facilitate cohort behavior and contribute to the rapid and complete elimination of large fields of cells.</p><p>Propagation of cell death may also be an efficient way to prevent infection. It is known that cells respond to viral infection by entering apoptosis and in this way impede the replication of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barber, 2001</xref>). The process of AiA would extend apoptosis to the neighboring cells, preventing also their infection and thus avoiding the spread of the virus.</p><p>However, propagation of apoptosis may be detrimental in pathological conditions where excessive cell death underlies the etiology of the disease. This may be the case for neurodegenerative disorders, hepatic diseases, cardiac infarction, etc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Thompson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Favaloro et al., 2012</xref>). In all these cases it remains to be studied whether extensive amounts of apoptosis that are observed in the affected tissues are a direct consequence of cell damage in an autonomous manner or if part of the cell loss could be attributed to a process of propagation through AiA.</p><p>Finally, AiA may play a role in cancer. It is known that radiotherapy in humans can induce biological effects in non-irradiated cells at a considerable distance, a phenomenon called radiation-induced bystander effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prise and O’Sullivan, 2009</xref>). Our current findings provide a possible explanation for some of these effects. Therefore, large-scale induction of apoptosis by AiA may contribute to successful cancer therapy. TNF family proteins are being used as models for drug development aimed to treat cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ashkenazi, 2008</xref>). Furthermore, Eiger, the only TNF member in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, has a known role in the elimination of pre-tumoral <italic>scrib</italic><sup>−</sup> clones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Igaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ohsawa et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, cell competition induces cell death even in aggressive <italic>scrib</italic><sup>−</sup><italic>Ras</italic><sup>V12</sup> tumors, raising the possibility that AiA is induced during tumor initiation, which may affect the tumor microenvironment and ultimately tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Menendez et al., 2010</xref>). It is well known that TNF can play both tumor-promoting and tumor-suppressing roles, but AiA has not been investigated in this context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pikarsky and Ben-Neriah, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Vainer et al., 2008</xref>). Future studies will shed new light on the relevance of signaling by apoptotic cells and the implications of this signaling mechanism in different scenarios.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Material and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains and crosses</title><p>All flies were raised in standard fly food at 25°C unless indicated otherwise.</p><p>To generate undead cells, UAS-rpr UAS-p35 or UAS-hid UAS-p35 flies were crossed to the appropriate drivers (hh-Gal4, ap-Gal4 and Ci-Gal4 were a gift from G Morata).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers.</p><p>All three reviewers thought that the data presented in your manuscript clearly describe a new phenomenon, termed “Apoptosis-induced apoptosis”(AiA). AiA occurs when apoptotic cells trigger apoptosis of cells at a distance, which are otherwise not programmed to die. The data support the conclusion that this phenomenon occurs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs and that there may be a potentially similar mechanism occurring in the hair follicle in the mouse. Before we reach a final decision, please consider responding to the following points made by the reviewers:</p><p>1) Perform <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> or TRE-GFP labelings in hh&gt;hid&gt;p35 discs. While you show a requirement of the JNK pathway for AiA, it is important to see where exactly JNK is activated. Is it only activated in the two populations of cells that undergo AiA, or alternatively is it activated in a broader domain and only the cells in the dying region respond by undergoing apoptosis?</p><p>2) The non-autonomous cell death in the discs could theoretically be due to leaky expression of the Gal4 driver or from the UAS construct alone. This possibility should be discussed. Leaky driver expression is in part dealt with in the QS/Gal4 experiment. However, it is important that the <italic>UAS-hid</italic> and <italic>UAS-rpr</italic> controls be shown.</p><p>3) The TNF staining in the hair follicle shows a surprisingly strong overlap with caspase staining, which does support the apoptosis induced apoptosis model. However, the neutralizing antibody injection does not prove that the TNF produced in those cells promotes catagen. You should be more careful about how you state the conclusions for this work. You can’t say that TNF expression in apoptotic HF cells is “essential” for apoptosis, unless you knock out expression in only those cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.01004.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Perform</italic> puc-lacZ <italic>or TRE-GFP labelings in hh&gt;hid&gt;p35 discs.

Therefore, we performed <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> staining experiments and included the results in a new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. We observed the highest levels of puc-lacZ in undead cells, where the apoptotic loop keeps JNK constantly activated. However, we also saw modest activation of JNK in the dying cells in the anterior compartment, and in cases we detected a trail of <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> between undead cells and dying cells.</p><p><italic>2) The non-autonomous cell death in the discs could theoretically be due to leaky expression of the Gal4 driver or from the UAS construct alone.

However, it is important that the</italic> UAS-hid <italic>and</italic> UAS-rpr <italic>controls be shown</italic>.</p><p>We agree that this is an important point and therefore thoroughly examined the possibility of leaky driver expression. Based on our analyses we are very confident that this is not the case. First, we addressed this issue using the QF/Gal4 system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Unfortunately, the same type of experiment cannot be performed for over-expression of <italic>hid</italic> or <italic>rpr</italic> alone. The Psc-QF&gt;QUAS-<italic>rpr/hid</italic>; Ci-Gal4&gt;UAS-QS flies are lethal, and it is not possible to temporally control the expression of rpr/hid since the QS inhibitor is used for spatial control. Nevertheless, evidence for non-leakiness under these conditions is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. Here we use posterior compartment markers (GFP and <italic>hh-lacZ</italic>) to show that anterior dying cells clearly lack these marks.</p><p><italic>3) The TNF staining in the hair follicle shows a surprisingly strong overlap with caspase staining, which does support the apoptosis induced apoptosis model. However, the neutralizing antibody injection does not prove that the TNF produced in those cells promotes catagen. You should be more careful about how you state the conclusions for this work. You can't say that TNF expression in apoptotic HF cells is “essential” for apoptosis, unless you knock out expression in only those cells</italic>.</p><p>We fully agree and we have revised the text accordingly. Even though TNF expression was exclusively detected in apoptotic cells, eliminating its expression only in those cells would be technically very difficult. We rephrased the relevant text and figure legend to avoid any over-statements.</p></body></sub-article></article>
