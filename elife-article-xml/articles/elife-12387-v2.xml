multiple dendrites. Hallmarks of the multi-polar state are large fluctuations in microtubule-based transport into and outgrowth of different neurites, although what drives these fluctuations remains elusive. We show that actin waves, which stochastically migrate from the cell body towards neurite tips, direct microtubule-based transport during the multi-polar state. Our data argue for a mechanical control system whereby actin waves transiently widen the neurite shaft to allow increased microtubule polymerization to direct Kinesin-based transport and create bursts of neurite extension. Actin waves also require microtubule polymerization, arguing that positive feedback links these two components. We propose that actin waves create large stochastic fluctuations in microtubule-based transport and neurite outgrowth, promoting competition between neurites as they explore the environment until sufficient external cues can direct one to become the axon.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12387.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12387.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells (also known as neurons) connect with each other to form complex networks through which signals are carried around the body. Signals are received by branch-like projections called dendrites, pass through the cell body and then pass along a long projection called the axon before being transmitted to the dendrites of neighboring neurons.</p><p>In animal embryos, immature neurons in part of the brain called the hippocampus – which is crucial for learning and forming memories – develop into mature neurons through a series of steps. In the early stages of development, an immature neuron sends out multiple projections that extend out in all directions from its cell body. These projections randomly retract and lengthen for a while before a single projection grows into an axon and the others become dendrites.</p><p>It is believed that signal proteins inside the neuron that promote the formation of an axon selectively accumulate in a projection as it grows into an axon. These axon-promoting proteins are carried to the axons by a motor protein called kinesin, which moves along fibers called microtubules. In immature neurons, kinesin motors randomly move in and out of different projections, before settling in the projection that will grow into the axon. However, it is not clear what drives these fluctuations.</p><p>To address this question, Winans et al. used microscopy to study the transport of axon-promoting proteins in hippocampal neurons. The experiments show that a protein called actin forms a mesh of filaments in a wave-like manner, starting in the cell body and moving outwards into the projections. When a wave of actin reaches a projection, the projection grows for a while and then stops until the next actin wave arrives. Furthermore, the actin waves promote the formation of more microtubule filaments.</p><p>This work shows that actin waves make the projections wider to create space for more microtubules to form, which increases the transport of axon-promoting proteins to the projections. Winans et al.’s findings suggest that actin waves direct axon-promoting proteins to axons and promote competition between the projections early on by generating random fluctuations that allow all the projections to grow and retract. This would allow each projection to explore its environment in the search for signals that promote axon growth. The next challenge is to understand how different signals select the “winning axon”.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.12387.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.12387.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>neuronal polarity</kwd><kwd>cytoskeleton</kwd><kwd>neurite outgrowth</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1MH095087</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winans</surname><given-names>Amy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stanford Biophysics Training Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Winans</surname><given-names>Amy M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM063702</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Meyer</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Waves of polymerizing actin work in concert with microtubule polymerization to lay down more microtubules tracks and transiently increase microtubule-based transport into the growing neurite.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>During development, hippocampal neurons transit through a multi-polar intermediate state in which neurons typically extend 4–5 immature neurites, which are each capable of becoming either an axon or a dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). These neurites stochastically retract and elongate for a period of hours to days before a single neurite is specified as the axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This delayed axon specification is typically mediated by extracellular cues such as soluble growth factors, neighboring cells, and the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>) or in vitro by stochastic extension and stabilization of the longest single neurite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dotti et al., 1988</xref>). Previous studies showed that axon specification is based on a competition between “axon-promoting” signals such as Ras, Phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K), and Protein Kinase A (PKA) and “axon-inhibiting” signals such as Glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3β) and Protein Kinase G (PKG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes and Polleux, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shelly et al., 2010</xref>). It is believed that these signals are controlled by the selective accumulation of axon-promoting proteins in the nascent axon via microtubule-based transport involving one or more self-reinforcing positive feedback loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fivaz et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Inagaki et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Toriyama et al., 2006</xref>). During the multi-polar state, however, pro-axon components appear to dynamically shuttle collectively to and from different neurites through an unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), a process that has been investigated using a constitutively active version of the microtubule motor Kinesin-1 (a.a. 1–560, CA-KIF5C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hammond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Toriyama et al., 2010</xref>). Kinesin-1 carries numerous proteins known to promote axon formation such as CRMP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>) and WAVE/Sra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kawano et al., 2005</xref>), and perturbing Kinesin-1 expression or localization inhibits single axon formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>). There is also evidence that the Kinesin-1 adaptor protein c-Jun N-terminal kinase-interacting protein-1 (JIP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dajas-Bailador et al., 2008</xref>) and the PI3K interactor Shootin1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Toriyama et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">2010</xref>) also relocalizes from one neurite to another before settling in the nascent axon. A similar dynamic collective relocalization of this kinesin motor domain has also been observed in vivo in developing neurons expressing CA-KIF5C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Randlett et al., 2011</xref>). What drives these fluctuations is a fundamental open question, as the number, orientation, or age of microtubules may play a role, and conflicting studies suggest that Kinesin-1 may preferentially bind microtubules that are stable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hammond et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Konishi and Setou, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Reed et al., 2006</xref>) or newly polymerized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nakata et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Valesoq et al., 1994</xref>). These results regarding microtubule-based transport may also be related to an earlier observation that bulk cytoplasmic flow precedes axon specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bradke and Dotti, 1997</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Stochastically-generated actin waves correlate with neurite extensions.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic showing two stages of symmetry breaking.

Previous observations of actin waves showed that they are triggered stochastically, linked to neurite outgrowth and axon specification, more prevalent in early neurons compared to mature neurons, and found in cultured organotypic slices as well as primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsuno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruthel and Banker, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1999</xref>). It has been suggested that they constitute a transport mechanism that brings actin and actin associated proteins towards growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsuno et al., 2015</xref>). Our study shows that actin waves act in concert with microtubules to direct microtubule-based transport and that these discrete transport events are tightly linked to neurite outgrowth during the multi-polar state before an axon is specified.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To investigate the role of actin waves in neuronal polarity, we first characterized actin waves in our in vitro system. Consistent with previous studies of cultured hippocampal neurons extracted from embryonic rat brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ruthel and Banker, 1998</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsuno et al., 2015</xref>) actin waves are clearly visible in all neurons and neurites that bear actively growing processes (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), and travel nearly exclusively in an anterograde fashion, from cell body to growth cone (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>) during our DIV1 imaging window. Actin waves are generated at a median frequency of 1–2 actin waves per hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), move at average speeds of 2–3 µm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), and morphologically resemble growth cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b,c</xref>). Structured illumination microscopy (SIM) revealed that actin waves are a mix of lamellipodial and filopodial structures that project outward from the neurite shaft, mainly contained to the x-y plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). After an actin wave impacts the neurite tip, the neurite undergoes a growth spurt that often lasts until the growth cone shrinks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d, e</xref>). Afterwards, the neurite often does not grow outwards again until the arrival of an additional actin wave reactivates the growth cone. Kymographs of actin intensity paired with neurite length over time illustrate the tight correlation between neurite outgrowth and actin wave arrival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). In fact, roughly 90% of neurite outgrowth in the DIV1 window is clearly concomitant with actin wave arrival (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). Later stage imaging (DIV2+) displays greater neurite outgrowth in the absence of actin waves (data not shown). We further noted that actin waves entered different neurites at different times in an apparently stochastic fashion without an obvious pattern or frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>). For the majority of live cell images in this study, fluorescently-tagged F-tractin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnson and Schell, 2009</xref>) is used as a marker for f-actin, although actin waves can also be observed with only a membrane marker (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>) as well. Together with previous findings, our results strongly support the hypothesis that actin waves have a role in promoting the stochastic fluctuations in neurite length observed during the multi-polar phase of symmetry breaking.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-12387-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Actin waves are widespread and move in an anterograde fashion.</title><p>This movie shows timelapse images from the entire frame of acquisition for F-tractin-mCherry expressing neurons.

Indeed, live cell imaging of F-tractin and EB1 revealed an increase in the number of EB1 puncta within and behind actin waves, with much lower levels of EB1 puncta in front of the wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>). This enrichment in the number of polymerizing microtubules progresses down the neurite with the actin wave, creating a dual wave of polymerizing microtubules and polymerizing actin. Control experiments using a maximum intensity projection of time lapse images showed that single EB1 puncta moved in a persistent fashion outward, confirming that they track with anterograde polarized polymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), consistent with previous measurements showing that microtubules generally polymerize outward during the multi-polar phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>This striking co-localization of polymerizing actin and increased microtubule polymerization prompted us to investigate the correlation between actin waves and microtubule-based transport by using the minimal Kinesin 1 motor domain construct (CA-KIF5C-Venus; a.a. 1–560, adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobson et al. (2006)</xref>). The attachment and movement of this motor domain to microtubules is not regulated by conformational changes and is constitutively active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Friedman and Vale, 1999</xref>). The mechanisms controlling the dynamic localization pattern of CA-KIF5C during symmetry breaking have previously been investigated, and the dynamic, stochastic nature of actin wave entry into various neurites struck us as reminiscent of the dynamic localization of CA-KIF5C. We first confirmed that the Kinesin-1 motor, CA-KIF5C, is often enriched at the tip of one or sometimes more neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacobson et al., 2006</xref>) during the multipolar phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>).

We marked the time when actin waves entered neurites by visual inspection and averaged the time course of change in total CA-KIF5C intensity in the neurite receiving the actin wave. This analysis showed in the same neurite a marked increase in CA-KIF5C over a period of over 10 min following an actin wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). Moreover, we found that when CA-KIF5C entered a neurite previously lacking CA-KIF5C, such entry events occurred in parallel with an actin wave (in 34 out of 35 entry events). We then assessed the time lag (if any) between the increases of actin and CA-KIF5C signals during CA-KIF5C entry events and found that the increase in actin intensity preceded the increase in CA-KIF5C intensity by several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). To address the concern that the co-localization of actin waves and CA-KIF5C entry into neurites may be an artifact of a cytoplasmic fraction of CA-KIF5C, we imaged CA-KIF5C moving in and out of neurites in neurons also expressing a cytoplasmic Turquoise fluorescent protein. Taking the ratio of CA-KIF5C over the Turquoise volume marker shows that the movement of CA-KIF5C into and out of neurites is significant over changes in volume; moreover, addition of the microtubule polymerization inhibitor Nocodazole eliminates the movement of CA-KIF5C into and out of neurites relative to a volume marker, confirming that CA-KIF5C movement is dependent on microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In a parallel analysis of the spatial correlation between actin polymerization and CA-KIF5C, we found that CA-KIF5C was transported in pulses, or waves, along the neurite shaft to the growth cone, coincident with actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).

Most of the pulses of CA-KIF5C arriving at growth cones resulted in an increase in CA-KIF5C concentration that persisted for tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g</xref>). Moreover, the arrival of an actin wave can reverse the retrograde movement of CA-KIF5C out of the neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>).

We first probed the potential role of actin waves in promoting microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport by examining both microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport after the addition of Jasplakinolide, an actin-stabilizing agent that stalls the progression of actin waves. We found that stalling actin waves halted the progression of CA-KIF5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a,b</xref>) as well as the progression of the wave of polymerizing microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c,d</xref>), suggesting that progression of actin waves was necessary in order to continue the forward progression of the other two components. Notably, EB1 comets were still observed in the stalled actin wave, suggesting that although microtubules were still polymerizing in the actin waves, they were unable to polymerize beyond the structural bottleneck present at the front of the actin wave. This observation suggests that a mechanical mechanism may, at least partially, drive the increase in microtubule polymerization observed in the actin wave, and may explain the conundrum presented by the discrepant speeds of the components moving along with actin waves. More precisely, vesicular transport and Kinesin motors both advance at a speed of ~50 μm/min along microtubules while actin waves only advance at a speed of ~ 2 μm/min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This raises important mechanistic questions of why Kinesin motors and vesicles have a net progression that is much slower than their molecular transport rate, why motors and vesicles appear to be restrained behind the leading edge of actin waves, and why vesicular transport stays elevated in and behind an actin wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>).<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.021</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Forward advance of microtubule polymerization and Kinesin-1 is dependent on actin wave progression.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Wave of CA-KIF5C does not advance independently of actin wave advancement.

In this hypothesis, the increase in the number of microtubules could enhance the flux of microtubule-based transport through the neurite. Another motivation for this hypothesis was that the speed of microtubule polymerization is ~10x faster than the speed of actin waves (in neurite: 20.4 +/- 5.4 um/min (39 measurements) in wave: 16.8 +/- 5.4 (23 measurements)), which is consistent with previously measured microtubule polymerization rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stepanova et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, in order for the wave of EB1 puncta to advance at the same speed as the actin wave, individual EB1 puncta must stall and disappear at the leading edge of the actin wave, similar to what we see when a polymerizing microtubule hits the membrane of the neurite tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, left). Indeed, kymograph analysis of EB1 comets moving through the bottleneck of the actin wave revealed that EB1 comets disappear at the bottleneck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, right). As a separate experiment, we quantifiedthe flow of EB1 puncta through two windows placed right before and right after the bottleneck (but within 6 μm of each other) at time points 100 s apart which showed the same marked difference consistent with a loss of EB1 comets in between. In control experiments, we observed that the flow through each window does not significantly change over the time window measured, suggesting that microtubule polymerization is at a steady state over short time periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Also, the difference between the flow of EB1 puncta through the two windows does not change over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Thus, the larger flow of polymerizing microtubules through the window closer to the cell body does not reach the second window ahead of the actin wave, suggesting EB1 puncta disappear between the two windows. To understand this result, it is helpful to again consider that processive EB1 puncta should move 25–30 μm in approximately 100 s, much faster than the actin waves. We also measured EB1 puncta flow versus neurite width in a smooth neurite or within an actin wave which reveals a correlation between neurite width and the number of EB1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The lack of a pronounced higher number of EB1 puncta per unit area in actin waves relative to smooth neurites suggests that the mechanism by which actin waves promote microtubule polymerization is mainly steric, although this does not rule out other signaling cross-talks between the two cytoskeletal components. Furthermore, as for microtubule polymerization, the number of microtubules present also correlates with neurite width, as shown by SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.022</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Structural bottleneck provided by actin waves inhibits progression of polymerizing microtubules.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Image depicting EB1 puncta at a neurite tip (top left) and at a bottleneck provided by an actin wave (top right). Accompanying kymographs illustrating EB1 puncta disappearing at the growth cone tip (bottom left) and the bottleneck of an actin wave (bottom right) are below. For better signal, the actin image of the neurite tip was constructed using a maxiumum intensity projection. Images were acquired every 2 sec for 2 min. Scale bars are both 3 μm, with the horizontal axis of the kymographs matching the spatial scale of the images. (<bold>b</bold>) Flow of EB1 puncta is restricted by a bottleneck. Flow (number of EB1 puncta through a plane over 20 sec) was assessed in two windows &lt;6 μm apart (w1 and w2) on each side of a structural bottleneck at two time points separated by 100 sec. Flow through each window does not significantly increase or decrease between t1 and t2, however the number of EB1 puncta moving through w1 was significantly higher than the number moving through w2 at each time point. Different colors denote different neurites. Signicance was assessed using a two-sided sign test (testing difference between measurement in t1 and t2 (p = 1 for w1 and p = 0.6 for w2) and between w1 and w2 (p = 0.03, for both t1 and t2)). Colors represent distinct neurites. (<bold>c</bold>) Flow of EB1 puncta (defined in (<bold>b</bold>)) assessed in neurites with waves (red) and without waves (blue) of varying widths.

If such changes were long-lasting, we would expect that neurites would steadily thicken over time, which has not been previously observed. Also, our analysis of neurite growth over 10 hr time periods suggest that the growth promoting effect of an incoming actin waves is lost after tens of minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). To determine whether the induced microtubule polymerization persists after an actin wave, we imaged the number of EB1 puncta in a neurite segment before, during, and after actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>, top). Markedly, the EB1 puncta number increased along with an actin wave and persisted after the wave passed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9b</xref>), in agreement with our analysis of the persistence of the spatial profiles of Synaptophysin, volume, and microtubule enrichment. We then generated kymographs of actin intensity, EB1 intensity, and neurite width in a single section of neurite with multiple actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>). The kymographs reveal simultaneous increases in EB1 intensity and neurite width that remained past the passage of the actin wave, but gradually decayed with variable timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9c</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). The transient nature of the increases in microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport was confirmed using a kymograph analysis of Synaptophysin vesicles in a neurite containing actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9d</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media8">Video 8</xref>). Thus, our data as a whole suggests that each actin wave, by creating a transient increase in neurite width, creates a burst of microtubule polymerization and microtubule-based transport that will eventually decay after approximately 30 min and neurites will start to retract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10a</xref>). The transient characteristic of the increase in transport explains the frequent neurite retractions and the necessity of frequent actin waves to continually deliver cargo to a single growth cone to maintain and elongate the neurite and ultimately allow one of the neurites to dominate and become the axon.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.030</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model illustrating the co-regulation of actin and microtubules that drive microtubule-based transport.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of changes caused by the actin wave.

More broadly, our study suggests that the stochastic nature of actin waves leads to the stochastic increase of microtubule-based transport paired with growth cone extension in different neurites thereby creating the dynamic multi-polar state that allows a search for external cues and ultimately enables single axon formation. In particular, we show that the fluctuating actin waves control the previously observed pulsatile anterograde Kinesin transport generated during the multi-polar phase of symmetry breaking. We discovered that the link from actin wave to Kinesin-mediated transport appears to be based on a mechanical control mechanism whereby actin waves widen the neurite shaft and create the space needed for more microtubules to polymerize. The increase in microtubule polymerization in turn increases microtubule number and vesicular microtubule-based transport. In addition, these morphological changes and consequent changes in microtubule-based transport are transient, resulting in the pulsatile delivery of cargo to the growth cone and necessitating the generation of frequent actin waves in order to continue to deliver axon-promoting factors into the neurite. Finally, the results of our pharmacological perturbation of microtubules suggest that, in fact, actin waves and microtubules co-regulate each other through a positive feedback mechanism, potentially mediated by cross-talk mechanisms that have been identified in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhshi et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In combination with studies in other systems, our results suggest that mechanical regulation is a major avenue of crosstalk from the actin cytoskeleton to microtubule growth during neurite outgrowth. Consistent with this finding, it has also been shown that depolymerizing actin in growth cones spatially de-restricts microtubule polymerization, thus promoting neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradke and Dotti, 1999</xref>). A later study further found that ADF/cofilin, an actin severing enzyme, promotes neuritogenesis by disassembling the actin meshwork at the cortex, allowing for microtubule polymerization to promote a new protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Flynn et al., 2012</xref>). In conjunction with these previous studies, our results argue that the actin cortex structurally inhibits microtubule extension, and that a stent-like broadening of the neurite shaft or other mechanisms to “loosen” the actin cortex, by actin waves or other processes, relieves this inhibition to enable more microtubules to extend forward.</p><p>In the context of neuron polarization, the stochastic nature of actin waves allows each neurite to repeatedly grow and retract thereby allowing the growth cone of each neurite to spatially explore its local environment to find external axon-promoting inputs (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arimura and Kaibuchi, 2007</xref>). When receiving sufficient input, signaling in one of the neurites is expected to be strengthened and the neurite is marked as the future axon. Such a specification of one neurite as the axon is known to subsequently inhibit axonal maturation of the other neurites and convert them to dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Esch et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ménager et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Shelly et al., 2010</xref>). Together with these previous considerations, our study argues that actin waves have a dual function. First, they are the drivers for neurite outgrowth by directing microtubule-based transport to deliver axon-promoting factors to the growth cones at the neurite tip. Second, they promote competition between neurites by generating large stochastic fluctuations that allow each neurite to sample “winning” and “losing” states as they explore their surroundings for the cues that will ultimately determine axon specification.</p><p>Our study does not directly address the role of actin waves in in vivo symmetry breaking and single axon formation. However, imaging of later stage polarized neurons in culture showed that actin waves still move through the nascent dendrites and the axon, but their effect on neurite outgrowth appears to be smaller (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Video 9</xref>). This suggests that actin waves may become less important after polarization. With respect to their in vivo relevance, actin waves have been observed in hippocampal and cortical neurons in slice cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flynn et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Katsuno et al., 2015</xref>), although whether they promote microtubule polymerization and transport is more difficult to explore in this setting. Nevertheless, the results of our study suggest that actin waves could play an equally important role in neurite extension in vivo, to allow neurites to properly sense the polarized growth cues provided by the developing brain.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media9" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-12387-media9.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.12387.033</object-id><label>Video 9.</label><caption><title>Actin waves are observed in post-polarized neurons.</title><p>This movie shows timelapse images of a polarized Lyn-mCherry-expressing neuron producing actin waves.

Our study further argues that the stochastic nature of actin waves creates the previously described stochastically fluctuating microtubule-based transport events during the multi-polar state. Thus actin waves may play a critical role in a stochastic search mechanism that allows a set of neurites to explore the surrounding space, integrate external signaling cues, and measure relative input differences to select the a “winning” axon.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary hippocampal neuron culture</title><p>Primary hippocampal neurons were cultured from Wistar rat E18 embryos.

For imaging, CO2 independent media (Gibco) or custom-made extracellular imaging buffer was used with added Pen/Strep/Glut (Life Technologies) and B27 (Gibco) or SMI (Stemcell Technologies) as a vitamin supplement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Image analysis</title><p>Image analysis was conducted using basic image analysis tools available in Fiji (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) or custom-written MATLAB scripts. <italic>Total neurite intensity</italic>: analysis was performed by generating a binary mask of the summed timelapse set of images, and assessing total intensity within the mask for each timepoint. <italic>2D line scans:</italic> analysis was conducted as follows 1) generate binary mask of neurite section of interest, 2) skeletonize mask, 3) select two endpoints on skeleton to generate “shortest path” aka a single path, 4) divide path into regular coordinates with desired spacing, 5) divide original binary mask into windows based on proximity to the closest coordinate. Using the window analysis, parameters such as mean signal intensity (from live cell probes or fixed cell staining), max signal intensity, neurite width (total number of pixels divided in a window divided by given spacing), puncta per window, and others can be calculated. In most cases, intensity measurements were determined by taking the mean or median of the top 20% of pixels in a given window. <italic>Trace alignment for averaging data between independent waves</italic>: traces were aligned to the half-maximum value of the front of the actin wave (oriented towards the growth cone). Half maximum values were determined by manual identification of the maximum and minimum actin signals on the front half of the actin curve. Traces were then computationally aligned. <italic>EB1 puncta counting:</italic> to count EB1 puncta, puncta were manually identified and computationally assigned to their corresponding window. <italic>EB1 flow measurements</italic>: to calculate flow, the number of EB1 puncta passing through a perpendicular plane of the neurite was counted by eye for 20 s. <italic>2D kymographs</italic>: to generate 2D kymographs, window analysis was used with coordinate spacing of 1–3 pixel(s). For each window, the maximum signal from the various sensors was measured. For kymographs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>, the “Multi Kymograph” feature of Fiji was used. <italic>Mobile vesicle intensity measurement:</italic> to obtain a measure of mobile vesicles, fast image series of 600 m<sup>-1</sup> s per image were gathered. Images were filtered using a tophat filter with a disc (2–3 pixel radius) to remove background signal. Negative values were then set to zero and the difference between subsequent images was taken in order to remove stationary particles. The resulting subtracted images from successive timepoints were added together and the summed image was subjected to the window analysis to produce line traces. <italic>Single microtubule counting</italic>: maximum intensity projection of SIM images were taken and the “Plot Profile” function used to take a line scan perpendicular to the neurite at desired locations in Fiji. Peaks in the line scan were identified by eye and counted as single microtubules. This method likely undercounts microtubules because of the high density of microtubules present in the neurite. <italic>SIM images</italic>: raw SIM data was processed on the API DeltaVision OMX softWoRx image processing software available in the Stanford Neuroscience Microscopy facility. Generation of maxiumum intensity projections and 3D reconstructions were performed in Fiji. <italic>FRET analysis:</italic> CFP and FRET images were collected with a 20x (NA = 0.75) Nikon objective. Regions of interest were identified and subjected to a flat background subtraction (background calculated after removal of the object of interest), segmentation, and smoothing with a Gaussian filter before calculating FRET/CFP ratios. Custom written Matlab scripts used for 2D line scan analysis, mobile vesicle intensity measurements, and FRET analysis can be found at github.com/MeyerLab/AWinans_Elife_2016.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Thanks to S Leal-Ortez and C Garner, M Matsuda, C Waterman, G Banker, and M Schell for constructs.

Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Vivek Malhotra (Senior editor) and the original three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below. These revisions do not require new experiments.</p><p>The authors showed that latrunculin A treatment dilates the neurite to a similar extend as an actin wave. This is a really interesting finding. It suggests that the actin network restricts the protruding microtubules. If this were correct, then one would expect that latrunculin treatment would lead to microtubule protrusion and to axon growth. Hence, actin depolymerization would decouple the waves from axon growth, because the shaft widening and microtubule protrusion would be the important feature.</p><p>Please check Bradke and Dotti, Science, 1999. This appears exactly to be the case: Microtubules protrude into the distal area in the absence of actin dynamics upon pharmacological actin depolymerization. Similarly, please check Flynn et al., Neuron, 2012, where it is shown that cofilin renders the actin network dynamic and permissive for microtubule protrusion. In fact, the loss of cofilin can be restored by actin depolymerization. In principle, the data of the authors in conjunction with these papers may suggest that the waves formed is a way to make the actin cytoskeleton less restrictive for protruding microtubules. Please discuss these mentioned works accordingly as a possible action of how the waves could act to support axon growth. I don't think that these previous findings take anything away from the novelty of the beautiful findings presented here, but it will help the reader to put things in a very clear context.</p><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The previous decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Stochastic neurite extensions that precede axon formation are propelled by actin wave-driven microtubule-based transport&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers agree that your observations are really interesting and exciting, and suggest a new paradigm for organization of microtubule-dependent traffic along the extending axon. However, the findings are largely descriptive, and the chain of causality is weak. It seems that quite a number of new experiments would be required to provide a convincing mechanism. Accordingly, we have decided to reject, but would be very interested in seeing a new version if you are able to develop the story further. Our full reviews are provided below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper relates actin waves, which travel anterogradely along neurites, to microtubules and vesicular movement. The studies were done with cultured hippocampal neurons, before an axon is permanently specified and when all neurites have MTs arranged with plus ends out. The authors find that CA-KIF5C moves to and fro prior to a wave, but the arrival of a wave causes a widening of the shaft and predominantly anterograde movement of CA-KIF5C. The CA-KIF5C and actin wave move together along the shaft, followed by vesicles and a wider shaft with increased microtubules. The authors repeat Ruthel and Banker's finding that MTs are needed for the actin waves, and also show that stabilizing F actin with Jasplakinolide inhibits the MT increase that occurs in the wave region. The results suggest positive feedback between the actin wave and MT processes.</p><p>1) The study is essentially correlative and it is not possible to say that the actin wave &quot;drives&quot; the MT-based transport. The Nocodazole result suggests that MTs actually drive the actin waves. The proposal that the increased F actin in the wave increases the volume, allowing more MT polymerization that is maintained as the wave passes through, is interesting, but basically untestable since there is no other way to create a dilation. Overall the results are interesting but rather descriptive. Potentially, localized inhibition of actin/MT dynamics partway along the shaft might allow cause and effect to be distinguished. However, at the present time, it is speculative to assert that actin waves &quot;propel&quot; neurite extensions or &quot;we discovered.… a mechanical control system whereby the actin waves widen the neurite shaft and create the space needed for more microtubules to polymerize&quot;.</p><p>2) Another concern is that actin waves have only been seen in vitro, with cultured neurons. Ruthel and Banker 1998 show what may be an actin wave progressing down the axon of a single hippocampal neuron in slice culture. However, to my knowledge, waves have not been noted in the many publications in which neurons were labeled by in utero electroporation and then imaged in slice culture. As noted in Barnes and Polleux, 2009, in vivo pyramidal neurons inherit their axon-dendrite polarity from the trailing and leading processes during migration. The hippocampal culture system is essentially a &quot;repolarization&quot; of cells that were polarized in vivo before they were dissociated for culture. Studying symmetry breaking using the hippocampal culture system is well established, but the authors should be explicit about the artificiality of the system.</p><p>3) The mechanical control system is not clear. Does the increased MT extension (or initiation) in the wave result from the increased cross-section area or from increased rate of extension of individual MTs per unit volume? The super-resolution microscopy suggests that the microtubule number is greatly increased behind the wave. This means there are more MT ends available for extension. Perhaps EM would help show whether more MTs are being seeded in the wave, or whether the dilation is creating volume for more tubulin dimers to recruit to the growing plus ends.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports live imaging of actin waves in multipolar hippocampal neurons in culture. The waves are associated with what appears to be increased lamellipodial activity along the process shaft, and an increase in process diameter. Growing microtubule ends, vesicular cargo, and kinesin motor domain are all enriched in the wave and may follow it as it moves outward along the neurite.</p><p>The strengths of this study are that the actin wave phenomenon is very interesting, and the efforts at reliable quantitative characterization are impressive. Determining wave function within an initial study would be a lot to ask, but some further clarity on the limits of the study is needed. In particular, the physiological purpose of the waves is incompletely understood from the current data. Also, there is little evidence other than codistribution with CA-KIF5C and synaptophysin vesicles for a role in axon specification, as implied in the title and text. As a practical issue, it has remained unresolved how reliably the CA-KIF5C motor domain alone can locate the putative nascent axonal process. The current study seems to push the question back to the actin wave, but it remains unclear whether the CA-KIF5C construct is simply carried forward as part of the increased cytoplasmic volume, whether it is enriched solely as a result of the increased MT number, or whether it localizes specifically to MT plus ends, not a known form of behavior for this kinesin. Another issue is the limited data indicating that actin actually leads the way in this behavior. Modifications and additions to the text and data are recommended to clarify these and other important issues and to improve the presentation of the data.</p><p>1) Based on the frequency per neurite and the velocity of the actin waves, they would be expected to appear very commonly in unpolarized neurons, perhaps as lateral lamellipodial protrusions in at least one or more neurites in general, and not just in this study. Are they detectable in published images, and how commonly? Or might they be a product of specific culture conditions used here?</p><p>2) The function of the waves in neuronal differentiation remains largely unaddressed and is a critical issue for understanding the physiological importance of these structures. Neurons should be monitored for an additional day to correlate actin wave activity with longer-term neurite extension and axonogenesis. It seems as though there may be no direct link between the waves and axon formation, in which case the waves may remain for the moment a curiosity, albeit a remarkable one.</p><p>3) This relates to another issue, the localization of CA-KIF5C to neurite tips. This is reported to correlate strongly with axon identity, yet CA-KIF5C appears to be present in most or all neurites in the current study. What are the implications for CA-KIFC as a pre-axon marker?</p><p>4) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Actin waves are linked to anterograde Synaptophysin-mediated vesicular transport during the multi-polar phase of axon formation“: The authors report actin wave velocities of 2-3 μm/min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but less than this &lt; 2 μm/min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref> controls.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: This graph represents an important form of analysis, in showing the temporal sequence of actin vs. CA-KIF5C at a point within the neurite. Surprisingly, this is the only such analysis shown, but serves as the basis for a major claim (see summary diagram and Title) that actin leads the way. More of this type of analysis comparing actin with other subcellular structures should be provided.</p><p>6) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Actin waves are linked to anterograde Synaptophysin-mediated vesicular transport during the multi-polar phase of axon formation “and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: The authors claim that &quot;arriving actin waves.…[were]… in most cases followed by neurite extension.&quot; However, only 8/16 showed some degree of neurite extension.</p><p>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: The authors relied on only the moving vesicles to plot the curve on the right. How does a plot of total vesicles appear (moving and non-moving)? This issue gets at whether bulk cytoplasm is moving along with actin, or, instead, whether microtubule-based transport is stimulated within the region of the wave.</p><p>8) What is meaning of stalled EB1, which is reported to associate as short lines at the growing plus ends of microtubules?</p><p>9) What is the three-dimensional nature of the F-tractin peak. Are we seeing anterograde transport of F-actin filaments, a bulge of swollen cytoplasm, or a combination of lamellipodia and surface ruffles?</p><p>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: The superresolution image showing MT density in the wave is useful, but a comparison with MT density ahead of and behind the wave would make more sense to include.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript &quot;Stochastic neurite extensions that precede axon formation are propelled by actin wave-driven microtubule-based transport&quot; by Winans et al. report that actin waves, which have been formerly shown to precede neuronal polarization, enhances traffic into the future axon. Moreover, the authors show that actin waves enhance microtubule polymerization. The authors further reveal that the effect on microtubule polymerization is transient, which open up the possibility to form a stochastic model of how neuronal polarization takes place.</p><p>In general, the work is very fascinating and gives a very interesting perspective of how neuronal polarization can occur. While their exciting work has the potential to become a fine <italic>eLife</italic> paper, the authors need to perform some experiments to put their idea on a more solid basis. All of the experiments are relatively straightforward and should be all done.</p><p>1) The authors show that kinesin-1 mediated transport is enhanced after waves. What happens when kinesin 1 activity is abrogated? Do the authors still see traffic into the axon? Do waves actually still form without kinesin 1 activity?</p><p>2) The authors argue that the actin waves dilate the neurites to enable enhanced microtubule polymerization and microtubule based transport. Could the actin waves enable this process by dynamizing the cortical actin. Consistent with this possibility the authors show that jasplakinolide prevents these processes. The authors should try the converse experiment with cytochalasin D or latrcunculin. If their hypothesis is true then cytoD treatment (probably local treatment) should enable dilation and enhance microtubule polymerization. Please check also Bradke and Dotti, Science, 1999, where preferential trafficking and axon formation has been reported after local actin depolymerization.</p><p>3) What happens if the cultures are treated with low doses of Taxol (3 nM) that enables microtubule polymerization (Witte et al., JCB, 2008)? How does it affect microtubule polymerization and dilation of the neurite? Is there an effect on wave formation?</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: According to the Methods part, the authors fixed the cells and subsequently extracted them. Therefore, soluble tubulin is left in these staining. The authors should perform a simultaneous fixation-extraction so that tubulin dimers are gone for the actual staining procedure.</p><p>5) The authors should mention in the paper that it had been previously shown that enhanced membrane traffic precedes axon formation (Bradke and Dotti, Neuron, 1997).

This is a really interesting finding. It suggests that the actin network restricts the protruding microtubules. If this were correct, then one would expect that latrunculin treatment would lead to microtubule protrusion and to axon growth. Hence, actin depolymerization would decouple the waves from axon growth, because the shaft widening and microtubule protrusion would be the important feature. Please check Bradke and Dotti, Science, 1999. This appears exactly to be the case: Microtubules protrude into the distal area in the absence of actin dynamics upon pharmacological actin depolymerization. Similarly, please check Flynn</italic> et al.<italic>, Neuron, 2012, where it is shown that cofilin renders the actin network dynamic and permissive for microtubule protrusion. In fact, the loss of cofilin can be restored by actin depolymerization. In principle, the data of the authors in conjunction with these papers may suggest that the waves formed is a way to make the actin cytoskeleton less restrictive for protruding microtubules. Please discuss these mentioned works accordingly as a possible action of how the waves could act to support axon growth. I don't think that these previous findings take anything away from the novelty of the beautiful findings presented here, but it will help the reader to put things in a very clear context.</italic></p><p>This is an excellent point, and we now discuss our findings in the context of these previous papers in the Discussion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1: 1) The study is essentially correlative and it is not possible to say that the actin wave &quot;drives&quot; the MT-based transport. The Nocodazole result suggests that MTs actually drive the actin waves. The proposal that the increased F actin in the wave increases the volume, allowing more MT polymerization that is maintained as the wave passes through, is interesting, but basically untestable since there is no other way to create a dilation. Overall the results are interesting but rather descriptive. Potentially, localized inhibition of actin/MT dynamics partway along the shaft might allow cause and effect to be distinguished. However, at the present time, it is speculative to assert that actin waves &quot;propel&quot; neurite extensions or &quot;we discovered</italic>.…</p><p> <italic>a mechanical control system whereby the actin waves widen the neurite shaft and create the space needed for more microtubules to polymerize&quot;.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 1 critiques the causality links in the paper. In the previous version of the paper, we emphasized a linear causality link whereby actin waves increase microtubule polymerization which leads to increased microtubule-based transport. Reviewer 1 argues that our hypothesis concerning a mechanical link between actin waves and microtubules is not sufficiently supported, as is the link between actin waves and neurite outgrowth. Although we show that stalling actin waves with the drug Jasplakinolide prevents the forward progress of the wave of polymerizing microtubules and CA-KIF5C, Reviewer 1 further argues that the Nocodazole data, whereby inhibiting microtubule polymerization leads to the dissipation of actin waves, shows a co-dependence of polymerizing actin and microtubules.</p><p>We also agree that it is likely that actin waves and polymerizing microtubules are co-dependent on one another, although this model was not emphasized in the previous version of the manuscript. In fact, there are multiple studies examining the positive feedback between actin and microtubule polymerization, as is mentioned in our previous Discussion. To address the concerns of Reviewer 1 we have added emphasis to a model of co-dependence in the new version of the manuscript, and have also added data showing that actin waves are affected by the addition of Taxol, a pharmacological microtubule stabilizer (as suggested by Reviewer 3). This compliments the Nocodazole data and further supports a model of co-dependence.</p><p>Nonetheless, Reviewer 1 makes a valid point that the links between actin waves, the increase in neurite volume, and microtubule polymerization, required more supporting evidence. To address these concerns, we have used a photo-activatable Rac1 construct to generate actin waves de novoand probe the causality chain starting from the actin wave showing increased microtubule polymerization. We also performed further experiments to support our argument concerning a mechanical role of actin waves in microtubule polymerization.</p><p><italic>2) Another concern is that actin waves have only been seen</italic> in vitro<italic>, with cultured neurons. Ruthel and Banker 1998 show what may be an actin wave progressing down the axon of a single hippocampal neuron in slice culture. However, to my knowledge, waves have not been noted in the many publications in which neurons were labeled by in utero electroporation and then imaged in slice culture. As noted in Barnes and Polleux, 2009,</italic> in vivo</p><p> <italic>pyramidal neurons inherit their axon-dendrite polarity from the trailing and leading processes during migration. The hippocampal culture system is essentially a &quot;repolarization&quot; of cells that were polarized in vivo before they were dissociated for culture. Studying symmetry breaking using the hippocampal culture system is well established, but the authors should be explicit about the artificiality of the system.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 1 brings up a concern about the in vivo significance of the actin waves, a concern which is shared by Reviewer 2. It is true that actin waves have been overwhelmingly examined in only an in vitrocontext. There are two known observations of actin waves in slice cultures; the first by Flynn et al., Develop Neurobiol., 2009, and the second in the recently-published Katsuno et al., Cell Reports, 2015. During the revision process, we reached out to several zebrafish developmental biologists to see if they have observed actin waves. Unfortunately, they had not, although in all cases the developmental window in which they imaged and the temporal resolution of imaging was not suited to observe actin waves, if they did exist. In in vitrocultures, actin waves are most frequent in young cultures (DIV1-2) in pre-polarized neurons. We also image a minimum of once every five minutes to capture the movement of the actin waves. It is very possible actin waves have not been observed more widely in vivo because the imaging parameters have not been suited to capturing the movement of actin waves.</p><p>Reviewer 1 also notes that pyramidal neurons do inherit their axon-dendrite polarity from their trailing and leading processes during polarization. The review cited (Barnes and Polleux, 2009) also describes a multi-polar stage before the establishment of the leading and trailing processes; a stage that in the retinal ganglion of zebrafish (Randlett et al., Neuron, 2011) bears the characteristic switching of CA-KIF5C in between neurites. Because of these data, we do think that the fluctuating neurite outgrowth and microtubule-based transport observed during the multi-polar phase is important to ensuring the specification of the leading and trailing process in the correct orientation, which leads to axon specification. However, we have modified the manuscript to better reflect the limitations of the in vitrosystem we use, as suggested by the reviewers.</p><p><italic>3) The mechanical control system is not clear. Does the increased MT extension (or initiation) in the wave result from the increased cross-section area or from increased rate of extension of individual MTs per unit volume? The super-resolution microscopy suggests that the microtubule number is greatly increased behind the wave. This means there are more MT ends available for extension. Perhaps EM would help show whether more MTs are being seeded in the wave, or whether the dilation is creating volume for more tubulin dimers to recruit to the growing plus ends.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 1 points out that the data on the mechanical control system is incomplete and suggests some excellent experiments to provide more evidence for this model. We have added this and other experiments to help support our model, although we would like to emphasis that this is not necessarily the only means that actin waves can increase microtubule polymerization, but the simplest one that fits the data we have gathered.</p><p>To look at whether the increase in the number of polymerizing microtubule plus-ends was a proportional increase to width, or increased per unit area in an actin wave, we counted the flow of EB1 puncta (the number of puncta to pass through a plane in a neurite in a set amount of time – this is not per unit width) in different widths of smooth neurite shafts, and in the shafts of neurites bearing actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We found that there was a roughly linear relationship between neurite width and EB1 puncta flow. (Note that this measurement is of a single z-plane and does not count the entire volume of the neurite). We further found that the flow per neurite width in actin waves fell within the distribution of flow measurements in smooth, control neurites. This data supports a positive correlation between neurite width and the number of polymerization microtubules, and affirms that the increase in EB1 puncta in actin waves is consistent with the increase in width.</p><p>We have further showed that at a bottleneck, where the neurite rapidly narrows, we see the disappearance of EB1 puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right), similar to what you would see at the leading edge of a cell, or at a growth cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, left). This data also supports a model where microtubules prefer to polymerize into open space, and will stop polymerizing if they reach a steric restriction.</p><p>Finally, we added additional statistics to the bottleneck experiments performed in the previous version of the paper, re-affirming that over time, polymerizing microtubules upstream of a bottleneck will not all successfully pass through the bottleneck (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). We believe this data further strengthens the argument that microtubule polymerization is affected by steric constraints, rather than itself solely dictating the width of the neurite.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2: The strengths of this study are that the actin wave phenomenon is very interesting, and the efforts at reliable quantitative characterization are impressive. Determining wave function within an initial study would be a lot to ask, but some further clarity on the limits of the study is needed. In particular, the physiological purpose of the waves is incompletely understood from the current data. Also, there is little evidence other than codistribution with CA-KIF5C and synaptophysin vesicles for a role in axon specification, as implied in the title and text. As a practical issue, it has remained unresolved how reliably the CA-KIF5C motor domain alone can locate the putative nascent axonal process. The current study seems to push the question back to the actin wave, but it remains unclear whether the CA-KIF5C construct is simply carried forward as part of the increased cytoplasmic volume, whether it is enriched solely as a result of the increased MT number, or whether it localizes specifically to MT plus ends, not a known form of behavior for this kinesin. Another issue is the limited data indicating that actin actually leads the way in this behavior. Modifications and additions to the text and data are recommended to clarify these and other important issues and to improve the presentation of the data.</italic></p><p>The concern that CA-KIF5C is simply reporting on cytoplasmic volume is addressed in Reviewer 2’s point 5.</p><p><italic>1) Based on the frequency per neurite and the velocity of the actin waves, they would be expected to appear very commonly in unpolarized neurons, perhaps as lateral lamellipodial protrusions in at least one or more neurites in general, and not just in this study. Are they detectable in published images, and how commonly? Or might they be a product of specific culture conditions used here?</italic></p><p>See response to Reviewer 1 point 2.</p><p><italic>2) The function of the waves in neuronal differentiation remains largely unaddressed and is a critical issue for understanding the physiological importance of these structures. Neurons should be monitored for an additional day to correlate actin wave activity with longer-term neurite extension and axonogenesis. It seems as though there may be no direct link between the waves and axon formation, in which case the waves may remain for the moment a curiosity, albeit a remarkable one.</italic></p><p>Reviewer 2 brings up an excellent point concerning the role of actin waves during the precise step of symmetry breaking and following axon specification. Flynn et al. (2009) previously observed an upregulation of the number of actin waves in the neurite that becomes the axon. In post-polarized neurons, we still observe the production of actin waves in the shorter, non-axonal processes.</p><p>However, these actin waves have a greatly diminished effect on neurite outgrowth (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media9">Movie 9</xref>). We speculate that at this point, other mechanisms have been established to biaspolarized transport to the nascent axon, and the role of actin waves in controlling microtubule-based transport is diminished. We furthermore observe that once axons grow long, actin waves are less likely to travel all the way to the axonal tip. This also correlates with more observed neurite outgrowth independent of actin waves in more mature neurons. Although this matter could and should be further clarified, we respectfully argue that this is beyond the scope of this particular story.</p><p>To interpret what our data suggests in the light of axon specification, we believe that actin waves link neurite outgrowth to microtubule-based transport in order to help neurites grow out and explore the extracellular space for growth cues, while the neurite can also receive internal pro- growth cues. This is only one part of the kinetics of axon specification though. The maintenance of growth cues at the neurite tip might not just depend on actin waves, but also the presence of external growth cues that can prevent growth cone collapse and retrograde movement of the components in the growth cone.</p><p><italic>3) This relates to another issue, the localization of CA-KIF5C to neurite tips. This is reported to correlate strongly with axon identity, yet CA-KIF5C appears to be present in most or all neurites in the current study. What are the implications for CA-KIFC as a pre-axon marker?</italic></p><p>We examine CA-KIF5C localization in pre-polarized neurons, when the axon has yet to be determined. Multiple studies have shown that CA-KIF5C localizes to a single neurite or subset of neurites in multi-polar neurons in a dynamic fashion (Jacobson et al., Neuron, 2006; Toriyama et al., Mole Sys Biol., 2010, Randlett et al., Neuron, 2011). We use a virtually identical construct to that used by Banker et al. (Neuron, 2006), with a change in the fluorescent protein that preserves the original linker. Cloning is described in the Materials and methods. CA-KIF5C localization is hugely dynamic. The fluorescently-tagged motor protein will move in and out of neurites at a timescale on the order of tens of minutes. It can also dwell in the growth cones for variable amounts of time. Localization of CA-KIF5C at any given time will be determined by the balance of the anterograde and retrograde movement of the protein. Given our finding that the CA-KIF5C travels with the actin wave and is thus linked with neurite outgrowth, it appears that CA-KIF5C presence in the neurite coincides with a neurite’s attempt to grow out and become the axon. Its movement out of the neurite may occur when the signals traditionally responsible for axon specification are not strong enough to maintain CA-KIF5C and other possible pro-axon factors at the growth cone. During the multi-polar phase, each neurite has the inherent capability to become an axon, and thus most or all neurites will grow and receive growth promoting factors. Due to insufficient growth cues (both external and internal) however, most neurites will be unable to permanently specify as axons.</p><p> <italic>4) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Actin waves are linked to anterograde Synaptophysin-mediated vesicular transport during the multi-polar phase of axon formation“: The authors report actin wave velocities of 2-3 μm/min in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, but less than this &lt; 2 μm/min in Figure</italic></p><p><italic>3E &amp; 5E controls.</italic></p><p>The speed of actin waves varies moderately from day-to-day and from neurite-to-neurite, perhaps influenced by imaging and culturing conditions. More photo-toxic imaging conditions can affect speed and possibly frequency; where the actin wave is measured in the neurite can also affect the measured speed. The speeds measured still all fall within an expected distribution. Importantly, controls are always assessed in parallel to perturbations performed in similar conditions.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>: This graph represents an important form of analysis, in showing the temporal sequence of actin vs. CA-KIF5C at a point within the neurite. Surprisingly, this is the only such analysis shown, but serves as the basis for a major claim (see summary diagram and Title) that actin leads the way. More of this type of analysis comparing actin with other subcellular structures should be provided.</italic></p><p>To address this point, we first conducted a more precise analysis of the delay between actin and CA-KIF5C entry into the neurite by measuring the time delay (if any) between the increase in actin signal and the increase in CA-KIF5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The re-analyzed data confirmed that an increase in actin signal often (although not always) precedes the increase in CA-KIF5C. This</p><p>observation is in agreement with our new photo-activation results that show that de-novo generated Rac1 activity is sufficient to initiate actin waves and increase microtubule polymerization. However, it is important to point out that we are simply measuring the first minutes of actin wave entry into the neurite. Once a burst of CA-KIF5C has entered the neurite, it rapidly catches up with the actin wave. We therefore have worked to emphasize in the text that actin and microtubules do work together to advance the wave of actin, polymerizing microtubules, and microtubule-based transport.</p><p>To further address the concern that the movement of CA-KIF5C is mirroring that of cytoplasm, we monitored the ratio of CA-KIF5C-Citrine to cytoplasmic Turquoise in the tips of neurites over time. We can see the ratio of these signals increase and decrease as CA-KIF5C moves in and out of the neurites, suggesting that the CA-KIF5C increases are distinct from increases in volume. Moreover, the addition of Nocodazole causes the ratio to become constant over time, affirming a role in polymerizing microtubules in the movement of CA-KIF5C. Reviewer 2 notes that it appears that CA-KIF5C may be moving with microtubule plus ends. An interpretation of our data could support this hypothesis, which has been suggested by other papers (Vale et al., J Biol Chem, 1994; Nakata et al., J Cell Biol., 2011). Of note, if there is a cytoplasmic fraction of CA-KIF5C that contributes to some of our intensity traces, we believe this ratiometric analysis supports the validity of the entry event analysis.</p><p><italic>6) In the first paragraph of the subsection “Actin waves are linked to anterograde Synaptophysin-mediated vesicular transport during the multi-polar phase of axon formation “and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>: The authors claim that &quot;arriving actin waves</italic>.…<italic>[were]</italic>…</p><p> <italic>in most cases followed by neurite extension.&quot; However, only 8/16 showed some degree of neurite extension.</italic></p><p>Addressed in Reviewer 1’s point 1.</p><p> <italic>7) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>: The authors relied on only the moving vesicles to plot the curve on the right. How does a plot of total vesicles appear (moving and non-moving)? This issue gets at whether bulk cytoplasm is moving along with actin, or, instead, whether microtubule-based transport is stimulated within the region of the wave.</italic></p><p>Following Reviewer 2’s suggestion, we examined the motile and non-motile Synaptophysin-positive vesicles in actin waves. Our movies indicate that a substantial portion of the vesicles are non-motile and fixed in place, not subject to Brownian motion (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Movie 6</xref>). This suggests that these vesicles are either attached to microtubules (or possibly actin) and are not simply cytoplasmic.</p><p><italic>8) What is meaning of stalled EB1, which is reported to associate as short lines at the growing plus ends of microtubules?</italic></p><p>Our writing was unclear when describing the result of the Jasplakinolide experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C, D</xref>). The EB1 puncta are still moving in a stereotypical fashion after addition of the Jasplakinolide within the neurite and the actin wave, meaning that microtubule polymerization is still taking place within the neurite and actin wave. However, the wave of EB1 puncta (or the wave of</p><p>polymerizing microtubules) largely disappears once it hits the bottleneck. We think this is another example of polymerizing microtubules being sterically hindered from moving past a bottleneck.</p><p><italic>9) What is the three-dimensional nature of the F-tractin peak. Are we seeing anterograde transport of F-actin filaments, a bulge of swollen cytoplasm, or a combination of lamellipodia and surface ruffles?</italic></p><p>To answer these questions, we performed additional super-resolution SIM experiments using phalloidin-stained neurons. 3D reconstructions of the actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) show a widened shaft with lamellipodia jutting out in a perpendicular manner. The lamellipodia structures stay mainly within the plane of the glass surface, with some dimension in 3D.</p><p><italic>10) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>: The superresolution image showing MT density in the wave is useful, but a comparison with MT density ahead of and behind the wave would make more sense to include.</italic></p><p>An excellent point and an oversight on our part. New images were introduced to better illustrate the MT density before and after the actin wave. We also performed statistical analysis on number of microtubules cables before and after the actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) to reinforce the statistics taken from the low-resolution immunofluorescence data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3: In general, the work is very fascinating and gives a very interesting perspective of how neuronal polarization can occur. While their exciting work has the potential to become a fine eLife paper, the authors need to perform some experiments to put their idea on a more solid basis. All of the experiments are relatively straightforward and should be all done. 1) The authors show that kinesin-1 mediated transport is enhanced after waves. What happens when kinesin 1 activity is abrogated? Do the authors still see traffic into the axon? Do waves actually still form without kinesin 1 activity?</italic></p><p>Several previous studies have examined the effect of Kinesin 1 knock-down on axon formation and trafficking. Ferreira et al. (JCB, 1992) showed that knock-down of Kinesin 1 caused disregulation of the trafficking of GAP-43 and synapsin, and also caused shorter neurites.</p><p>Konishi and Setou (Nature Neuroscience, 2009) showed that knock-down of Kinesin 1 caused polarity defects in neurons (more multi-polar neurons) and shorter axons, and the introduction of a mutant Kinesin-1 causes erroneous distribution of Piccolo, a pre-synaptic protein. Knock-down of Kinesin-1 also causes an aberrant localization of CRMP2, a protein important for axonal development (Kimura et al., J. of Neurochemistry, 2005). These results suggest that Kinesin-1 does play a role in trafficking and polarity.</p><p>As per Reviewer 3’s suggestion, we also attempted to examine the effect of Kinesin-1 knock down on actin waves. We first attempted to knock down all three known isoforms of Kinesin-1, but were unable to achieve more than mild knock down of each isoform (assessed via qPCR). We then decided to do a single knockdown of KIF5C, an isoform highly expressed in the brain, and examine the effect of the single knock down on actin waves formation. After achieving ~65% knock down (assessed via qPCR), we found no apparent affect on axon formation, assessed at DIV3. This differs from published results (Konishi and Setou, 2009), likely because the paper cited was able to knock down all three isoforms. We also observed no affect on actin wave formation during a co-culture experiment of control and KIF5C knock-down, assessed on DIV2. siRNA’s were introduced before plating on DIV0. Moving forward, it is unclear whether the lack of phenotypes observed during knock-down is biologically significant, or a result of insufficient knock-down.</p><p><italic>2) The authors argue that the actin waves dilate the neurites to enable enhanced microtubule polymerization and microtubule based transport. Could the actin waves enable this process by dynamizing the cortical actin. Consistent with this possibility the authors show that jasplakinolide prevents these processes. The authors should try the converse experiment with cytochalasin D or latrcunculin. If their hypothesis is true then cytoD treatment (probably local treatment) should enable dilation and enhance microtubule polymerization. Please check also Bradke and Dotti, Science, 1999, where preferential trafficking and axon formation has been reported after local actin depolymerization.</italic></p><p>Per the reviewer’s suggestion, we observed what happened to actin waves and neurites in the presence of Latrunculin A. Interestingly, although LatA treatment did not appear to affect smooth neurites, we found that actin waves, or regions rich in f-actin, would dissolve (as expected) and often (though not always), caused neurite widening in various sections of the neurite shaft. In Figure 5—figure supplement 1, three examples are noted. In a, the neurite in front of the former actin wide widens; in b, the entire neurite widens; in c, the base of the neurite widens.</p><p>This may be an example of the actin cortex “softening” or dynamizing, allowing EB1 puncta to pass through, although we would be careful not to over-interpret the data.</p><p><italic>3) What happens if the cultures are treated with low doses of Taxol (3 nM) that enables microtubule polymerization (Witte et al., JCB, 2008)? How does it affect microtubule polymerization and dilation of the neurite? Is there an effect on wave formation?</italic></p><p>This is an excellent suggestion and a good way to further probe the connection between actin and microtubules. In response, we treated F-tractin-mCherry expressing neurons with increasing doses of Taxol (5 – 50 nM) and observed effects on actin waves. Although we did not see any obvious effects on actin waves at low doses within the several hours of exposure observed, high doses of Taxol disrupted the processive nature of actin waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Bursts of actin polymerization were still observed, although the bursts could originate in different location in the neurite, rather than the cell body, and lacked the anterograde processive behavior of stereotypical actin waves. EB1 puncta measurements in the presence of a high dose of Taxol show that microtubule polymerization is diminished at high doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), so it remains unclear whether the effect of Taxol on actin waves is from the stabilization of microtubules, or from its affects on microtubules polymerization.</p><p> <italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>: According to the Methods part, the authors fixed the cells and subsequently extracted them. Therefore, soluble tubulin is left in these staining. The authors should perform a simultaneous fixation-extraction so that tubulin dimers are gone for the actual staining procedure.</italic></p><p>To answer, we attempted several types of fixation-extraction experiments, but were unable to fully extract a cytosolic fluorescent protein control. We decided to instead acquire additional SIM measurements in order to count single MT cables. These measurements would be independent of the signal from the tubulin dimers, and thus still address the referee’s comment. Our data showed that a greater number of microtubule cables were present in and behind the actin wave (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). This enrichment ratio was also statistically greater than the control ratio in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>. Given that the presence of dimers would artificially increase both ratios, (experimental and the control ratio), we are satisfied that the single microtubule counts confirm an enrichment of microtubules behind the actin wave greater than would be caused by natural widening of neurites as you approach the cell body.</p><p> <italic>5) The authors should mention in the paper that it had been previously shown that enhanced membrane traffic precedes axon formation (Bradke and Dotti, Neuron, 1997). I don't think that this info will take anything away from their exciting findings.</italic></p><p>An omission on our part that has been corrected.</p></body></sub-article></article>
