A candidate mechanism underlying the centrifugal direction selectivity of SAC dendrites is synaptic inhibition onto SACs. Here we disrupted this inhibition by perturbing distinct sets of GABAergic inputs onto SACs – removing either GABA release or GABA receptors from SACs. We found that lateral inhibition onto Off SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells is required for optimal direction selectivity of the Off pathway. In contrast, lateral inhibition onto On SACs is not necessary for direction selectivity of the On pathway when the moving object is on a homogenous background, but is required when the background is noisy. These results demonstrate that distinct sets of inhibitory mechanisms are recruited to generate direction selectivity under different visual conditions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.21053.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.21053.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>retinal circuitry</kwd><kwd>inhibition</kwd><kwd>direction selectivity</kwd><kwd>starburst amacrine cell</kwd><kwd>lateral inhibition</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Koren</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wei</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010310</institution-id><institution>E.

One of the main output neurons that signal motion direction from the retina to higher visual centers, the On-Off DSGC, has bistratified dendritic arbors that receive directionally tuned inhibition from On and Off subtypes of SACs at each of these sublamina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Famiglietti, 1983</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kittila and Massey, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>). SACs are monostratified, axonless interneurons that release GABA and acetylcholine from varicosities at the distal ends of their dendritic arbors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brecha et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Famiglietti, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kosaka et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">O'Malley and Masland, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vaney and Young, 1988</xref>). Generating directionally tuned GABAergic inhibition onto DSGCs requires two mechanisms. First, GABAergic inputs preferentially originate from SAC dendritic sectors that extend in the anti-preferred (null) direction of On-Off DSGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Briggman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fried et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2011</xref>). Second, the dendritic sectors of SACs are electrotonically isolated and directionally tuned to motion in the centrifugal direction (from soma to dendritic tips) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2002</xref>). Since null-direction motion for a DSGC corresponds to centrifugal motion for its presynaptic SAC dendrites, maximal GABA release from SACs to DSGCs occurs during motion in the null direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21053.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic deletion of <italic>Slc32a1</italic> from SACs eliminates reciprocal inhibition between SACs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic shows laminar organization of cell types involved in the direction selective circuit in the IPL.

Centrifugal direction selectivity has also been attributed to other mechanisms such as patterned distribution of voltage-gated channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oesch and Taylor, 2010</xref>) and chloride transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavrikov et al., 2006</xref>), segregation of excitatory inputs from distinct bipolar cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2014</xref>); but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stincic et al., 2016</xref>), and skewed distribution of glutamatergic inputs along SAC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). However, the relative contributions of these synaptic and intrinsic mechanisms to SAC centrifugal preference is unclear. Furthermore, the role that synaptic inhibition onto SACs plays in the direction selectivity of DSGCs has not yet been experimentally demonstrated.</p><p>To address these outstanding questions, we perturbed GABAergic inhibition onto SACs using two types of SAC-specific genetic manipulations. The first one disrupted GABA release from SACs by conditionally knocking out the vesicular GABA transporter (Vgat) gene <italic>Slc32a1</italic> in SACs. This selectively removed reciprocal SAC-SAC inhibition and allowed us to determine its contribution to the centrifugal direction selectivity of SACs. The second manipulation blocked all GABAergic inputs onto SACs by removing their functional GABA receptors. This enabled us to determine the role that total GABAergic inhibition onto SACs plays in the direction selectivity of both SACs and On-Off DSGCs. Combining these genetic manipulations with pharmacology, we found that motion stimuli with different contrast and backgrounds recruit different sets of inhibitory mechanisms for the computation of motion direction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Direction selectivity of SAC dendrites persists in the absence of SAC-mediated GABA release during a simple moving bar stimulus</title><p>To eliminate reciprocal GABAergic inhibition among neighboring SACs, we used a conditional knockout (KO) mouse line in which <italic>Slc32a1</italic> is selectively removed from SACs (<italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO) to block GABA release from SACs. This line contains homozygous floxed <italic>Slc32a1</italic> alleles (acronym: <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup>) to replace the endogenous <italic>Slc32a1</italic> gene, and a choline acetyltransferase (<italic>Chat)-IRES-Cre</italic> knockin allele for SAC-specific <italic>Cre</italic> expression (acronym: <italic>C</italic>). A floxed <italic>tdTomato</italic> transgene (acronym: <italic>T</italic>) was also included when SACs were targeted for electrophysiological recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We have previously shown that these KO mice display disrupted GABAergic inhibition from SACs to DSGCs and no detectable developmental compensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pei et al., 2015</xref>). To confirm that GABAergic synapses between neighboring SACs are also lost in these mice, we performed paired recordings from neighboring SACs in the ganglion cell layer with intersoma distance of 50~100 um. Evoked GABAergic inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) were measured from one SAC at holding potential of −80 mV while the other SAC was depolarized to 0 mV for 20 ms in voltage clamp configuration. We detected reciprocal inhibition between SACs in 9 out of 9 pairs in the control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, mean peak amplitude 16.4 ± 2.8 pA, five mice), consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kostadinov and Sanes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>). We did not detect any evoked IPSCs in the KO group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, n = 9 pairs, three mice), indicating that reciprocal SAC-SAC inhibition is abolished in <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice.</p><p>Next, we examined centrifugal direction selectivity of SAC dendrites in these KO mice using two-photon imaging of the calcium indicator GCaMP6. We imaged calcium transients in varicosities located in the furthest distal 20 μm of GCaMP6-expressing SAC dendrites while a bright bar moved against a homogeneous dark background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We term this stimulus &quot;simple moving bar stimulus”. As expected, the leading edge of the bright bar evoked calcium transients in On SACs and the trailing edge evoked responses in Off SACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). We used the peak amplitude of the calcium transients in varicosities as a measure of the strength of dendritic activation. We quantified direction selectivity of responses using the direction selectivity index (DSI, see Experimental methods) and the vector sum. In control mice, dendritic calcium signals in both On and Off SACs show strong directional tuning to motion in the centrifugal direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). In <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice, centrifugal direction selectivity (both DSI and vector sum) of On SACs is similar to that of control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). However, Off SACs exhibit a small, but statistically significant, increase in DSI and vector sum values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) due to decreased centripetal direction response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Adding the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 to <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO retinas reduces these direction selectivity parameters for both On and Off SACs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–2G</xref>), indicating a role for GABAergic inhibition of SACs by non-SAC amacrine cells. Our results demonstrate that, for a simple moving bar stimulus, losing reciprocal SAC-SAC inhibition in <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice does not affect the direction selectivity of On SACs, and enhances the direction selectivity of Off SACs.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.21053.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Centrifugal preference of SACs is not reduced in <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Schematic of simple moving bar stimulus used during calcium imaging of SAC dendrites.

The second is direct GABAergic input onto SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). To distinguish between these two possibilities, we examined the direction selectivity of SACs when GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are removed from SACs but not from bipolar cells.

We targeted SAC-pDSGC pairs with overlapping dendritic arbors and intersoma distances of 60–80 µm.

What, then, is the role of lateral inhibition in the On pathway? We hypothesized that our stimulus conditions did not optimally activate this inhibitory pathway. In particular, a noisy background may more effectively engage this inhibition and reveal its functional importance in direction selectivity. To test this idea, we measured the direction selectivity of pDSGCs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice using a bright bar moving against a flickering checkerboard background. This flickering checkerboard provides &quot;white noise&quot; that is commonly used for mapping receptive fields in the spike-triggered average method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chichilnisky, 2001</xref>). We set the brightness of this moving bar equal to that of our simple moving bar stimulus, and varied the brightness of the checker pattern from 0% to 100% of the moving bar intensity. In control mice, the pDSGC spiking response maintains direction selectivity over a wide range of checker intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–7C</xref>).

To test if changing either ambient illuminance or contrast alone can mimic the effect of introducing the flickering checkerboard, we measured the direction selectivity of pDSGCs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice using the simple moving bar stimulus with different contrast and background illuminance levels that lie in the upper and lower range of the flickering checkerboard stimuli. We found that, similar to the results with our original simple bar stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), the On component of the pDSGC's spiking response displays normal direction selectivity, while the Off component shows reduced direction selectivity at all illuminance and contrast levels tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Therefore, the impaired direction selectivity seen in the On pathway in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice with the flickering checkboard background is not due to changes in stimulus contrast or ambient illuminance. Instead, the noise introduced by the flickering checkerboard is important for the functional recruitment of lateral inhibition in the On pathway.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here we used synapse-specific genetic manipulations to distinguish the effects on the retinal direction selectivity of GABAergic inhibition originating from different sources. We found that distinct sets of inhibitory mechanisms are recruited, depending on the properties of the background and the positive versus negative contrast of the moving object. The optimal direction selectivity of a dark object, encoded by the Off pathway, requires lateral inhibition from non-SAC amacrine cells onto Off SACs. In contrast, direction selectivity of a bright object, encoded by the On pathway, does not require lateral inhibition onto On SACs when the moving bar stimulus lies on a homogeneous background, but does require it when the bar moves on a noisy background. Together, our results highlight the multiple levels of synaptic mechanisms that underlie direction selectivity under complex visual conditions.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title><italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO and <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice display no detectable developmental compensations</title><p>Although using conditional KO mice offers the unique advantage of achieving the cell type and synapse specificity, a major concern of this genetic approach is that neural circuits may potentially be altered due to developmental compensations.

Therefore, we must verify that aside from loss of SAC-mediated GABA release in <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice and loss of GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors in SACs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice, the rest of the direction selectivity circuit is not altered. To address this issue, we examined the other known synapse types that are involved in retinal direction selectivity, including the cholinergic and GABAergic synapses between SACs and DSGCs, as well as the glutamatergic inputs onto DSGCs from bipolar cells. We found that these synapses showed no detectable changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pei et al., 2015</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), indicating that removing GABA release or GABA receptors from SACs does not lead to compensatory developmental changes at other synapses in the direction selective circuit. We cannot discount the possibility that developmental compensation has occurred at sites not examined in this study. However, our findings are consistent with multiple previous studies that demonstrate that the early development of retinal direction selectivity is highly resistant to changes in neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chan and Chiao, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elstrott et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hamby et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wei et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>After direction selectivity is established, visual experience has been shown to play a role in refining the clustered distribution of preferred directions of On-Off DSGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bos et al., 2016</xref>).

A major candidate source for this lateral inhibition is GABAergic input from neighboring SACs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>). However, when a bar moves against a homogeneous dark background, we found that blocking GABA release or GABA receptors of On SACs does not affect their centrifugal preference. Therefore, under this stimulus condition, lateral inhibition is not necessary for centrifugal direction selectivity of On SACs, and other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oesch and Taylor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>) must act to maintain it.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2-2"><title>The off pathway</title><p>Unlike On SACs, Off SACs are sensitive to lateral inhibition during the simple bar stimulus. Removing all GABAergic inputs onto Off SACs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice reduces centrifugal preference. As a result, the Off component of pDSGC inhibitory inputs and spiking responses shows significantly impaired direction selectivity. This effect does not stem from SAC-SAC inhibition, since the loss of this inhibition in <italic>Slc32a1 KO</italic> mice does not reduce direction selectivity of Off SACs, but rather slightly enhances it by decreasing centripetal-direction response. This indicates that the centrifugal preference of Off SAC dendrites requires additional GABAergic inputs onto Off SACs from non-SAC amacrine cells. These cells are presumably the wide-field amacrine cells that synapse onto the proximal dendrites of Off SACs and contribute about 8% of the total number of inhibitory synapses onto Off SACs identified by connectomic reconstruction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>). Though these synapses represent a small fraction of the synaptic inputs onto Off SACs, they may be sufficiently strong and efficient for shunting glutamatergic excitatory inputs that are also clustered in the proximal SAC dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We still do not know what mechanism underlies the improved selectivity of Off SACs in <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice, and if this improvement detected by calcium imaging impacts the spiking output of On-Off DSGCs. One possibility is that Off SACs also provide GABAergic inhibition to the above-mentioned non-SAC amacrine cells. In the absence of GABA release from SACs in <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO mice, these non-SAC amacrine cells might be disinhibited, thus providing stronger lateral inhibition to Off SACs to decrease their centripetal-direction response. Directly testing this hypothesis requires targeted recordings from pairs of Off SACs and non-SAC amacrine cells, an experiment that is currently hindered by a lack of cell type-specific markers.</p><p>We have shown here that the direction selectivity of On and Off SACs is differentially affected in both <italic>Slc32a1</italic> KO and <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice. Thus, the direction selective circuitry is not merely mirrored in the On and Off layers of the IPL, but consists of distinct sets of mechanisms in each sublamina. Our study therefore adds to others that have demonstrated differences and interactions between the On and Off pathways of the direction selective circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor and Vaney, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Vlasits et al., 2014</xref>) and of other retinal circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geffen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tikidji-Hamburyan et al., 2015</xref>).

One elaborated form, the reciprocal inhibition between inhibitory neurons, has been described in multiple brain areas such as retina, thalamus, midbrain and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Machens et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miller and Wang, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Papadopoulou et al., 2011</xref>). In sensory and cognitive systems, lateral inhibition motifs have been implicated in selecting the target feature in an environment when other 'competitor' features are present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mysore and Knudsen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sharpee, 2012</xref>). In the visual system, moving objects in natural scenes have backgrounds that are rarely homogeneous and stationary, but rather are spatially and temporally noisy. These can serve as 'competitor' stimuli that pose challenges to the direction selective circuit for reliably detecting motion direction. We postulate that lateral inhibition onto On SACs functions to safeguard direction selectivity against a noisy environment. A noisy background increases activation of bipolar cells, which in turn provides stronger glutamatergic drive to the downstream amacrine cells including SACs. Under this condition, the lateral inhibitory network may be in a more 'primed' state to be efficiently recruited by the motion stimuli and to exert its function. In contrast, amacrine cells involved in lateral inhibition are less activated when bipolar cells adapt to the gray background, and thus the moving bar alone may not be sufficient to significantly recruit lateral inhibition in the On pathway. Consistent with this hypothesis, direction selectivity of the On response of DSGCs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice is normal when the background is homogeneous but deteriorates as soon as white noise is introduced into the background. These findings represent an intriguing example in which additional neural mechanisms are recruited when the visual stimulus more closely resembles natural viewing conditions, but simpler visual stimuli involving only the feature of interest may not reveal the functional significance of these mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Felsen and Dan, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felsen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turner and Rieke, 2016</xref>). A notable analogy has been reported in the visual cortex: a prominent inhibitory component in the receptive field of visual cortical neurons is uniquely revealed by more complex natural stimuli but is not observed with synthetic sinusoidal gratings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">David et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparison to previous pharmacological results using GABA receptor antagonist</title><p>The role of lateral inhibition onto SACs in direction selectivity has been exclusively studied in On SACs using bath application of the GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor antagonist SR95531 with variable results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ding et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Euler et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gavrikov et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hausselt et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lee and Zhou, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oesch and Taylor, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Vlasits et al., 2016</xref>). This variability may be due to a number of factors, such as species differences, conditions of visual stimulation, somatic recordings versus calcium imaging at the dendrites, and locations of varicosities along SAC dendrites. Furthermore, the effect of the antagonist cannot be attributed to specific type(s) of GABAergic synapses since GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors are extensively expressed in amacrine cells and bipolar cells in the IPL. Here, we combined pharmacology with the genetic dissection of the GABAergic circuitry to determine the synaptic loci that participate in direction selectivity. This approach allowed us to assign functional roles to different inhibitory synaptic components, and to identify a new component in the functional wiring diagram of the direction selective circuit: inhibitory inputs from non-SAC amacrine cells onto Off SACs.</p><p>Pharmacological experiments cannot establish the ultimate effect that lateral inhibition onto SACs has on the spiking output of DSGCs because SR95531 disrupts SAC-DSGC inhibition. However, by genetically eliminating GABA<sub>A</sub> receptors but not neurotransmitter release from SACs in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice, we preserved the critical synaptic connections between SACs and DSGCs, and determined the role that GABAergic inputs onto SACs play in the spiking output of DSGC’s. We found that the direction selectivity of On-Off DSGC spiking decreases when SAC centrifugal preference is reduced. Therefore, the inhibitory mechanisms contributing to the centrifugal preference of SACs that we have studied here are functionally relevant for determining the signals that are relayed from the retina to the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The <italic>Gabra2</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mouse line was a generous gift from Dr. Uwe Rudolph at Harvard Medical School. <italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>flox/flox</sup> mice (<italic>Slc32a1&lt;tm1Lowl&gt;/J</italic>), <italic>Chat-IRES-Cre</italic> mice (129S6-<italic>Chat<sup>tm2(cre)Lowl</sup></italic>/J) and floxed <italic>tdTomato</italic> mice (129S6-<italic>Gt(ROSA)26Sor<sup>tm9(CAG-tdTomato)Hze</sup></italic>/J) were acquired from the Jackson Laboratory. <italic>Drd4–GFP</italic> mice were originally developed by MMRRC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mmrrc.org/strains/231/0231.html">http://www.mmrrc.org/strains/231/0231.html</ext-link>) in the Swiss Webster background, and were subsequently backcrossed to C57BL/6 background.

For statistical analysis, we compared variance across varicosities on the dendrites of the same SAC versus variance across varicosities of different SACs. Since the latter was larger, we averaged DSI and vector sum values of all the varicosities belonging to one SAC to get a single data point, and took N in the statistical analysis to be the number of cells, which approximately equals the number of imaging windows.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Two-photon targeted loose-attached recording of <italic>GFP</italic>-positive neurons for light response</title><p>The two-photon targeted recording of light responses was performed as in (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pei et al., 2015</xref>). Briefly, the retinas were perfused with oxygenated Ames at 32–33°C. Cells were visualized with infrared light (&gt;900 nm) and an IR-sensitive video camera (Watec). <italic>Drd4-GFP</italic>-positive cells were identified using a two-photon microscope (Bruker Nano Surface Division) and a Ti:sapphire laser (Coherent Chameleon Ultra II) tuned to 920 nm. An electrode of 3–5 MΩ was filled with Ames’ medium for loose patch recordings of spikes. Then the electrode was carefully removed, and a new electrode filled with cesium-based internal solution and 25 μm Alexa 594 was used to fill the recorded cell. An image stack of the Alexa-488 filled pDSGC was acquired with the two-photon microscope at <italic>z</italic> intervals of 1.5 μm and was resampled three times for each z-plane using a 60x objective (Olympus LUMPlanFl/IR 60x/0.90W). Images were acquired to cover the entire dendritic field of the cell to verify the bistratified dendritic arbor and the cofasciculation with <italic>tdTomato</italic>-expressing SACs. Rarely, we encountered <italic>Drd4-GFP</italic> positive neurons that did not show the above two characteristics in both control and knockout groups. These mislabeled cells are not included in the analysis.</p><p>Data were analyzed using custom protocols in MATLAB. The number of spikes evoked by the leading (On) and trailing (Off) edges of the bar were counted using MATLAB and averaged across trials in each direction. Spiking DSI is defined as (N<sub>pref</sub>− N<sub>null</sub>)/ (N<sub>pref</sub> + N<sub>null</sub>) where N is the number of spikes evoked by the leading or trailing edge of the moving bar.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Grouped data with error bars are presented as mean ± SEM and tested for normality.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Andrew King (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal her identity: Yang Dan (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study provides key insights into the mechanisms underlying direction selectivity. The specific question addressed in this study concerns the role of lateral inhibition between starburst amacrine cells (SACs), the inhibitory interneurons that provide a source of directional inhibition onto direction selective ganglion cells. Using precise genetic manipulations to SACs, they provide direct evidence that the circuitries of ON and OFF SACs must indeed be different, as they rely on GABAergic input to very different degrees. The most exciting result of this study, however, is that SAC-SAC interactions render SAC direction selectivity more robust under more natural stimulus conditions, that is in the presence of noise. This is, to our knowledge, the first convincing demonstration of the long standing idea that different dendritic direction selectivity mechanisms supplement each other in order to render motion direction detection robust and as independent as possible from the stimulus.</p><p>All reviewers agree that this is a very nice, carefully conducted study with important results. The effects are clear and there are several controls based on paired recordings to assess the physiological impact of the knockouts.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The finding that lateral inhibition in the ON pathway is required for direction selectivity only with noisy background is intriguing, and the study would be greatly strengthened if the authors can expand on that point more. In particular, the authors are drawing this conclusion on a fairly small parameter set. Although they vary the contrast of the random checkerboards, they use only one bar velocity and one bar contrast for the primary stimulus. This is potentially dangerous since the changing checkerboard intensity is effectively changing the contrast between bar and background. This is particularly important for the recording conditions since at 32 °C (slightly below physiological temperatures) the photoreceptor responses are slower and 15 Hz noise refresh rate for the checkerboard might be equivalent to a gray background.</p><p>We recommend that the authors strengthen this particular aspect of the study. Since all the methods are in place, such additional experiments should be doable within a few weeks.</p><p>A few suggestions would be:</p><p>Alter the contrast and/or velocity of the stimulus and assess the impact of flickering background on tuning in WT and GABA-A α2-ko.</p><p>Report whether the noisy stimulus paradigm impacts the tuning in Vgat KO mice. This would greatly strengthen the argument (subsection “The role of lateral inhibition during a moving bar stimulus against a noisy background”) that SAC-SAC inhibition is important for safeguarding direction selectivity in noisy environment.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, control and KO showed no difference at 0% but a large difference at 3% checker intensity, so it seems like a sudden increase. It would be helpful to map that part of the curve a bit more to see the threshold at which inhibition starts playing a role.</p><p>2) It would be helpful to add a bit more discussion on why lateral inhibition between starburst cells would be most effective in a noisy background.</p><p>3) The reference list reads as if there was no research done on direction selectivity before the year 2000; in fact, the only reference to earlier work is a methods paper on visual stimulus software. This is particularly prominent in their Introduction. The authors should acknowledge earlier work appropriately.</p><p>4) One mystery that is not completely explained is why a decrease in lateral inhibition leads to a decrease in SAC responses to centripetal motion, enhancing direction selectivity in the OFF pathway. The reason for this is not at all clear and would be helpful for the authors to postulate the reason for this.</p><p>5) The figures are underselling the great quality of the data – the accessibility of the data could be much improved by cleaning up the figures and making them more consistent. Fonts are often too small, so are some of the illustrations; the use of colors is partially inconsistent, and repetitive, unnecessary text clutters the figures (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B-C,E-F</xref>). In addition, in some of the figures the use of abbreviations adds work for non-expert readers. For example, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, &quot;CP&quot; and &quot;CF&quot; could have been spelled out the first time they are used since there is space.

If it is, we should see reduced direction selectivity in the On pathway in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice during a moving bar stimulus with contrast and background luminance levels that are similar to the equivalent flickering checkerboard stimulus. Thus, we performed this experiment and found that direction selectivity in the On pathway in <italic>Gabra2</italic> KO mice is not affected at all contrast and background luminance levels we tested. Therefore, lateral inhibition in the On pathway is functionally recruited by the noisy background but not by the specific contrast of the primary stimulus nor the background luminance levels. This data has now been included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, and in the text (subsection “Lateral inhibition in the On pathway is required for direction selectivity on a noisy background”, last paragraph).</p><p>We agree that impaired tuning of DSGCs during a noisy stimulus in the absence of SAC-SAC inhibition would directly support a role for reciprocal SAC inhibition. We have previously recorded from DSGCs from Vgat KO mice and have found that the tuning of DSGCs is significantly impaired (Pei et al., 2015). However, in these KO mice, the SAC-DSGC inhibition is also disrupted. Therefore, we cannot assign the reduced direction selectivity to SAC-SAC inhibition. Since we currently cannot provide direct support for a role of SAC-SAC inhibition in a noisy background, we have modified the Discussion section accordingly (subsection “The role of lateral inhibition during a moving bar stimulus against a noisy background”).</p><p>We are also technically limited in that our visual stimulation setup cannot reliably produce checker intensities lower than 3% of the moving bar brightness used in this study. We will work on overcoming these technical difficulties for future studies.</p><p><italic>2) It would be helpful to add a bit more discussion on why lateral inhibition between starburst cells would be most effective in a noisy background.</italic></p><p>We have included more discussion in the subsection “The role of lateral inhibition during a moving bar stimulus against a noisy background”.</p><p><italic>3) The reference list reads as if there was no research done on direction selectivity before the year 2000; in fact, the only reference to earlier work is a methods paper on visual stimulus software.
