proteins (IDPs) present a functional paradox because they lack stable tertiary structure, but nonetheless play a central role in signaling, utilizing a process known as allostery. Historically, allostery in structured proteins has been interpreted in terms of propagated structural changes that are induced by effector binding. Thus, it is not clear how IDPs, lacking such well-defined structures, can allosterically affect function. Here, we show a mechanism by which an IDP can allosterically control function by simultaneously tuning transcriptional activation and repression, using a novel strategy that relies on the principle of ‘energetic frustration’. We demonstrate that human glucocorticoid receptor tunes this signaling in vivo by producing translational isoforms differing only in the length of the disordered region, which modulates the degree of frustration. We expect this frustration-based model of allostery will prove to be generally important in explaining signaling in other IDPs.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30688.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Proteins carry out most of the key tasks inside cells. To perform these roles, proteins must fold up to form complex three-dimensional structures. Researchers used to think that the useful parts of proteins all had set structures. However, we now know that ‘disordered’ proteins with variable structures are common and disordered parts of proteins can have vital roles.</p><p>In a process called allosteric regulation, regulator molecules can increase or decrease the activity of a protein by binding to it. This binding was thought to work by changing the structure of the protein, but it was not clear how this works in disordered proteins. To investigate, Li et al. studied a disordered protein called glucocorticoid receptor, and found that disordered regions can have opposing effects on other regions of the protein. This creates a ‘tug-of-war’ that Li et al. term “energetic frustration”, whereby the activity of the protein results from the combination of the opposing interactions.</p><p>Further investigation revealed that the glucorticoid receptor produces different versions of itself that have different degrees of energetic frustration, which alters how effectively the proteins perform their tasks. This means that the protein can regulate its own activity even in the absence of binding to regulator molecules.</p><p>The concept of energetic frustration could enhance our understanding of the many different proteins that contain disordered regions. Eventually, this knowledge could be used to develop drugs that alter the activity of these proteins and so could form part of treatments for a wide range of conditions including autoimmune diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus), cancers, and organ rejection for transplant patients. The results presented by Li et al. suggest where more research is needed to achieve this goal. For example, we need to understand more about the stability of disordered protein regions, and to identify which surfaces of the proteins interact with each other.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>allostery</kwd><kwd>frustration</kwd><kwd>disorder</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1330211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name><name><surname>White</surname><given-names>Jordan T</given-names></name><name><surname>Saavedra</surname><given-names>Harry</given-names></name><name><surname>Wrabl</surname><given-names>James O</given-names></name><name><surname>Motlagh</surname><given-names>Hesam N</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Kaixian</given-names></name><name><surname>Sowers</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilser</surname><given-names>Vincent J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM-063747</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Motlagh</surname><given-names>Hesam N</given-names></name><name><surname>Wrabl</surname><given-names>James O</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilser</surname><given-names>Vincent J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32-GM008403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Motlagh</surname><given-names>Hesam N</given-names></name><name><surname>Wrabl</surname><given-names>James O</given-names></name><name><surname>Hilser</surname><given-names>Vincent J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007880</institution-id><institution>Johns Hopkins University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JHU Institutional Funds</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hilser</surname><given-names>Vincent J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Allostery in an intrinsically disordered domain of glucocorticoid receptor is mediated by opposing thermodynamic signals that are directed through the production of different isoforms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A cornerstone of biological regulation is the ability of proteins to tune their particular activities in response to the binding of specific ligands at distinct regulatory sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>). Historically, such tunability has been explained by the concerted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monod et al., 1965</xref>) or sequential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koshland et al., 1966</xref>) models of allosteric regulation, which describe the coupling between binding sites in terms of ligand-induced changes in the average structure of the protein. More recent studies reveal that allostery is not restricted to structured proteins. It is widely observed in intrinsically disordered (ID) proteins, polypeptides, or regions therein, that lack stable tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ferreon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garcia-Pino et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lum et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sevcsik et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, ID regions are hyper-abundant in known allosteric proteins such as transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gronemeyer and Bourguet, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2006</xref>), suggesting that allostery involving ID sequences may represent a major regulatory paradigm. Despite the existing evidence, however, the mechanism by which ID proteins facilitate allostery is not known.</p><p>Previously, we developed a mathematical model to show how proteins could use intrinsic disorder to facilitate, and even optimize, allosteric control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hilser and Thompson, 2007</xref>). This model predicts that coupled folding and binding in different ID domains could produce complex coupling mechanisms that result from the simultaneous tuning of both activating and repressing sub-ensembles within the overall conformational ensemble (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilser et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>), a process of ‘energetic frustration’ akin to the well-known physical concept of ‘geometric frustration’. In condensed matter physics, ‘geometric frustration’ describes a physical system’s inability to simultaneously minimize the competing interaction energies between its components in mean field theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vannimenus and Toulouse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Villain, 1977</xref>). Frustration theory has been invaluable in understanding magnetic and superconducting systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vannimenus and Toulouse, 1977</xref>), circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2006</xref>), protein folding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bryngelson and Wolynes, 1987</xref>), and even gene networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishna et al., 2009</xref>). However, whereas numerous biological networks can utilize multiple components (e.g. repressors and activators) to control overall activity, it is not known whether a single gene product could encode tunable activity based on an analogous form of frustration, as theory predicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilser et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hilser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the relationship between disorder and allostery and to test whether energetic frustration is at the heart of disorder-mediated allostery, we selected the human glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a model system. The GR is a member of the steroid hormone receptor (SHR) family of transcription factors and plays key roles in organ development, metabolite homeostasis, and the responses to stress and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Griekspoor et al., 2007</xref>). Three major domains segregate the GR’s primary functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilser and Thompson, 2011</xref>). The DNA-binding domain (DBD) and ligand-binding domain (LBD) are well-structured and are responsible for interacting with DNA (i.e. GR response element) and the steroid hormone (e.g. cortisol), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilser and Thompson, 2011</xref>). The N-terminal domain (NTD), which consists of the first 420 amino acids, contains the activation function 1 core region (i.e. AF1c, GR 187–244), which is required for the recruitment of cofactors necessary for transcriptional activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dahlman-Wright et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ford et al., 1997</xref>) and full transcriptional potency. In contrast to the LBD and DBD, the NTD of GR is intrinsically disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hilser and Thompson, 2011</xref>). Importantly, five active isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Inset) among the total of eight translational isoforms of GR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), differing only in the lengths of the ID NTDs have been discovered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Cidlowski, 2005</xref>). These isoforms differ in their relative activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender et al., 2013</xref>), tissue distributions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Cidlowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu and Cidlowski, 2006</xref>), and regulatory specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lu and Cidlowski, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu and Cidlowski, 2006</xref>). Although the effect of binding either different steroid molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pandit et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pfaff and Fletterick, 2010</xref>) or different DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meijsing et al., 2009</xref>) is known to produce a variety of structural changes within their respective binding domains, how such binding events are differentially propagated to the ID NTD of each isoform, and subsequently translated into functional changes, is not known. Fundamentally, it is not clear whether and, if so, how structured domains like the DBD can both receive and transmit allosteric signals to disordered domains like the NTD of GR.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30688.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Transcriptional activity and DNA-binding affinity are not correlated among GR translational isoforms.</title><p>Transcriptional activity, monitored by dual luciferase reporter assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a and b''</xref>), and binding affinity to DNA, monitored by fluorescence anisotropy change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c and d</xref>), show uncorrelated behavior. <bold>Inset</bold>: Domain organization of the constitutively active GR constructs for translational isoforms, wherein the intrinsically disordered N terminal domain (NTD) varies in length.

First, the affinities of the isoforms for DNA vary, despite having identical DBDs, indicating that the NTD of each isoform differentially communicates with its respective DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). Second, the GR C3 isoform (i.e. 98–525) is almost five times more active than the full-length GR A isoform (i.e. 1–525), indicating that residues 1–97 somehow negatively regulate the activity of the remaining NTD residues, which contain the functionally important AF1c region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Importantly, the thermodynamic stabilization of the F-domain conferred by the DBD is accompanied by a dramatic increase in activity, as determined from cell-based transcriptional assays that compare the activity of the GR F-DBD construct (C3 isoform) with the non-natural chimera that tethers the DBD from the yeast Gal4 transcription factor to the F-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).

In order to only measure the coupling between the R-domain and the DBD, and to avoid the convoluting effects associated with the coupling between the F-domain and the R-domain and DBD, constructs were generated that utilized a series of flexible linkers connecting the R-domain to the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref> reveals, inclusion of the R-domain residues 1–85, naturally present in GR’s A and B isoforms, significantly increased the DNA-binding affinity of the DBD, while the shorter length R-domains in the C isoforms show no effect.

It has long been known that DNA binding to GR DBD stabilizes the DBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lefstin and Yamamoto, 1998</xref>). As a consequence of its direct positive coupling to the F-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), DBD binding to DNA stabilizes the folded form of the F-domain and therefore promotes activation of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, counterclockwise green arrow). However, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> indicates, there is also positive coupling between the DBD and the R-domain. But because of the negative coupling between the R- and F-domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>), the same DNA binding (to the DBD) that stabilizes/activates the F-domain simultaneously, through stabilization of the R-domain, destabilizes the folded form of the F-domain, promoting repression of transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, red inhibitory semicircle), a process that resembles geometric frustration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vannimenus and Toulouse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Villain, 1977</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30688.008</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Competing thermodynamic coupling in GR produces frustration.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic view of the thermodynamic configuration of GR. According to this convention, the positive (+) signs between the DBD and F-domain, and the DBD and R-domain signify they are positively coupled; stabilization of one domain stabilizes the other. The negative (-) sign between the R- and the F- domains indicate they are negatively coupled; stabilization of one domain destabilizes the other. Thus, the combination of the positive coupling between DBD and R-domain, and the negative coupling between R- and F-domains produces an overall repression (red semicircle) from the effect that is mediated through the R-domain. Triplet arrows are an abbreviation to describe all the couplings in the system: first arrow indicates the coupling between DBD and F-domain, second arrow indicates coupling between R-domain and F-domain, and third arrow indicates coupling between DBD and R-domain.

Importantly for this equilibrium scheme, any permutation containing an even number of up arrows will be energetically frustrated.

Four of the possible configurations produce frustration between the DBD and the F-domain (top), whereas four configurations do not produce frustration (bottom), representing the cases of activation and repression, respectively. Note the curved arrows connecting the domains are colored according to the overall effect on F-domain from stabilizing the DBD; this coloring scheme highlights the result that frustrated configurations result from opposing energetic couplings affecting the F-domain stability. For example, in case i (Top, Left), stabilization of the DBD destabilizes the R-domain due to the negative coupling energy, signified by the red curved arrow between domains. However, the destabilization of the R- domain has the effect of also destabilizing the F-domain, because the F- and R- domains are positively coupled. Thus, the overall effect of stabilizing the DBD is to destabilize the F-domain through its interaction with the R-domain, signified by the red curved arrow between the R- and F- domains (even though the coupling between R-F alone is positive).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30688-fig4-v2"/></fig><p>Geometric frustration originates in bi-stable systems wherein competing thermodynamic couplings interact such that no single state acquires significant stability so as to dominate the ensemble probabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krishna et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vannimenus and Toulouse, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Villain, 1977</xref>).

For each case, a positive interaction energy signifies that a stabilization of one domain would result in a stabilization of the second domain, whereas negative coupling would produce the opposite effect. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> reveals, frustration results when the ‘direct’ impact of stabilization of the DBD on the F-domain is opposite in sign to the indirect impact (i.e. the impact that is mediated through the R-domain). Such is the case when one or all three of the inter-domain interactions is/are negative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hilser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Motlagh and Hilser, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>). Of the possible configurations that are predicted to produce frustration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref> upper), GR clearly conforms to case ii, wherein the DBD is positively coupled to the F-domain serving to increase its activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–c</xref>). However, because of the negative coupling between the R-domain and the F-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>), and the positive coupling between the R-domain and the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), the DBD is ultimately also negatively coupled to the F-domain. The net effect of DNA binding on GR transcriptional activity is thus a balance between the strengths of these coupling energies, which could differ among translational isoforms. The results clearly demonstrate that two opposing control mechanisms are at play, and that the classic deterministic models of allostery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Koshland et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Monod et al., 1965</xref>) are insufficient to capture the probabilistic nature of this mechanism.</p><p>To highlight the analogy with geometric frustration, while simultaneously distinguishing this biological phenomenon from the condensed matter physics model, we term this phenomenon ‘energetic frustration’.

Panels a-d are relevant to the first method, and panels e-f demonstrate that the resulting estimates from both methods were robustly similar in sign and magnitude. The first method was exhaustive subject to the following reasonable parameter space constraints (the second method was subject to no constraints): (1) full length isoform A has higher binding affinity and lower transcriptional activity than C3 isoform (as experimentally demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–d</xref>); (2) The probability of the high-affinity state of A isoform is less than 40%, as A isoform’s binding affinity is more than 2.5 fold lower than D2 isoform, which has highest binding affinity among all the translational isoforms (as experimentally demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c–d</xref>); (3) R<sub>A</sub>-linker-DBD construct has higher binding affinity than linker-DBD construct (as experimentally demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>); (4) In presence of GR response element, the sum of probability of the functional states (with F-domain in the folded conformation and the DBD in the high-affinity state) is larger than 5%, which is consistent with the possibility of a large population increase upon a small energetic stabilization, such as a binding event to co-regulators.

Thus, to save computational time, the parameter space search was carried out again by fixing F-domain stability at −7 kcal/mol and exhaustively scanning the other parameters. Under such conditions, the probability distribution of the stabilities of the R-domain and the DBD are shown in panel <bold>c</bold> and the distributions of the interaction energies between domains are shown in panel <bold>d</bold>. A range of parameter combinations can satisfy the experimental constraints, but it is important to emphasize that with no parameter does the sign of the energy change. With any such set of parameter combinations, the simulated transcriptional activity and the simulated binding affinity of C3 isoform can be calculated as relative to A isoform.

Another useful heuristic, a ‘distribution score’, was employed to assess how well a chosen parameter compared to the mode of its distribution.

To do this, we targeted the interaction between the R-domain of the A isoform (i.e. R<sub>A</sub>, residues 1–97) and the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> inset), by determining the impact of point mutations in the DBD on DNA binding affinity in the presence and absence of the tethered R-domain. For constructs containing only the DBD and the R-domain, DBD mutations could perturb either the stability of the DBD, the coupling between the DBD and the R-domain, or both. Thus, by expressing the mutant forms as linker-DBD and R<sub>A</sub>-linker-DBD constructs, using an inert linker to substitute for the F-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), the impact of the mutations could be clearly discerned.

Because the mutation should decrease the stabilizing effect of binding DNA on the R-domain, which in turn, should lower the destabilizing effect on the F-domain, the model predicts the counter-intuitive result whereby the activity of the triple mutant should increase, while the DBD-DNA binding affinity should decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> Model). Importantly, such a prediction is the direct result of the frustration in the system and would represent a compelling argument for the competing energetic couplings shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>.</p><p>True to the prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref> Experiment), the effect of the triple mutant is a decrease in affinity for DNA while concomitantly increasing the transcriptional activity. This result is particularly important because while the modulatory role of the residues we refer to as the R-domain has been known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender et al., 2013</xref>), previous interpretations attributed the effect to simple steric occlusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bender et al., 2013</xref>). Our results unequivocally demonstrate that the R-domain not only negatively affects the F-domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>) but also positively affects the wild-type DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), increasing the affinity of the DBD for DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), and it does so in a manner that is directly related to the stabilities and coupling energies in the system.</p><p>Furthermore, the facts that the three residues implicated in the coupling were independently identified through mutational analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1b–d</xref>), but nonetheless mapped to a conserved contiguous surface on the DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), strongly supports a model whereby these residues affect the coupling between the DBD and the R-domain through a common mechanism involving direct interactions between domains. Further supporting this notion, titration of the DBD of the C3 isoform and the C3 triple mutant (C431Y&amp;V435A&amp;L436A) with the R-domain (expressed in trans), using the luciferase assay as a reporter, clearly shows a greater concentration dependence of activity for the wild-type C3 isoform over the triple mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). This result indicates that the R-domain can exert its stabilization effect on the DBD through mass action, suggestive of a direct interaction involving residues C431, V435, and L436. We note that although the combination of comparatively weak coupling energies (based on the maximum likelihood parameter estimation for <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mo>∆</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>R</mml:mi><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>; Fig. S3e) and poor solubility of both the DBD and R-domains precluded attempts to structurally characterize the interaction using NMR, such limitations have not adversely affected our efforts to rationally intervene. Indeed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> reveals that the coupling between the R-domain and the DBD, identified in isolation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), could not only be leveraged into a comprehensive frustration-based model that quantitatively captures the relative binding and activity of all the GR isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>), but could also be rationally manipulated, and the opposing consequences on DNA binding and transcriptional activity predictably altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Thus, although physical basis of the couplings between the domains awaits future studies, the fact that GR has evolved the ability to produce isoforms that utilize different degrees of energetic frustration opens entirely new avenues for investigating regulation in IDPs.</p><p>The regulatory role of the isoform-specific ID R-domain in GR is especially important in light of the observation that the DNA sequences coding for ID regions are enriched in splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buljan et al., 2012</xref>), leading to a high degree of variability in the ID regions of the resultant proteins. The studies presented here provide a functional explanation. Alternative splicing, like the alternative translation start sites of GR described here, can produce proteins with different degrees of frustration in their ID regions, and thus differing activities. In addition, isoforms may also have different combinations of post-translational modification sites, which are also enriched in ID segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bah and Forman-Kay, 2016</xref>). By combining regulatory elements possessing different stabilities with different numbers and types of modification sites, ID proteins can potentially regulate not only the efficiency of the resultant protein, as shown here for GR, but also how that activity can be tuned by different types of modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Conclusions</title><p>We have shown that GR produces different isoforms, which have different DNA-binding affinities and transcriptional activities that are uncorrelated to each other. Our results show that this uncorrelated behavior is facilitated through ‘energetic frustration’, wherein opposing energetic couplings compete to modulate the overall response. Recent studies reveal that in addition to being facilitated by structured proteins, allostery can also be mediated by dynamic and even ID proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freiburger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Motlagh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Petit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Popovych et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">2012</xref>). Within these ubiquitous ID systems, significant heterogeneity, both in the apo and ligand-bound states, produces ensembles that cannot be treated using classic deterministic or structure-based allosteric models. Instead, extension of these classic models to account for positive and negative couplings between different regions provides a framework for understanding not only how ID sequences communicate with other structured and ID sequences, but also how such heterogeneity can produce complex regulatory strategies, such as the frustration-based mechanism identified here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Plasmids</title><p>DNA 2.0 (Menlo Park, CA) synthesized the plasmid used to express the A isoform of human GR in U-2 OS cells.

The dosage and competitive transfection curves were fitted with dose response curves using Origin.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Western blot</title><p>U-2 OS cells were plated on 6-well plates at a density of 5 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells per well. After 18 hr, 50 ng of GR expression vector and 450 ng of salmon sperm DNA (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, transfection boosting reagent) were transfected into each well with X-tremeGENE HP DNA transfection reagent (Roche), following the manufacturer’s protocol. The medium was changed once 24 hr post transfection. After 48 hr, the cells were scraped from each well with PBS, and pelleted by centrifuging at 1500 rpm. For lysis, 50 μL of lysis buffer (8 M urea, 20 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% Triton, 2.5 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM beta-glycerophosphate, 1 mM Na<sub>3</sub>VO<sub>4</sub> and 1 µg/ml leupeptin, pH 7.5) was added to each cell pellet. To reduce the viscosity, cells were passed through a 26G 3/8’’ syringe needle 10 times and then the cell lysate was centrifuged at 14000 rpm for 30 min. Supernatant was collected and the total protein concentration was measured by Bradford assay (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). In each well of a 4–15% Mini-PROTEAN TGX Precast Gel (Bio-Rad), 5 µg of total protein was loaded, and separated in Tris/Glycine/SDS gel running buffer. Transfer of the protein from the SDS page gel to PVDF film was done in the transfer buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 192 mM glycine, 20% methanol) under 120V for 15 min. After blocking in 5% nonfat milk in PBS with 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) for 1 hr, the PVDF film was then incubated at 4˚C overnight with 10000 fold diluted primary antibody for GR (BD Transduction Laboratories, #611226, San Jose, CA) or p150glued (BD Transduction Laboratories, #610473), which served as loading control. Both antibodies were diluted into the same 5% nonfat milk in PBST. The next morning, after washing with PBST buffer for three times, the PVDF film was incubated in the 20000 fold diluted HRP-linked anti-mouse IgG (GE healthcare, NA931, Chicago, IL), also in the 5% nonfat milk in PBST. The detection was done with Amersham ECL Prime Western blotting reagent (GE heathcare, RPN2232) and autoradiography film (Denville Scientific).</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Immunostaining</title><p>U-2 OS cells were plated on 6-well plates with 15 mm round German coverslips. All the culture and transfection procedures are the same as done for the cells for western blot experiments. After 48 hr, cells were rinsed with PBSM (PBS with 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) three times, and fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBSM at room temperature for 10 min. Afterwards, each coverslip was rinsed with PBSM three times again, and quenched with 50 mM NH<sub>4</sub>Cl in PBSM. Then the slide was placed in PBSTB (PBS with 0.1% Triton X-100, 1% BSA) for 30 min at room temperature to permeabilize cells and block nonspecific binding. Thereafter, the slide was incubated for 1 hr at room temperature with primary rabbit antibody for GR (cell signaling, #3660), which was 5000 fold diluted in PBSTB. Then the slide was washed three times with PBSM and incubated for 30 min at room temperature in the dark with the Alexa Fluor 488 Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), which was 600 fold diluted in PBSTB. Next the slide was incubated for 10 min at room temperature in the dark in PBSM with 0.2 μg/mL DAPI (Invitrogen) and 5 unit/mL Rhodamine Phalloidin (Invitrogen) to stain the nuclei and F-actin respectively. After that, each slide was washed with PBSM twice and mounted onto a microscope slide with Fluoromount (Sigma, St. Louis, MO), and kept in the dark for drying.</p><p>Images were taken with an inverted light microscope (Axiovert 200, JHU Integrated Imaging Center). All images were taken the same day using the same gain, exposure times, and filter configurations (DAPI, FITC, and Texas Red filters). The images were analyzed using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Staal et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-9"><title>Ensemble allosteric model</title><p>The Ensemble Allosteric Model

This MS is well written, clear, and easy to follow despite the numerous constructs that one has to keep in mind. The major theme in this work, which is a continuation of the ensemble allostery model for TFs with IDRs, is the finding that different GR isoforms, distinguished entirely by differences in their N-terminal IDRs, engender different transcriptional activities entirely through differences in coupling free energies among different domains. This result shines through because the DBDs are identical in all of the constructs, and yet the authors observe a clear impact of changes to the N-terminal IDR on DNA binding and on transcriptional activity, although there is no correlation between the DNA binding affinities and activities. This family of TFs is an elegant system for dissecting the impact of IDR mediated allostery and the model appears to do a good job of recapitulating the measured activities.</p><p>Overall, this is a very strong paper, clearly written, espousing coherent concepts, and highlighting novel roles for IDRs, which go beyond speculation and anchor the findings in concrete data, that are driven by predictions. In many ways, this work exemplifies the best of science and the integrative efforts of clearly formulated statistical physics, biophysical experimentation, and evolutionary principles.</p><p>Reviewer 2</p><p>This paper describes a study to document the previously predicted phenomenon of allostery involving disordered protein regions using the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) as a model system. GR contains two functionally separable disordered regions, each of which is shown experimentally to interact favorably with the DNA-binding domain (DBD), but to interact unfavorably with each other, resulting in a frustrated system in which activity, mediated by the F domain, is enhanced directly by the DBD but is repressed indirectly via DBD-enhanced repression by the R domain. Using the model previously developed to model allostery in such system, featuring the individual stabilities of the domains and the coupling energies between each pair of domains, the authors are able to generate results that are in delightful agreement with the experimental measurements on differently spliced isoforms of GR in which the R region is present to different degrees. Even more impressively, a series of mutations is identified which are able to disrupt the coupling between the DBD and the R domain, which then show precisely the predicted effects on activity, both in cis and in trans.</p><p>This is a lovely, clear paper that beautifully demonstrates the validity and biological relevance of the model previously developed by the authors for allostery involving disordered protein regions. This is a conceptually important extension of the classical models of allostery, and in light of the ever growing importance of disordered protein regions, is a critical contribution to our understanding of protein function regulation.</p><p>Reviewer 3</p><p>In this study by Li et al. the authors have investigated the role of regions of the intrinsically disordered amino-terminal domain of the glucocorticoid receptor in allosteric regulation. Specially they have tested experimentally and further validated their previously published 'ensemble allosteric model'.</p><p>This is an excellent study and significantly contributes to our growing understanding of the role of intrinsically disordered structure and nuclear receptor signalling. The authors have used a range of molecular and biophysical methods to investigate receptor-dependent transcription, DNA binding affinity and protein folding.</p><p>Comments to address:</p><p>1) Could the title be made somewhat more accessible?

Because of the more than superficial analogy with the physics models, it deserves a distinguishing name. For consistency, the term “energetic frustration” has been adopted throughout the text.</p><p>Furthermore, we agree with the reviewer that our terminology regarding energetic frustration could have been articulated more clearly. Accordingly, we clarify our model in subsection “The Ensemble Allosteric Model (EAM) Enables Quantitative Characterization of the Energetic Frustration in GR”, and its analogy to geometric frustration, as follows. Our model of energetic frustration in GR is related, but not identical, to classical physics models for the interaction energies between pairs of spins in a magnet. The simplest model of spin interaction energy takes the form E<sub>int</sub> = -J<sub>ij</sub>S<sub>i</sub>S<sub>j</sub>, where J<sub>ij</sub> is the coupling between spins i and j, while S<sub>i</sub>, S<sub>j</sub> are the signs referring to up/down nature of the spins (Ferreiro, et al., 2014). Similarly, we model the interaction energy between one pair of domains in GR (or any multi-domain protein) with an analogous mathematical form, as E<sub>int</sub> = J<sub>ij</sub>(S<sub>i</sub>|∆G<sub>i</sub>)(S<sub>j</sub>|∆G<sub>j</sub>). In our model, J<sub>ij</sub> is also a coupling energy, which we instead name ∆g<sub>int</sub>, between the domains.</p><p>There are, however, three key differences between the models. First, S<sub>i</sub> and S<sub>j</sub>, though still signs as in the classical model, are constrained to the values of {0, +1}. Second, the value of the sign is conditional on the stabilities of the individual domains, ∆G<sub>i</sub> and ∆G<sub>j</sub>. If the domains are both folded, the interface between them is also folded. S<sub>i</sub> and S<sub>j</sub> then both take the value +1, and only in this case does the complete expression provide additional coupling energy ∆g<sub>int</sub> to the system. Third, the sign of J<sub>ij</sub> in our model may be either positive or negative, as allosteric coupling in different proteins has been observed to be either positive or negative.</p><p>These differences increase the theoretical complexity of the energetic frustration model, relative to the simple geometric frustration model. Thus, connecting our Ensemble Allostery Model (EAM) with physics frustration models is a useful analogy because the non-intuitive allosteric behavior exhibited by biological systems, such as GR, may be now partially understood and interpreted in terms of the classical physics models, which have been more thoroughly explored for almost a century.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the context of comment 2) above, it would help to clarify how the classification into frustrated vs. non-frustrated configurations was achieved in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. It looks like there are configurations that are erroneously labeled as non-frustrated ones and this is why the precepts of the model would be useful to clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for making this point, as it highlights the shortcomings in the original version in explaining our model and differentiating energetic frustration from geometric frustration. We have clarified the description of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> by stating that all configurations in the Figure are correctly labeled with respect to energetic frustration. The reason for this is that the triplets of arrows in the Figure represent a different type of interaction than the spin pairs of geometric frustration, and thus individual arrows do not represent molecular positions and neighboring pairs of arrows should not be interpreted as directly interacting with each other. Rather, each triplet arrow in the context of energetic frustration represents a domain-domain interface, and the up/down direction of the arrow represents positive or negative allosteric coupling. In the particular case of GR, these arrows are interpreted from left to right as representing the coupling between DBD- and F-domains, the coupling between R- and F-domains, and the coupling between DBD- and R-domains, respectively. DNA binding to the DBD stabilizes the DBD, and thus inputs a positive coupling energy into the system. The response of the system, i.e. transcriptional regulation, is a complex function of the competition between the direct coupling between DBD-F and the indirect coupling mediated through the R-domain.</p><p>Put another way, the energetic frustration of the system results from the numbers of up and down arrows in the triplet without regard to the exact ordering: for example, two up arrows grouped with one down will always result in a system with energetic frustration, given an input of positive coupling. Although we thought adequate explanation was given in the legend, we see now that a clearer description was necessary. We sincerely apologize for all these shortcomings. To address the reviewer’s concerns and to improve the clarity of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4, a</xref> triplet has been added to 4A to better connect 4A to 4B, and the text and figure legend have been expanded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The paper does not clearly explain how the model is able to differentiate between isoforms that feature different length deletions of the R domain (isoforms A, B, C1, C2 and C3).

Indeed, the reviewer is correct that emphasis has been placed in the text on A and C3, even though the Ensemble Allosteric Model (EAM) implemented for GR can treat the other isoforms.</p><p>The key assumption influencing the predictions for the B, C1, C2 and C3 isoforms, relative to A, is a length-dependent coupling energy between DBD- and R-domains: since the A isoform of the R-domain is 97 residues and the B isoform is 71 residues we assume the coupling energy between B and DBD is roughly 80% of that observed between A and DBD. This modification is coded to variable “SWdbdRB” (abbreviation for “Statistical Weight of folded DBD and folded R domain, B-isoform”) in the fifth line of the “Partition Function for the B Isoform&quot; in the Supplemental Mathematica Notebook. Similarly, every C isoform has zero R-domain and DBD coupling energy, since the entire R-domain is missing in these isoforms; these modifications are coded explicitly as zero in line 5 of each of the C isoform partition functions.</p><p>Since the coupling energy between F-domain and DBD is also identical among the C1, C2, C3 domains, their different predicted values must arise from the fact that the EAM naturally permits different values for the intrinsic stabilities of C1 and C2 in the solution (the measured value for C3 is one of the experimental constraints).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Many of the reported errors are noted to represent the uncertainty of the curve fits to the date, but details regarding how the curve fitting was performed and how the errors were then extracted would be welcome in the supplementary materials.</p></disp-quote><p>Curve fitting was performed using Mathematica’s NonLinearModelFit function with all-default parameters, which automatically provides error estimates at 95% confidence intervals.

Indeed, the reviewer is correct that we wished to avoid the complication of dimerization by using the half-site, since dimerization is reported to be palindromic-GRE dependent.

As detailed in this paper, binding of an inverted repeated negative GRE (IR nGRE) seems to require conformational change and covalent modification within the NTD (i.e. “unmasking” as described by Hua, et al.), mediated by LBD binding of a glucocorticoid. Although the LBD and covalent modifications are not modeled in our work, we can accept the point that the DBD could be structurally malleable. Thus, we could speculate that IR nGRE binding may induce a conformation of DBD that is different from the positive GRE binding in our model. How this conformation could be coupled to the R and F domains are intriguing topics for future study.
