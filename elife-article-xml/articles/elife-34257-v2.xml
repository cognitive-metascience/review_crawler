In this study, we performed fiducial-less tomography on over 50 different cryoEM grid/sample preparations to determine the particle distribution within the ice and the overall geometry of the ice in grid holes. Surprisingly, by studying particles in holes in 3D from over 1000 tomograms, we have determined that the vast majority of particles (approximately 90%) are adsorbed to an air-water interface. The implications of this observation are wide-ranging, with potential ramifications regarding protein denaturation, conformational change, and preferred orientation. We also show that fiducial-less cryo-electron tomography on single particle grids may be used to determine ice thickness, optimal single particle collection areas and strategies, particle heterogeneity, and de novo models for template picking and single particle alignment.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cryoET</kwd><kwd>single

(cryoEM) grids have commonly been imaged and processed under the assumption that most particles imaged were not adsorbed to the air-water interfaces and were in a single layer as they were plunge-frozen. An ideal grid and sample for single particle collection would have the majority of areas in holes maximally occupied by non-adsorbed, non-interacting particles 10 nm or farther from the air-water interfaces, particles oriented randomly, vitreous ice thin enough to contain the particles plus about 20 nm of additional space, where none of the particles overlap in the beam direction, and where the beam direction is normal to the areas of interest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Collection in such ideal areas of a grid would then be the most efficient use of resources and would result in the highest resolution structure possible for a given number of particles, collection hardware, and collection parameters.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagrams of grid hole cross-sections containing regions of ideal particle and ice behavior for single particle cryoEM collection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A grid hole where all regions of particles and ice exhibit ideal behavior. (<bold>B</bold>) Grid holes where there are areas that exhibit ideal particle and ice behavior. Green arrows indicate areas with ideal particle and ice behavior. The generic particle shown is a low-pass filtered holoenzyme, EMDB-6803 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Yin et al., 2017</xref>). The particles were rendered with UCSF Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-34257-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>In practice, during single particle grid preparation and data collection there are many issues that contribute to preventing a sample from following this ideal behavior. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, numerous combinations of air-water interface, particle, and ice behavior are possible for each hole and for regions within each hole, without taking into account surface ice contamination. Each air-water interface might be: (i) free from sample solution constituents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, A1), (ii) covered with a layer of primary, secondary, and/or tertiary protein structures (either isolated or forming protein networks) from denatured particles (A2), or (iii) covered with one or more layers of surfactants if present during preparation (A3). It is difficult to distinguish between air-water interfaces that are clean, covered in primary protein structures, or covered in surfactants as they are likely indistinguishable by cryoEM or cryo-electron tomography (cryoET) analysis without a sample-free control for comparison (cryoET may be able to resolve lipid layers at the air-water interface if high tilt angles are collected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vos et al., 2008</xref>]). Bulk particle behavior in regions of holes might include any combination of: (i) non-adsorbed particles without preferred orientation (B1), (ii) particles at an air-water interface without preferred orientation (B2), (iii) particles at an air-water interface with N-preferred orientations (B3), (iv) partially denatured particles at an air-water interface with M-preferred orientations (B4), and/or (v) significantly denatured particles at an air-water interface (B5). Protein degradation in A2 might be considered to be a continuation of the denaturation in B4 and B5. Interactions between neighboring particles at the air-water interface might induce different preferred orientations in B3 and B4, particularly at high concentrations. Ice behavior at the air-water interfaces of each hole might be characterized by any two combinations of: convex ice (C1), flat ice (C2), concave ice where the center is thicker than the particle’s minor axis (C3), and/or concave ice where the center is thinner than the particle’s minor axis (C4). In the case of a convex air-water interface, the particle’s minor axis might be larger than the ice thickness at the edge of the hole.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Depictions of potential ice and particle behavior in cryoEM grid holes, based on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> from (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor and Glaeser, 2008</xref>).</title><p>A region of a hole may be described by a combination of one option from (<bold>A</bold>) for each air-water interface and one or more options from (<bold>B</bold>).

B3 is different from B4 if, for example, a particle prone to denaturation is frozen before or after denaturation has begun, thus potentially changing the set of preferred orientations.

Incubation times before and after blotting are on the order of seconds, allowing for the possibility of protein adsorption to the air-water interface due to Brownian motion. Concerns regarding deleterious air-water interface interactions with proteins have been often discussed in the literature. For instance, Jacques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubochet et al., 1988</xref> observed issues with regards to air-water interface and particle orientation for a small number of samples. In a recent review by Robert Glaeser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Glaeser and Han, 2017</xref>), evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Trurnit, 1960</xref>) using Langmuir-Blodgett (LB) troughs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Langmuir, 1917</xref>) was used to propose that upon contact with a clean air-water interface, proteins in solution will denature, forming an insoluble, denatured protein film. This film reduces the surface tension at the air-water interface and might act as a barrier between the remaining particles in solution and the air. Particles in solution might then adsorb to the denatured layer of protein depending on the local particle affinity with the interface, thus creating an ensemble of preferred orientations. Estimates for the amount of time a particle with a mass of 100 kDa to 1 MDa in solution might take to first reach the air-water interface (bulk diffusion) range from 1 ms to 0.1 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Naydenova and Russo, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Taylor and Glaeser, 2008</xref>).</p><p>More recent literature, using LB troughs, substantiates that 10–1000 mL volumes of various proteins (commonly 10–1000 kDa and at ≲1 mg/mL) in buffer commonly adsorb to the air-water interface and form &lt;10 nm thick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunning et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Vliet et al., 2002</xref>) denatured viscoelastic protein network films (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Birdi, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damodaran and Song, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Jongh et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dickinson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Graham and Phillips, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yano, 2012</xref>). The time it takes for adsorption to begin due to bulk diffusion may be on the order of 0.1 to 1 ms, depending on the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kudryashova et al., 2005</xref>). For a protein that denatures at the air-water interface (surface diffusion), the surface diffusion time might be on the order of tens of milliseconds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kudryashova et al., 2005</xref>), depending on factors including protein and concentration, surface hydrophobicity, amount of disordered structure, secondary structure, concentration of intramolecular disulfide bonds, buffer, and temperature. Higher bulk protein concentrations have been shown to increase the protein network thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meinders et al., 2001</xref>). When several proteins and/or surfactants in solution are exposed to a clean air-water interface, competitive and/or sequential adsorption may occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ganzevles et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le Floch-Fouéré et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stanimirova et al., 2014</xref>). It has been shown using atomic force microscopy (AFM) imaging of LB protein films that these protein network films may not completely denature down to individual amino acids: adding surfactants to protein solutions in which a protein network film has already formed at the air-water interface will displace the protein layer (desorption [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">MacRitchie, 1998</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunning and Morris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mackie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wilde et al., 2004</xref>) and the resulting protein network segments might partially re-fold in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gunning and Morris, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mackie et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morris and Gunning, 2008</xref>). Time-resolved AFM surfactant-protein displacement experiments for a specific protein, β-lactoglobulin, and different surfactants, Tween 20 and Tween 60, show that displacement of the protein network film by the surfactants occurs at equivalent surface pressures and results in non-uniform surfactant domain growth, implying that the protein network is not uniform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gunning et al., 2004</xref>). Different surfactant displacement behavior and patterns are observed while varying only the proteins, where the degree of protein network displacement isotropy by surfactant decreases for more ordered, globular proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mackie et al., 1999</xref>). Non-uniformity of the protein network has also been seen by 3D AFM imaging of β-lactoglobulin LB-protein network films placed on mica (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gunning et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morris and Gunning, 2008</xref>). Similar experiments using LB troughs have also shown that proteins with β-sheets partially unfold, with the hydrophobic β-sheets remaining in-tact at the air-water interface and with potentially one or more layers of unstructured, but connected, hydrophilic amino acid strands just below the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yano et al., 2009</xref>). This potential for β-sheets to survive bulk protein denaturation is likely due to β-sheets commonly consisting of alternating hydrophobic and hydrophilic (polar or charged) sidechains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 1993</xref>), with the hydrophobic sidechains orienting towards the air. Intermolecular β-sheets may also bind together, strengthening the protein network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renault et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, the number of random coils, α-helices, and β-sheets for a protein in bulk solution might each increase or decrease when introduced to a hydrophobic environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Reddy and Nagara, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zangi et al., 2002</xref>), including the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yano, 2012</xref>), implying that protein conformation when adsorbed to the air-water interface could be different than when in solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lad et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vance et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yano, 2012</xref>). Measurements of shear stress and compressibility of protein network films versus the internal cohesion of the constituent protein show a correlation: the more stable a protein in bulk solution, the more robust the resulting protein network film at the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2005</xref>). At high enough surface concentrations and depending on surface charge distribution, neighboring globular proteins might interact to induce additional preferred orientations as has been shown in surface-protein studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Billsten et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rabe et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tie et al., 2003</xref>). Such nearest neighbor protein-protein interactions may in turn decrease protein affinity to the interface and increase desorption. Similar effects might occur at protein-air-water interfaces.</p><p>Given the length of incubation time commonly permitted before plunging a grid for cryoEM analysis, the cross-disciplinary research discussed above suggests that some particles in a thin film on a cryoEM grid will form a viscoelastic protein network film at the air-water interface. The composition and surface profile of the resulting protein network film will vary depending on the structural integrity of the bulk protein and the bulk protein concentration. Bulk protein affinity to the protein network film will then vary depending on the local affinity between the film and the proteins. To better understand the range of particle behaviors with respect to the air-water interfaces in cryoEM grid holes, a representative ensemble of grid and sample preparations needs to be studied in three dimensions.</p><p>One method of studying single particle cryoEM grids is using cryoET. CryoET is typically practiced by adding gold fiducials to the sample preparation for tilt-series alignment, which requires additional optimization steps and might not be representative of the same sample prepared without gold fiducials. To avoid the issues imposed by gold fiducials, we have employed the fiducial-less tilt-series alignment method of Appion-Protomo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noble and Stagg, 2015</xref>), allowing for cryoET analysis of all single particle cryoEM grids we have attempted. We used this fiducial-less cryoET method to investigate over 50 single particle cryoEM samples sourced from dozens of users and using grids prepared using either conventional grid preparation techniques or the new Spotiton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2012</xref>) method. Our aim was to determine the locations of particles within the vitreous ice and the overall geometry of the ice in grid holes (related to the possible combinations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p><p>We have also found that the usefulness of performing cryoET on a single particle cryoEM grid extends beyond the goal of understanding the arrangements of particles in the ice. CryoET allows for the determination of optimal collection locations and strategies, single particle post-processing recommendations, understanding particle structural heterogeneity, understanding pathological particles, and de novo model building. We contend that cryoET should be routinely performed on single particle cryoEM grids in order to fully understand the nature of the sample on the grid and to assist with the entire single particle collection and processing workflow. We have made available a standalone Docker version of the Appion-Protomo fiducial-less tilt-series alignment suite used in these investigations at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nysbc/appion-protomo">https://github.com/nysbc/appion-protomo</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>The fiducial-less tomography pipeline at the New York Structural Biology Center (NYSBC) consisting of Leginon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Suloway et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Suloway et al., 2009</xref>) or SerialEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mastronarde, 2003</xref>) for tilt-series collection and Appion-Protomo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noble and Stagg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winkler and Taylor, 2006</xref>) for tilt-series alignment allows for the routine study of grids and samples prepared for single particle cryoEM in three dimensions. The resulting analysis sheds light on long standing questions regarding how single particle samples prepared using traditional methods (manual, Vitrobot, and CP3 plunging), or with new automated plunging with Spotiton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2012</xref>), behave with respect to the air-water interfaces. In the following sections, we report and discuss how tomography collection areas were determined and analyzed, the observation that the vast majority of particles are local to the air-water interfaces and the implications with regards to potential denaturation, the prevalence of overlapping particles in the direction orthogonal to the grid, the observation that most cryoEM imaging areas and particles are tilted several degrees with respect to the electron beam, the value of cryoET to determine optimal collection locations and strategies, the benefits of using cryoET to understand pathological particle behavior, and the use of fiducial-less cryoET for isotropic de novo model generation.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determination of tomography collection locations</title><p>The single particle samples studied here were sourced from a diverse set of grids, samples, and preparation techniques. Grid substrates include carbon and gold holey films, either lacey or with a variety of regularly spaced holes, and various nanowire grids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Razinkov et al., 2016</xref>) prepared using Spotiton. Grid types also include carbon Quantifoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ermantraut et al., 1998</xref>), gold Quantifoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Russo and Passmore, 2014</xref>), and C-flat carbon on metal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Quispe et al., 2007</xref>). Plunging methods include plunging manually, with a Vitrobot (FEI Company, Hillsboro, OR) or CP3 (Gatan, Inc., Pleasanton, CA), and with Spotiton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2012</xref>). With such diversity in samples and preparation techniques, we determined that the most feasible and representative collection strategy for analyzing particle and ice behaviors over dozens of preparations would be to collect in areas typical of where the sample owner intended to collect or had already collected single particle micrographs. For a typical grid, a low-magnification grid atlas or montage is collected, promising squares are imaged at increasing magnifications, and potential exposure locations are examined at high magnification until sufficient particle contrast and concentration is found as determined by the sample owner. Then before or after a single particle collection, typically three or more tilt-series are collected as described in the Materials and methods. Tilt-series were typically collected from −45° to 45° with a tilt increment of 3°, defocus of ~5 microns, total dose of ~100 e-/Å<sup>2</sup>, and a pixelsize between 1 and 2 Å. For most grids, one or two tilt-series are collected at the center of a typical hole and one or two tilt-series are collected at the edge of a typical hole, often including the edge of the hole if the grid substrate is carbon. Tilt-series are then aligned with Appion-Protomo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Noble and Stagg, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Winkler and Taylor, 2006</xref>) for analysis as described in the Materials and methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Analysis of single particle tomograms</title><p>Single particle tomograms of samples described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> have each been analyzed visually using 3dmod from the IMOD package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>).

For many of the samples shown here and made available in the data depositions, particle orientations can be explicitly determined by direct visualization. Contamination on the surface of the air-water interface is used to determine the approximate location of the interface and to measure the ice thicknesses.

organized with the single particle sample mass in roughly descending order. Over 1000 single particle tomograms of over 50 different sample preparations have been collected over a 1-year period. Most of these samples are reported on here. These samples include widely studied specimen such as glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH), apoferritin, and T20S proteasome (samples #30–32, #34–39, and #42–44, respectively), along with various unique specimens such as a neural receptors, lipo-protein, and particles on affinity grids (samples #13,14, #19, and #40, 41, 46, respectively). Samples that are not specifically named have yet to be published. Over half of the samples were prepared on gold or carbon nanowire grids, while the remaining were prepared on a variety of carbon and gold holey grids using common cryo-plunging machines and techniques. Samples showing regions of ice in grid holes with near-ideal conditions – less than 100 nm ice thickness, no overlapping particles, and little or no preferred orientation – are highlighted in blue (21 of 46 samples; 46%) in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>. Samples showing regions of ice in grid holes with ideal conditions – near-ideal conditions plus no particle-air-water interface interaction – are highlighted in green (2 of 46 samples; 4%). Over half of the samples only contained areas that are not ideal for collection due to ice thickness being greater than 100 nm, overlapping particles, and/or preferred orientation.</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.005</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Apparent air-water interface, particle, and ice behavior of the same samples in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> using the descriptions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</title><p>Tilt-series were aligned and reconstructed using the same workflow and thus are oriented in the same direction. However, the direction relative to the sample application is not known. The bottom air-water interface corresponds to lower z-slice values, and the top to higher z-slice values as rendered in 3dmod from the IMOD package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). ‘A’ means that the air-water interface is apparently clean and cannot be visually differentiated between A1, A2 (primary structure), or A3. Percentages in parentheses are particle layer saturation estimates. Reported angles are the angles (absolute value) between the particle layer’s normal and the electron beam direction, measured using ‘Slicer’ in 3dmod. It is often difficult to distinguish between flat and curved ice at the air-water interfaces (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, ‘C1 or C2’ or ‘C2 or C3’) because most fields of view do not span entire holes. ‘<sup>‡</sup>’ indicates that the top layer of objects is the same layer as the bottom layer. ‘--’ indicates that these values were not measurable.</p></caption><table

If a particle is prone to denaturation at the interface and if the interface is already coated with a denatured layer of protein, then the preferred orientations of the same sequestered particle on the protein film-air-water interface might change. If the particle is not sequestered, but is in a protein-concentrated environment, then neighboring particle-particle interactions might change the possible preferred orientations of the particles. For each of these cases, an ensemble of particles at air-water interfaces arrived at by diffusion, as is the case with most single particle cryoEM datasets, will exhibit all possible particle orientations. The percentage of particles in each preferred orientation might be then mapped back onto all possible relative local particle-air-water interface affinities. Particles that have had less time to equilibrate before observation (e.g. before plunge-freezing) might have more realized orientations in the ensemble than if they had more time to equilibrate at the air-water interfaces.

Sample #13 consists of two distinct air-water interfaces, as can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, where the bottom interface is covered with particles and protein fragments while the top interface is covered with protein fragments and a small number of partial particles (see also <xref ref-type="video" rid="video11">Video 11</xref> corresponding to sample #13).

In this sample, the observed partial particles are oriented as rare top-views rather than abundant side-views of the particle and exist adjacent to areas of the air-water interface that do not harbor adsorbed particles. Also of note is that all of the domains of the neural receptor and some of the domains of apoferritin, hemagglutinin, HIV-1 trimer complex 1, and GDH are composed of series of β-sheets, which have the potential to not denature at the air-water interface. This observation might correlate with the cross-disciplinary literature presented in the introduction showing that β-sheets may potentially survive air-water interface interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Renault et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yano et al., 2009</xref>).

From the cross-disciplinary literature presented in the introduction, we speculate that adsorption rates for proteins that first denature at the air-water interface will differ from those that adsorb directly to the air-water interface. For a protein that does denature at the air-water interface, there is an additional amount of diffusion time, possibly on the order of tens of milliseconds, for surface diffusion to take place. Proteins that adsorb directly to the air-water interface are only time-limited by the bulk diffusion time of that sample preparation. The bulk diffusion time may be orders of magnitudes less than the surface diffusion time. The rate at which proteins adsorb to a protein network film depends on the affinity between that protein film and the bulk particles. The additional surface diffusion time along with the additional bulk protein adsorption time to the denatured protein film may allow for speed advances in sample application and plunging to outrun bulk protein adsorption to the denatured proteins on the air-water interfaces, depending on the grid preparation and particle behavior. Secondary effects, such as bulk particle flow – in conventional grid preparation when blotting paper is applied and in nanowire grid preparation with Spotiton when the protein solution reaches the nanowires on the grid bars and wicks away – and flow due to thermal convection – potentially due to contact with tweezers and the blotting process – may change the effective concentration of bulk particles near the air-water interfaces.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Protein network films may not be particle-friendly</title><p>Evidence from the literature in the introduction shows that proteins do denature at air-water interfaces, with an apparent dependency on protein concentration and structural rigidity. Evidence from this study showing that some air-water interfaces do harbor protein fragments and/or partial particles might be additional examples of denaturation due to the air-water interface. Evidence from LB trough studies of the small, disordered protein β-casein additionally show that increasing the concentration of bulk proteins in solution from 0.1 to 100 mg/mL results in an increased thickness of the denatured protein film at the air-water interface from 5 to 50 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meinders et al., 2001</xref>). This observation implies that bulk proteins may denature not only at the air-water interface, but also at the subsequently formed protein network film interface depending on the bulk protein concentration. This in turn implies that proteins adsorbed to the protein film undergo conformational change, at least at higher concentrations. Thus, if an increase in the thickness of a protein network film of a given protein at high concentration is observed, concern that bulk proteins adsorbed to the protein network film are undergoing conformational change might be warranted. We speculate that if particles are undergoing conformational change at either the protein-air-water interface or at the protein-protein network interface, then anomalous structures might be present after 2D and 3D classification that are practically indistinguishable from the nominal structures. These anomalous structures might contribute toward artefactual 3D reconstructions, towards lower resolutions, and/or toward lower density contributions on the peripheries of resulting 3D reconstructions. In the last two cases, lower resolutions on the peripheries of the reconstruction might also be a result of radial inaccuracies in alignment, and thus these two resolution-degrading factors would need to be decoupled on a per-sample basis before drawing conclusions. Apoferritin, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and the <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">6</xref> (samples #34–38), might be an explicit example of observed conformational change due to the air-water interface if the observed particle degradation is indeed caused by air-water interface denaturation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-4"><title>Air-water interface symmetries and asymmetries</title><p>Several samples show an asymmetry between particle saturation at the top and bottom air-water interfaces. For example, samples #10, 12–15, 33, and 44 have particles covering one air-water interface with the other interface showing no particles, samples #4, 7, 9, 18, 32, 36, 39, 42, and 43 have more particles covering one air-water interface than the other, and samples #1, 8, 9, 16, 17, 20–22, 24–31, 39, and 45 have a roughly equal number of particles on each air-water interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Particles that layer only on one air-water interface suggest that they are either sticking to the first available air-water interface (the interface on the back of the grid prior to blotting for conventional grid preparation techniques or the interface in the direction of application momentum for Spotiton), or to the first-formed protein network film. This first-formed protein network film might form nearly instantaneously after the first air-water interface is created with the sample dispenser. For a particle that denatures at the air-water interface, since the bulk diffusion time is one or more orders of magnitude less than the surface diffusion time, if the second available air-water interface is formed before the first air-water interface is saturated with bulk particles and if the protein concentration is high enough, then one might expect denaturation to occur at the second air-water interface. This would allow for a layer of particles to adsorb to each air-water interface. Further study into such sample behavior using cryoET while taking into account sample application directionality might lead to a clearer model for why particles adsorb preferentially to one air-water interface over the other.</p><p>Ideal samples are a rarity</p><p>Only two samples, #25: protein in nanodisc and #46: protein on streptavidin, exhibit ideal characteristics – less than 100 nm ice thickness, no overlapping particles, little or no preferred orientation, and areas with no particle-air-water interface interaction.

While the particle layers are on the air-water interfaces in thicker areas near the edges of holes, the lack of preferred orientation implies that some fraction of the particles contain protein that is not in contact with the air-water interface, thus satisfying the ideal condition. Sample #46 contains particles dispersed on streptavidin, which is used to both randomly orient the particles and to avoid at least one air-water interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).

When this occurs, it is often the case that projection images collected in these areas will contain overlapping particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, middle and right). These overlapping particles may cause several issues. First, overlapping particles picked as one particle will need to be discarded during post-processing (particles not circled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). If these particles are not discarded, then anomalous results might be expected in any 3D refinement containing these particles – particularly in refinement models that use maximum likelihood methods such as Relion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheres, 2012</xref>), cryoSPARC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Punjani et al., 2017</xref>), and Xmipp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scheres et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheres et al., 2008</xref>) – thus reducing the reliability and accuracy of the refinement results. Second, overlapping particles reduce the accuracy of whole-image defocus estimation (as depicted by particle color in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For instance, an exposure area perpendicular to the electron beam containing two parallel layers of particles with identical concentrations will result in a whole-image defocus estimation located halfway-between the two layers, thus limiting the resolution of each particle depending on their distance from the midway point. For such an image collected with a defocus range of 1 to 2 microns and with a 10 nm deviation from the midway point, the particles will have a resolution limit of about 2.5 Å. A 50 nm deviation from the midway point will result in a resolution limit of about 6 Å. Third, overlapping particles might reduce the accuracy of per-particle or local defocus estimation. If the concentrations of overlapping particles are too high, then local and potentially per-particle defocus estimation might contain fragments of particles at different heights than the particle of interest. Fourth, overlapping particles reduce the efficiency of data processing and thus data collection. The second and the third issues posed above might be partially resolved if the ice thickness is known by duplicating each particle, CTF correcting one</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.023</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Collection and processing limits imposed by variations in ice thickness (<bold>A</bold>) and particle layer tilt (<bold>B</bold>), given that the vast majority of particles in holes on conventionally-prepared cryoEM grids are adsorbed to an air-water interface.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Variations in ice thickness within and between holes might limit the number of non-overlapping particles in projection images (efficiency of collection and processing), the accuracy of whole image and local defocus estimation (accuracy in processing), the signal-to-noise ratio in areas of thicker ice (efficiency of collection and processing), and the reliability of particle alignment due to overlapping particles being treated as a single particle.

Tomography also has allowed us to study the orientation of the normal of each air-water interface with respect to the direction of the electron beam, and thus the tilt of the particles local to each air-water interface. We have found that air-water interfaces are tilted between 0° and 16° relative to the electron beam when at a nominal stage tilt of 0° (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The average tilt ± (one standard deviation and measurement error) of particle layers at the centers of holes is 4.8°±3.1° (N = 89) and at the edges of holes is 6.9°±3.5° (N = 61) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These tilts may be due to a combination of errors in stage orientation, local grid deformations, and/or local air-water interface curvatures. In most cases, these tilts are not systematic with respect to particle orientation in the ice, and thus contribute beneficially to angular particle coverage.</p><p>As shown previously, most particles are adsorbed to an air-water interface (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and Videos). It is important to note that a lack of apparent preferred orientation in single particle micrographs does not imply that the particles are not adsorbed to the air-water interfaces. Indeed, most of the particles listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> that have no apparent preferred orientations are adsorbed to the air-water interfaces. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> shows a selection of adsorbed particles with and without preferred orientations. A distinction should be made between preferred orientation and apparent preferred orientation of particles. A particle may have N and/or M preferred orientations on the grid as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>. Collection on a given grid with non-zero tilts effectively increases the number of imaged preferred orientations of the particle. Depending on the numbers N and/or M, the locations of the preferred orientations on the particle, the symmetry of the particle, and the range of non-zero tilts on the grid, a preferentially oriented particle might have no apparent preferred orientations in a full single particle dataset. As a hypothetical example, both T20S proteasome and apoferritin might have two preferred orientations each, yet T20S proteasome may appear to have a small number of preferred orientations while apoferritin may appear to have no preferred orientations when micrographs are collected with a nominal tilt of zero degrees, but with non-zero degree local air-water interface tilts. This would be due to apoferritin having a high number of uniformly distributed asymmetric units and ~6° tilts in the exposure areas.</p><p>The potential effect of tilted particle layers on CTF estimation, and thus resolution limit, of a single particle cryoEM dataset can be nearly as harmful as there being a layer of particles at each air-water interface, as described in the previous section and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> depicts the additional effects imposed by air-water interface and thus particle layer tilts. CTF correction on individual particles using defocus estimation on whole fields of view will limit the resolution of particles above and below the corrected defocus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left and middle) and will alleviate the resolution limit of some particles in thicker areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, middle and right). Additionally, areas of thick ice that are tilted might change which particles are uniquely identifiable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, right) relative to being untilted. As a hypothetical example, consider a micrograph with a single particle layer in the exposure area and a particle layer tilt of 10° collected at 1 Å pixelsize on a 4 k × 4 k camera with a defocus range of 1 to 2 microns. If the CTF for this micrograph is estimated and corrected for on a whole-image basis, then the worst-corrected particles will have a resolution limit of around 4 Å. These particles might be down-weighted or removed during processing, effectively decreasing the efficiency of the collection.</p><p>Several datasets in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> exhibit both of the issues described in this section and in the previous section: overlapping particles in the direction of the electron beam and tilted exposure areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Most of these locations are near hole edges where the ice is often curved and thicker. It is not uncommon for a user to collect single particle micrographs near the edges of holes in order to maximize the collection area in each hole, to avoid the potentially greater beam-induced motion in the center of the holes, and/or to avoid the thin center of holes that are more prone to tearing during exposure. Without previously characterizing the sample in the grid holes by cryoET, collection in these areas might severely limit the number of alignable particles due to projection overlap, the resolution due to CTF estimation and correction error, and the signal due to ice thickness. Thus, for many samples, it is advisable to first determine the distance from the edge of a representative grid hole to collect in order to reliably image single layered particles in thin ice. Doing so will increase the signal due to ice thickness and the reliability and efficiency of single particle alignment and classification due to there being no overlapping particles. CTF estimation and correction should also be performed with the assumption that the field of view is tilted relative to the electron beam (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), either by performing estimation and correction with whole-image CTF tilt processing, local CTF processing, or per-particle CTF processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grigorieff et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang, 2016</xref>). If the ice in thinner areas in the centers of holes is prone to tearing, then one solution might be to image at a lower dose rate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Fiducial-less cryoET may be used to determine optimal single particle collection areas and strategies</title><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, ice thickness in holes is commonly greater at the edges than in the centers. Most samples that have this ice behavior have a single layer of particles on one air-water interface, with either a second layer on the apposed air-water interface or additional non-adsorbed particles, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). At a certain distance from the edge of the holes (usually between 100 to 500 nm from the edge), the ice commonly becomes thin enough for only one layer of particles to fit between – usually the particle’s minor axis plus 10 to 20 nm of space between the particles and the air-water interfaces. Provided that particle concentration is high enough for accurate CTF estimation, specimen drift is low enough for sufficient correction, and the particles have little or no apparent preferred orientation, then collection a certain distance away from the edges of these holes would be the most efficient use of resources.

For example, cryoET has been used on several HIV-1 trimer preparations with receptors to understand the stoichiometry of the bound receptors by direct visualization of individual particles in 3D (samples #5–7 corresponding to <xref ref-type="video" rid="video8">Videos 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video13">13</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video14">14</xref>). In another example, sample #17, the size of the ‘glycoprotein with bound lipids’ particles varied discretely with the radial distance from the edge of holes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video15">Video 15</xref>). In single particle cryoEM micrographs, this observation was not immediately explicable and would have required a single particle data collection followed by alignment and classification before reliable conclusions could be made. Instead, a single tomogram of the sample was collected and it was observed that near the edges of the hole the particles with lipids existed in two layers at the air-water interfaces. Beyond a radial distance from the edge of about 300 nm where the ice became about 15 nm thin the particles and lipids dissociated, with the particles remaining in a single layer (see <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref> for sample #20). A solution to this issue was found where glycosylated particles were prepared using Spotiton with conditions that intentionally created thick ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, sample #18). A further example highlighting the importance of using cryoET to understand the behavior of samples on grids is sample #40 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This sample consisted of a very low concentration of particles in solution prepared with a carbon layer over holes to increase the concentration in holes. CryoET showed that the particles were forming two layers on the carbon: a layer directly on the carbon with about 60% saturation and a layer scattered on top of the first layer with about 30% saturation. This observation made clear that particle overlap would be an issue in single particle processing and introduced the possibility that since the particle layers were directly touching that this might induce conformational change in some of the particles. Similarly for sample #41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), cryoET on particles and DNA strands prepared with carbon over holes revealed that a considerable fraction of projection areas consisted of overlapping particles due to some non-adsorbed particles attached to DNA strands. In this situation, it was determined that single particle cryoEM on this sample would be highly inefficient for studying the complex of interest. In the cases described here, cryoET was an expedient and sometimes indispensable method for determining particle behavior.</p><media id="video13" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-34257-video13.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.025</object-id><label>Video 13.</label><caption><title>Sample 6.</title></caption></media><media id="video14" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-34257-video14.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.026</object-id><label>Video 14.</label><caption><title>Sample 7.</title></caption></media><media id="video15" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-34257-video15.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.027</object-id><label>Video 15.</label><caption><title>Sample 17.</title></caption></media></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Fiducial-less SPT can generate de novo initial models with no additional preparation</title><p>A useful and sometimes critical benefit of being able to perform fiducial-less cryoET on a single particle grid is that the resulting tomograms can be processed through single particle tomography alignment and classification in order to generate de novo templates for single particle micrograph picking and for use as initial models in single particle alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Cong and Ludtke, 2010</xref>).

This resulted in three de novo initial models, each showing an asymmetric cracked ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), contradicting the C6-symmetric reconstruction determined by 2D classification and common-lines approaches. The most populated class from single particle tomography (SPT) was then used to both template pick the single particle micrographs in Relion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Scheres, 2012</xref>) and as initial models for single particle alignment, resulting in a 4.1 Å structure of the DnaB helicase-helicase loader (manuscript in preparation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). In this example, cryoET revealed that the apparent symmetry in the prevalent top view particles as seen in the Gaussian picked 2D class averages was in fact a projection of the globally asymmetric particle. There are two key benefits to performing fiducial-less cryoET to generate de novo initial models as opposed to fiducial-based cryoET: (1) No additional gold bead + sample preparation and optimization is involved as with conventional fiducial-based tilt-series alignment and (2) the exact sample from which single particle micrographs are collected is used, thus removing the possibility of sample variation across grid preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We have shown that over a wide range of single particle cryoEM samples, particle and ice behaviors vary widely, yet the vast majority of particles on grids prepared using conventional techniques and using Spotiton with nanowire grids end up adsorbed to air-water interfaces. This varied behavior shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">2</xref> – varied in particle denaturation, particle preferred orientation, particle overlap in the direction of the beam, particle layer tilt, ice thickness, and ice thickness variation across holes – provides impetus for researchers to routinely perform cryoET on their single particle cryoEM grids. Routine characterization of cryoEM grids allows for the determination of particle behavior, whether a single particle sample might produce desirable results, and optimal collection areas and strategies, thus increasing microscope and single particle processing efficiency. Moreover, cryoET on single particle cryoEM grids can be used to generate de novo initial models through single particle sub-tomogram alignment and classification.</p><p>The observation that the vast majority of particles are adsorbed to air-water interfaces warrants further research into methods for avoiding the air-water interface. Possible methods include preparing grids with non-ionic surfactants, using affinity grids, encapsulating particles in carbon layers, encapsulating particles in scaffolds, and, perhaps, faster plunging technologies to outrun air-water interface adsorption. Adding surfactants to single particle sample/grid preparation prior to freezing in order to protect bulk proteins from the air-water interfaces has been proposed and used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frederik et al., 1989</xref>), yet might be revisited by adding non-ionic surfactants below the CMC. Alternatively, spreading a layer of surfactant (ionic or non-ionic) onto the surface of the air-water interfaces during grid preparation might both reduce the surfactant-protein interaction in solution along with competitive adsorption, and increase the mechanical strength of the resulting surfactant layer on the air-water interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Morris and Gunning, 2008</xref>) (perhaps using a method similar to that described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vos et al., 2008</xref>]). Affinity substrates, such as carbon, streptavidin, or ionic lipid monolayers over holes may be used in an attempt to escape the air-water interfaces, and potentially have the additional benefit of requiring lower protein concentrations in solution. However, the usage of affinity grids requires further grid optimization with regard to collecting only in areas where the ice is thick enough to more than cover the particles adsorbed to the affinity substrate, and signal is degraded due to the affinity substrate. Encapsulating two-dimensional crystals between carbon layers in order to avoid excessive dehydration due to open air-water interfaces has been performed successfully (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2013</xref>), opening up the possibility of encapsulating particles in-between carbon, or possibly graphene layers, to avoid air-water interface interactions. Particle encapsulation using protein scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kedersha and Rome, 1986</xref>) or synthetic DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Martin et al., 2016</xref>) has also been proposed for avoiding air-water interface and preferred orientation issues. Lastly, decreasing the time between sample application and freezing in order to outrun air-water interface adsorption altogether might be possible with further technological development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arnold et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feng et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frank, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Noble et al., 2018</xref>). The time it takes for a particle to diffuse to an air-water interface, to diffuse across the air-water interface, and for subsequent bulk particles to adsorb to the resulting viscoelastic protein network film might be on the order of tens of milliseconds or greater. This process appears to be largely dependent on protein surface hydrophobicity, protein concentration, and protein structure. Avoiding the air-water interface may prove critical for obtaining higher resolution structures of more fragile proteins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Grid preparation</title><p>About one-third of the grids characterized were prepared using conventional techniques as determined by the sample owner.

accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Routine Single Particle CryoEM Sample and Grid Characterization by Tomography&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher J Russo (Reviewer #1); Georgios Skiniotis (Reviewer #2); John AG Briggs (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Noble et al. applied cryo-electron tomography in a large variety of single-particle samples prepared with a range of vitrification devices and grids to characterize the particle distribution in vitreous ice and the ice geometry in vitrified layers. The results demonstrate convincingly that the vast majority of particles in most cases adsorb to the air-water interface, a phenomenon with potential consequences regarding protein denaturation or complex dissociation, non-physiological conformational changes, as well as preferred particle orientation based on the preferential exposure of the most hydrophobic regions. This study, being the first to systematically examine particle localization in vitrified ice, is important given its implications for the rapidly developing cryo-EM field. However, a weakness of the paper is that it does not directly assess whether particle position really correlates with protein denaturation, orientation and reconstruction quality.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors suggest that the preferred orientation of particles in many cases is due to the exposure at the air-water interface. To this end it would be very helpful if they demonstrate through sub-tomogram averaging, e.g. as they show in Figure 8, that indeed the particles at the interface assume more preferred orientations compared to particles in the middle of the ice layer.</p><p>The authors state, e.g. in reference to Figure 5, that it is not clear whether observed protein fragments are from denaturation at the air-water interface, unclean preparation conditions, or protein degradation in solution. This is an important point. Can the authors show that in the majority of these cases there was no degradation in solution, e.g. by SDS PAGE or even negative stain visualization? Could the authors design an experiment showing that particles away from the air water interface are better than those at the air water interface?</p><p>It is disappointing that there is no overall analysis of whether sample distribution has an effect on the final 3D reconstruction. Could this be done?</p><p>The authors discuss that &quot;protein network films may not be particle friendly&quot;, and suggest this might contribute to artefactual reconstructions. This is all rather speculative, but could this be assessed? There must be 3D reconstructions of most of such samples, is an effect seen in the 3D reconstructions where a protein network film is present?</p><p>The authors discuss that &quot;particle adsorption implies preferred orientation&quot;. There is no explanation as to how preferred orientation was assessed or quantified. Could the authors design an experiment to show whether preferred orientation does correlate with interaction with the air water interface?</p><p>The discussion on collection and processing limits (illustrated in Figure 6) could also be followed up in the 3D structures – where the sample is tilted or thick, then changing away from whole-image based CTF estimation toward tilted or per-particle CTF should improve the reconstruction?</p><p>Some of the sample properties that the authors suggest should be measured by cryoET can typically also be assessed directly from 2D images. For example, one paragraph is spent on the observation that some areas have overlapping particles. This can be often assessed in 2D for the majority of samples. Concerning the statement &quot;without previously characterizing the sample in the grid holes by cryoET, collection in these areas might severely limit the number of alignable particles due to projection overlap&quot; – many users would see the overlapping particles in 2D images and decide to collect elsewhere. Similarly, people have used CTFtilt in the past to assess whether the field of view is tilted relative to the beam, and estimate the gradient. Tilted exposure areas are not a serious problem for all processing pipelines. Collecting some tomograms can provide a quick and relatively easy sample assessment, and it is a good idea to do this, it is not the case that users who do not do this are doomed to collecting bad images. Please provide a discussion along these lines.</p><p>The claims in the subsection “A significant fraction of areas in holes have overlapping particles in the electron beam direction”, about the effects of overlapping particles on cryoEM reconstructions should have citations for each claim or should be left out unless the authors wish to present additional evidence to support the claims.</p><p>Technical comments:</p><p>In reporting the tilt angles of the specimen in the holes, the authors have provided the magnitude but not the direction of the tilt angles. Even though the tilt direction w.r.t. the grid was unfortunately not tracked, the direction of tilt with respect to the beam axis is important for interpreting the results and statistics so the authors should include the tilt direction for all the tilt angles reported.</p><p>If 3D reconstructions of any of the specimen or sub-tomogram particles were performed, plots of the orientation distributions, especially from different regions within the same specimen corresponding to the tomograms presented, should be included. In addition, a more specific reporting of the extent of preferred orientation than &quot;some&quot; &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; (Table 1) would be helpful.</p><p>A detailed description of the measurement of ice thickness, and the determination of the error in this measurement should be reported, i.e. how the value of 10 nm on P14L26 was determined and what are the possible sources of systematic error in these measurements.</p><p>For the errors reported in Figure 3, it is not clear if the standard deviation includes the propagated error from the individual measurements or is just the statistical error. This should be described.</p><p>For an individual tomogram, the error in the tilt measurement should be determined and included when reporting statistics on multiple tomograms. For example, Figure 3 column 4, the error in an individual tilt angle may be comparable to the value of the angle itself, but one cannot tell currently if this is the case or not.</p><p>There is little exploration of the relationships of the parameters that have been measured. For example, is there any correlation between particle size and ice thickness, or between ice thickness and grid type? Given the heterogeneity of the samples, is it appropriate to show average properties (Figure 3), but not explore relationships between parameters?</p><p>Comments on presentation:</p><p>The manuscript text needs rewriting for readability, at the moment it is very challenging.

We are prepared to accept this manuscript as a Tools and Resources article, provided that some of the raw data are publicly deposited. Specifically, we request that both the 2D single particle data and the tilt-series/tomograms be deposited for at least a few specimen, such as, apoferritin, proteasome and maybe another one of the dozens in the tables that are of structures that are already available in the literature. We believe that these deposited datasets will become a resource to the community.

It takes several somewhat abstract concepts, like preferential orientation and the air water interface and makes them strikingly obvious and easy to both quantify, and understand for new-comers to the field. The authors have addressed many of the statistical rigour concerns and certainly improved the paper from its previous version. Still, I am somewhat disappointed that the authors have not made better use of this data to address the questions which are not already clear to experts in the field: namely in what percentage of particles, for a particular specimen, and among different specimen, does adsorption to the air-water interface actually prevent structure determination by either destruction or preferential orientation. By quantifying these two outstanding problems the authors could have set a goal and a benchmark for the field as to the current state of the art as well as point toward the opportunity for improvement by some technological solution. Instead we only have the new Figure 5 which sort of hints that it is a mixture, but with no quantification of either effect.</p><p>Ultimately, this paper contains important and useful experiments and analysis that should definitely be published. But to the expert reader, the paper sometimes reads a bit like a straw man argument in that the authors claim that most people believe one thing, which is not universally true historically, given section 6 of Dubochet et al. 1988, so their claims about the &quot;wide-ranging implications&quot; of these observations ring less true. This is what makes the lack of quantification of the both the denaturation and orientation distribution of the particles disappointing as it strikes me as a slightly missed opportunity to push the understanding of the problem, and thus the entire field beyond what Dubochet clearly realised more than 30 years ago.</p><p>I think the paper can and should be published in <italic>eLife</italic> with minor revision if the authors are willing and able to deposit all the raw data (both tomograms and subsequent 2D micrographs/movies) for at least the specimen shown in the figures. In this way others will also be able to perform analyses to help understand the relationship, if there is one, between the location of a particle in a vitrified specimen and its usefulness in structure determination by cryoEM.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>I find that the authors have done a good job in addressing most reviewer concerns and comments. The new Figure 5 is very informative and a nice addition. Even though not all comments or suggestions could be addressed with updated experiments, the work is important to the cryo-EM field and the revised manuscript should be published without further delay.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The authors have declined to address most of the essential revisions requested by the reviewers, reasonably arguing that the work required is substantial and it would be better to get the paper out there.</p><p>Here is the background to my opinion:</p><p>There are already some examples of particles clustering at the air water interface from tomograms – the ribosomes in Bharat and Scheres, Nature Protocols 2016, Figure 6 are a good example. It has been assumed since Dubochet, though has not been demonstrated, that particles at the air-water interface may be subjected to denaturation. It has also been broadly accepted in the field that particles showing preferred orientations often due so due to interactions at the air water interface:</p><p>&quot;Occasionally particles adopt preferred orientations, presumably due to interactions with the air/water interface.&quot;: A primer to single particle cryo-electron microscopy, Cheng et al., 2015.</p><p>&quot;In situations where the target adopts a preferred orientation due to interactions with the air-water interface or substrate, there may be a problem similar to the missing wedge problem&quot;: Single particle analysis at high-resolution, Cong and Ludtke., 2010.</p><p>This manuscript describes an interesting study, showing that the majority of particles in large number samples are located at the air water interface, but it doesn't tell us how detrimental this is for reconstruction, or why it does/doesn't happen. Many of the structures solved from these samples presumably went to high resolution, so this is an interesting question. I think that a descriptive study of the distribution of particles in ice is informative and interesting for the cryo-EM field, but in the first round of reviews we asked to go beyond this and ask how particle position influences the results of the single particle experiment. Without this, I feel that the manuscript is still of interest to the cryo-EM field, but does not have the importance that is typical of papers in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34257.121</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>Noble et al. applied cryo-electron tomography in a large variety of single-particle samples prepared with a range of vitrification devices and grids to characterize the particle distribution in vitreous ice and the ice geometry in vitrified layers. The results demonstrate convincingly that the vast majority of particles in most cases adsorb to the air-water interface, a phenomenon with potential consequences regarding protein denaturation or complex dissociation, non-physiological conformational changes, as well as preferred particle orientation based on the preferential exposure of the most hydrophobic regions. This study, being the first to systematically examine particle localization in vitrified ice, is important given its implications for the rapidly developing cryo-EM field. However, a weakness of the paper is that it does not directly assess whether particle position really correlates with protein denaturation, orientation and reconstruction quality.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers and the editors for considering this manuscript, and for their helpful comments and suggestions. We note that the comment on the weakness of the paper above is echoed many times below in various forms. It is clear that the reviewers really want to know whether the tendency of particles to adhere to an air-water interface affects the integrity of the particles and thus the quality of 3D maps derived from these particles. As shown in the manuscript, the vast majority of particles for all samples are absorbed to the air water interface. An experiment to distinguish the quality of maps derived from non-adsorbed vs. adsorbed particle would involve a prohibitive amount of images to accumulate enough non-adsorbed particles and also an enormous amount of additional processing and analysis. We respectfully propose that this new work proposed is not essential to support the major conclusions of our paper (which is that most particles reside at the air-water interface), that it would entail a major amount of work that would significantly delay the publication of this paper, and that it is beyond the scope of the current paper which makes no claims or conclusions regarding whether particle position correlates to protein denaturation or reconstruction quality. Since submitting this paper, we have been doing additional work on some of the issues of interest to the reviewers and some discussion on these matters was presented in a different manuscript now available on bioRxiv (<underline>https://doi.org/10.1101/288340</underline>). We do intend to try and address whether the quality of maps derived from non-adsorbed particles is different from that of adsorbed particles by using the methods described in that paper which aims to increase the number of non-adsorbed particles and thus reduce the onerousness of this task. We also want to note that it is of course clear that while 90% of particles adhere to the air-water interface, for several of these samples we can readily reconstruct sub 3A maps. Thus, we believe it is very likely that the integrity of particles will be highly sample dependent. But as this is pure speculation and we are not yet able to undertake the necessary experiments to prove this, we prefer not to discuss this further regarding this point.</p><p>With that stated we do note that indeed particle position appears to show some correlation with preferred orientation, as can be seen by direct observation of the particles in the tomograms. An analysis of particle position versus orientation and reconstruction was also partially addressed in the bioRxiv manuscript:</p><p><underline>https://doi.org/10.1101/288340</underline>. This has been cited in the revised manuscript.</p><p>These points are addressed further below in response to various specific related comments by the reviewers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors suggest that the preferred orientation of particles in many cases is due to the exposure at the air-water interface. To this end it would be very helpful if they demonstrate through sub-tomogram averaging, e.g. as they show in Figure 8, that indeed the particles at the interface assume more preferred orientations compared to particles in the middle of the ice layer.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting that the potential change in preferred orientation between particles adsorbed at the air-water interface and those not adsorbed should be shown explicitly. To this end, we have included an additional figure, new Figure 5, with examples of particles, observed directly in the tomograms, showing preferred orientation with respect to the air-water interface when adsorbed but without preferred orientation when not adsorbed (HIV-1 trimer, rabbit muscle aldolase, and T20S proteasome) and without preferred orientation when adsorbed (DnaB helicase-helicase loader). We note that the orientation of particles as observed in tomograms can be determined directly without the need for sub-tomogram processing for most of the samples reported on here. These tomograms are available in the tomogram videos accompanying this manuscript and from the deposited EMDB and EMPIAR datasets. As discussed above, we respectfully suggest that performing sub-tomogram averaging would entail an onerous amount of additional work and substantially delay the publication of this paper. (Note that the references to figures in this response to reviewers are with respect to the figure order in the original submission. The additional figure is referred to as ‘new Figure 5’.)</p><p>We have weakened the sub-section name in response to this suggestion. It now reads: ‘Particle adsorption sometimes implies preferred orientation’. We have added references to new Figure 5 in this section.</p><p>We note that nearly all of the particles depicted in Figure 8 and the video for Sample #33 in the original manuscript and in the entire dataset (EMPIAR-10135) are adsorbed to air-water interfaces. Virtually no particles in this dataset were in the middle of the ice layer. This has been clarified in the figure caption.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors state, e.g. in reference to Figure 5, that it is not clear whether observed protein fragments are from denaturation at the air-water interface, unclean preparation conditions, or protein degradation in solution. This is an important point. Can the authors show that in the majority of these cases there was no degradation in solution, e.g. by SDS PAGE or even negative stain visualization? Could the authors design an experiment showing that particles away from the air water interface are better than those at the air water interface?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have the means to assess the majority of samples reported on in the manuscript as much of the data was gathered from users of our facilities who agreed to have their samples evaluated by tomography during data collection sessions otherwise devoted to single particle analysis.</p><p>As shown in this paper, the vast majority of particles for all samples are absorbed to the air-water interface. An experiment to distinguish the quality of maps derived from non-adsorbed vs. adsorbed particle would thus involve a prohibitive amount of additional work and be well beyond the scope of the current paper. We instead intend to address this at a future data by using the methods described in a different paper (<underline>https://doi.org/10.1101/288340</underline>) that aims to increase the number of non-adsorbed particles.</p><p>In response to what we see as the heart of the reviewers’ questions here, we suspect, based on the food and colloidal literature cited in the Introduction, that proteins might undergo minor conformational changes in secondary structure and random coils exposed to the air-water interface (see specifically Table 2 in Yano, Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter, 2012 for a review of observed secondary structural change between bulk proteins in solution and proteins adsorbed to an air-water interface). These higher-resolution structural changes are very unlikely to be resolvable with sub-tomogram processing of the data presented and included in this manuscript. We also note that while the majority of particles like apoferritin and the T20S proteasome are undoubtedly adsorbed to air-water interfaces, we nevertheless routinely produce sub-3Å maps from these structures, so any differences due to the air-water interface are unlikely to be resolved by sub-tomogram averaging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is disappointing that there is no overall analysis of whether sample distribution has an effect on the final 3D reconstruction. Could this be done?</p></disp-quote><p>This point has been partly addressed above. Also, please see Tan et al., 2017 (cited in our paper) for an explicit example of how conventional untilted single particle cryoEM on a particle, hemagglutinin, with a very high degree of preferred orientation (due to air-water interface adsorption, as shown in this manuscript) affects the final 3D reconstruction compared to tilted collection.</p><p>In the bioRxiv preprint (<underline>https://doi.org/10.1101/288340</underline>) discussed above, we showed that decreasing the time from spot to plunge affects particle orientation at air-water interfaces with regards to the final 3D reconstruction. In that manuscript, we also show how plunging faster can increase the number of non-adsorbed particles for some samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss that &quot;protein network films may not be particle friendly&quot;, and suggest this might contribute to artefactual reconstructions. This is all rather speculative, but could this be assessed? There must be 3D reconstructions of most of such samples, is an effect seen in the 3D reconstructions where a protein network film is present?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for allowing us to clarify this point. While we acknowledge that this is speculation in terms of its effects on cryoEM maps, and indeed state this in the manuscript, we also cite several sources in food and colloidal studies that show that proteins denature at air-water interfaces, potentially causing conformational changes. For instance, Meinders, Bosch and Jongh, 2001 shows that by increasing bulk protein concentration in solution, a protein film of increasing thickness forms on the air-water interface consisting of ‘a single homogeneous protein solution.’ This implies that subsequent proteins adsorbing to the already existing protein film at the air-water interface denature. Also, Table 2 in Yano, 2012 cites several results in the literature showing that protein secondary structure at air-water interfaces has been observed to transmute between beta sheets, alpha helices, and random coils.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for suggesting that the protein network film might be visible in 3D reconstructions of particles adsorbed to the air-water interface with preferred orientation. We examined the 3D reconstruction of a severely preferentially oriented particle, hemagglutinin, to see if there is a visible protein network. The 3D reconstruction of hemagglutinin was collected at tilts to fill in Fourier space (EMD-8731), as described in Tan et al., 2017. Increasing the threshold of the map in Chimera does not appear to reveal any coherent protein network film. We have not included this assessment in the manuscript because it is inconclusive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors discuss that &quot;particle adsorption implies preferred orientation&quot;. There is no explanation as to how preferred orientation was assessed or quantified. Could the authors design an experiment to show whether preferred orientation does correlate with interaction with the air water interface?</p></disp-quote><p>This has been partially addressed in the previous discussion above. Preferred orientation was assessed by direct examination of the tomograms (deposited in EMDB and EMPIAR) containing particles whose orientations can be determined. The preferred orientations observed in these tomograms are reflected in the cross-sectional depictions accompanying each video and in Figure 4. We have added a sentence to the ‘Cross-sectional depictions’ section to clarify this for the reader.</p><p>Regarding the correlation between air-water interface interaction and preferred orientation, several tomograms in this manuscript where particle orientation can be determined directly explicitly show this correlation. For instance, the tomogram of Sample #5, HIV-1 trimer, shows that the vast majority of the trimers are adsorbed to the air-water interface with the 3-fold symmetric view facing the interface, while the few particles away from the interfaces are in random orientations. The tomogram video of Sample #42, T20S proteasome, show that the vast majority of particles are adsorbed to the air-water interface in the proteasome’s side-view, while the few non-adsorbed particles are in random orientations. We have added a figure, new Figure 5, showing the preferred orientation variation by location of a selection of examples, including the HIV trimer and proteasome. We have also added a reference in the conclusion to our recent bioRxiv preprint (<underline>https://doi.org/10.1101/288340</underline>), which shows explicit examples of how air-water interface interaction affects preferred orientation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion on collection and processing limits (illustrated in Figure 6) could also be followed up in the 3D structures – where the sample is tilted or thick, then changing away from whole-image based CTF estimation toward tilted or per-particle CTF should improve the reconstruction?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand that the reviewers are requesting that we illustrate that using per-particle CTF processing results in better 3D structures.</p><p>Several times throughout the manuscript, we refer to Tan et al., 2017, which explicitly details how per-particle CTF estimation and correction is essential for processing tilted images.</p><p>We have added a reference to Mingxu Hu’s upcoming software, Thunder, to the end of the section titled “Most air-water interfaces are tilted with respect to the electron beam” (Hu et al. 2018 https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/05/23/329169). This software refines per-particle CTF based on a maximum likelihood model. The authors show that their per-particle CTF processing on the public EMPIAR dataset of 2.8 Å T20S proteasome by Campbell et al., 2015 results in a 2.35 Å structure. This T20S sample and the T20S shown in this manuscript were both sourced from the lab of Yifan Cheng. We have also added references in the same location to existing per-particle CTF estimation and correction software, gCTF and CisTEM.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the sample properties that the authors suggest should be measured by cryoET can typically also be assessed directly from 2D images. For example, one paragraph is spent on the observation that some areas have overlapping particles. This can be often assessed in 2D for the majority of samples. Concerning the statement &quot;without previously characterizing the sample in the grid holes by cryoET, collection in these areas might severely limit the number of alignable particles due to projection overlap&quot; – many users would see the overlapping particles in 2D images and decide to collect elsewhere. Similarly, people have used CTFtilt in the past to assess whether the field of view is tilted relative to the beam, and estimate the gradient. Tilted exposure areas are not a serious problem for all processing pipelines. Collecting some tomograms can provide a quick and relatively easy sample assessment, and it is a good idea to do this, it is not the case that users who do not do this are doomed to collecting bad images. Please provide a discussion along these lines.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out that we are over-emphasizing the dangers here. However, from our own experience, we cannot agree with the statement that overlapping particles can always be assessed directly from 2D images, particularly for novel samples where the shape of the particle is unknown, for small particles, and for very crowded fields of view. For example, rabbit aldolase, Sample #21 (1 layer) and #22 (2+ layers), are difficult or impossible to differentiate in the 2D projection images.</p><p>With regards to somewhat tilted exposures areas significantly degrading single particle collection quality, we did not state this in in the manuscript and did not intend to make this point. We state “In most cases, these tilts are not systematic with respect to particle orientation in the ice, and thus contribute beneficially to angular particle coverage.” We also suggest that collecting with a tilt can be beneficial, e.g. in Figure 7 discussion and in the several references to Tan et al., 2017.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The claims in the subsection “A significant fraction of areas in holes have overlapping particles in the electron beam direction”, about the effects of overlapping particles on cryoEM reconstructions should have citations for each claim or should be left out unless the authors wish to present additional evidence to support the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We have softened the statement to say “may” rather than “will” cause issues. We do not see how this should be cited (do the reviewers have any suggestions?) as these are simple statements about the geometry and the method of projection matching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Technical comments:</p><p>In reporting the tilt angles of the specimen in the holes, the authors have provided the magnitude but not the direction of the tilt angles. Even though the tilt direction w.r.t. the grid was unfortunately not tracked, the direction of tilt with respect to the beam axis is important for interpreting the results and statistics so the authors should include the tilt direction for all the tilt angles reported.</p></disp-quote><p>Every dataset released on EMPIAR includes the aligned tilt-series of each tomogram reported on with regards to tilt angle with respect to the beam. AppionProtomo estimates and records the three Euler angles required to orient the normal of the specimen to the normal of the Protomo WBP reconstruction. The plots of each of these angles are included in the protomo_alignments/tiltseries####/media/angle_refinement/series####_orientati on.gif images on EMPIAR. Psi is the in-plane rotation required to reach the tilt direction, theta is the tilt with respect to the electron beam, and phi is in-plane rotation required to return to the tomogram coordinate system. The directional angle, Psi, appears to have no correlation with microscope: for example, EMPIAR-10138 (collected on Krios#01 at NYSBC), tiltseries0002 is a hole-magnification tomogram collected near the edge of the grid with (psi, theta, phi) ~= (100, -2, -100), while tiltseries0008 is a high magnification tomogram collected near the center of the grid with (psi, theta, phi) ~= (-50, 10, 50). As a second example on the same Krios microscope, tiltseries0004 and 0005 of EMPIAR10143 were each collected near the center of the grid and have (psi, theta, phi) of about (-40, -1, 40) and (-25, -6, 25), respectively. From the tilt-series we have checked for the microscopes used in this manuscript, the tilt magnitudes and directions do not appear to correlate with the microscope they were collected on; i.e. they are not systematic with respect to the microscope. The main cause of tilt area direction and magnitude appears to be due to variations in local bends in the grid and local ice curvature, and thus particle layer curvature. We have added a sentence stating that “there is no apparent correlation between microscope and tilt direction or magnitude” (section ‘Analysis of single particle tomograms’) and have pointed interested readers to the tomogram tilt orientation plots of all deposited data in the ‘Data deposition and software availability’ section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If 3D reconstructions of any of the specimen or sub-tomogram particles were performed, plots of the orientation distributions, especially from different regions within the same specimen corresponding to the tomograms presented, should be included. In addition, a more specific reporting of the extent of preferred orientation than &quot;some&quot; &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;unknown&quot; (Table 1) would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Again, this has been partly addressed above. Apart from the DnaB helicase-helicase loader tomograms, no other sub-tomogram processing was performed. We have only a few single particle Euler angle distributions and we do not feel these would add substantially to the discussion as these seem to be highly sample dependent (e.g. hemagglutinin is completely preferred while for the T20S the symmetry presumably compensates for the preferred orientation). Again, we feel that this request is well beyond the scope of this paper. We again note that the provided tomogram videos and tomograms on EMDB and EMPIAR show explicit orientations of many of the samples by going slice-by-slice through the tomograms. We have added a sentence clarifying this in the ‘Analysis of single particle tomograms’ section: “For many of the samples shown here and made available in the data depositions, particle orientations can be explicitly determined by direct visualization.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A detailed description of the measurement of ice thickness, and the determination of the error in this measurement should be reported, i.e. how the value of 10 nm on P14L26 was determined and what are the possible sources of systematic error in these measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for prompting us to include proper descriptions of estimations and errors. A section in the Materials and methods titled ‘Estimations and measurement error’ has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the errors reported in Figure 3, it is not clear if the standard deviation includes the propagated error from the individual measurements or is just the statistical error. This should be described.</p></disp-quote><p>A section in ‘Estimations and measurement error’ has been added to describe error propagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For an individual tomogram, the error in the tilt measurement should be determined and included when reporting statistics on multiple tomograms. For example, Figure 3 column 4, the error in an individual tilt angle may be comparable to the value of the angle itself, but one cannot tell currently if this is the case or not.</p></disp-quote><p>The measurement error is about 1 degree for each tomogram measured, which is the estimated error in orienting a particle layer to the viewing area in 3dmod’s ‘Slicer’ window. 1-5 tomograms per sample were measured for the data presented in Figure 3. The measurement error for the particle layer tilts in particular is an order of magnitude less than the value of the angle itself. An explanation of this measurement and its error has been added to the ‘Estimations and measurement error’ section in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is little exploration of the relationships of the parameters that have been measured. For example, is there any correlation between particle size and ice thickness, or between ice thickness and grid type? Given the heterogeneity of the samples, is it appropriate to show average properties (Figure 3), but not explore relationships between parameters?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for allowing us to clarify. As stated at the outset in the manuscript, the exposure areas were determined by the user, thus correlations versus ice thickness would not decouple user subjectivity. Also, we think that there are many parameters that may be implicated (e.g. grid type, plasma cleaning method, buffer, time between cleaning and sample application, sample incubation time, sample incubation temperature, sample incubation humidity, blot force (if used), blot time (if used), nanowire count, grid thickness, etc.); Most of these were not tracked and analysis of these relationships would require a full, separate study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments on presentation:</p><p>The manuscript text needs rewriting for readability, at the moment it is very challenging. There are lots of very long sentences and very long paragraphs. The heavy use of &quot;codes&quot; (B2, 2+, M-preferred) is extremely irritating and often unnecessary, forcing the reader to reference figures and tables to understand the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing this out. We have edited and split up several long sentences throughout the text. We think that the longest paragraph – the introductory paragraph briefly reviewing food and colloidal air-water interface studies – is necessary to keep in-tact as it is a departure from the rest of the Introduction. Furthermore, we do not wish to shorten this paragraph because it is an in-depth mini-review of these adjacent fields of study that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been analyzed to this extent in the cryoEM field, and because nearly all results mentioned are referred to throughout the manuscript.</p><p>We strongly believe that abbreviation of repeating information is absolutely necessary in dense tables and figures due to the amount of information that must be condensed for the reader. Every abbreviation and nomenclature is explained in the tables, figures, and their captions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results are all contained within two tables are very difficult to use and understand. Why put three values in one column in brackets running over two lines rather than just three columns or sub-columns? Why use rather cryptic nomenclature like &quot;3+&quot; which requires some thought by the reader to imaging what it might really mean. Entries like &quot;A2, B2 or B3 and B4 and B5‡ (50%), 0°&quot; are hard to interpret, requiring the reader to repeatedly look at legends and other figures to understand anything.

The subsection “Ideal samples are a rarity” explains why samples #25 and #46 are ideal.</p><p>With regards to inconsistencies between B1 and ‘+’, we have re-assessed the data and have simplified the tables by only including B1 and not ‘+’ to indicate the presence of non-adsorbed particles.</p><p>Whether B3 and B4 can be practically differentiated is not the point of Figure 2. This figure is an attempt to encapsulate all potential particle and ice behaviors in grid holes. As the figure caption states, this figure is based on a similar attempt by Tayler and Glaeser, 2008. Regarding B3 and B4 in particular, there might be proteins that adsorb to air-water interfaces, but take a long time relative to plunging time to begin denaturing. If those proteins are frozen before denaturation, they may have a different set of preferred orientations (N) than if they are frozen during/after denaturation (M). To clarify this, the following sentence has been added to the Figure 2 caption: “B3 is different from B4 if, for example, a particle prone to denaturation is frozen before or after denaturation has begun, thus potentially changing the set of preferred orientations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The tables are too small to read when printed – please make fonts larger or put in landscape mode.</p></disp-quote><p>The tables have been put in landscape mode.

The reviewers are correct that ‘freely-floating’ was used incorrectly as a synonym for ‘randomly oriented/positioned’, when in fact such particles may not be in equilibrium. We have opted to replace instances of ‘free/freely floating’ with ‘non-adsorbed’ or ‘not adsorbed to’.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the text and tables there is unnecessary complication. Why refer to &quot;ice behaviour (bottom)&quot; as C2, rather than &quot;flat&quot;. Why define &quot;N-preferred&quot; and &quot;M-preferred&quot; orientations?</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the reviewers concern but we believe that unless we use abbreviations the entire paper will be unnecessarily wordy. As mentioned previously, Figure 2 is intended to show all potential particle and ice behaviors in grid holes.

In particular, the new Figure 5 is very informative and a nice addition. However, it is disappointing that there is no further quantification as regards the effect of the surface-air water interface on the particles and the orientation of the particles. Comments expressed by the reviewers are given below, but note that we are not asking for any further work on the manuscript, except for dataset deposition (see below).</p><p>Despite the mixed opinions expressed by reviewers, after discussion among the reviewers and the reviewing editor we have concluded that your paper represents a significant contribution that we will be happy to publish in eLife. We are prepared to accept this manuscript as a Tools and Resources article, provided that some of the raw data are publicly deposited. Specifically, we request that both the 2D single particle data and the tilt-series/tomograms be deposited for at least a few specimen, such as, apoferritin, proteasome and maybe another one of the dozens in the tables that are of structures that are already available in the literature. We believe that these deposited datasets will become a resource to the community. When resubmitting the manuscript, please specify which datasets are deposited, and what the accession codes or preliminary processing information is for those datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>Two single particle datasets have been added to EMPIAR as the reviewers requested and the manuscript has been edited to reflect the additions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
