Here, we report on how phosphorylation at serine 10 of histone H3 (H3 S10) contributes to this process. Using a fluorescence-based assay to study local compaction of the chromatin fiber in living yeast cells, we show that chromosome condensation entails two temporally and mechanistically distinct processes. Initially, nucleosome-nucleosome interaction triggered by H3 S10 phosphorylation and deacetylation of histone H4 promote short-range compaction of chromatin during early anaphase. Independently, condensin mediates the axial contraction of chromosome arms, a process peaking later in anaphase. Whereas defects in chromatin compaction have no observable effect on axial contraction and condensin inactivation does not affect short-range chromatin compaction, inactivation of both pathways causes synergistic defects in chromosome segregation and cell viability. Furthermore, both pathways rely at least partially on the deacetylase Hst2, suggesting that this protein helps coordinating chromatin compaction and axial contraction to properly shape mitotic chromosomes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10396.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10396.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10396.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA in humans, yeast and other eukaryotic organisms is packaged in structures called chromosomes. When a cell divides these chromosomes are copied and then the matching pairs are separated so that each daughter cell has a full set of its genome. To enable these events to take place, the DNA must become more tightly packed so that the chromosomes become rigid units with projections called arms. Any failure in this chromosome “condensation” leads to the loss of chromosomes during cell division.</p> <p>Within a chromosome, sections of DNA are wrapped around groups of proteins to make a series of linked units called nucleosomes, which resemble beads on a string. These units and other scaffold proteins together make a structure called chromatin and establish the overall shape of the chromosome. However, it is not exactly clear how the nucleosomes and scaffold proteins are rearranged during condensation.</p> <p>Kruitwagen et al. used microscopy to study chromosome condensation in budding yeast. The experiments reveal that condensation involves two separate processes. First, modifications to the nucleosomes result in these units becoming more tightly packed in a process called short-range compaction. Second, a group of proteins called condensin is responsible for rearranging the compacted chromatin to enforce higher-order structure on the arms of the condensed chromosome (long-range contraction). Further experiments suggest that an enzyme called Hst2 may help to co-ordinate these processes to ensure that chromosomes adopt the right shape before the cell divides. For example, Hst2 ensures that longer chromosomes condense more than shorter ones.</p> <p>A future challenge will be to find out whether chromosome condensation works in a similar way in humans and other large eukaryotes, which form much larger chromosomes with more complicated structures than yeast.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10396.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10396.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>chromosome condensation</kwd><kwd>chromosome segregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ETH Zurich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruitwagen</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name><name><surname>Denoth-Lippuner</surname><given-names>Annina</given-names></name><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kruitwagen</surname><given-names>Tom</given-names></name><name><surname>Denoth-Lippuner</surname><given-names>Annina</given-names></name><name><surname>Barral</surname><given-names>Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Condensation and segregation of chromosomes during mitosis is caused by a combination of short-range interactions between nucleosomes and the long-range contraction of chromosome arms mediated by condensin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front> <body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title> <p>The DNA molecule at the core of any eukaryotic chromosome is a hundred to million times longer than the average diameter of the cell that hosts it. Thus, cells need to fold their genetic material in order to fit it in the interphase nucleus; they need to pack it further during mitosis, in order to move sister-chromatids safely and symmetrically apart. Furthermore, chromatin folding must be dynamic to allow transcription and replication during interphase, and such that exceptionally large chromosomes can hyper-condense during anaphase in order to fit the size of the spindle and prevent chromosome missegregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Titos et al., 2014</xref>). Moreover, mitotic condensation also facilitates the decatenation of sister chromatids during their separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charbin et al., 2014</xref>), and might help to ‘cleanse’ chromosomes from transcription, replication and cohesion factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yanagida, 2009</xref>). This is thought to ‘reset’ the transcriptional state of genes, and prevent displaced factors from interfering with chromosome segregation. However, despite their importance for chromosome segregation, the events ensuring the mitotic condensation of chromosomes are still only partially understood.</p> <p>Early studies made evident that nucleosomes play a critical role in DNA packaging. In favor of the idea that they play specific roles in chromatin condensation, histone H3 is phosphorylated by aurora B throughout mitosis on a serine at position 10 in most, if not all, eukaryotes. Furthermore, aurora B inactivation leads to chromosome condensation and segregation defects in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lavoie et al., 2004</xref>), fission yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petrova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tada et al., 2011</xref>), HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tada et al., 2011</xref>) and roundworms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hagstrom et al., 2002</xref>). However, the precise role of H3 S10 phosphorylation has remained unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajiro and Nishimoto, 1985</xref>). Recent data demonstrated that H3 S10 phosphorylation promotes the recruitment of the sirtuin-related deacetylase Hst2, which in turn deacetylates, at least, lysine 16 of histone H4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>). This unmasks a basic patch, allowing H4 to interact with the acidic patch on H2A, most probably on an adjacent nucleosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gordon et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, this cascade of events initiated by H3 phosphorylation is thought to tighten the interaction between neighboring nucleosomes. However, all studies carried out so far have failed to reveal strong phenotypes for H3 serine 10 to alanine mutations in a plethora of model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">de la Barre et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afonso et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ditchfield et al., 2003</xref>). Furthermore, mutation of this residue in budding yeast did not affect axial contraction of chromosomes and the condensation of the rDNA during regular mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lavoie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lavoie et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, the only phenotype identified upon replacement of H3 S10 with alanine in yeast so far is limited to the reduced ability to hyper-condense artificially long chromosomes in order to fit them in the spindle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it remains unclear whether H3 phosphorylation and H4 deacetylation play any general role in mitotic chromosome condensation.</p> <p>The discovery that mitotic extracts of frog eggs lacking any one of the subunits of a protein complex called condensin largely failed to condense chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hirano and Mitchison, 1994</xref>) opened new perspectives for understanding chromosome condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Piazza et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thadani et al., 2012</xref>). Condensin is a ring-shaped pentameric protein complex. The core of the ring is formed by two structural maintenance of chromosome (SMC) subunits, Smc2 and Smc4. Three non-SMC proteins (Brn1, Ycg1 and Ycs4 in budding yeast) close the ring. The mechanism of condensin loading on chromatin is not understood, but seems to depend on the activity of the kinase aurora B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lavoie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tada et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, the non-SMC subunits were recently shown to directly bind DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Piazza et al., 2014</xref>), potentially followed by topological entrapment of chromatin inside the condensin ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>). How condensin performs its functions in chromosome condensation is unclear, but it has been proposed that condensin’s role might be structural, by inducing loops within the same DNA strand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cuylen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>) or might be enzymatic by promoting positive DNA supercoiling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxter and Aragón, 2012</xref>), both assisting in a decrease in length of mitotic chromatids.</p> <p>Mitigating the central role of condensin in chromosome condensation, however, were observations in model organisms as diverse as fission yeast, fly, chicken and mammalian cells that indicate that chromosomes can still, at least partially, condense in the absence of condensin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petrova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coelho et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vagnarelli et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerlich et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, although condensin was established as a key player in chromosome condensation, it cannot be the sole factor shaping mitotic chromosomes.</p> <p>In order to gather insights into whether and how H2A-H4 interaction contributes to the organization of mitotic chromosomes, we sought for a method to assay the condensation state of chromatin in vivo. Here, we use a fluorescence-based assay to investigate short-range chromatin compaction and use it to study the relationships between condensin and histone modifications during chromosome condensation in mitotic cells.</p></sec> <sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title> <sec id="s2-1"><title>A microscopy-based assay to measure chromatin fiber compaction</title> <p>In order to develop a chromatin condensation assay, we reasoned that increased nucleosome-nucleosome interaction might render chromatin less accessible to DNA-binding proteins. To test this idea directly, we asked whether chromatin condensation restricted access for heterologous reporter proteins to their binding sites when those are introduced at a chosen chromosomal locus. Therefore, we used a yeast strain in which a set of Tet operator (TetO) repeats are inserted at the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus on chromosome IV, 15 kb from <italic>CEN4</italic>, and constitutively expressing the TetR-mCherry fusion protein, which efficiently binds the TetO repeat. As a consequence, these cells exhibit a red dot in their nucleus throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To test whether the intensity of TetR-mCherry fluorescence possibly varied over the cell cycle, we measured the fluorescence intensity of this dot in G1 cells (unbudded), when the chromatid is decondensed, but not replicated yet, and in late anaphase mother cells, when the chromatid is separated from its sister and has reached full condensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B</xref> and 3C; (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sullivan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">D'Amours et al., 2004</xref>) and see below). After subtracting background fluorescence, we noticed a highly significant (p&lt;0.0001), 2–2.5-fold decrease in mCherry fluorescence intensity at the TetO repeats on the anaphase compared with the G1-phase chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10396.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Fluorescence intensity of TetO/TetR-mCherry as a read-out for chromatin compaction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of a cell in G1 and anaphase, containing a TetO array at the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus and expressing TetR-mCherry (red).

Supporting this view, mutating key residues in the H3 phosphorylation and H4 deacetylation pathway established by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>) affected these variations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). Strikingly, mutations that abrogate the mitotic interaction between H2A and H4, such as <italic>H3 S10A, hst2</italic>∆ and the <italic>H4</italic> ∆<italic>9–16</italic> mutations, all abolished the reduction in brightness of the TetR-mCherry focus normally observed in anaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In reverse, mutations that promote constitutive H2A/H4 interaction, such as <italic>H3 S10D</italic> and <italic>H4 K16R,</italic> caused the TetR-mCherry focus to constitutively show, that is, even in G1 cells, the low fluorescence intensity normally specific of anaphase cells. The effect of the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutation was indeed mediated by the recruitment of Hst2, since the <italic>hst2</italic>Δ mutation suppressed it; the <italic>H3 S10D hst2</italic>∆ double mutant cells showed constitutive high brightness, similar to <italic>hst2</italic>∆ single mutant cells. Interestingly, however, introducing the <italic>H4 K16R</italic> mutation in the <italic>hst2</italic>∆ mutant cells did not restore the intensity drop normally observed during anaphase, suggesting that H4 K16 is not the sole residue that Hst2 deacetylates to promote nucleosome-nucleosome interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p> <p>To test whether the observed fluctuations in fluorescence intensity were specific for the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus or TetO/TetR-mCherry, we also measured the fluorescence intensity at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus, in the middle of the right arm of chromosome IV, where we integrated LacO repeats in cells expressing LacI fused to Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP). Although the effect was slightly less pronounced, we observed a similar, and significant, decrease in reporter brightness in anaphase compared with G1 cells at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As for the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus, mutants in the H3 S10 pathway also affected fluctuations in intensity at the CEN distal locus: <italic>hst2</italic>∆, <italic>H3 S10A</italic> and <italic>H3S10D hst2</italic>∆ showed a continuously higher fluorescent intensity on the LacO repeats near the <italic>LYS4</italic> gene and the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutation also resulted in a continuously lower fluorescent signal. These data indicated that changes in chromatin organization during mitosis indeed affected either the recruitment or the fluorescence intensity of TetR-mCherry and LacI-GFP on two distant chromatin loci, one close to the centromere and the second in the middle of the second longest yeast chromosome arm.</p> <p>Since chromatin condensation is regulated by the kinase aurora B (Ipl1 in budding yeast), we last asked whether Ipl1 activity is required for the intensity decrease of TetR-mCherry at the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus in mitotic cells. We arrested wild type yeast cells and cells containing the temperature sensitive <italic>ipl1-321</italic> allele in G1 with alpha-factor, released them at the restrictive temperature of 35ºC and determined TetO/TetR-mCherry fluorescence intensity in the same G1 or following anaphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Whereas wild type cells showed no significant difference in G1 and anaphase TetO/TetR-mCherry fluorescence intensity, the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> strain showed a significantly brighter dot when undergoing anaphase at the restrictive temperature. Compaction in G1 of <italic>ipl1-321</italic> cells at the restrictive temperature was not affected, presumably due to the fact that this protein has no activity in G1, even in wild type cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buvelot et al., 2003</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the enhanced H2A-H4 interaction triggered by aurora B-dependent recruitment of the deacetylase Hst2 onto chromatin indeed affects the intensity of the TetR-mCherry signal on the chromosome.</p></sec> <sec id="s2-2"><title>Fluorophore concentration quenching causes fluctuations in brightness</title> <p>We next wanted to better understand the molecular processes and structural changes of chromatin that were underlying the fluorescence variation at the TetO array over the cell cycle. Assuming enhanced nucleosome-nucleosome interaction promotes chromatin compaction, three models may explain the observed decrease of fluorescence in mitosis. First, chromatin compaction might reduce access of DNA-binding proteins, such as TetR-mCherry, to their binding site on DNA and cause their removal, as postulated by the chromosome cleansing hypothesis. Second, chromatin compaction might increase the local packing of TetR-mCherry, leading to quenching of the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lakowicz, 2013</xref>); these two first models are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>. Third, the changed local environment of mitotic chromatin might reduce the intrinsic fluorescence of mCherry and GFP.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10396.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Fluorophore quenching causes changes of TetO/TetR intensity over the cell cycle.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Two models to explain anaphase-specific decrease in fluorescence brightness (cleansing and quenching, see text for explanations).

Furthermore, in this context, quenching might be replaced by Förster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) between the TetR-GFP and TetR-mCherry molecules. Remarkably, unlike the cells expressing only TetR-mCherry, cells expressing both versions of TetR failed to show significant variation of the fluorescence signal for either mCherry or GFP at the TetO array between anaphase and G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, cleansing and a general change in the local environment of the fluorophores are unlikely to explain the fluorescence drop observed at the TetO array during anaphase in the cells expressing solely TetR-mCherry. Supporting the idea that the intensity drop was due to a quenching effect, FRET was indeed observed upon exciting in the GFP and recording emission in the red channel in cells expressing both TetR-mCherry and TetR-GFP, but not in cells expressing TetR-mCherry alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Moreover, FRET was significantly increased during anaphase compared with G1-phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), indicating that the fluorophores are indeed brought in closer proximity during anaphase compared with interphase. We conclude that increased H2A/H4 interaction results in a tighter packing of fluorophores and their quenching, establishing that H2A/H4 interaction leads to compaction of mitotic chromatin in vivo. Furthermore, cell cycle dependent changes of TetR-mCherry or TetR-GFP signals on TetO arrays is a reliable measure of short-range compaction of the underlying chromatin.</p></sec> <sec id="s2-3"><title>Chromatin compaction precedes the axial shortening of chromosomes</title> <p>Next, we investigated the dynamics of chromatin compaction during the cell cycle.

Using this strain, we first recorded time-lapse movies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) in which we measured the intensity of the LacI-GFP fluorescence at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus in cells progressing through mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Upon averaging the signal of at least 15 (t = -18 minutes) to maximum 31 (t = 0 minutes) such traces, we observed that the intensity of the signal was indeed lowest during the first 12 minutes of anaphase, while starting to increase as soon as the cells started to exit mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, blue line indicates the formation of the first bud in the population). We also noticed that fluorescence intensity at the LacO locus was highly variable throughout every single movie, leading to high standard deviations. This variation was lowest during anaphase and started to increase as soon as chromatin was decondensing, consistent with the idea that chromatin is more constrained when it is most compacted and fluorophore quenching is highest. The source of this fluorescence variation is not known, but might reflect breathing movements of the underlying chromatin or complex photochemistry effects. In either case, this intrinsic cell-to-cell variability precludes drawing conclusions at the single cell level and emphasizes the fact that the quenching assay introduced here is statistical in nature.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10396.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dynamics of chromatin compaction and chromosome arm contraction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of a cell going from metaphase to the next G1 phase with <italic>TRP1</italic> and <italic>LYS4</italic> loci marked with TetR-mCherry and LacI-GFP, respectively.

To avoid variations due to photobleaching, we used snapshot images of cells at precise and representative time points in mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>): metaphase (large buds but neither the <italic>TRP1</italic> nor the <italic>LYS4</italic> loci were separated), early anaphase (sister <italic>TRP1</italic> loci – in red – are separated, but the two <italic>LYS4</italic> loci are not), mid-anaphase (both loci have undergone separation but the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus still lags behind), late anaphase (all loci are separated and moved to the opposite poles of the cell) and G1 (unbudded cell). For each of these stages (&gt;25 cells each), we measured both the intensity of the fluorescence on the two arrays and the distance between them. In this study, we focused specifically on the loci segregated to the mother cell, as we showed before that mother and bud are not directly comparable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>).</p> <p>Analysis of this data set indicated that the two marked loci underwent compaction and decompaction with slightly different kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, upper panel). During early anaphase, both the TetO and LacO array seemed to be compacted to some extent already. As cells progressed to mid anaphase, the <italic>CEN4</italic> proximal TetO arrays seemed slightly more compacted than the distal LacO arrays. In late anaphase, the TetO array was already starting to unpack, whereas the LacO remained compacted. Both dots had recovered their full intensity in the G1 cells, demonstrating that the intensity decrease in anaphase was not solely the consequence of sister-chromatid separation, which is expected to reduce fluorescence intensity by half, down to its G1 level until the next S-phase. In the same cells, measuring the TetO-LacO distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, lower panel) indicated that the chromosome first stretched out upon anaphase onset, to subsequently contract, reaching their shortest length in late anaphase, as reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guacci et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). The TetO-LacO distance re-extended then to its steady state average in G1 cells.</p> <p>The changes in distance between the two loci could be due to changes in nuclear diameter, which would constrain the maximal distance that the loci can move apart by random motion. However, we did not observe any significant changes in nuclear diameter (as determined by GFP-tagging the nucleoporin Nup170) when comparing late anaphase and the G1 phase in wild type and <italic>hst2</italic>Δ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, the shortening of the <italic>TRP1</italic>-<italic>LYS4</italic> distance in late anaphase cells truly reflects the effect of chromatin condensation by axial contraction of the chromosomes. Furthermore, our results established that short-range chromatin compaction was not strictly concomitant with long-range axial contraction of the chromosome, but rather preceded it.</p></sec> <sec id="s2-4"><title>Condensin is not involved in local chromatin compaction</title> <p>These observations suggested that chromatin compaction and axial contraction of mitotic chromosomes might be distinct processes. Thus, we asked whether condensin, which is essential for axial chromosome contraction, contributed to short-range compaction of chromatin. We analyzed the brightness of the TetR-mCherry focus in yeast cells carrying the <italic>smc2-8</italic> allele, a temperature sensitive mutation in the condensin subunit Smc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Remarkably, condensin inactivation for 90 min at the restrictive temperature had no effect on the changes in mCherry brightness between the anaphase and G1-phase of the cell cycle, whereas it indeed abrogated shortening of the TetO-LacO distance during anaphase (see below). We therefore conclude that condensin, unlike histone 3 phosphorylation and histone 4 deacetylation, does not promote nucleosome-nucleosome interaction. To test this idea further, we directly probed H2A/H4 interaction by using genetically encoded Ultraviolet (UV) inducible crosslinking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>). We arrested cells in G1 with alpha-factor and released them in the presence of nocadozole under wild type and <italic>smc2-8</italic> conditions at 37ºC. Fluorescence-Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) analysis showed that the release and arrest was equally efficient in both cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In wild type cells, as reported before, H4/H2A crosslinking is observed in mitosis and correlated strongly with H4 K16 deacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In fitting with the microscopy data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), the crosslinking between H4 and H2A showed no difference in kinetics in the condensin inactivated and in the wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

Even more remarkably, the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> phospho-mimicking allele caused chromosome IV to remain in a constitutive state of axial contraction throughout the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). This most probably reflected constitutive recruitment of Hst2 to nucleosomes, since inactivation of the <italic>HST2</italic> gene in these cells abolished contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Thus, boosting the recruitment of Hst2 to chromatin through mimicking constitutive and ubiquitous phosphorylation of H3 promoted both chromatin compaction and axial chromosome contraction, despite the fact that the H3-dependent pathway of Hst2 recruitment is normally dispensable for Hst2 function in axial chromosome contraction during regular mitoses (though, it is essential for adaptive hyper-condensation of an artificially long chromosome). We next sought to determine the role of H4 K16 deacetylation in anaphase chromosome contraction. In accordance with the idea that H4 deacetylation solely plays a role in mitotic chromatin compaction, the <italic>H4 K16R</italic> allele did not show any significant differences in chromosome contraction compared with wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

Thus, we rationalized that Hst2 might not only promote chromosome compaction, but also the function of factors required for the axial contraction of chromatids, such as condensin. To test this notion, we measured the effect of combining the <italic>smc2-8</italic> mutation with <italic>H3</italic> and <italic>hst2∆</italic> mutations on axial chromosome contraction during anaphase. As expected, the <italic>smc2-8</italic> single mutant cells grown at the restrictive temperature failed to axially contract their mitotic chromosomes to wild type levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Deletion of Hst2 in these cells did not exacerbate their contraction phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that condensin and Hst2 might act in the same genetic pathway. In contrast, contraction was restored in the <italic>H3 S10D smc2-8</italic> double mutant cells. This effect was likely due to boosting Hst2 recruitment and activity since it disappeared in the <italic>H3 S10D hst2∆ smc2-8</italic> triple mutant cells.

Accordingly, the <italic>smc2-8 hst2∆</italic> double mutants showed the same phenotype.

The kinase aurora B has long been implicated in this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lavoie et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tada et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lavoie et al., 2002</xref>). Through activation of condensin and phosphorylation of S10 on histone H3 it is thought to promote the formation of a mitotic chromosome. However, how these pathways interacted with each other to shape mitotic chromosomes was poorly understood.</p> <p>Here, we monitored chromosome condensation in living yeast cells by using two microscopy assays, allowing us to distinguish long-range contraction of chromosomes along their longitudinal axis from short-range chromatin compaction. The first assay has been used before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Petrova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Guacci et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vas et al., 2007</xref>), but did not detect a role for histone phosphorylation during regular mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>). The second assay, introduced here, uses fluorophore quenching to show that nucleosome-nucleosome interaction via H3 phosphorylation and in an Hst2-dependent manner promotes short-range compaction of mitotic chromatin in vivo. This enhanced packing is evidenced by the increased quenching of fluorophores when the chromosome locus is decorated by multiple copies of a fluorescent reporter. The quenching effect was observed similarly well whether we used GFP or mCherry as a fluorophore, and independently of whether it was fused to TetR or to LacI. Though we cannot exclude any local effects of the repetitive nature of the TetO and LacO repeats on chromatin compaction, this novel fluorescence-based assay allows for a simple detection of chromatin compaction states. Beyond promoting chromosome segregation, the exact function of this compaction process will be interesting to address. Our studies establish that chromatin compaction does not displace DNA-associated proteins such as TetR or LacI, as a strong cleansing model would predict. Although they do not exclude that other DNA-binding factors might be removed from the DNA during this process, these data suggest that compaction might serve other functions, such as to change the biophysical properties of the chromatin fiber during segregation. Chromatin compaction might for example affect the local stiffness, elasticity and mechanical resistance of chromosomes to facilitate their decatenation, protection and movement during anaphase.</p> <p>Related to this, it is remarkable that the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutation is able to establish an Hst2-dependent and constitutive state of compaction and contraction, as evidenced by both assays, without affecting much growth and viability. We propose that this mutation strongly boosts the recruitment and activation of Hst2 all along chromosomes by mimicking the phosphorylated state of histone H3. Two models may explain how <italic>H3 S10D</italic> elicits its effects. In the first, <italic>H3 S10D</italic> might lead to hyper-activation of chromatin compaction by over-recruitment of Hst2, such that it might shorten the chromosome axis, independently of the contraction machinery. However, the following observations speak against this idea: I. crosslinking studies do not indicate that <italic>H3 S10D</italic> increases nucleosome-nucleosome interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>), II. fluorescence quenching of TetR-mCherry and LacI-GFP is not enhanced in the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>) compared with WT anaphase cells, and III. phosphorylation of H3 S10 does promote the condensin-dependent and Hst2-dependent contraction of artificially long chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, these data support an alternative model: Hst2 may stimulate condensin function, and hyper-activation of Hst2 by <italic>H3 S10D</italic> may promote this effect and thereby chromosome arm contraction. To fully distinguish between these two models it will be important to investigate the effect of the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutation on condensin loading and activity. Furthermore, it is important to note that the phenotype of the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutant cells does not seem to reflect physiological conditions taking place during regular mitoses, indicating that the fraction of Hst2 driving wild type chromosome contraction does not depend on H3 S10 phosphorylation (dashed arrow <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, left panel). Rather, it might reflect what happens when both chromosome condensation pathways are hyper-activated, for example under the presence of an artificially long chromosome or in small cells, such as cells grown on a poor carbon source (see below). In any case, it is striking that the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> strain does not show any obvious defects in growth and viability despite causing chromatin compaction and contraction throughout the cell cycle. Thus, this constitutively condensed state does not impair access and remodeling of chromatin by the transcription and replication machineries during interphase in any major manner.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10396.011</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model of chromosome condensation.</title><p>H3 S10 phosphorylation leads to chromatin fiber closure, whereas condensin is required for axial shortening.

First, this might simply be due to the fact that the anaphase nucleus is more elongated, allowing for the chromosome arm to reach its real extension without being confined in the normally spherical morphology of late anaphase or G1 nuclei. In this scenario, the apparent stretching of the chromosome in early anaphase does not correspond to any rearrangement of the chromatin or changes in contraction, and the impression that contraction follows compaction is an illusion. However, previous work has established that residual cohesion between sister chromatids persists during early anaphase and that this actually causes chromosome stretching during early segregation stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Renshaw et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harrison et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, a second model would be that maximum contraction is only reached when cohesion is fully resolved, such as to not interfere with cohesion removal. This scenario suggests that chromosome contraction indeed needs to be a late anaphase event to complete chromosome segregation, and that perhaps the compaction events that precede play an important role in facilitating cohesion resolution. This model is attractive because it might more thoroughly account for the molecular events that are actually taking place during anaphase. Understanding how these processes are regulated during early anaphase will be necessary in order to distinguish between the two models. However, one definite conclusion that we can already draw is that arm contraction and chromatin compaction undergo relaxation between late anaphase and G1, since these nuclei are not significantly different in size, and hence the effects observed are not due to confinement alone.</p> <p>Based on our data on chromosome contraction and compaction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, we propose that mitotic chromosome condensation entails at least three processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p> <p>First, a histone 3-dependent and histone 4-dependent process, which we term chromatin compaction, ensures the short-range tightening of DNA into a smaller volume via nucleosome-nucleosome interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wilkins et al., 2014</xref>). This process strictly depends on the phosphorylation of histone H3 on serine 10, and the subsequent deacetylation of lysine 16 of histone H4. Because this event has little impact on the length of condensed chromosomes, it has escaped attention until now. However, our data indicate that it is an important event for proper chromosome architecture and is an early event of every yeast mitosis.</p> <p>Second, a condensin-dependent process, termed here axial chromosome contraction, ensures the long-range contraction of the chromosome, probably by facilitating the formation of higher order chromatin structures along the chromosome axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cuylen and Haering, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxter and Aragón, 2012</xref>). This process is completed after chromatin compaction, in late anaphase, but does not strictly require it in order to proceed. Certainly, it will be interesting to clarify this order of event, to dissect how it is controlled, and to determine whether it facilitates the ordered condensation of well-separated chromosome arms. Moreover, the observation that Hst2 contributes to both processes suggests that this enzyme might be pivotal for coordinating compaction and contraction with each other. In this respect, it will be interesting to determine how Hst2 promotes the shortening of the chromosome axis, and whether it does so by directly modulating condensin function.</p> <p>Third, our data also indicate the existence of an additional, also condensin-dependent process devoted to some other aspect of chromosome organization, beyond compaction and contraction. Indeed, restoring the contraction of the chromosome along its axis in the <italic>smc2-8</italic> condensin mutant cells by mimicking constitutive H3 phosphorylation did not alleviate the temperature-dependent lethality caused by the <italic>smc2-8</italic> mutation. Furthermore, although inactivation of the deacetylase Hst2 largely abolished the axial contraction of chromosomes, <italic>HST2</italic> is not an essential gene. Hence, we suggest that the essential function of condensin is not to mediate long-range contraction. Rather, the essential function of condensin most likely relates to its roles in orchestrating the decatenation of intertwined sister-chromatids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charbin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baxter and Aragón, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baxter et al., 2011</xref>) and the re-annealing of single stranded DNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sakai et al., 2003</xref>).</p> <p>In an earlier study we demonstrated that yeast cells challenged by the presence of an exceptionally long chromosome or by being themselves exceptionally small (for example, <italic>whi3</italic> mutant cells and cells growing on a poor carbon source) possess the ability to condense chromosomes beyond wild type levels to adjust the axial contraction of long chromosomes and adapt their length to the length of the spindle, a process we termed adaptive hyper-condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>), and which we would like to rename adaptive hyper-contraction. This process depended on condensin and phosphorylation of H3 S10, this last requirement being in contrast to what is observed for the contraction of most wild type chromosomes during regular mitoses. Accordingly, single <italic>smc2-8</italic> and <italic>H3 S10A</italic> mutants failed to hyper-contract an exceptionally long chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neurohr et al., 2011</xref>). Since the <italic>H3 S10A</italic> mutation had no defect on the axial contraction of wild type chromosomes, these results indicated that adaptive hyper-contraction depended more heavily on Ipl1-dependent phosphorylation of S10 on histone H3 than regular chromosome condensation does. Thus, we propose that H3 S10 is hyper-phosphorylated on long chromosomes by Ipl1 located in the center of the spindle (midzone), boosting Hst2 and condensin activity (dotted arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our observation that mimicking S10 phosphorylation, using the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> allele, promotes axial shortening in an Hst2-dependent manner is indeed consistent with high levels of S10 phosphorylation promoting the crosstalk between compaction and contraction, via Hst2.</p> <p>It will be interesting to test how the principles laid out here function in eukaryotes with a more complex chromosome structure, such as humans. A good starting point for such investigations would be to test the effects of H3 S10 mutation and/or removal of the Hst2 homologues on such cells. How important is a tight regulation between short-range chromatin compaction and long-range chromosome contraction? How does that impact chromosome structure? And how do such mutations affect the segregation of the genetic material? Together, our work demonstrates that yeast is a powerful system to dissect the mechanisms underlying chromosome condensation and how the disruption of such mechanisms affects chromosome segregation and cell viability.</p></sec> <sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title> <sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title> <p>All yeast strains used in this study were derived from the S288c background and are described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>.

Condensin temperature-sensitive strains were grown in liquid YPD until OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.4 and then transferred to 25ºC or 37ºC for 90 min prior to imaging. For imaging, cells were resuspended in non-fluorescent medium (Synthetic Defined (SD) minus tryptophan (– TRP)) and put on an agar pad. All microscopy was done using a Deltavision microscope (Applied Precision) with a CCD HQ2 camera (Roper), 250W Xenon lamps, Softworx software (Applied Precision), and a temperature chamber set to the desired temperature. For both chromosome contraction and chromatin compaction assays, still images were taken using 750 ms exposure in the Tetramethylrhodamine (TRITC (red)) channel and 500 ms exposure time for the Fluorescein (FITC (green)) over ten Z-slices that were 0.5 μm apart. Transmission images were taken as a reference. Analysis was done using Fiji image processing software. We defined G1 cells as round cells with no bud and anaphase cells as a budded cell where the red focus leads and the green focus followed. All measurements were done in mother cells. Sum intensity projections were used and a line was drawn between the green and red foci to determine chromosome contraction. For fluorescence intensity, a Region Of Interest (ROI) was drawn around a focus and the integrated density was determined. An identically sized ROI was put in the nucleus to determine the background signal. Background intensity was subtracted from the focus intensity to yield the fluorescent intensity for a given focus. For the example cell in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, 1-hr long movies were taken using slightly modified conditions: 300 ms FITC exposure, 500ms TRITC exposure and eight Z-stacks that were 0.5μm apart. FRET was done using the same microscope described above. First the FRET channel was recorded using 500 ms exposure in the FITC channel while capturing emission in the TRITC channel. Then, excitation and emission in TRITC was recorded using 500 ms of exposure time. Analysis was done by drawing a ROI around the fluorescent focus in both channels, subtracting the background and determining the ratio between them. At least 50 cells were measured for all conditions. For Ipl1 inactivation, exponentially growing cells were arrested with alpha-factor according to standard protocols and released at 25°C or 35°C. To obtain G1 condensation, cells were released for 5 min, to obtain anaphase condensation cells were released for approximately 2 hr at the indicated temperatures before imaging.</p> <p>Nuclear diameters were determined by imaging Nup170-GFP as described above and by using Fiji image processing software.</p> <p>DAPI staining was performed by growing cells of a given strain to OD<sub>600</sub> &lt; 1.0 in YPD at 25°C, then two new diluted cultures were made at OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.2. One of them was again put at 25°C, while the other was kept at 33°C for 90 min. Cells were harvested by 90 s centrifugation in a 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube at 650 RCF. Cells were resuspended in 1 ml 70% ethanol, left to fix for 7 min, spun down again and washed in 1 ml sterile water, before being resuspended in 3–5 µl Phosphate Buffered Saline (PBS) containing 0.5 µg/ml DAPI. Cells were prepared on a glass slide and imaged by using the DAPI channel with 300 ms exposure. Transmission images were taken for reference.

The nuclei of the crosslinked samples were isolated and then the histones further purified by acid extraction.

Cells were again grown at permissive temperature for 2 hr and the arrest efficiency was monitored by microscopy (arrest stopped when &gt;95% of the cells entered G1 based on morphology). Cells were washed with YPD and then expanded into YPD (without pBPA). At release time zero, nocodazole was added to a final concentration of 1.5 μg/mL and shifted to the restrictive temperature of 37°C. Proper cell arrest and synchronization was monitored by FACS.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Jim Kadonaga (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p> <p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p> <p>Summary:</p> <p>Two of the three referees were enthusiastic about the imaging based approach to study chromosome compaction and axial contraction, while referee 3 was critical of some aspects of your experimental design. Referees 1 and 3 also raised questions about the statistical significance of some of your experiments, which are in points 1 and 4 of referee 3's detailed comments. Referees 2 and 3 have articulated important experimental controls and 1-2 additional experiments that will strengthen your study. The referee comments are attached verbatim.</p> <p>Essential revisions:</p> <p>In looking through the comments, it appears that there are only 4-5 points for which experiments are required (those in the comments of referee 2 and 3). These are all necessary to be performed to establish and strengthen your model fully. The super-resolution study that referee 1 suggests is not essential, but if you have STORM or PALM data, in particular, available you may add it to the revision. It is clear that SIM may not be a great improvement over your Deltavision acquired data with appropriate image analysis.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p> <p>This manuscript by Barral and colleagues addresses a fundamental question in chromosome biology, i.e. of the mechanism of chromosome condensation during mitosis. The authors use a clever microscopy based assay to investigate two different processes that contribute to condensation, i.e. of short-range compaction and axial contraction. Compaction, they show, clearly involves histone-histone interactions and is not perturbed in condensin mutants. By contract, axial contraction involves condensin (this was known previously), but they find a new role Hst2 deacetylase in modulating condensin function. They propose a pathway in which two synergistic arms contribute to chromosome condensation during mitosis.</p> <p>While I find the approach very unique and the conclusions interesting, the statistics in many of the figures make me wonder how significant the various measurements are, especially of the intensities and distance measurements.</p> <p>I support publication, but would like the following major issue addressed.</p> <p>With tremendous advances in light microscopy, perhaps they can increase the resolution and intensity measurement/counting using either a SIM (increases resolution to 125 nm) or even better STORM/PALM, which further increases resolution.</p> <p>While this may sound excessive, this sort of approach is becoming very routine and even getting one data set in wild-type cells for fluorescence intensity difference between G1 and anaphase and similarly the cell cycle dependent differences between <italic>LYS1</italic> and <italic>TRP1</italic> loci will go a long way to convince readers of this important mechanism arrived at using a novel strategy. I want to stress that the intention is not to make the authors repeat the entire study using super-resolution, but to at least set the stage so that we can be sure about the conclusions made using microscopy approaches that do not allow imaging in high resolution.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p> <p>Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of H3S10 recruits the deacetylase Hst2, which deacetylates H4K16, and promotes the interaction between H2A and H4, a key mechanism in chromatin compaction. The authors have now developed an ingenious method to monitor chromosome compaction by monitoring fluorescence proteins localized to the TetO or LacO arrays, which show quenching when chromatins become compact. Using this tool, they show that condensin is dispensable for chromosome compaction, but indispensable for chromosome contraction. On the other hand, the pathway required for chromosome compaction is mostly indispensable for chromosome contraction. Thus, the authors propose that there are two mechanisms of mitotic chromosome condensation in budding yeast; one is the chromatin compaction mediated by nucleosome-nucleosome interaction, and the other is chromosome contraction mediated by condensin. Most experiments are well controlled and the conclusions are interesting. However, there are some aspects of the paper that weaken the overall story and that could be improved.</p> <p>1) This manuscript has resolved important issues regarding chromosome condensation regulated by aurora B/Ipl1 in budding yeast. However, it is peculiar that the authors neither analyzed nor mention the contribution of Ipl1 to chromosome compaction/contraction. In fact, the authors previously mention that 'ipl1 inactivation did not abolish anaphase condensation in general (Science, 332, 465-468, 2011)'. How do they reconcile the model shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) with the previous description? This issue should be addressed, probably by performing additional experiments to examine compaction and contraction under ipl1 inactive conditions.</p> <p>2) This manuscript stresses the importance of H3S10 phosphorylation by aurora B, although the <italic>H3S10A</italic> mutant shows defects only in compaction. In the final model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the authors suggest that aurora B regulates chromosome contraction through condensin. In fact, condensin phosphorylation by aurora B and its requirement for anaphase condensation has been demonstrated in fission yeast and humans (Tada et al. Nature 2011). Also in budding yeast, Lavoie et al. (Gene Dev 2004) reported the importance of Ipl1 for anaphase condensation. These papers would be cited in the context of the authors' own results.</p> <p>3) The previous report indicated that Hst2 recruitment to nucleosomes is dependent on <italic>H3S10p</italic>, and acts in the deacetylation of H4K16 and chromosome compaction. Importantly, the H3S10A mutation causes defects only in chromosome compaction, but not in contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Curiously, <italic>H3S10D</italic> (and recruited <italic>Hst2</italic>) not only sustains compaction, but also restores contraction defects caused by a condensin mutation. These facts cannot be reconciled with the authors' interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). I assume that although <italic>H3S10D</italic> might cause artificial overloading of Hst2, its loading is usually limited in wild type cells; <italic>H3S10p</italic>-independent (or residual) Hst2 may act in the condensin contraction pathway.</p> <p>4) It is not clear what happens in <italic>H3S10D</italic>. What happens in <italic>H4∆9-16 H3S10D</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?</p> <p>5) Please examine <italic>H4K16R</italic> and <italic>H4K16Rhst2</italic>∆ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and 6. These experiments will clarify the effect of compaction (but not deacetylation) on contraction.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p> <p>The manuscript of Kruitwagen et al. exploits budding yeast to examine the contributions of short-range nucleosome compaction and long-range condensin-dependent chromosome contraction. By assessing changes in compaction and contraction in mutants defective in condensin and histone modification, the authors conclude that compaction and contraction happen at different times in the cell cycle and suggest potential different modes of regulation. The topic of chromosome condensation in mitosis is important, as chromosome structure in mitosis remains one of the major unanswered questions in biology. Much of the work here seems to corroborate a previous paper published by Wilkins et al. in Science, including the role of H3 and H4 modification in nucleosome compaction, and the role of H3 S10 and Hst2 in nucleosome compaction and chromosome contraction. In addition the manuscript has some important technical and experimental issues that need to be addressed.</p> <p>1) The authors use an unusual assay to assess compaction, the reduction in fluorescence of TetR-mCherry and LacO-GFP bound to operator arrays between G1 and late anaphase cells. Many possible explanations exist for changes in fluorescence, one of which is compaction. Others include changes in chromatin composition or structure other than compaction that would be equally affected by histone modification. For example, the reduction in fluorescent signal in anaphase is not nearly as pronounced at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus as it is at the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus. No statistical significance is given to the small drop in fluorescence at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus. This difference between loci opens up the possibility that the reduction in signal at <italic>TRP1</italic> represents histone-dependent modification of a special feature of the pericentromere region and/or the kinetochore that is well documented by the Bloom lab. The key to believing these modifications represent global change in nucleosome compaction comes from the UV cross-linking experiment of H2-H4. But the recovery of this crosslink is very inefficient. This poor recovery may reflect inefficiencies of the method as the authors have suggested previously, or that the crosslinks are constrained to a small region of the genome, like the unusual pericentric structure.</p> <p>2) The measurement of chromosome contraction using differentially marked loci on chromosome IV is also technically flawed. It is important to remember that yeast undergoes a closed mitosis such that the nuclear envelope constrains the ability of sequences to separate in space. In G1-metaphase the nucleus is a small ball, which prevents the chromosomes from extending. During anaphase, the nucleus elongates with the elongating spindle before returning to a small ball in late anaphase. As chromosomes are dragged during anaphase in all organisms, they lag behind the centromere and are stretched. In yeast with the elongated nucleus this stretching can manifest itself. When the nucleus shrinks the chromosomes become more confined again. This pattern fits the kinetics of spot separation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> exactly. Thus it is unclear whether the kinetics of contraction is meaningful, that is the apparent additional contraction in anaphase from that already in anaphase is real. This worry challenges their conclusion that nucleosome compaction precedes contraction. It would also be important to know that whether the small changes in distances between spots reflects a difference in nuclei morphology due differences in the time of the cell cycle. The authors could include a marker for the nuclear envelope.</p> <p>3) The authors state, &quot;As expected from previous studies (Neurohr et al., 2011; Lavoie, B. D., Hogan, E., and Koshland), the mutations <italic>H3 S10A</italic> and <italic>H4 Δ9-16</italic> did not impair anaphase contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), establishing that phosphorylation of H3 S10 and H4/H2A interactions are not necessary for axial contraction of chromosomes. In contrast, however, the <italic>hst2∆</italic> mutation did abrogate the proper contraction of the chromosome during mitosis.&quot; Yet this same first author is an author on a previous publication (2014) that states: &quot;Both HST2 inactivation and the H3 S10A mutation impaired this process to the same extent, either alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).&quot; These results appear contradictory.</p> <p>4) The authors also conclude that yeast does not cleanse TetR or LacO based upon a failure to see an increase in background fluorescence. If a very small percentage of TetR-mCherry is associated with chromosomes, one is very unlikely to see a change in the background fluorescence if half of it is removed in anaphase. Without a measure of the fraction of the pool in the nucleus that has bound TetR-mCherry this experiment is meaningless.</p> <p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p> <p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Axial contraction and short-range compaction of chromatin synergistically promote mitotic chromosome condensation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, (Mohan Balasubramanian) is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining textual issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below.</p> <p>As you will see, two of the original three referees raise minor points to do with: 1) deleting some of the kinetic analyses of chromosome contraction (referee 3) and 2) making the model figure clear and also streamlining the manuscript to clarify the role of H3 S10 phosphorylation (referee 2).</p> <p>These should not take you very long and we will be pleased to accept the further revised version.</p> <p>Please see the referees' minor comments below.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p> <p>The authors appear to have addressed most of the points I raised in the initial round of review. I still have, however, one major issue.</p> <p>The authors' interpretation concerning the <italic>H3S10D</italic> phenotype is now under question. I agree that <italic>H3S10D</italic> over-recruits Hst2. Although this mutant restores chromosome contraction in some assays, there is no defect in physiological chromosome contraction in the <italic>H3S10A</italic> mutant in which Hst2 is not recruited by H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Therefore, it is most likely that <italic>H3S10D</italic> causes either 'over compaction', which by itself somewhat shortens the axis length, or artificial enhancement of the condensin-dependent contraction. The latter case is now properly represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (left panel) by adding a new Hst2 out of <italic>H3S10p</italic>. This pool of Hst2 might be artificially supplied when <italic>H3S10D</italic> is expressed. Therefore, the current results do not provide any evidence to support the notion that 'H3S10 phosphorylation is involved in condensin regulation', at least under physiological conditions. This point is very confusing throughout the manuscript. I strongly recommend that the arrows in (<italic>H3S10p</italic>) Hst2 --&gt; condensin --&gt; contraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (left panel) be removed, as well as the related content in the text. Instead, I agree that the simple model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (right panel) that clarifies the concept of compaction (by H3S10 phosphorylation) and contraction (by condensin), which act synergistically to form a properly condensed chromosome.</p> <p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p> <p>The authors have significantly strengthened the manuscript, having addressed many of the important issues.</p> <p>However they missed the point of the criticism about the analyzing the kinetics of chromosome contraction. The authors clearly have shown that they observe differences in contraction between late anaphase and G1 cells that are independent of nuclear morphology. However, they have not shown that the apparent longer distances between their arrays in early and mid-anaphase, which they assume to be less contraction, are not a consequence of changes in nuclear morphology. The chromosome stretching during chromosome movement may reveal the real distance between the arrays along the chromosome axis. When confined to a small round nucleus the distances between the arrays represent the shortest distance between arrays on bent chromosomes. In other words if one could make early and mid-anaphase cells that have small round nuclei like late anaphase and G1 cells, the distances between the arrays would shrink and be the same as late anaphase cells, all of which would be shorter than G1 cells. So contraction is greater in late anaphase than G1 as the authors contend but it is also equally greater in early anaphase and mid anaphase than G1. If so, contraction is happening at the onset of early anaphase concurrent with compaction and not later than it. I can't think of a way for the authors to address this nuclear morphology issue that really dramatically hinders any conclusion from this experimental strategy about contraction in early and mid-anaphase. However this kinetic analysis is really a side embellishment of the major points of the manuscript and as such deleting this section will not detract from the manuscript.</p></body> </sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10396.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub> <body><p>Reviewer #1:</p> <p><italic>This manuscript by Barral and colleagues addresses a fundamental question in chromosome biology, i.e. of the mechanism of chromosome condensation during mitosis.

To investigate this variability, we followed individual dividing cells and measured the fluorescence intensity at the LacO/LacI-GFP locus (which was more resistant to photobleaching than the TetO/TetR-mCherry focus). The result of this experiment is now shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> of our revised manuscript.

I want to stress that the intention is not to make the authors repeat the entire study using super-resolution, but to at least set the stage so that we can be sure about the conclusions made using microscopy approaches that do not allow imaging in high resolution.</italic> </p> <p>Indeed, super resolution microscopy could be a way to confirm and gain more insight into the specific structures that underlie, in particular, chromatin compaction. The reviewer mentions three “standard” methods that can be used. For PALM, specific antibodies against, in our case, TetR- mCherry or LacI-GFP could be applied. Indeed, we have tried this in the past (unpublished) to visualize equivalent TetO-containing chromatin using PALM, but we encountered technical problems that would require significant optimization. Thus, this approach currently lies beyond the scope of this manuscript. STORM could be a great, equivalent, method, given that we construct the required photo-switchable or -activatable TetR fusion proteins. However, so far we have not been successful with using STORM in yeast cells either. Given the nature of this method, however, we predict that we would not see an increase in fluorophore-quenching in anaphase, since homo-fluorophores are not excited at the same time anymore. It can only be used as a method to measure the size of the LacO and TetO loci and test whether they indeed compact during anaphase. This might already be tested using SIM, which is currently available to us.</p> <p>Thus, we fixed cells and used an in-house Applied Precision OMX Blaze to visualize LacO/LacI- GFP foci. Indeed, we observed that anaphase foci are dimmer and smaller than their G1 counterparts. However, upon careful analysis of the intensity profile, we observed that these still reflect a simple Gaussian distribution. Thus, the resolution provided by SIM is probably not sufficient to measure the size of the locus and compare between G1 and anaphase. Furthermore, the highly processive nature of the image reconstruction might result in artifacts when combined with quenching. Based on this preliminary experiment we conclude that the changes in fluorescence loci caused by chromatin compaction cannot be resolved by SIM, but rather require optimization of STORM/PALM. We are sorry that we cannot provide the analysis wished by the reviewer at this stage.</p> <p>Reviewer #2:</p> <p><italic>Previous studies have shown that phosphorylation of H3S10 recruits the deacetylase Hst2, which deacetylates H4K16, and promotes the interaction between H2A and H4, a key mechanism in chromatin compaction. The authors have now developed an ingenious method to monitor chromosome compaction by monitoring fluorescence proteins localized to the TetO or LacO arrays, which show quenching when chromatins become compact.

On the other hand, the pathway required for chromosome compaction is mostly indispensable for chromosome contraction. Thus, the authors propose that there are two mechanisms of mitotic chromosome condensation in budding yeast; one is the chromatin compaction mediated by nucleosome-nucleosome interaction, and the other is chromosome contraction mediated by condensin. Most experiments are well controlled and the conclusions are interesting. However, there are some aspects of the paper that weaken the overall story and that could be improved. 1) This manuscript has resolved important issues regarding chromosome condensation regulated by aurora B/Ipl1 in budding yeast. However, it is peculiar that the authors neither analyzed nor mention the contribution of Ipl1 to chromosome compaction/contraction. In fact, the authors previously mention that 'ipl1 inactivation did not abolish anaphase condensation in general (Science, 332, 465-468, 2011)'. How do they reconcile the model shown here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) with the previous description? This issue should be addressed, probably by performing additional experiments to examine compaction and contraction under ipl1 inactive conditions.</italic> </p> <p>In our previous work (Neurohr et al., 2011), Ipl1 was inactivated shortly before anaphase onset by switching cells containing the <italic>ipl1-321</italic> temperature sensitive allele to the restrictive temperature accordingly. With this protocol, we observed a minor and actually insignificant defect in wild type chromosome contraction (whereas the contraction of the artificially long chromosome was significantly decreased). We now used the same strain, but inactivated Ipl1 throughout mitosis, i.e. shifted the cells to the restrictive temperature while they were still in G1. Strikingly, this resulted in a significant failure in both chromosome compaction and contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>), as reported before (Lavoie et al., 2004).</p> <p>These data indicate that for normal sized, wild type chromosomes, Ipl1 promotes condensation (compaction and condensation) prior to anaphase onset, probably during prophase and/or metaphase. This is in fact suggests that there are intermediate steps between Ipl1 function in early mitosis and the actual process of full condensation, which is most obvious during anaphase. Therefore, our data suggest that Ipl1 functions essentially in priming chromosomes for condensation. Subsequently, a second step downstream of Ipl1 is required to implement actual chromosome contraction and this second step can be temporally separated from the initial step (i.e. pro/metaphase and early anaphase). For example, the phosphorylation of condensin by Ipl1 may contribute to its loading or prime it for activation, whereas its phosphorylation by Cdk1 might delay its full activation for its role in chromosome contraction (Robellet et al., 2015). In such a scenario, full contraction would rely on Ipl1 activity in metaphase and activation of FEAR, activation of Cdc14 and condensin dephosphorylation on its Cdk1 sites during anaphase. In this scenario, the effects of mutating the Cdk1 sites in condensin might reflect consequences of premature activation rather than lack of activation.</p> <p><italic>2) This manuscript stresses the importance of H3S10 phosphorylation by aurora B, although the</italic> H3S10A <italic>mutant shows defects only in compaction. In the final model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), the authors suggest that aurora B regulates chromosome contraction through condensin. In fact, condensin phosphorylation by aurora B and its requirement for anaphase condensation has been demonstrated in fission yeast and humans (Tada et al. Nature 2011). Also in budding yeast, Lavoie et al. (Gene Dev 2004) reported the importance of Ipl1 for anaphase condensation. These papers would be cited in the context of the authors' own results.</italic> </p> <p>The reviewer is right. These citations are now incorporated in the Introduction and Discussion.</p> <p><italic>3) The previous report indicated that Hst2 recruitment to nucleosomes is dependent on H3S10p, and acts in the deacetylation of H4K16 and chromosome compaction. Importantly, the H3S10A mutation causes defects only in chromosome compaction, but not in contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Curiously, H3S10D (and recruited Hst2) not only sustains compaction, but also restores contraction defects caused by a condensin mutation. These facts cannot be reconciled with the authors' interpretation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). I assume that although H3S10D might cause artificial overloading of Hst2, its loading is usually limited in wild type cells; H3S10p-independent (or residual) Hst2 may act in the condensin contraction pathway.</italic> </p> <p>We fully agree with the reviewer’s interpretation of the data, and it is in fact what we aimed to suggest in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. While H3 S10 phosphorylation has no role in chromosome contraction in the majority of WT mitoses, <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutant cells indeed show constitutively condensed chromosomes and this depends on Hst2 activity. <italic>H3 S10D</italic> in fact suppresses the effect of the <italic>smc2-8</italic> mutation in condensin, through a yet unknown mechanism, which depends on Hst2. We indeed suggest that increased activation of Hst2 in the <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutant cells hyper-activates the (crippled) condensin or acts in a still unidentified contraction pathway.</p> <p>As the reviewer proposes, our data indicate that only a fraction of H3 S10 is phosphorylated in most WT mitoses, and some Hst2 must be indeed recruited to chromatin independently of H3 S10 phosphorylation to promote chromosome contraction. This was certainly not evident in our previous model figure, which we have amended to clarify this point.</p> <p>Lastly, in the presence of an artificially long chromosome, such as in Neurohr et al. (2011), we propose that increased phosphorylation of H3 S10 by Ipl1 on the midzone boosts up the activation of Hst2 on that chromosome beyond regular levels, promoting its further contraction to fit it into the spindle. We have clarified the Results and Discussion sections regarding these issues.</p> <p><italic>4) It is not clear what happens in H3S10D. What happens in H4∆9-16 H3S10D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>?</italic> </p> <p>See below.</p> <p><italic>5) Please examine H4K16R and H4K16R hst2∆ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and 6. These experiments will clarify the effect of compaction (but not deacetylation) on contraction.</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewer for raising these points, which together raise the issue of whether acetylated K16 of H4 is the main target of Hst2 upon H3 S10 phosphorylation, in which case <italic>H4∆9-16</italic> should bypass the effect of <italic>H3 S10D</italic> and <italic>H4 K16R</italic> should bypass the compaction phenotype of the <italic>hst2</italic>∆ mutation but not its contraction phenotype. Due to the organization of the histone loci in budding yeast, constructing the <italic>H4∆9-16 H3 S10D</italic> is challenging and we have therefore addressed the issue by focusing on characterizing the <italic>H4 K16R hst2</italic>∆ double mutant.</p> <p>From our original data, it was already clear that the <italic>H4 K16</italic> acetylation alone does not affect chromosome contraction, which still takes place normally in the <italic>H4 ∆9-16</italic> mutant cells.</p> <p>Supporting this idea further, the <italic>H4 K16R hst2</italic>∆ double mutant does not contract its chromosome IV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that deacetylation of K16 on H4 is not sufficient to restore contraction in the <italic>hst2</italic>∆ mutant cells. Thus, we conclude that: 1) H4 deacetylation has no evident effects on chromosome contraction and 2) that Hst2, when deleted, does not have its defects on chromosome contraction through the chromatin compaction pathway, but rather by acting on another factor in the contraction pathway.</p> <p>The picture is more complex for what concerns chromosome compaction. Indeed, unlike in the <italic>H4 K16R</italic> single mutant fluorescence intensity at the TetO/TetR-mCherry focus remained continuously high over the cell cycle in the <italic>H4 K16R hst2</italic>∆ double mutant cells, analogous to what is observed in the <italic>hst2</italic>∆ single mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This implies that Hst2 promotes chromatin compaction not solely through deacetylation of K16 on H4 but also through additional downstream targets. The nature of these targets is not known at this stage but could include K8 and K12 on H4. Addressing the role of these residues and identifying possible additional targets of Hst2 will be the focus of further studies.</p> <p>Reviewer #3:</p> <p><italic>The manuscript of Kruitwagen et al. exploits budding yeast to examine the contributions of short-range nucleosome compaction and long-range condensin-dependent chromosome contraction. By assessing changes in compaction and contraction in mutants defective in condensin and histone modification, the authors conclude that compaction and contraction happen at different times in the cell cycle and suggest potential different modes of regulation. The topic of chromosome condensation in mitosis is important, as chromosome structure in mitosis remains one of the major unanswered questions in biology. Much of the work here seems to corroborate a previous paper published by Wilkins et al. in Science, including the role of H3 and H4 modification in nucleosome compaction, and the role of H3 S10 and Hst2 in nucleosome compaction and chromosome contraction. In addition the manuscript has some important technical and experimental issues that need to be addressed. 1) The authors use an unusual assay to assess compaction, the reduction in fluorescence of TetR-mCherry and LacO-GFP bound to operator arrays between G1 and late anaphase cells. Many possible explanations exist for changes in fluorescence, one of which is compaction. Others include changes in chromatin composition or structure other than compaction that would be equally affected by histone modification. For example, the reduction in fluorescent signal in anaphase is not nearly as pronounced at the LYS4 locus as it is at the TRP1 locus. No statistical significance is given to the small drop in fluorescence at the LYS4 locus. This difference between loci opens up the possibility that the reduction in signal at TRP1 represents histone-dependent modification of a special feature of the pericentromere region and/or the kinetochore that is well documented by the Bloom lab. The key to believing these modifications represent global change in nucleosome compaction comes from the UV cross-linking experiment of H2-H4. But the recovery of this crosslink is very inefficient. This poor recovery may reflect inefficiencies of the method as the authors have suggested previously, or that the crosslinks are constrained to a small region of the genome, like the unusual pericentric structure.</italic> </p> <p>We thank the reviewer very much for raising this important question. To address whether the <italic>TRP1</italic> locus reflects a specialized chromatin region that is not representative for the whole chromosome, we analyzed the fluorescence intensity of LacO/LacI-GFP at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus in the middle of the chromosome arm more carefully. Though it might compact slightly less than <italic>TRP1,</italic> we still observe a significant difference in fluorescence intensity between G1 and anaphase cells at the <italic>LYS4</italic> locus. Furthermore, analysis of the LacO/LacI-GFP brightness in the <italic>H3 S10A, H3 S10D, hst2</italic>∆ and <italic>H3 S10D hst2</italic>∆ single and double mutants confirms that H2A/H4 interactions are also required to compact this <italic>CEN4</italic> distal locus. These data indicate that chromatin compaction is taking place over the whole chromosome. They are now added to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> where they extend the TetO/TetR-mCherry data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. However, since the anaphase specific quenching is not as strong as it is at the <italic>CEN4</italic> proximal <italic>TRP1</italic> locus, we do not exclude that the specialized chromatin domain around centromeres reaches a tighter compaction state during mitosis.</p> <p><italic>2) The measurement of chromosome contraction using differentially marked loci on chromosome IV is also technically flawed. It is important to remember that yeast undergoes a closed mitosis such that the nuclear envelope constrains the ability of sequences to separate in space. In G1-metaphase the nucleus is a small ball, which prevents the chromosomes from extending. During anaphase, the nucleus elongates with the elongating spindle before returning to a small ball in late anaphase. As chromosomes are dragged during anaphase in all organisms, they lag behind the centromere and are stretched. In yeast with the elongated nucleus this stretching can manifest itself. When the nucleus shrinks the chromosomes become more confined again. This pattern fits the kinetics of spot separation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> exactly. Thus it is unclear whether the kinetics of contraction is meaningful, that is the apparent additional contraction in anaphase from that already in anaphase is real. This worry challenges their conclusion that nucleosome compaction precedes contraction. It would also be important to know that whether the small changes in distances between spots reflects a difference in nuclei morphology due differences in the time of the cell cycle. The authors could include a marker for the nuclear envelope.</italic> </p> <p>To address the possible role of nuclear morphology in chromosome condensation, we measured the nuclear diameter in G1 and late anaphase nuclei in WT and <italic>hst2</italic>∆ conditions. We failed to observe any significant difference between G1 and anaphase in either strain. If anything, late anaphase nuclei tended to be a bit bigger than their G1 counterparts, rather opposing than facilitating chromosome condensation. Thus, we conclude that nuclear morphology during mitosis is not a major determinant of the distance measured between <italic>TRP1</italic> and <italic>LYS4</italic> in <italic>WT</italic> cells. Rather, these data support the conclusion that this distance reflects changes in axial chromosome contraction, as suggested by the numerous studies that have relied on this assay by now.</p> <p><italic>3) The authors state, &quot;As expected from previous studies (Neurohr et al., 2011; Lavoie, B. D., Hogan, E., and Koshland), the mutations H3 S10A and H4 Δ9-16 did not impair anaphase contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>), establishing that phosphorylation of H3 S10 and H4/H2A interactions are not necessary for axial contraction of chromosomes. In contrast, however, the hst2∆ mutation did abrogate the proper contraction of the chromosome during mitosis.&quot; Yet this same first author is an author on a previous publication (2014) that states: &quot;Both HST2 inactivation and the H3 S10A mutation impaired this process to the same extent, either alone or in combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).&quot; These results appear contradictory.</italic></p> <p>It is important to note the differences between the wild type situation investigated in the presentstudy, where we have looked exclusively at regular chromosomes, and the study to which the reviewer is referring in which we characterized specifically the effect of Hst2 and H3S10 on the contraction of an artificially long chromosome, such as those constructed by Neurohr et al. (2011). Indeed, the 2014 study focused on the phenomenon of adaptive hypercondensation.</p> <p>Therefore, the differences pointed out by the reviewer between the data obtained in the present study and those reported in the 2014 paper reflect how much hypercondensation is a phenomenon distinct from regular chromosome organization. Regular chromosomes do not depend on H3 S10Ph to contract, whereas the artificially long chromosome does. We showed that adaptive hypercondensation depends on the anaphase activity of the Ipl1 kinase, its midzone localization, H3 S10Ph and on Hst2 function (Neurohr et al., 2011; Wilkins et al., 2014), whereas regular condensation relies on metaphase activity of Ipl1, and Hst2 function. We propose that, in the case of a longer chromosome, more H3 S10 is phosphorylated by midzone Ipl1 in anaphase, which leads to an increased activation of Hst2. As explained in our response to reviewer 2 (point 3), we propose that increase Hst2 activity on chromatin leads to activation of its substrates in the contraction pathway, such as perhaps condensin. In any case, the long chromosome depends more heavily on H3 S10 phosphorylation, compared to WT chromosomes. To clarify these points, we added some explanations to the Discussion section regarding the difference between regular chromosome condensation and adaptive hypercondensation.</p> <p><italic>4) The authors also conclude that yeast does not cleanse TetR or LacO based upon a failure to see an increase in background fluorescence. If a very small percentage of TetR-mCherry is associated with chromosomes, one is very unlikely to see a change in the background fluorescence if half of it is removed in anaphase. Without a measure of the fraction of the pool in the nucleus that has bound TetR-mCherry this experiment is meaningless.</italic> </p> <p>In order to address this issue, we determined that the fraction of bound TetR-mCherry in G1 cells is 0.19. Given this number, it would indeed be difficult to measure any significant change in background fluorescence in the case of cleansing with our current microscopy setup. We therefore thank the reviewer for this useful insight and have removed these data from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and changed the text accordingly.</p> <p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p> <p><italic>As you will see, two of the original three referees raise minor points to do with: 1) deleting some of the kinetic analyses of chromosome contraction (referee 3) and 2) making the model figure clear and also streamlining the manuscript to clarify the role of H3 S10 phosphorylation (referee 2).</italic> </p> <p><italic>These should not take you very long and we will be pleased to accept the further revised version. Please see the referees' minor comments below.</italic> </p> <p>Reviewer #2:</p> <p><italic>The authors appear to have addressed most of the points I raised in the initial round of review. I still have, however, one major issue.</italic> </p> <p><italic>The authors' interpretation concerning the H3S10D phenotype is now under question. I agree that H3S10D over-recruits Hst2. Although this mutant restores chromosome contraction in some assays, there is no defect in physiological chromosome contraction in the H3S10A mutant in which Hst2 is not recruited by H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6A</xref>). Therefore, it is most likely that H3S10D causes either 'over compaction', which by itself somewhat shortens the axis length, or artificial enhancement of the condensin-dependent contraction. The latter case is now properly represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (left panel) by adding a new Hst2 out of H3S10p. This pool of Hst2 might be artificially supplied when H3S10D is expressed. Therefore, the current results do not provide any evidence to support the notion that 'H3S10 phosphorylation is involved in condensin regulation', at least under physiological conditions. This point is very confusing throughout the manuscript. I strongly recommend that the arrows in (H3S10p) Hst2 --&gt; condensin --&gt; contraction in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (left panel) be removed, as well as the related content in the text. Instead, I agree that the simple model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (right panel) that clarifies the concept of compaction (by H3S10 phosphorylation) and contraction (by condensin), which act synergistically to form a properly condensed chromosome.</italic> </p> <p>The reviewer is right that there are two ways to explain the constitutive contraction phenotype of <italic>H3 S10D</italic> mutant cells and both depend on hyper-recruitment of Hst2. On the one hand, over-compaction by maximum nucleosome-nucleosome interaction could start to show its effects in contraction, independently of the contraction pathway. On the other hand, Hst2 might activate components of the chromosome contraction pathway (such as condensin). Our current and past experimental data speak against over-compaction since (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">1</xref>) TetO and LacO foci are not dimmer in <italic>H3 S10D</italic> strains as compared to WT, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2</xref>) there is not more crosslinking between H4 and H2A in an <italic>H3 S10D</italic> strain as compared to WT (Wilkins et al., 2014) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">3</xref>) H3 S10 phosphorylation, through Hst2, was shown to be required for adaptive hyper-condensation (Neurohr et al., 2011 and Wilkins et al., 2014). Since our data is supportive of Hst2 and condensin being in the same genetic pathway, we favor the idea that Hst2 might promote condensin activation through a yet unknown mechanism. However, it is crucial to realize, as the reviewer does, that the over-recruitment of Hst2 observed in <italic>H3 S10D</italic> strains is not relevant for the vast majority of yeast mitoses. Rather, this scenario becomes relevant in the case of smaller yeast nuclei and/or larger yeast chromosomes that require an additional burst of chromosome condensation. We included a new section to the Discussion to address these points.</p> <p>Reviewer #3:</p> <p><italic>The authors have significantly strengthened the manuscript, having addressed many of the important issues. However they missed the point of the criticism about the analyzing the kinetics of chromosome contraction. The authors clearly have shown that they observe differences in contraction between late anaphase and G1 cells that are independent of nuclear morphology. However, they have not shown that the apparent longer distances between their arrays in early and mid-anaphase, which they assume to be less contraction, are not a consequence of changes in nuclear morphology. The chromosome stretching during chromosome movement may reveal the real distance between the arrays along the chromosome axis. When confined to a small round nucleus the distances between the arrays represent the shortest distance between arrays on bent chromosomes. In other words if one could make early and mid-anaphase cells that have small round nuclei like late anaphase and G1 cells, the distances between the arrays would shrink and be the same as late anaphase cells, all of which would be shorter than G1 cells. So contraction is greater in late anaphase than G1 as the authors contend but it is also equally greater in early anaphase and mid anaphase than G1. If so, contraction is happening at the onset of early anaphase concurrent with compaction and not later than it. I can't think of a way for the authors to address this nuclear morphology issue that really dramatically hinders any conclusion from this experimental strategy about contraction in early and mid-anaphase. However this kinetic analysis is really a side embellishment of the major points of the manuscript and as such deleting this section will not detract from the manuscript.</italic> </p> <p>We apologize for not recognizing this issue in the first set of reviewers’ comments. The reviewer suggests that especially in early anaphase nuclear morphology might play a bigger role in chromosome condensation, since the chromosomes are less constrained in their movement due to a bigger nuclear volume, naturally causing the TetO-LacO distance to be high, though contraction is already present. Although we definitely consider nuclear morphology to play a role in chromosome extension during the early stages of anaphase, we do not think that this is the only factor contributing to it. Specifically, it has been shown that residual arm cohesion in the early stages of anaphase can cause chromosomes to stretch out during exactly this stage (Harrison et al., 2009 and Tanaka et al., 2010). We believe that this phenomenon is causing the very high TetO-LacO distance in early anaphase cells and would like to propose that initiating contraction too early (i.e. in early in stead of late anaphase) might lead to defects in chromosome segregation. However, to properly address this issue the activity of the compaction and contraction machinery in these cell cycle stages would have to be determined with an alternative method. We have discussed these models and their implications in the Discussion and thank the reviewer for these constructive comments.</p></body> </sub-article></article>
