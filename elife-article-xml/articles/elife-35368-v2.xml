However, the mechanism by which epigenetic change impacts aging remains to be understood. H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone modification signifying transcriptional repression, is marked and maintained by Polycomb Repressive Complexes (PRCs). Here, we explore the mechanism by which age-modulated increase of H3K27me3 impacts adult lifespan. Using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we reveal that aging leads to loss of fidelity in epigenetic marking and drift of H3K27me3 and consequential reduction in the expression of glycolytic genes with negative effects on energy production and redox state. We show that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRCs-deficiency promotes glycolysis and healthy lifespan. While perturbing glycolysis diminishes the pro-lifespan benefits mediated by PRCs-deficiency, transgenic increase of glycolytic genes in wild-type animals extends longevity. Together, we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging and that stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetic drift</kwd><kwd>H3K27me3</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>metabolic

characterized by the progressive decline in cellular and organismal functions that lead to reduction of fitness and increased risks to diseases and death. Epigenetic alterations in histone modification represent a prominent hallmark of aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sen et al., 2016</xref>). Chromatin and epigenetic complexes that modify histones regulate the accessibility of DNA to transcriptional machinery, thereby permitting direct control of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>). Previous studies have established that changes in histone markings, such as acetylation on histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dang et al., 2009</xref>), trimethylation on histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2017</xref>), and trimethylation on histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> substantially impact adult lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sen et al., 2015</xref>). Polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs), including PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shao et al., 1999</xref>) and PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kuzmichev et al., 2002</xref>), are important histone-modifying enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müller et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Saurin et al., 2001</xref>) that are evolutionally conserved from the worm to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Whitcomb et al., 2007</xref>). Tri-methylated histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3) denotes transcriptional silencing, which is produced by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czermin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Müller et al., 2002</xref>) and functionally maintained by PRC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2002</xref>). Although mutation in the H3K27me3 demethylase couples an increase of H3K27me3 with longevity in <italic>C.elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maures et al., 2011</xref>), reducing H3K27me3 by heterozygous mutation in the H3K27me3 methyltransferase results in lifespan extension in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ni et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Siebold et al., 2010</xref>). Hence, it remains unclear whether the life-benefit phenotype is due to manipulation of specific genes or modulatory effect of H3K27me3. Importantly, H3K27me3 levels are known to increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2014</xref>); however, the manner by which H3K27me3 epigenome changes over the course of lifespan and its consequent impact on the progression of aging have not been addressed.</p><p>Metabolic homeostasis is intimately connected with aging and lifespan regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">López-Otín et al., 2016</xref>). Glucose is the dominant provider of energy for cells. Glycolysis, the first step in the breakdown of glucose to extract energy in the form of ATP for cellular metabolism, is present in all cellular organisms and critical for life. The anti-aging effect of caloric restriction correlates with a metabolic feature of limiting glucose metabolism including a reduction of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feuers et al., 1989</xref>). On the other hand, glycolysis is essentially involved in a wide-range of biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okamoto et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</xref>). It is unclear, however, how the beneficial outcome of restricting glucose metabolism and glycolysis as a result of caloric restriction could be reconciled with the essential role of glycolysis during normal adult lifespan. Strikingly, decreased brain glucose metabolism is present prior to the onset of clinic symptoms in individuals at risk of Alzheimer's disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cunnane et al., 2011</xref>). Since aging is the most significant factor for human neurodegenerative diseases, it is important to better understand how glycolysis is modulated with age and whether modulation of glycolytic process could impact adult lifespan.</p><p>Mounting evidence associates aging with epigenetic, transcriptional, and metabolic alterations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">López-Otín et al., 2013</xref>), yet how these processes are integrated into the regulation of adult physiology is only beginning to be revealed. Although epigenetic effects could potentially elicit broad regulatory mechanisms, it remains to be determined whether epigenetic modulations are simply associated with aging or directly contribute to transcriptional and metabolic modulations that profoundly impact adult lifespan. Here, using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we discover that adult-onset fidelity loss results in epigenetic drift of H3K27me3, which in turn impinges on the transcription and metabolism of the glycolytic pathway. Our data presented in this study are consistent with the model that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to at least a subset of age-associated phenotypes and limit lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Moreover, we reveal that a reduction of H3K27me3 by PRC2-deficiency stimulates glycolysis and healthy lifespan. Our study proposes that, during natural aging, stimulation of glycolysis promotes metabolic health and longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Adult-onset fidelity loss results in epigenetic drift of H3K27me3</title><p>H3K27me3 is a signature histone modification, but its dynamics at the epigenome level during aging has not been studied. To characterize H3K27me3 during aging, we examined the level of H3K27me3 in muscle by western blot and revealed an age-associated increase in wild-type (WT) flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To quantitatively profile H3K27me3, we adapted the chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) followed by high-throughput DNA sequencing with reference exogenous genome method (ChIP-Rx) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonhoure et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Orlando et al., 2014a</xref>) in fly muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We generated H3K27me3 epigenome profiles in adult flies of 3, 15, and 30d. In addition, we also sampled embryo, larvae, and pupae to examine H3K27me3 epigenome profiles during development. Surprisingly, despite the fact that H3K27me3 levels increased with age, H3K27me3 peak profiles in the aging adult remained largely unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In a sharp contrast, H3K27me3 signals during developmental stages showed dramatic gain or loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This evidence highlights a distinct, yet unknown mechanism of H3K27me3 modification that occurs during aging.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35368.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Adult-onset fidelity loss results in epigenetic drift of H3K27me3.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H3K27me3 peak profiles are comparable between young and aged animals. A scatter plot (top panel) of 331 peaks and a genome browser mini-view (bottom, left panel) illustrated that H3K27me3 had comparable peak profiles between young and aged animals.

We used bootstrapping to generate the mean reference-adjusted ChIP intensity of peak genes or inter-peak genes (10,000 draws with replacement of n = 500). Violin plots represent the bootstrapped mean H3K27me3 level of inter-peak genes (left) and peak genes (right) at 3d, 15d, and 30d. In aging flies, inter-peak genes gained relatively more signal (15d: 36.4%, 30d: 48.4%) than peak genes (15d: 9.4%, 30d: 13.3%). Net gain of H3K27me3 signals during aging was calculated by a subtraction of the mean signal intensity between aged and 3d. Bootstrapped 95% confidence intervals: 3d inter-peak genes: [0.758, 1.017]; 15d inter-peak genes: [1.023, 1.401]; 30d inter-peak genes: [1.149, 1.562]; 3d peak genes: [3.349, 3.739]; 15d peak genes: [3.681, 4.075]; 30d peak genes: [3.817, 4.230].

Scatter plots demonstrated that H3K27me3 signals in WT clearly had an adult-onset, progressive increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). To further characterize H3K27me3 dynamics, we sorted individual genes into peak genes (1141 genes) according to the peak regions and genes therein covered (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for peak regions and included genes) or inter-peak genes (16370 genes). In aging WT flies, despite a genome-wide increase, we noted that inter-peak genes gained relatively more signals than those of peak genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To quantify the H3K27me3 marks gained specifically during aging, we subtracted the signals of 3d from those of older age points. Genome browser views illustrated that subtracted signals propagated along the chromosome, showing no direct correlation with pre-existing peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We then extended this analysis to the entire epigenome. Modification in flies that were 3d old was predominantly biased at the peaks, with approximately 323% more signals as compared to the inter-peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). In contrast, the signals acquired during aging were only about 9% more at the peaks than those at the inter-peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), suggesting that there was a dramatic shift in the pattern of H3K27me3 modification in aging. Altogether, analysis of H3K27me3 aging dynamics implicates a strong selection on peak regions compared to inter-peak regions when animals are young; however, adult-onset modification of H3K27me3 becomes less biased at the peak regions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A CRISPR/Cas9 deficiency screen identifies the role of PRCs in aging</title><p>Given that above study indicated a new feature of H3K27me3 dynamics at the epigenome level during adult lifespan, we further explored the roles of epigenetic pathways in the aging process via an unbiased deficiency-based genetic screen.

In addition, it was still possible that life-extension might be due to manipulations of individual genes, but not linked to the epigenetic change of H3K27me3. We further examined pairwise combinations of PRC2 double mutants in trans-heterozygosity.

This finding, together with above results obtained by untargeted metabolomics, provides definitive evidence that glycolysis is modulated by aging. Since metabolites of the citric acid cycle are mix lineages from glycolysis, glutamate, and fatty acids, each metabolite may contain multiple <sup>13</sup>C-labeled isotopologues via glycolysis-derived reactions as well as recurrent cycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>).

Our study provides a new paradigm by which epigenetic drift of H3K27me3, a highly conserved histone mark, links glycolysis to healthy longevity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I</xref>). Though H3K27me3 levels have been shown to increase with age in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sun et al., 2014</xref>) and flies (current study), the epigenomic feature of such changes is unknown. Our quantitative assessment shows that aging couples with a decline of fidelity in H3K27me3 modification, as demonstrated by a genome-wide drift of this repressive mark. Concomitant to this drift, glycolytic genes are downregulated, which in turn causes a reduction of glycolysis and glucose metabolism. Importantly, the age-delaying effect of PRCs-mutation likely arises from its ability to slow down or reverse this trend. Therefore, we suggest that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3, enhanced by its age-modulated increase, is one of the molecular mechanisms that drive the progression of aging. Expression of <italic>Tpi</italic> and <italic>Pgi</italic> of glycolytic genes is inherently regulated by the alterations of H3K27me3 levels, as shown by their corresponding changes during natural aging, in <italic>utx</italic> mutants as well as in PRCs-deficiency. We propose that H3K27me3 dynamics may elicit changes in local chromatin environment—especially inter-peak regions that are potentially more sensitive to the gain or loss of the epigenetic mark—thus enabling fine-tuning of target gene expression.</p><p>It is unclear how aging might promote the drift in H3K27me3 modification. One possible reason is age-associated DNA damage that reduces the fidelity of epigenetic markings. It has been well-established that aging is associated with the accumulation of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lu et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, UV-C irradiation can induce the increase of H3K27me3 mediated by PRC2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, on the other hand, the increase and redistribution of H3K27me3 can be induced by the loss of H3K9 methyltransferase complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Basenko et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, dysregulation of H3K27me3 may be due to feed-forward interactions between DNA damage and changes in the levels of complexes that control epigenetic markings during aging.</p><p>Metabolic control has emerged as a critical player to determine the aging outcome. Previous data implicates that impairing glycolysis can extend lifespan perhaps by triggering compensatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Schulz et al., 2007</xref>). Quantitative proteomic analysis in mouse heart shows that aging correlates with an increased abundance of proteins in glycolysis, and that caloric restriction and rapamycin treatment known to extend longevity can reverse this trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dai et al., 2014</xref>). D-Glucosamine supplementation that impairs glucose metabolism can extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Weimer et al., 2014</xref>). However, rat models supplemented with 2-deoxyglucose, a known anti-glycolytic compound, are instead short-lived (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Minor et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, glucose-enriched diet can prevent pathophysiological decline and early death of telomere dysfunctional mice by stimulating glucose metabolism including glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Missios et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, recent evidence from studies on a wide range of species suggests that a balanced diet from protein to carbohydrate and their interactive effects are key elements for healthy longevity. Mouse dietary studies have demonstrated that animals fed on diets that are low in protein and high in carbohydrate enjoy longer life with lower blood pressure, improved glucose tolerance and lipid profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Solon-Biet et al., 2014</xref>). This is also supported by human data on the deleterious effects of diets with high protein and low-carbohydrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Floegel and Pischon, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lagiou et al., 2012</xref>). Hence, the impact of glucose metabolism including glycolysis on natural aging might be poised to integrate age-associated physiology; the precise outcome must be rather complicated, which could be influenced not only by diverse spatiotemporal need in normal or pathological conditions, but also upon newly evolved biological activities correlated with the increased complexity from nematode to <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals. It is important to note that since our study is based on <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatic tissues that are primarily post-mitotic cells in adult animals, it is possible that the effects are more dominant in the fly model than others. Our findings in <italic>Drosophila</italic> propose that, during natural aging, the ability to maintain glycolysis is an alternative avenue to ensure a healthy level of physical capability by delaying the bioenergetic decline with advanced age as which otherwise might form a vicious cycle from decrease in physical activity to hypometabolism, and perhaps disease susceptibility.</p><p>Aging is a complex process that can be regulated by a network of multiple mechanisms. It has been well-established that enhancing NAD<sup>+</sup> biogenesis promotes healthy lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Balan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mills et al., 2016</xref>). As noted, supplementation of NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors profoundly elevates energy metabolism by increasing the expression of genes in the TCA cycle as well as glycolysis in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mouchiroud et al., 2013</xref>), and promotes glucose metabolism with increased flux through pentose phosphate and glycolytic pathways in mice on a high-fat diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mitchell et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, it would be interesting to test whether the life-benefit effects of NAD<sup>+</sup> might be through at least in part by the activation of glycolysis. Intriguingly, while declining intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and thus increased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> ratio correlate with aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>), our experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrate that increased ratios of GSH/(GSH +GSSG) and NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> due to enhanced glycolytic activities may provide a simple but effective way to retard aging. The oxidative phosphorylation, although produces more ATP than glycolysis, can yield intracellular ROS. The accumulation of ROS is the leading proposed cause of decline in cellular function and integrity in aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, modulating H3K27me3 may reprogram bioenergetic decline during aging, which in effect reduces cellular damage and deterioration. Importantly, mammalian glycolytic genes have also been shown as PRCs targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brookes et al., 2012</xref>). Future investigations, including in-depth comparative analysis of PRCs and glycolytic pathway in the aging process in both flies and humans, may harness common operative mechanisms that modulate metabolic homeostasis and healthy longevity. Given the reversible nature of epigenetic pathways, this study proffers a tempting strategy against age-associated physiological decline and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Kevin Struhl (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Matt Kaeberlein (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Adrienne Wang (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Overall, the referees appreciated the novelty and importance of the work and the provocative new hypotheses suggested. Several major concerns were noted, however, that should be addressed before publication. Many of these concerns involve more thorough integration of these studies within the existing literature and a discussion of how the results fit, or in some cases run counter to, prevailing models for aging. In particular, this study is limited in that it may be unique to <italic>Drosophila</italic>. While the reviewers found the data to be credible, the proposed model does contradict data in other organisms regarding the importance of glycolysis in aging (large body of CR literature, work from Ristow in worms and mice https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4563) and is directly contradicting the current thinking about NAD/NADH ratio and aging. The authors at least need to acknowledge these contradictions and the possibility that this is a private mechanism of aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that will not be conserved in other organisms. Unless they have data to suggest that this is a conserved mechanism of aging, in which case it is strongly recommended that they add it to the paper.</p><p>There is also a striking absence of discussion of prior literature related to epigenetic marks modulating aging and lifespan in yeast and worms. The studies from Shelley Berger's lab showing that histone acetylation impact aging in yeast should be discussed, as should the work from Anne Brunet and others in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and in stem cells, some of which specifically deals with H3K27me3. The authors need to put their work into context with the prior literature rather than ignoring it. To claim that this study shows that H3K27me3 is a &quot;new mechanism that drives the progression of aging&quot; would seem an overstatement in light of the prior literature in this area. As another example of missing literature, the authors completely ignore a study by the Rabinovitch group in which quantitative proteomics was used to characterize age-related changes in the heart proteome and in which glycolytic enzymes were shown to increase with age, while calorie restriction was shown to decrease the abundance of these enzymes, promoting health of this tissue (Dai et al., 2014).</p><p>The referees also felt that in many cases, the data were over-interpreted. For example, the subsection “Long-lived PRC2 Mutants Diminish the Epigenetic Drift of H3K27me3 During Aging”, ends with 'Combined, our study implicates that the life-extension effect of PRC2-mutation likely arises from its ability to mitigate the drifting of H3K27me3 during aging.' At this point in the paper, it has only been shown that PRC2 mutants live longer and that they have reduced H3K27me3 levels. A functional or causal connection between these phenotypes has not been established, and the conclusion is thus not valid. There are many other instances of such over-interpretation, and the authors need to edit the text significantly to more conservatively and accurately interpret the results.</p><p>In addition, there are a few experimental studies, additional statistical analyses, and additional textual changes that were considered to be essential for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is the lack of detail on the collection, processing, and statistical analysis of the large datasets. It is therefore difficult to evaluate how rigorous the analysis of these data was. Raw datasets (for example FPKM tables for the RNAseq results, as well as cohort data for the lifespan studies – for which statistical analysis is wholly missing) should be made available to evaluate the data. Further consultation with a statistician before resubmission is highly recommended.</p><p>2) A majority of the results are based on muscle samples, but the authors occasionally use head-specific samples throughout the manuscript. Though both tissues have high energy demand, their regulation of metabolism is very different. This is something that should be acknowledged in the manuscript. In particular, since epigenetic marks are very cell-type dependent, a clearer characterization and description of epigenetic changes specifically in muscle and brain tissue is warranted. Based on the Materials and methods section, the data was acquired from muscle, but later RNAseq studies also include the brain. Tissue-specificity needs to be clearly described and if transcriptome or metabolomic data from brain is used, then the ChIPseq data should be obtained from brain as well.</p><p>3) The metabolomics data raises important unresolved questions that could be addressed. The authors measured a total of 151 metabolites. This likely represents far less than the total metabolome found in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The size of their dataset is critical in drawing inference about the key pathways that are associated with lifespan. The authors do look specifically for changes in the TCA cycle, but might there be other equally predictive pathways associated with metabolism that are not represented here given the small number of metabolites measured overall? What happens to TCA intermediates? (ATP levels are down, suggesting glycolysis is the main source of ATP, but this isn't actually measured. What happens to oxphos activity/efficiency? What is happening to the PPP pathway?</p><p>4) How does the global loss of PRC2 affect the developmental establishment of H3K27me3 patterns (i.e. do certain marks never get established in the first place? It is mentioned that 'global occupancy of H3K27me3 between wt and age-matched PRC2 mutants was highly preserved', but the correlation coefficient is only 0.77, suggest that there are significant changes in certain loci that are being ignored). A more acute depletion of PRC2 in the adult, for example by RNAi would be useful to analyze its effects specifically on aging-related pattern changes. It would also be important to acutely deplete PRC1 to assess the specificity of the PRC2 effects. And to perturb both PRC1 and PRC2 to establish whether the establishment and/or maintenance of epigenetic marks is affected by age. It is shown that PRC1 mutants have extended lifespan but no changes in H3K27me3, and this discrepancy with PRC2 mutants is ignored – if PRC1 mutants are also long-lived, it seems likely that the longevity effects are not caused by changes in H3K27me3.</p><p>5) As this paper is reliant upon accurate metabolic analysis, and the levels of protein and sugar in <italic>Drosophila</italic> food have documented effects on lifespan and metabolism, the authors should specify the &quot;standard&quot; food their flies are reared on.</p><p>6) Given that the authors are studying changes that occur with aging, age is an important factor for the interpretation of most of the figures. Throughout the manuscript, there are many places where age of samples used is not explicitly stated, or is unclear – for example, the samples used for the transcriptomic analysis.</p><p>7) The authors show that down-regulation of these PRC2-mediated glycolytic genes blocks the lifespan extension seen in PRC2 mutants, thus establishing that the mechanism of lifespan extension by PRC2 is at least partially reliant upon glycolysis.

Several major concerns were noted, however, that should be addressed before publication. Many of these concerns involve more thorough integration of these studies within the existing literature and a discussion of how the results fit, or in some cases run counter to, prevailing models for aging. In particular, this study is limited in that it may be unique to Drosophila. While the reviewers found the data to be credible, the proposed model does contradict data in other organisms regarding the importance of glycolysis in aging (large body of CR literature, work from Ristow in worms and mice https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4563) and is directly contradicting the current thinking about NAD/NADH ratio and aging. The authors at least need to acknowledge these contradictions and the possibility that this is a private mechanism of aging in Drosophila that will not be conserved in other organisms. Unless they have data to suggest that this is a conserved mechanism of aging, in which case it is strongly recommended that they add it to the paper.</p><p>There is also a striking absence of discussion of prior literature related to epigenetic marks modulating aging and lifespan in yeast and worms. The studies from Shelley Berger's lab showing that histone acetylation impact aging in yeast should be discussed, as should the work from Anne Brunet and others in C. elegans and in stem cells, some of which specifically deals with H3K27me3. The authors need to put their work into context with the prior literature rather than ignoring it. To claim that this study shows that H3K27me3 is a &quot;new mechanism that drives the progression of aging&quot; would seem an overstatement in light of the prior literature in this area. As another example of missing literature, the authors completely ignore a study by the Rabinovitch group in which quantitative proteomics was used to characterize age-related changes in the heart proteome and in which glycolytic enzymes were shown to increase with age, while calorie restriction was shown to decrease the abundance of these enzymes, promoting health of this tissue (Dai et al., 2014).</p><p>The referees also felt that in many cases, the data were over-interpreted. For example, the subsection “Long-lived PRC2 Mutants Diminish the Epigenetic Drift of H3K27me3 During Aging”, ends with 'Combined, our study implicates that the life-extension effect of PRC2-mutation likely arises from its ability to mitigate the drifting of H3K27me3 during aging.' At this point in the paper, it has only been shown that PRC2 mutants live longer and that they have reduced H3K27me3 levels. A functional or causal connection between these phenotypes has not been established, and the conclusion is thus not valid. There are many other instances of such over-interpretation, and the authors need to edit the text significantly to more conservatively and accurately interpret the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the significance of the work and the impact to the field. Given the scope of our data, we have now changed the title of the manuscript into: Epigenetic Drift of H3K27me3 in Aging Links Glycolysis to Healthy Longevity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We appreciate the issue raised by the reviewer. In the revised manuscript, we have substantially re-written the background and Discussion to better fit into and further advance our current understanding of aging.</p><p>In Abstract: we have edited as follows: “we propose that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to aging”</p><p>In Introduction: we have re-written as follows:</p><p>“Previous studies have established that changes in histone markings, such as acetylation on histone H4 at lysine 16 (H4K16ac) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Dang et al., 2009), trimethylation on histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Han et al., 2017), and trimethylation on histone H3 at lysine 36 (H3K36me3) in <italic>S. cerevisiae, C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> substantially impact adult lifespan (Pu et al., 2015; Sen et al., 2015).”</p><p>“Though mutation in the H3K27me3 demethylase couples an increase of H3K27me3 with longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Jin et al., 2011; Maures et al., 2011), reducing H3K27me3 by heterozygous mutation in the H3K27me3 methyltransferase results in lifespan extension in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (Ni et al., 2012; Siebold et al., 2010). Hence, it remains unclear whether the life-benefit phenotype is due to manipulation of specific genes or modulatory effect of H3K27me3.”</p><p>“Our data presented in this study are consistent with the model that epigenetic drift of H3K27me3 is one of the molecular mechanisms that contribute to at least a subset of age-associated phenotypes and limit lifespan in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.”</p><p>In Discussion:we have re-written as follows:</p><p>“Quantitative proteomic analysis in mouse heart shows that aging correlates with an increased abundance of proteins in glycolysis, and that caloric restriction and rapamycin treatment known to extend longevity can reverse this trend (Dai et al., 2014). D-Glucosamine supplementation that impairs glucose metabolism can extend lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and mouse (Weimer et al., 2014).”</p><p>“It is important to note that since our study is based on <italic>Drosophila</italic> somatic tissues that are primarily post-mitotic cells in adult animals, it is possible that the effects are more dominant in the fly model than others.”</p><p>“Aging is a complex process that can be regulated by a network of multiple mechanisms. It has been well-established that enhancing NAD<sup>+</sup> biogenesis promotes healthy lifespan (Anderson et al., 2002; Balan et al., 2008; Mills et al., 2016). […] Intriguingly, while declining intracellular NAD<sup>+</sup> and thusincreased NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> correlate with aging (Zhu et al., 2015), our experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> demonstrate that increased ratios of GSH/(GSH<sup>+</sup>GSSG) and NADH/NAD<sup>+</sup> due to enhanced glycolytic activities may provide a simple but effective way to retard aging.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is the lack of detail on the collection, processing, and statistical analysis of the large datasets. It is therefore difficult to evaluate how rigorous the analysis of these data was. Raw datasets (for example FPKM tables for the RNAseq results, as well as cohort data for the lifespan studies – for which statistical analysis is wholly missing) should be made available to evaluate the data. Further consultation with a statistician before resubmission is highly recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for lack of clarity in presentation of our work. In the revised manuscript, we have added statistic method next to the figure panels and the figure legends; the Materials and methods section also includes more details, including data collection, processing, and statistical analysis.</p><p>Both raw and processed data files of ChIP-seq and RNA-seq experiments have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession number: GEO:GSE96654, the following secure token has been created to allow review of record GSE96654 while it remains in private status: adotmsqctzerxol). A detailed lifespan data, including fly number, lifespan curve, median and 10% survival, and statistics, is provided in Supplementary file 2.</p><p>Dr. Zhandong Liu, a co-author of the manuscript, is an expert in biostatistician and now an assistant professor at the Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, USA, who helped to oversee the procedures of data processing and analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A majority of the results are based on muscle samples, but the authors occasionally use head-specific samples throughout the manuscript. Though both tissues have high energy demand, their regulation of metabolism is very different. This is something that should be acknowledged in the manuscript. In particular, since epigenetic marks are very cell-type dependent, a clearer characterization and description of epigenetic changes specifically in muscle and brain tissue is warranted. Based on the Materials and methods section, the data was acquired from muscle, but later RNAseq studies also include the brain. Tissue-specificity needs to be clearly described and if transcriptome or metabolomic data from brain is used, then the ChIPseq data should be obtained from brain as well.</p></disp-quote><p>For each experiment, we have carefully labeled tissue types used next to the figure panel, in the text and figure legends. Moreover, we have profiled H3K27me3 using dissected heads of <italic>Pcl</italic><sup>c421</sup><italic>Su(z)12</italic><sup>c253</sup> mutants and their age-matched WT controls, as shown in revised Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1. Similar to what we have noted in muscle, our data shows that H3K27me3 in heads has age-associated increase and drift during normal aging in WT animals, and that this shift is partially diminished by PRC2-mutation.</p><p>To find transcriptional change of particular genes that might play a dominant role in PRC2-dependent life-extension, we compared RNA-seq datasets derived from PRC2 mutants in both head and muscle tissues. This analysis led us to narrow down to two glycolytic genes, <italic>Tpi</italic> and <italic>Pgi</italic>, whose expressions were upregulated in both tissue types in all long-lived PRC2 mutants. For untargeted metabolomics and metabolic flux experiments, we used dissected heads to avoid metabolic features carried over from the food residues in the trachea or the gut. For measurement of specific metabolites, we used dissected muscles. Our data consistently supports our conclusion that glycolysis is modulated with age and in PRC2-deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The metabolomics data raises important unresolved questions that could be addressed. The authors measured a total of 151 metabolites. This likely represents far less than the total metabolome found in Drosophila. The size of their dataset is critical in drawing inference about the key pathways that are associated with lifespan. The authors do look specifically for changes in the TCA cycle, but might there be other equally predictive pathways associated with metabolism that are not represented here given the small number of metabolites measured overall? What happens to TCA intermediates? (ATP levels are down, suggesting glycolysis is the main source of ATP, but this isn't actually measured. What happens to oxphos activity/efficiency? What is happening to the PPP pathway?</p></disp-quote><p>For the metabolomics data set, about 20,000 metabolic features were detected in total, including adducts and isotopes corresponding to the unique metabolite ID. Approximately 30% of metabolic features with MS/MS spectrum were obtained using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) based untargeted metabolomics approach. Among all putatively characterized metabolites, 151 metabolites matched against our standard library were accurately identified with the highest confidence level (Level 1) according to Metabolomics Standards Initiative (MSI). The standard library for spectral match consists of 830 metabolites covering a majority of metabolism pathways in KEGG database. Therefore, the metabolites identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> samples are unbiased benefiting from the relative comprehensive library. It is important to note that, in addition to unbiased metabolic analysis, we also have metabolic flux experiment (Figure 6 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2) in which we observed no consistent change in the metabolites of the TCA cycle with age and in PRC2-deficiency, which was in line with constant levels of metabolites as measured by untargeted metabolomics as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1B. RNA-seq experiments of individual long-lived PRC2 mutants found no consistent changes in the expression of genes mediating pentose phosphate pathway (PPP), citric acid cycle, and oxidative phosphorylation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, Supplementary file 4). These data together led us to conclude that expression and metabolism of the glycolytic pathway is affected with age and in PRC2-deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) How does the global loss of PRC2 affect the developmental establishment of H3K27me3 patterns (i.e. do certain marks never get established in the first place? It is mentioned that 'global occupancy of H3K27me3 between wt and age-matched PRC2 mutants was highly preserved', but the correlation coefficient is only 0.77, suggest that there are significant changes in certain loci that are being ignored).</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that our data was based on studying heterozygous mutation of PRC2 genes, in which H3K27me3 modification, despite at a reduced level, remained operative in mutant animals. In Figure 3A, Circos plot of the H3K27me3 epigenome illustrates peak profiles that are highly preserved with age and in PRC2 mutants.</p><p>As noted by Liu et al. (Liu et al., 2011) and a web-based application called Cistrome (http://cistrome.org/ap/root) therein described, the correlation coefficient between +0.7 and +1.0 can be interpreted as strong positive correlation. Nevertheless, we agree with reviewers that we cannot fully rule out the possibility that unknown H3K27me3 targets might be affected by PRC2-deficiency. Thus we have modified the sentence to read as follows: “Interestingly, global occupancy of H3K27me3 between WT and age-matched PRC2 mutants was preserved, as demonstrated by the comparable patterns of peak profiles and genes known to be H3K27me3-modified (pair-wise Pearson correlation coefficients ≥0.77) (Figure 3A, Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and 1C), though we cannot rule out the possibility that certain H3K27me3 targets might be altered.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A more acute depletion of PRC2 in the adult, for example by RNAi would be useful to analyze its effects specifically on aging-related pattern changes. It would also be important to acutely deplete PRC1 to assess the specificity of the PRC2 effects. And to perturb both PRC1 and PRC2 to establish whether the establishment and/or maintenance of epigenetic marks is affected by age.</p></disp-quote><p>To knockdown PRC1/2 factors specifically in the adult, we have explored two methods. First, we fed flies with available chemical compounds targeting mammalian PRC2 genes (compound ID: GSK343, GSK503, GSK126, EPZ6438, EPZ5687, UNC1999, and EI1 from Selleck Chemicals, USA). Unfortunately, none of these compounds showed inhibitory effect against <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRC2 counterpart, as evidenced by their inability to decrease H3K27me3 levels. Alternatively, we combined adult-onset Gal4 driver (<italic>geneswitch</italic>-GAL4 promoter that can be induced by feeding adult flies with RU486) with pUAST-transgene expressing double stranded RNA against PRC1/2 genes. One RNAi line that we have carefully tested was THU0754 (Tsinghua University, China) against <italic>Su(z)12</italic> gene. Induction of this RNAi line caused 20% decrease of <italic>Su(z)12</italic> mRNAas compared to <italic>geneswitch</italic>-GAL4 control.However, for the lifespan experiment, we surprisingly noted that <italic>geneswitch</italic>-GAL4 flies alone had a dramatically shortened lifespan, to about 65% that of WT animals. Induction of <italic>Su(z)12</italic> RNAi had a modest 10% lifespan extension than <italic>geneswitch</italic>-GAL4 control animals. Though this experiment may seem supportive, we hesitated to further interpret this result because <italic>geneswitch</italic>-GAL4 alone and perhaps RU486 feeding have already induced strong, confounding aging phenotypes. We feel that there is something quite interesting about the adult-specific deletion of PRC1/2, although to resolve this is beyond the scope of the current studies. It is worth to note, however, that fly behaviors and lifespan phenotypes are particularly sensitive to genetic background. We highlight that <italic>all</italic> fly lines used in our studies have been either isogenized or directly generated in the control background 5905 (Flybase ID FBst0005905, <italic>w1118</italic>). These include altogether 29 new site-specific gene mutations as described in Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is shown that PRC1 mutants have extended lifespan but no changes in H3K27me3, and this discrepancy with PRC2 mutants is ignored – if PRC1 mutants are also long-lived, it seems likely that the longevity effects are not caused by changes in H3K27me3.</p></disp-quote><p>While PRC2 complex is required for H3K27me3 modification, PRC1 complex is generally involved in maintenance of the silencing status. Our data that PRC1-deficiency has no effect in H3K27me3 levels is consistent with a prior study by Tie et al., where they observed no detectable change in H3K27me3 upon knockdown of <italic>Polycomb</italic> gene of the PRC1 complex (Tie et al., 2016). As a result, our CRISPR/Cas9 mutagenesis screen identifies longevity genes functionally related to H3K27me3, including factors of PRC2 in establishing H3K27me3 marks and PRC1 in maintenance of H3K27me3-led repressive function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) As this paper is reliant upon accurate metabolic analysis, and the levels of protein and sugar in Drosophila food have documented effects on lifespan and metabolism, the authors should specify the &quot;standard&quot; food their flies are reared on.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this. We have detailed the food receipt in the method. Briefly, standard <italic>Drosophila</italic> food contains sucrose (36g/L), maltose (38g/L), yeast (22.5g/L), agar (5.4g/L), maizena (60g/L), soybean flour (8.25g/L), sodium benzoate (0.9g/L), methyl-p-hydroxybenzoate: (0.225g/L), propionic acid (6.18ml/L), and ddH<sub>2</sub>O to make up 1L of the food.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Given that the authors are studying changes that occur with aging, age is an important factor for the interpretation of most of the figures. Throughout the manuscript, there are many places where age of samples used is not explicitly stated, or is unclear – for example, the samples used for the transcriptomic analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this. For each experiment, we have now carefully labeled age of the samples used next to the figure panel, in the main text and figure legends as appropriate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The authors show that down-regulation of these PRC2-mediated glycolytic genes blocks the lifespan extension seen in PRC2 mutants, thus establishing that the mechanism of lifespan extension by PRC2 is at least partially reliant upon glycolysis. However, the extent to which downregulation of these genes blocks the PRC2-mediated lifespan extension is unclear from the text and without referring to supplementary figures. As there was only partial reduction of lifespan by knocking down glycolytic genes in comparison to WT, it indicates that other mechanisms might be in play mediating lifespan in this model. This should be explicitly addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this, and we have added RT-qPCR data in Figure 8—figure supplement 1E and 1J, for <italic>Tpi</italic><sup>c511</sup> and <italic>Pgi</italic><sup>c392</sup>, respectively. We would like to clarify that since homozygous <italic>Tpi</italic><sup>c511</sup> or <italic>Pgi</italic><sup>c392</sup> had a pre-adult lethality, we could only combine <italic>Tpi</italic><sup>c511</sup> heterozygote or <italic>Pgi</italic><sup>c392</sup> heterozygote with <italic>Pcl</italic><sup>c421</sup><italic>Su(z)12</italic><sup>c253</sup>, another trans-heterozygote double mutants, and evaluated the adult phenotypes by using the triple mutants. This genetic experiment, though showing partial rescue effects, supports our conclusion that perturbing glycolysis by genetic mutation diminishes longevity traits in PRC2 mutants. However, we agree with reviewers that we cannot fully rule out the possibility that other mechanisms might be in play in mediating lifespan in this model. Thus we have modified the sentence to read as follows: “These data implicate that perturbing glycolysis by genetic mutation diminishes longevity traits in PRC2 Mutants.

For the same purpose, Liu et al. used 1.5cm that was sufficient to characterize the climbing ability (Liu et al., 2012).</p></body></sub-article></article>
