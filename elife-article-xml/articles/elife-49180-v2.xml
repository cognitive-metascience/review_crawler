muscle contraction. Studies of this synapse have contributed to our understanding of synapse assembly and pathological mechanisms of neuromuscular disorders. Nevertheless, underlying mechanisms of NMJ formation was not well understood. To this end, we took a novel approach – studying mutant genes implicated in congenital myasthenic syndrome (CMS). We showed that knock-in mice carrying N88K, a prevalent CMS mutation of Rapsyn (Rapsn), died soon after birth with profound NMJ deficits. Rapsn is an adapter protein that bridges AChRs to the cytoskeleton and possesses E3 ligase activity. In investigating how N88K impairs the NMJ, we uncovered a novel signaling pathway by which Agrin-LRP4-MuSK induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Rapsn, which is required for its self-association and E3 ligase activity. Our results also provide insight into pathological mechanisms of CMS.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuromuscular junction</kwd><kwd>congenital myasthenic syndrome</kwd><kwd>acetylcholine receptor</kwd><kwd>Rapsyn</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS082007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS090083</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG051510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund13"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Veterans Health Administration office of Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1/01IB001020A</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mei</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund14"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG45781</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wen-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund15"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AG060997</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Wen-Cheng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Asparagine 88 to lysine (N88K), a prevalent congenital myasthenic syndrome mutation of Rapsyn, impairs the neuromuscular junction by disrupting agrin signaling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a synapse between motoneurons and muscle fibers. At vertebrate NMJs, motor nerve terminals release acetylcholine (ACh), which activates ACh receptors (AChRs) concentrated on postsynaptic membranes to initiate muscle contraction. The concentration of AChR at postsynaptic membrane requires Agrin, a factor released from motoneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McMahan, 1990</xref>), which binds to LRP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) to activate MuSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeChiara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glass et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jennings et al., 1993</xref>). Downstream effector of MuSK is believed to be Rapsn, a cytoplasmic protein that is required for AChR clustering and NMJ formation. Rapsn, discovered as a peripheral membrane protein associated with AChRs in the electric organ of Torpedo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cohen et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Neubig and Cohen, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Porter and Froehner, 1985</xref>), colocalizes with AChRs at developing as well as adult NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Froehner et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Noakes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sealock et al., 1984</xref>). It could induce AChR clusters in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Froehner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Phillips et al., 1991</xref>); <italic>Rapsn</italic> null mutant mice die soon after birth without AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gautam et al., 1995</xref>), indicating a critical role in NMJ formation. Being a classic adapter protein, Rapsn is thought to bridge the AChR to the cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Apel et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartoli et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maimone and Merlie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyazawa et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramarao et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramarao and Cohen, 1998</xref>). We showed recently that Rapsn possesses E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>). Mutation of a cysteine residue necessary for the E3 ligase activity impairs its ability to cluster AChRs in vitro and to form NMJs in knock-in mice, suggesting that Rapsn may also be a signaling molecule. Nevertheless, how signal is transduced from upstream molecules such as Agrin-LRP4-MuSK to Rapsn, remains unclear, a glaring gap in our understanding of NMJ formation.</p><p>Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMSs) are a heterogeneous group of NMJ diseases caused by mutations of genes of NMJ structure and function proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel and Sine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hantaï et al., 2004</xref>). Based on the primary deficits, CMSs could be classified into presynaptic, postsynaptic, and synaptic cleft-associated groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel and Sine, 2005</xref>). A majority of CMS cases, ~75%, involve mutations of genes encoding proteins for postsynaptic development or function; and among them, mutations in AChR subunits and Rapsn are prevalent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Engel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Engel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Engel and Sine, 2005</xref>). Although more than thirty genes have been identified in CMS patients, mouse models to mimic such mutations are rare. Hence underlying pathological mechanisms remain not well understood. Presently, about 40 mutations in the <italic>Rapsn</italic> gene have been identified in patients with CMSs, accounting for 15% of total CMS cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dunne and Maselli, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Maselli et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maselli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Müller et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ohno and Engel, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohno et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ohno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yasaki et al., 2004</xref>). Of them, the N88K (asparagine 88 to lysine) mutation is the most common (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2003</xref>). About 90% of Rapsn-related CMS patients carry N88K mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Burke et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2003</xref>). Patients are either homozygous for N88K or heteroallelic for N88K with another <italic>Rapsn</italic> mutation. Pathological examination of patient specimens revealed attenuated or fragmented AChR clusters and reduced Rapsn protein, and altered junctional folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maselli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohno et al., 2002</xref>). In severe cases, N88K heteroallelic with c.966 + 1GT, L14P, or a frameshift mutation may cause postnatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maselli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richard et al., 2003</xref>). N88K mutant Rapsn induced fewer AChR clusters, compared with wild type Rapsn in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohno et al., 2002</xref>) and was unable to fully rescue Agrin-induced AChR clusters in <italic>Rapsn</italic> mutant cultured myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cossins et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>To understand molecular mechanisms of NMJ formation, we studied CMS mutations of the <italic>Rapsn</italic> gene with an idea that such mutations with clinic implications would reveal unexpected insight. In particular, we generated N88K knock-in mice to investigate the in vivo impact of N88K mutation on the NMJ. N88K mutant mice displayed profound deficits not only in AChR clusters, but also in nerve terminals at both light and electron microscopic levels. Developmentally, the NMJ abnormality was observed as early as embryonic day 14. We performed a combination of cell and molecular biological experiments including studying N88K mutant muscles. We demonstrated that N88K mutation inhibited the E3 ligase activity of Rapsn by reducing its phosphorylation and self-association. Our results not only unravel pathophysiological mechanisms of N88K mutation, but also provide novel insight into how signals are transduced from Agrin-LRP4-MuSK to Rapsn.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Aberrant NMJ formation in N88K mt mice</title><p>To study pathological mechanisms of the CMS-associated mutation N88K, we generated N88K knock-in mutant (mt) mice by CRISPR-Cas9 technique (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The mRNA of N88K <italic>Rapsn</italic> was comparable to that of wild type (WT) <italic>Rapsn</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The protein levels of Rapsn were similar between muscle lysates of the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>); and the mutation seemed to have little effect on the levels of ubiquitinated Rapsn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). However, N88K homozygous mt mice died within 24 hr of birth with cyanosis, suggesting respiratory failure. To examine the effect of N88K mutation on the NMJ, diaphragms were isolated from neonatal P0 mice and stained for AChR and nerve terminals. In WT diaphragms, AChR clusters were abundant and localized in the middle of muscle fibers, whereas in <italic>Rapsn</italic> null mt (-/-) mice, there was almost no AChR cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D</xref>). N88K mt mice were able to form AChR clusters, but their number and size were dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Remaining clusters were elongated, in contrast to oval plaque morphology in WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and distributed in a wider region of muscle fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and H</xref>). AChR clusters in N88K mt mice were reduced in staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), indicating reduced AChR concentration. In addition, N88K mt mice displayed abnormal nerve terminal arborization, with increased numbers of secondary, tertiary, quaternary branches, as observed in null mt mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–D and J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). To eliminate potential off-target effects of CRISPR-Cas9, we generated N88K/- mice that possess null mutation on one chromosome and N88K mutation on the other.

E3 ligases including those containing RING-domain are regulated by self-association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liew et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nikolay et al., 2004</xref>). The TPR domains in the N-terminus of Rapsn are thought to mediate self-association and thus form aggregates in heterologous cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maimone and Merlie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ramarao et al., 2001</xref>). We posited that tyrosine phosphorylation of Rapsn may promote self-association and thus activates E3 ligase activity. To test this, C2C12 myoblasts were co-transfected with Rapsn that were tagged by EGFP and HA, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>). Resulting myotubes were treated with Agrin and examined for self-binding by co-precipitation. Agrin increased the amount of Rapsn-EGFP co-precipitated by Rapsn-HA, plateaued ~90 min of Agrin treatment. As summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>, upon Agrin stimulation, tyrosine phosphorylation of MuSK occurs prior to that of Rapsn; and subsequently, Rapsn self-association and δ-AChR neddylation were increased, suggesting E3 ligase activity might be regulated by self-association. To examine this, we investigated whether Y86F alters Rapsn self-association. HEK293T cells were transfected with EGFP-tagged and HA-tagged Rapsn. Lysates were incubated with beads immobilized with anti-HA antibody to purify HA-tagged Rapsn and probed with anti-GFP antibody. Compared with WT control, less amount of EGFP-tagged Y86F mt Rapsn was co-precipitated by HA-tagged Y86F Rapsn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K and L</xref>), suggesting impaired ability of mt Rapsn to self-associate. In agreement, self-association of N88K Rapsn was also reduced, compared with WT Rapsn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7M and N</xref>), suggesting that Y86 and N88 are necessary for Rapsn self-association. Together, these results support a working model that MuSK stimulates AChR cluster formation by increasing Rapsn phosphorylation and self-association and thus enhancing its E3 ligase activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Failure of Y86F-Rapsn in rescuing NMJ deficits in N88K mt mice</title><p>To investigate the role of Y86 phosphorylation in vivo, we generated adeno-associated virus (AAV, AAV-PHP.B) expressing WT Rapsn (AAV-WT-EGFP) or Y86F mt Rapsn (AAV-Y86F-EGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).

These results uncover previously unappreciated impacts of N88K mutation on the NMJ and contribute to a better understanding of pathological mechanisms of how N88K mutation causes CMS. At the molecular level, studies of N88K mutation led to discover a pathway by which signal is transduced from MuSK to Rapsn. Agrin is a factor utilized by motoneurons to direct NMJ formation, in particular postsynaptic differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McMahan, 1990</xref>).

Like Rapsn, Agrin, LRP4, and MuSK are absolutely necessary for NMJ formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">DeChiara et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gautam et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gautam et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Weatherbee et al., 2006</xref>). However, signaling events downstream of MuSK were unclear except that Dok7 is a necessary adapter protein that is believed to dimerize MuSK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Okada et al., 2006</xref>); and Rapsn that could function as an adapter protein to bridge AChRs to the cytoskeleton and/or as an E3 ligase to promote neddylation of the AChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2018</xref>).

The N88K mutation seemed to have little effect on the levels of Rapsn or AChR in muscle cells. We demonstrate that it may alter the phosphorylation of Y86, an adjacent tyrosine residue that is required for Agrin signaling. First, Y86 became tyrosine phosphorylated upon Agrin stimulation. Second, mutating Y86 to F, to block tyrosine phosphorylation, reduced MuSK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of full-length Rapsn, and abolished MuSK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of TPR1-7 of Rapsn, suggesting Y86 is a major tyrosine-phosphorylation site at TPR domain. Third, in HEK293T cells, Y86F mutation reduced Rapsn E3 ligase activity to comparable, minimal level as Rapsn C366A mt whose E3 ligase activity was abolished (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>). In agreement, E3 ligase activity of Rapsn was reduced in Y86F knock-in myotubes, suggesting a necessary role of Y86 phosphorylation in E3 ligase activity regulation. Fourth, WT Rapsn was able to rescue AChR clustering deficits in N88K mt mice; this rescue effect was not observed with Y86F mt Rapsn. Finally, we demonstrate that N88 and Y86 are both necessary for Rapsn self-association, a process that has been shown to be necessary for E3 ligase activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koliopoulos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liew et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Metzger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nikolay et al., 2004</xref>; ). A parsimonious explanation of these results is that MuSK activation causes, directly or indirectly, Rapsn tyrosine phosphorylation at Y86, which promotes Rapsn self-association and thus activate the E3 ligase activity, revealing a mechanism for Rapsn activation. These results also suggest a novel, molecular pathological mechanism by which N88K mutation impairs the NMJ formation and maintenance.</p><p>Rapsn has 14 tyrosine residues, including 12 in the TPR domain. Mutation of the Y86 abolished MuSK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation of the TPR domain, suggesting that Y86 is a key tyrosine phosphorylation site in this region or its mutation prevents others tyrosine residues from being phosphorylated. Interestingly, tyrosine phosphorylation of WT Rapsn was reduced, but not abolished by the Y86F mutation. About 40% of MuSK-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation remained in Y86F mt. These results could suggest that tyrosine residues in C-terminal regions of Rapsn may be a target for MuSK regulation. This region contains a coiled-coil domain that could bind to the AChR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ramarao and Cohen, 1998</xref>), and a RING-H2 domain that could bind to β-dystroglycan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartoli et al., 2001</xref>) and possess the E3 ligase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to determine whether these activities are regulated by tyrosine phosphorylation. Consistent with this notion, Agrin treatment can enhance the AChR-Rapsn interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moransard et al., 2003</xref>) and the association of the AChR-Rapsn complex to cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Moransard et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Both MuSK kinase activity and Rapsn are necessary for prepatterning or the formation of aneural AChR clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yang et al., 2001b</xref>); and Rapsn is known to interact with MuSK in the absence of Agrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apel et al., 1997</xref>). Further, LRP4 could interact with MuSK and thus maintain its activity in the absence of Agrin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Indeed, Rapsn phosphorylation could be detectable at E14, when aneural AChR clusters are yet to be innervated by axons. Together, these observations suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Rapsn could contribute to the formation of aneural AChR clusters or muscle prepatterning. It is worthy pointing out that evidence is lacking whether Rapsn is a direct substrate protein of MuSK.</p><p>Pathological mechanisms of the N88K mutation have been examined previously. It was shown to reduce Rapsn’s ability to induce AChR clusters in HEK and TE671 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cossins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ohno et al., 2002</xref>). In agreement, the N88K mt was shown here to reduce Rapsn’s ability to induce AChR clusters in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In N88K knock-in mt mice and in CRISPR/Cas9-generated C2C12 myotubes, AChR clusters were almost diminished. However, N88K seemed to be able to induce AChR clusters in <italic>Rapsn</italic> mt myotubes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cossins et al., 2006</xref>). The cause of this discrepancy is unclear. In the current study, the impact of the N88K mutation was inferred mainly by loss-of-function approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, without changing endogenous Rapsn level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). Rapsn is known to induce AChR clusters at low concentrations, but inhibit AChR clusters at high level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Han et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Yoshihara and Hall, 1993</xref>). This inverted U-function could complicate the interpretation of results of overexpressing WT or mt Rapsn.</p><p>CMS patients carrying the N88K mutation show variable phenotypes, from serious, early-onset symptoms to mild, late-onset symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cossins et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Müller et al., 2003</xref>), even in patients with homozygous N88K mutation. In severe cases, N88K heteroallelic with c.966 + 1GT, L14P, or a frameshift mutation may cause postnatal death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Maselli et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Richard et al., 2003</xref>), indicating N88K mutation could have seriously detrimental effects on NMJ formation or maintenance in human subjects. Overall, the symptoms of CMS patients with homozygous N88K mutation are milder than that of patients carrying heteroallelic N88K mutation with a second mutation. These secondary mutations including sequence deletions or insertions, such as c.1177-1178del AA, p.V50-S55del, p.K373del, and c.553-554insGTTCT, are often more disruptive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Milone et al., 2009</xref>). We also note that phenotypes of N88K mt mice seem to be more severe than symptoms of CMS patients. Almost all N88K mt mice died within 24 hr of birth. A simple explanation of these observations may be genetic difference. Gene mutations identified in patients with various diseases such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Lowe syndrome, galactosemia diseases often failed to reproduce clinic symptoms in mouse models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Elsea and Lucas, 2002</xref>). On the other hand, a knock-in mutation of AQP2, a gene implicated in hereditary non-X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, causes more severe phenotypes in mice than in human subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2001a</xref>). Even in same species, effects of a mutation could have variable impacts on different strains of mice, for example, the Agrin mutation, Agrin<sup>nm380</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanik and Burgess, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, it is possible that some patients with the N88K mutation are unable to survive and thus were not included in clinic reports.</p><p>In sum, this study demonstrates that the most prevalent CMS-associated mutation in Rapsn is causal to NMJ deficits. Not only does it reveal pathological mechanisms of how the N88K mutation alters NMJ development, the study also uncovers molecular mechanisms by which Rapsn is regulated upon MuSK activation. The results support a model where Rapsn becomes phosphorylated on tyrosine residues for self-association and E3 ligase activity, which are necessary for AChR clustering. Intriguingly, NMJ deficits in N88K mt mice could be diminished by a virus expressing WT Rapsn, suggesting that gene therapy may be beneficial for CMS.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The N88K mt mice were generated by the University of Rochester Mouse Genome Editing Resource using CRISPR/Cas9 approach, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2016</xref>).

SgRNA was generated by a MEGAshortscript T7 kit (Life Technologies) using template sequence (GCTCG AAAGC TACCT GAACC) cloned in pX330 plasmid (Addgene #42230) and was purified using MEGAclear kit (Life Technologies). Mixture of Cas9 mRNA (TriLink Biotechnologies, 100 ng / μl), sgRNA (50 ng / μl), and ssDNA (100 ng / μl) was injected into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J mice (Jackson Laboratory, Stock #000664). Viable two-cell stage embryos were transferred to pseudo-pregnant ICR females to generate founder mice, which were subsequently bred with C57BL/6J mice for germline transmission to generate F1 mice. Mice carrying N88K mutation were screened by PCR analysis and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Primers: 5’- GCTCG AAAGC TACCTG AACCT GGCG-3’ and 5’-CACGA GGTTCT CAGGG AGCCT CA-3’ were used to verify WT genomic DNA, and primers: 5’-CTTCC TGCTC GAAAG CTACC TCAAG TTAGC T-3’ and 5’-CACGA GGTTC TCAGG GAGCC TCA-3’ were used to verify N88K mt genomic DNA. C57BL/6 mice were used as WT controls. Mice were housed in cages in a room with 12 hr light-dark cycle with ad libitum access to water and rodent chow diet (Diet P3000). Embryo and P0 pups of either sex were analyzed, unless otherwise indicated.

Briefly, skeletal muscles or diaphragms were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 24 hr, and then dissected in PBS. Dissected samples were rinsed with 0.1 M glycine in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature and followed by three-time washing in PBS. Samples were then incubated with the blocking buffer (5% BSA, 5% goat serum, 1% Triton X-100 in PBS) for 1 hr at room temperature and incubated with primary antibodies in blocking buffer at 4°C overnight. Next day, after washing three times with washing buffer (1% Triton X-100 in PBS), samples were incubated with fluorescent-labeled secondary antibodies at room temperature for 1–2 hr. Samples were then washed with washing buffer and mounted with Vectashield mounting medium (H1000, Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA) and coverslip. Images were collected with a Zeiss confocal laser scanning microscope (LSM 800) and collapsed into a single image.

The sgRNA carrying targeting sequence GCTCG AAAGC TACCT GAACC was used for generation of N88K mt C2C12; sgRNA carrying targeting sequence CAT TGC TGC GCG CCA GGT TC was used for generation of Y86F mt C2C12. For comparing Rapsn tyrosine phosphorylation and E3 ligase activity between WT and N88K mt culture myotubes, myotubes were treated with Agrin for 2 hr, because Agrin activates MuSK within 10 min of stimulation and tyrosine phosphorylation of Rapsn that plateaus around 20 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), and Agrin induces the formation of AChR clusters beginning around 2 hr of stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ngo et al., 2012</xref>). For studying Rapsn self-association in culture myotubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7I</xref>), overexpression of high dosage of Rapsn could induce Rapsn aggregation in the absence of Agrin (data not shown), several dosages of Rapsn vectors were tested, and 3.5 μg Rapsn-HA vector and 3.5 μg Rapsn-EGFP vector were used to transfect 10 cm culture plate. At these dosages, through viewing GFP fluorescence, we could see expression of Rapsn at culture myotubes, but these myotubes didn’t have obvious Rapsn aggregates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Isolation of cell surface protein</title><p>The procedures for isolating surface proteins were described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hans Brenner (Reviewer #1); Markus Ruegg (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript examined a knockin mouse carrying a mutation (N88K) of rapsyn, a common mutation in congenital myasthenic syndrome. The homozygous KI mice died shortly after birth with NMJ deficits. The authors implicate the agrin-LRP4-MuSK tyrosine phosphorylation of rapsyn in the pathophysiology. The authors recently reported that rapsyn has E3 ligase activity, which is essentially for its role in AChR clustering. The importance of this signaling cascade is known and many of the general observations regarding rapsyn are known, the new information in this manuscript is the link of the N88K mutation to impaired rapsyn phosphorylation at Y86. The experiments appear carefully done and described and the current results are a logical extension of the authors' prior studies and provide additional details on the role of rapsyn at the NMJ.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Although the reviewers were supportive of the manuscript, a number of essential issues will need to be addressed in a revised manuscript as listed here and explained in depth in the full comments of the reviewers below.

Motor neuron growth cones differentiate into presynaptic nerve terminals at the site of n.-m. contact, and in close register, muscle fibers form high density accumulations of receptors for the transmitter acetylcholine (AChRs). Synaptic AChR clustering is driven by agrin secreted from the motor nerve terminal and activating its effector MuSK in the muscle fiber. AChR clustering ultimately involves the anchoring of AChRs to the synaptic actin cytoskeleton through the organization of a subsynaptic apparatus, a complex of transmembrane and peripheral membrane proteins. Whereas their importance for clustering has been demonstrated genetically, the nature of their interactions, i.e. purely physical and/or involved in signaling, and their respective relevance for AChR clustering have remained largely unknown, although it would be required for full molecular understanding of NMJ development. One of the major components of the subsynaptic apparatus is rapsyn, a peripheral membrane protein linking AChRs to the synaptic actin cytoskeleton via unknown mechanisms. In the absence of rapsyn, AChRs do not cluster, and different mutations in rapsyn gene are linked to potentially life-threatening NMJ malfunctions – a subgroup of NMJ diseases called congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS).</p><p>To dissect novel mechanisms of rapsyn's function, the authors have taken advantage of an earlier finding that one form of CMS is linked to a common mutation in rapsyn, in which asparagine 88 is mutated to lysine (N88K). Specifically, they generated rapsyn N88K mutant mice and observed impairments in NMJ development and function, with reduced synapse number, AChR density, presynaptic vesicle density and reduced synaptic folds; combined this led to cyanosis and caused death within 24 hours after birth. Reminiscent synaptic phenotypes have been reported in CMS patients carrying the N88K mutations.</p><p>In molecular and cell biological experiments on heterologous systems and in cultured muscle cells expression of N88K-mutant reduced spontaneous and agrin-induced AChR clustering without an effect on total or surface rapsyn, respectively, demonstrating reduced ability of N88K to cluster AChRs. This was not due to impaired binding of N88K to AChRs.</p><p>In previous experiments, the same group found that rapsyn possesses E3 ligase activity that is required for its ability to cluster AChRs, apparently through a process involving posttranslational neddylation of the AChRs. They now show in biochemical experiments both in HEK293 cells, in cultured muscle cells and in mouse muscle carrying the N88K mutation that indeed neddylation was strongly reduced compared to cells/tissue expressing wild type rapsyn. Evidence is then presented that agrin/MuSK phosphorylates a Tyr residue (Y86) in rapsyn immediately flanking N88 in WT, but not in N88K mutant muscle, and that phosphorylation at Y86 is required for rapsyn's E3 ligase activity and for its ability to cluster AChRs.</p><p>With activity being regulated by self-association in numerous E3 ligases, the authors then successfully tested their hypothesis that self-association of rapsyn in HEK293 cells – a condition for forming aggregates in heterologous cells – was impaired with non-phosphorylatable rapsyn Y76F mutants, as it was with rapsyn N88K mutants. They validated the physiological relevance of their hypothesis in vivo, by injecting fetal N88K mutant muscles with AAV expressing WT and N88K mutant rapsyns, respectively, which mimicked the changes in AChR clustering in the genetically modified mutant compared to control WT mice. Thus, NMJ deficits in N88K mutant muscle could be rescued by w.t. rapsyn, but not with N88K rapsyn. In contrast, forced expression of Y86F rapsyn did not rescue the synaptic phenotype in N88K mutants.</p><p>Combined, the data suggest that activated MuSK phosphorylates rapsyn at Y86 which stimulates rapsyn self-association, thus activating its E3 ligase activity which is required for AChR clustering. The paper provides not only insight into the molecular mechanism agrin-induced AChR clustering at the NMJ, but also explains, at least in part, the synaptic phenotype of rapsyn N88K patients afflicted by this form of CMS.</p><p>The data presented are well documented, except that numbers of items examined (AChR clusters, animals) should be given (see e.g. (4) below). Validations by appropriate controls are convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In the present study, the authors investigated how a prevalent mutation in a well-known congenital myasthenic syndroms (CMS) causing gene (ie Rapsyn) leads to neuromuscular junction (NMJ) formation defects in rodent. Rapsyn is a peripheral membrane protein that binds directly to the skeletal muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChR) and is essential for AChR clustering in the postsynaptic membrane. However, the mechanisms underlying Rapsyn function in anchoring postsynaptic proteins largely remain unknown. Mutations in Rapsyn cause CMS, the most common mutation occurs at N88 since about 90% of Rapsyn-related CMS patients carry N88K mutation.</p><p>The authors demonstrate by genetic approaches and functional studies that the N88 residue of Rapsyn is essential for NMJ formation in mouse and provide novel mechanistic insights for Rapsyn function in postsynaptic differentiation. Rapsyn N88K mutation strongly impairs functional differentiation of NMJ as early as embryonic day 14. Evidence is presented that the mutation alters the E3 ligase activity of Rapsyn and MuSK-induced Rapsyn tyrosine phosphorylation. The authors further identify Y86 site as one of the main residues phosphorylated by MuSK and show that it is critical for Rapsyn E3 ligase activity and AChR clustering presumably by promoting Rapsyn self-association. Finally, rescue experiments using AAV-mediated Rapsyn expression in N88K mutant muscle indicate that WT-Rapsyn, but not Y86F-Rapsyn ameliorate the NMJ morphological deficits of N88K mutant thigh muscle suggesting a critical role for Y86 in Rapsyn function during NMJ formation. This study provides important mechanistic insights of the molecular mechanisms underlying Rapsyn function in NMJ formation. Although overall the data support the conclusions, some of the results and mechanisms proposed appear over-interpreted and care should be given to the phrasing all throughout the manuscript for accuracy.</p><p>1) The authors claim that their study led to discover a pathway by which signal is transduced from MuSK to Rapsyn. However, the sequential link between MuSK activation, Rapsyn self-association, E3 ligase activity and Rapsyn tyrosine phosphorylation events in AChR clustering is not clear and no evidence is provided to support the sequential model proposed by the authors in the discussion that may only reflect one possibility among many others. The author should clarify their signaling model and propose experimental data that support their conclusions as to the mechanistic frame of Rapsyn function in AChR clustering.</p><p>2) The authors demonstrate that Rapsyn N88K mutation impairs NMJ formation in vivo as early as E14, where only minimal agrin/MuSK signaling is occurring. It would be important to determine whether Rapsyn is tyrosine phosphorylated by MuSK at this early stage and discuss how MuSK leads to Rapsyn tyrosine phosphorylation and self-association in absence of agrin.</p><p>3) N88K mutation is located in the third TPR repeat known to promote Rapsyn oligomerization. However, data previously reported that the N88K mutation does not alter the ability of Rapsyn to self-associate in heterologous cells (Ohno et al., 2002) in contrast to the authors findings. This should be included and commented in the manuscript.</p><p>4) CMS patients with Rapsyn N88K mutation are either homozygous for N88K or heteroallelic for N88K and a second mutation in the Rapsyn coding region. Strikingly, clinical reports suggest that disease severity of patients with Rapsyn compound allelic mutations is greater than that of patients with homozygous N88K Rapsyn mutation. The authors should discuss their findings based on available clinical data on the effect of N88K mutation on the variability and severity of Rapsyn-related CMS.</p><p>5) A well-known function of Rapsyn is to anchor postsynaptic proteins in the subsynaptic cytoskeleton including AChR. Interactions between Rapsyn with microtubule and actin binding proteins have been reported in the literature. It is somehow surprising that the authors did not investigate (immunostaining) whether N88K mutation impairs Rapsyn association with cytoskeleton components.</p><p>Figure 1: The authors analyzed the NMJ phenotype of mice carrying Rapsyn N88K mutation. For a meaningful comparison of the NMJ phenotypes it is important to compare WT, heterozygous and homozygous mice for the mutation. To support the conclusions of the NMJ staining and EM data, the authors could perform ex vivo electrophysiological recording at P0 to evaluate the neurotransmission defects. This may be challenging since the mutant mice died at birth, but worth to try.</p><p>Figure 2: The staining of AChR clusters at E14 is of poor quality.

The authors find that mice expressing the N88K-mutated rapsyn die within 24 hours after birth because of severe perturbation of the neuromuscular junction. The authors then show that N88K-rapsyn affects neddylation, rapsyn self-association and rapsyn-phosphorylation. Interestingly, prevention of phosphorylation of the nearby tyrosine (Y86) has a very similar effect as the N88K mutant.</p><p>Overall, the paper is well done and it reports on an interesting mechanism. Having said this, I find it a bit disturbing that others have reported much milder effects of the N88K mutant (see for example Cossins et al., 2006) in similar cell assays. These contributors also reported that the N88K-mutant rapsyn affects the stability of agrin-induced AChR clusters. Finally, the N88K mutant also has a much milder phenotype in human patients. Hence, a more thorough discussion and assessment what could account for these differences would strengthen the paper. One possibility that could explain the difference in the severity might be that levels of the N88K rapsyn mutant were much lower in the current study than in those studies conducted by others. Hence, a proper dose-response comparison between mutant and wild-type rapsyn may help address this difference.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49180.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The neuromuscular junction has for decades been a model synapse for investigating basic mechanisms of synaptic transmission and synapse development.</p><p>[…] The data presented are well documented, except that numbers of items examined (AChR clusters, animals) should be given (see e.g. (4.) below).

We have performed additional experiments to characterize the time courses of MuSK activation, Rapsyn tyrosine phosphorylation, Rapsyn self-association, Rapsyn E3 ligase activity in C2C12 myotubes in response to Agrin stimulation. As shown in revised Figure 6A, 6B and Figure 7I, 7J, MuSK activation occurred within 10 minutes, followed by Rapsyn tyrosine phosphorylation and self-association (CO-IP of Rapsyn-HA and Rapsyn-EGFP in C2C12 cells) (which plateaued around 20 and 90 minutes, respectively). E3 ligase activity was not peaked until 90 min after Agrin stimulation (Figure 6B). These data demonstrate that these events occur sequentially. Together with other data presented in this paper, they support a working model that MuSK stimulates AChR cluster formation by increasing Rapsyn phosphorylation and self-association and thus enhancing its E3 ligase activity. These results are now presented in subsection “Reduced Rapsn tyrosine phosphorylation by N88K mutation” and subsection “Y86 phosphorylation for E3 ligase activity and AChR clustering”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors demonstrate that Rapsyn N88K mutation impairs NMJ formation in vivo as early as E14, where only minimal agrin/MuSK signaling is occurring.

As shown in Figure 6E, 6G, tyrosine-phosphorylation was detected in muscles of E14 WT mice; but the level was reduced in muscles from N88K mice. As demonstrated in the literature, both MuSK kinase activity and Rapsyn are necessary for prepatterning or the formation of aneural AChR clusters (Lin et al., 2001; Yang et al., 2001b); and Rapsyn is known to interact with MuSK in the absence of Agrin (Apel et al., 1997). Further, LRP4 could interact with MuSK and thus maintain its activity in the absence of Agrin (Kim et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008). Our data are in agreement with these observations. Together, they suggest that tyrosine phosphorylation of Rapsyn could occur in the absence of Agrin and contributes to the formation of aneural AChR clusters or muscle prepatterning. These points are now described in the revised subsection “Reduced Rapsn tyrosine phosphorylation by N88K mutation” and Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) N88K mutation is located in the third TPR repeat known to promote Rapsyn oligomerization.

However, we would like to point out that in the paper by Ohno and colleagues (2002), “self-association” was defined as a morphological event (i.e., aggregate formation). In fact, as shown in Figure 4A, N88K Rapsyn could form aggregates in cultured cells, in agreement with the previous work. However, the N88K mutation reduced the co-precipitation of Rapsyn-HA and Rapsyn-GFP, suggesting that N88 is critical to self-association (Figure 7K-N). We revised subsection “Impaired ability of N88K Rapsn in AChR clustering” to indicate that our results were in agreement with the previous report in terms of “aggregates” formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) CMS patients with Rapsyn N88K mutation are either homozygous for N88K or heteroallelic for N88K and a second mutation in the Rapsyn coding region.

In severe cases, N88K heteroallelic with c.966 + 1GT, L14P, or a frameshift mutation may cause postnatal death (Maselli et al., 2003; Milone et al., 2009; Richard et al., 2003), indicating N88K mutation could have seriously detrimental effects on NMJ formation or maintenance in human subjects. Overall, the symptoms of CMS patients with homozygous N88K mutation are milder than that of patients carrying heteroallelic N88K mutation with a second mutation. These may be due to that second mutations may exert more harmful effects than that of N88K mutation. Actually, among these second mutations, coding sequence deletions or insertions are often observed, such as c.1177-1178del AA, p.V50-S55del, p.K373del, c.553-554insGTTCT (Milone et al., 2009), which may cause frameshift of coding sequence and totally disrupt Rapsn’s function.</p><p>We also note that phenotypes of N88K mt mice seem to be more severe than symptoms of CMS patients. Almost all N88K mt mice died within 24 hours of birth. A simple explanation of these observations may be genetic difference. Gene mutations identified in patients with various diseases such as Lesch-Nyhan syndrome, Lowe syndrome, galactosemia diseases often failed to reproduce clinic symptoms in mouse models (Elsea and Lucas, 2002). On the other hand, a knock-in mutation of AQP2, a gene implicated in hereditary non-X-linked nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, causes more severe phenotypes in mice than in human subjects (Yang et al., 2001a). Even in same species, effects of a mutation could have variable impacts on different strains of mice, for example, the Agrin mutation, Agrin<sup>nm380</sup> (Bogdanik and Burgess, 2011).

First, as shown in Figure 5B, the amount of Actin and Rapsyn associated with surface AChR was similar between N88K and WT myotubes, suggesting the mutation has little effect on actin association. Second, actin-anchored Rapsyn-AChR complexes are resistant to low concentration of detergents (Moransard et al., 2003). We found that the amount of Rapsyn that could be solubilized by Triton X-100 was similar between N88K and WT (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and D).

Pathological mechanisms of the N88K mutation have been examined previously.

In agreement, the N88K mutant was shown here to reduce Rapsn’s ability to induce AChR clusters in HEK293T cells (Figure 4A).

The cause of this discrepancy is unclear. In the current study, the impact of the N88K mutation was inferred mainly by loss-of-function approaches, both in vitro and in vivo, without changing endogenous Rapsn level (Figure 1 and Figure 4E and F). Rapsn is known to induce AChR clusters at low concentrations, but inhibit AChR clusters at high level (Han et al., 1999; Yoshihara and Hall, 1993). This inverted U-function could complicate the interpretation of results of overexpressing WT or mt Rapsn.
