These bacteria are surrounded by two membranes: an inner membrane and an outer membrane. Proteins called secretins are components of several large molecular complexes that are embedded within the outer membrane. Some secretin-containing complexes form pores in the bacterial membranes and allow molecules to pass in or out of the cell.</p><p>Some secretins also form part of the machinery that allow Gram-negative bacteria to grow fibre-like structures called type IV pili. These pili help bacteria that cause infections to move and stick to host cells, where they can also trigger massive changes in the host cells' architecture. Multiple copies of a secretin protein called PilQ form a channel in the outer membrane of the bacteria that allows a type IV pilus to grow out of the surface of the cell. The pilus can then hook the bacteria onto surfaces and other cells. There is evidence to suggest the type IV pilus machinery is involved in the uptake of DNA from other bacteria, an important but poorly understood process that has contributed to the spread of multi-drug resistance.</p><p>Now, Gold et al. have used a cutting-edge technique called ‘electron cryo-tomography’ to analyse the three-dimensional structure of the machinery that builds the type IV pili in the membranes of a bacterium called <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic>. This analysis revealed that, similar to many other channel complexes, the PilQ channel can be ‘open’ or ‘closed’. When pili are absent, the channel is closed, but the channel opens when pili are present. Further analysis also revealed the structure of an assembled pilus.</p><p>Next, Gold et al. studied the open state of the type IV pilus in more detail and observed that a region of each of the PilQ proteins moves a considerable distance to make way for the pilus to enter the central pore. These results will pave the way for future studies of type IV pili and other secretin-containing complexes and underpin efforts to investigate new drug targets to combat bacterial infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07380.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07380.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic></kwd><kwd>electron cryo-tomography</kwd><kwd>type IV pilus</kwd><kwd>subtomogram averaging</kwd><kwd>DNA transporter</kwd><kwd>bacterial secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft (Max Planck Society)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gold</surname><given-names>Vicki AM</given-names></name><name><surname>Kühlbrandt</surname><given-names>Werner</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AV 9/6-1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salzer</surname><given-names>Ralf</given-names></name><name><surname>Averhoff</surname><given-names>Beate</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Electron cryo-tomography reveals a huge conformational change in the secretin domain of the type IV pilus machinery that occurs when the channel opens for pilus extrusion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Secretins form multimeric pores through the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Averhoff, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korotkov et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhardt et al., 2012</xref>). They are the central secretion conduits for proteins and virulence factors in type II and III secretion systems (T2SS/T3SS) and are essential for extrusion of type IV pili (T4P) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 1993</xref>) and transport of some bacteriophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korotkov et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, secretins are key components of DNA transport systems, which mediate uptake of free DNA from the environment, referred to as natural transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarzenlander et al., 2009</xref>). The ability to take up DNA is one of the major mechanisms of horizontal gene transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domingues et al., 2012</xref>) and enables organisms to adapt rapidly to changing environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Averhoff, 2009</xref>). This process is also fundamental for adaptation of pathogenic bacteria to human hosts and the acquisition of multi-drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domingues et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In many Gram-negative bacteria, such as <italic>Thermus</italic>, and also in many major human pathogens such as <italic>Neisseria</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>, and <italic>Vibrio</italic>, DNA uptake is linked to the T4P machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wolfgang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Graupner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Seitz and Blokesch, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To investigate the structure and function of this system, we chose the thermophilic bacterium <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> HB27, which exhibits the highest transformation rates known to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Koyama et al., 1986</xref>), and due to the thermostability of its proteins is a convenient model for structural studies.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07380.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematic of the T4P machinery in <italic>T. thermophilus</italic>.</title><p>The type IV pilus machinery is a heterooligomer, formed from at least 10 different proteins. The PilQ secretin (orange) forms a channel in the outer membrane for secretion of the pilus-forming protein PilA4 (green), which is processed by the prepillin peptidase PilD (grey) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarzenlander et al., 2009</xref>). The membrane protein PilW (light orange) plays a role in DNA transport, PilQ assembly, and pilus extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rumszauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarzenlander et al., 2009</xref>).

PilM (light brown), PilN (dark brown), and PilO (beige) are suggested to form the inner membrane assembly platform and connect the periplasmic and cytoplasmic sides of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rumszauer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarzenlander et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karuppiah and Derrick, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karuppiah et al., 2013</xref>). The cytoplasmic ATPases PilF (bright yellow) and PilT1/PilT2 (pale yellow) drive pilus extension and retraction, respectively (indicated with red arrows) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rose et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salzer et al., 2014b</xref>).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07380.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07380.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-07380-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Pili are several micron-long flexible filaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Li, 2008</xref>) that can generate forces of over 100 pN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 2004</xref>). T4P are grouped together in a class based on the production and secretion of the major pilin protein PilA4 (<italic>Thermus</italic> nomenclature), thousands of copies of which form the helical pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schwarzenlander et al., 2009</xref>). The T4P is the only known bacterial pilus that can be retracted rapidly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al., 2004</xref>) to enable motility and adherence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Merz et al., 2000</xref>), major contributors to bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hahn, 1997</xref>). Assembly and disassembly of the pilus is driven by the AAA-ATPases (ATPases associated with diverse cellular activities) PilF (extension) and PilT1/PilT2 (retraction) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salzer et al., 2014b</xref>). It has been suggested that mature PilA4 assembles into pili extending from the inner membrane by action of PilF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Salzer et al., 2014b</xref>). The outer membrane channel of the T4P machinery is formed by the dodacemeric ∼1 MDa secretin complex PilQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhardt et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Other proteins, in particular PilM, PilN, and PilO, are hypothesized to be a central part of the pilus assembly platform and may couple the cytoplasmic and periplasmic sides of the T4P machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karuppiah et al., 2013</xref>). Some proteins of the complex have been implicated to play a dual role in both pilus assembly and natural competence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Averhoff and Friedrich, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedrich et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rumszauer et al., 2006</xref>). Recent results indicate that T4P themselves are not directly involved in DNA uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhardt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzer et al., 2014a</xref>).</p><p>T4P are essential for pathogenesis by mediating adhesion, biofilm formation, and twitching motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burrows, 2012</xref>). Thus, both secretins and T4P play important roles in virulence of different pathogenic bacteria, which has fostered their use as new targets for drug development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baron, 2010</xref>). To date, there is no information on the <italic>in situ</italic> structure of either the T4P machinery or DNA translocator. Determining structures of T4P complexes in whole bacterial cells is therefore of paramount importance and will enable further study of bacterial resistance and disease. Electron cryo-tomography (cryoET) has the unique ability to determine protein structures in cells at molecular resolution. We have applied cryoET to whole <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> HB27 cells, in order to visualize the T4P machinery <italic>in situ</italic>. We determine the helical structure of the pilus and find that the secretin complex PilQ is a central dynamic component of this system. CryoET and subtomogram averaging of the T4P machinery with and without pili reveal a ∼30 Å conformational change as the gates in the complex open.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p><italic>T. thermophilus</italic> has an unusual cell architecture with deep surface clefts, formed by invaginations of the outer membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Distal to the most polar outer membrane ring, numerous fibrous and straight pili extend from the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>).

Therefore, cells were treated with 100 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and pipetted in order to render the outer membrane leaky (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caston et al., 1988</xref>). This had the desired effect of depleting the periplasm of most small proteins.

These proteins are most likely connected to one another by flexible domains that are not well contrasted in the subtomogram average. A longitudinal slice through the complex reveals that PilQ has two gates, which are closed in the absence of a pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel). Gate 1 is formed by the ‘cone’ in the outer membrane and gate 2 by the N1 domain at the base of PilQ, enclosing an empty periplasmic vestibule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, right panel). The C-terminal ‘cone’ has been shown to form a sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-stable sub-domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhardt et al., 2011</xref>), thus, it is plausible that gate 1 is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the cell membrane in the closed state. A second gate formed by the N-terminal domains has not been observed in other secretins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korotkov et al., 2011</xref>). The N-terminus of PilQ forms an unusual βββαββ fold, different from the conserved ring-building βαββα folds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhardt et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we hypothesize that this motif may form part of gate 2.</p><p>To determine the structure of the T4P machinery in the open state, the pipetting step during sample preparation was omitted (‘Materials and methods’), which reduced the shearing forces and kept the assembled pilus intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Close inspection of the pilus shows a periodic structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which was suitable for subtomogram averaging. Since the ice surrounding the pili was thin (∼100 nm), it was possible to apply CTF-correction. The structure of the pilus was determined at ∼32 Å resolution by averaging 740 subvolumes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Power spectra calculated from a single tomographic slice or from the subtomogram average revealed a repeat distance of ∼4.9 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, lower panels). The <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> pilus forms a right-handed helix of ∼3 nm diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which is different from the previously determined electron cryo-microscopy structure of the isolated <italic>Neisseria gonorrhoeae</italic> T4P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craig et al., 2006</xref>). Diameters of pili can vary considerably and pilin proteins have limited sequence similarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Li, 2008</xref>), which likely accounts for this difference. The result may prompt a reassessment of the functional roles of different T4P in cells. Due to the more challenging sample preparation method, the structure of the open T4P machinery with the pilus extended was determined from only ∼300 particles at ∼45 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This resolution is sufficient to reveal the central protein channel complex with the ∼3 nm pilus protein density in the centre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). An extensive conformational change is evident that shifts PilQ domains N0–N3 away from N4/N5 by ∼30 Å towards the cytoplasmic membrane. This change opens the periplasmic vestibule to make way for the pilus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4E, 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>). The shape and dimensions of the pore change from a tapered form ranging in width from ∼4 nm (at N5) to ∼8 nm (at N2/N3) in the closed state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), to a roughly constant 7 nm-wide channel in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). In comparison, the closed state of <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> PilQ is ∼9 nm wide tapering to a point (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al., 2004</xref>), which would be sufficient to accommodate the wider <italic>Neisseria</italic> pilus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Craig et al., 2006</xref>) after a comparably large conformational change. Additional conformational changes and shifts also occur in protein densities P1, P2, and C1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In the open state, we observe an extra protein density in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, yellow arrowheads and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), which we speculate could be PilF, linked to the inner membrane platform via PilM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Karuppiah and Derrick, 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Homologous proteins have been shown to interact with the cytoplasmic ATPases, stimulating their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lu et al., 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2014</xref>). Because EDTA treatment caused a depletion of periplasmic protein, we cannot exclude the possibility that some proteins may have been removed from the T4P machinery. However, we also averaged complexes from a tomogram of the two cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, which contained both open (with pili) and closed (without pili) complexes and where the periplasmic protein density was considerably higher. These subtomogram averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) show clearly that the same large conformational changes occur in the T4P machinery, irrespective of the degree of periplasmic protein depletion, and hence of the effect of EDTA.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07380.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Structure of the T4P and the assembled machinery in the open state.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>B</bold>) Tomographic slices show close-up views of the T4P machinery with assembled pili (white arrowheads).

Subtomogram averages of the T4P machinery shown in all other figures were calculated from data collected at 33,000× and 7 μm underfocus on the Titan Krios microscope. Coordinates corresponding to the outer membrane and inner membrane domains of the complex were marked manually in IMOD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kremer et al., 1996</xref>). Subvolumes from twice-binned tomograms were then extracted from NAD filtered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Frangakis and Hegerl, 2001</xref>) data and an initial alignment and averaging performed in SPIDER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frank et al., 1996</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editor and another Jan Löwe (peer reviewer).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The short report titled “Structure of a type IV pilus machinery in the open and closed state” by Gold et al. describes the structure of a type IV secretion pore in two different states, bound and unbound to the pilus using cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging. The message of the manuscript is straightforward. Although true molecular interpretation of the reported results will have to await studies at much higher resolutions, it is valuable to get an initial overview of what is happening in cells. The work presented is a very good example of what is currently possible.</p><p>A general concern of the reviewers was that only someone with considerable background in this field can follow the description and relate it to what is known from high resolution studies of components—e.g., the crystallographic studies the assembly platform (Karuppiah, et al.), secretion complex (Burckhardt, et al.), and fiber (Karuppiah, et al. and Craig, et al.). As the authors point out, the complex depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> closely resembles that seen by Burckhardt, et al., but with some interesting structural differences. We therefore request a revised version that addresses the following points and that will allow a structural biologist, who does not know about bacterial pili, to understand the key points.</p><p>A) It would be helpful to use consistent terminology when introducing complexes and concepts. For example, the authors first introduce “secretins,” followed by reference to “the T4P system” and “the T4P machinery.” The molecular constituents of the T4P system/machinery/complex should be clearly delineated. Does T4P refer to the PilQ secretin complex alone (please see the Introduction), or is it meant to include both PilQ and PilMNO? Are PilMNO couplers, or parts of the complex? A cartoon of the model currently supported by the literature would be helpful.</p><p>B) Is the multi-ring structure, N0-N5, thought to be composed only of domains of the single protein (PilQ) or are there other components specific to particular rings. That is, do the authors think that the “gate closure” is a conformational change in PilQ itself or rather a redistribution of another protein?</p><p>C) Related to B). A major finding of the paper is a substantial conformational transition between the open and closed T4P machinery. (i) Since there are no atomic structures fitted into the cryoEM density presented, the importance of gate 2 in recognising the growing pilus is speculative. The entire paragraph should be reworded with more caution. (ii) The closed data set comes from EDTA-treated, pipetted, pilus-deficient cells, while the open set comes from non-pipetted, pilus-positive complexes. Comparison of the average number of pili to the average number of complexes suggests, as the authors write, that 80% of complexes are not associated with pili. Do these pilus-free complexes resemble the “closed” complexes seen in the pipetted, EDTA-treated cells?</p><p>D) To obtain the open state, the authors use strong EDTA treatment of cells to deplete the periplasm for the open state. This is an unnatural state for the pore proteins. Without this treatment, the signal to noise ratio is low in the tomograms, but the pore proteins can nonetheless be identified even without it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref>). Did the authors attempt to carry out subtomogram averaging from these native data? What was the result? It would be interesting to know the result, even just from an image processing perspective.</p><p>E) Related to D). The authors should introduce a caveat in the Results section that some molecules associated with the secretion pore may have been removed by the EDTA treatment and not make such strong points about “in situ” structures: the periplasm has been shrunk and emptied, at least partially.</p><p>F) The authors comment that <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> was chosen due to its high transformation rate and convenient thermostability (Introduction). Could the authors comment on how their in situ findings might be generalized to other bacterial species that do not have unusually deep surface clefts or an “extraordinarily wide” periplasm (as stated in the Results and Discussion section)? Is it possible that these characteristics are responsible for exaggerated structural dynamics that more readily facilitate DNA uptake and thus the higher transformation rate?</p><p>G) Some slightly more technical points:</p><p>i) The IMOD reconstruction showing the pilus does not show strong features. It is hard to see repeats in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>. Would it be possible to see a Fourier transform with a peak? The pili emanating from cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> are fairly long. Did the authors try to get 2D averages from the cryoEM images? If there is a repeat, then it should be easily visible from a few images. The issue is important because there are such strong differences from the pili of <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>. In <italic>Neisseria</italic>, would one expect the T4P channel to be that much wider? Does it use other proteins or just more of them with more than 12-fold symmetry? Independent alignment and averaging of the present data should be tried, perhaps using the 0.143 FSC criterion.</p><p>ii) Is there any independent verification that T4P channels have 12-fold symmetry? The authors make heavy use of the symmetry, but it seems from the MS that they are relying on someone else's result.</p><p>iii) How confident can we be of the correspondence between the rings in the image from subtomogram averaging and the rings in the projection from negative staining of PilQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>)? The spacings seem rather different. Could other components contribute to the rings in the intact sheath?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07380.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>A general concern of the reviewers was that only someone with considerable background in this field can follow the description and relate it to what is known from high resolution studies of components—e.g., the crystallographic studies the assembly platform (Karuppiah, et al.), secretion complex (Burckhardt, et al.), and fiber (Karuppiah, et al. and Craig, et al.).

That is, do the authors think that the “gate closure” is a conformational change in PilQ itself or rather a redistribution of another protein?</italic></p><p>The multi-ring structure N0-N5 is composed only of dodecamers of PilQ. We know this from the comparison of our in situ structure to the 2D images of isolated PilQ, of which the dimensions (length and width of complex) are identical. In the previous 2D work, the protein in the sample was treated with hot phenol, resulting in dissociation into monomers of PilQ only with no other proteins present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhardt et al. 2011</xref>). Thus the gate closure is a conformational change in PilQ. We have made this point clearer in the text (Results and Discussion section).</p><p><italic>C) Related to B). A major finding of the paper is a substantial conformational transition between the open and closed T4P machinery. (i) Since there are no atomic structures fitted into the cryoEM density presented, the importance of gate 2 in recognising the growing pilus is speculative. The entire paragraph should be reworded with more caution</italic>.</p><p>We appreciate that the function of the gates is speculative at present and have reworded the last four lines of the paragraph (third paragraph of the Results and Discussion section) accordingly to make this more general.</p><p><italic>(ii) The closed data set comes from EDTA-treated, pipetted, pilus-deficient cells, while the open set comes from non-pipetted, pilus-positive complexes. Comparison of the average number of pili to the average number of complexes suggests, as the authors write, that 80% of complexes are not associated with pili. Do these pilus-free complexes resemble the “closed” complexes seen in the pipetted, EDTA-treated cells?</italic></p><p>The closed data set is indeed obtained from EDTA-treated, pipetted and pilus-depleted cells. However, the open state is also EDTA-treated (as described in the Materials and methods, subsection headed “Sample preparation”) but not pipetted. The pipetting step produces shearing forces that destroy the pili. It was this alteration in sample preparation that preserved more pili on the cells and enabled structural determination. The average of the closed state was therefore calculated from pilus-depleted cells. This point is now made clear in Results. The value of 80% was calculated from the average number of pili (determined in detail by us elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Salzer et al. 2014</xref>) and in agreement with tomographic data here), and the total number of closed complexes calculated from pilus-depleted cells. A comparison between open and closed complexes is explained in more detail in our response to D) below.</p><p><italic>D) To obtain the open state, the authors use strong EDTA treatment of cells to deplete the periplasm for the open state.

EDTA treatment depletes the periplasmic protein to an extent that is difficult to control precisely. While most of our tomograms were collected from cells with low periplasmic protein level and correspondingly high contrast, we have also been able to average a few complexes from a tomogram of the two cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, where the periplasmic protein density was considerably higher. These cells contained complexes both in the open and closed state (with and without pili). The subtomogram averages are shown in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>. Due to the poorer signal-to-noise ratio in the denser periplasm, we were able to identify reliably only a total of 16 open (the eye is guided by the pilus) and 11 closed complexes from these 2 cells combined. Even after Gaussian filtering to reduce noise the data quality is worse than for averages from cells with a more depleted periplasm. The new figure shows the PilQ component plus protein P2, which have distinguishable features. It is clear from these new data that the same large conformational changes occur in the T4P machinery, irrespective of the degree of periplasmic protein depletion, and hence of the effect of EDTA. Please note that without EDTA treatment, the periplasm was too dense to identify any complexes in the tomographic volumes.</p><p><italic>E) Related to D). The authors should introduce a caveat in the Results section that some molecules associated with the secretion pore may have been removed by the EDTA treatment and not make such strong points about “in situ” structures: the periplasm has been shrunk and emptied, at least partially</italic>.</p><p>We have included the requested statement (Results and Discussion) and related it to the new subtomogram averages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5–figure supplement 1</xref>, and discussed in the fourth paragraph of the same section) as described above.</p><p><italic>F) The authors comment that</italic> T. thermophilus <italic>was chosen due to its high transformation rate and convenient thermostability (Introduction). Could the authors comment on how their in situ findings might be generalized to other bacterial species that do not have unusually deep surface clefts or an “extraordinarily wide” periplasm (as stated in the Results and Discussion section)? Is it possible that these characteristics are responsible for exaggerated structural dynamics that more readily facilitate DNA uptake and thus the higher transformation rate?</italic></p><p><italic>Thermus</italic> thrives in hot environments. The wide periplasm (containing thick layers of secondary cell wall polymers) and the surface clefts may be an environmental adaptation. The T4P machinery does not co-localize with the clefts, so we do not think that the two are linked. It is however plausible that the length of the PilQ secretin has adapted to the wide periplasm. Importantly, proteins of the T4P machinery are functionally conserved (Nudleman et al. 2004) and thus we speculate that the overall architecture is similar across species. We have included a comment is this regard in the manuscript (at the end of the Results and Discussion section).</p><p>Whether PilQ in <italic>Thermus</italic> is responsible for particularly efficient DNA uptake and high transformation rates is questionable. Based on models of T4P-related DNA translocators, it is more likely that the AAA-ATPases or rudimentary DNA-translocator pili facilitate DNA uptake (Maier et al. 2002, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Maier et al. 2004</xref>). As this point is rather speculative we prefer not to comment on it in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>G) Some slightly more technical points:</italic></p><p><italic>i) The IMOD reconstruction showing the pilus does not show strong features. It is hard to see repeats in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C</italic></xref><italic>. Would it be possible to see a Fourier transform with a peak? The pili emanating from cells in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>are fairly long. Did the authors try to get 2D averages from the cryoEM images? If there is a repeat, then it should be easily visible from a few images. The issue is important because there are such strong differences from the pili of</italic> N. gonorrhoeae<italic>. In</italic> Neisseria<italic>, would one expect the T4P channel to be that much wider? Does it use other proteins or just more of them with more than 12-fold symmetry? Independent alignment and averaging of the present data should be tried, perhaps using the 0.143 FSC criterion</italic>.</p><p>We have altered <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> to a new tomographic slice that shows the repeat more clearly. We also now include a slice of the subtomogram average and the power spectra of both images. The power spectra show clear layer lines, which indicate that the structure is periodic. The distance of the layer lines from the equator is reciprocal to the pitch of the helix, which is measured as 1/(49 Å) or 4.9 nm. From the subtomogram average volume, we measured a repeat distance of 5.5 nm. Considering that the pixel size in the average is 0.42 nm, this change of 0.6 nm is within reasonable error of only ∼1.5 pixels. Calculation from the power spectra is less ambiguous, thus we especially thank the reviewers for this excellent suggestion. We have modified the repeat distance accordingly.</p><p>We did not try to get 2D averages from the cryoEM images because the signal from a single tilt series image (at low magnification and low dose compared to single particle cryo-EM images) is too weak to distinguish small features. We can barely see the pili in the images without performing a full tomographic reconstruction. Therefore we cannot align and average the present data by an independent method.</p><p>The most striking difference that can be observed at this resolution between the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> and <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> pili is their width. We have altered the Discussion and figure legend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in this respect. In the present work we have independently verified the width of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> pilus from two different samples. The first is from the subtomogram average of the open state, and the second is from the subtomogram average of the pilus alone. Both of these reveal an average width of ∼3 nm, only half the width of the ∼6 nm <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pilus. Pili from various species have been shown previously to vary in diameter by negative stain electron microscopy and modelling, and apart from the N-terminus, sequences are not well conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Craig and Li 2008</xref>). Thus it is not surprising that they exhibit structural differences at the cryoEM level. This point has been made clearer in the text (Results and Discussion). We have also improved <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> by docking our structure of the T4P into the open state of the machinery.</p><p>A cryoEM structure of an isolated and therefore closed state of PilQ exists from <italic>N. meningitidis</italic> (closely related to <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic>), which also displays 12-fold symmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al. 2004</xref>). The cryo structure shows that the channel is 9 nm wide, tapering to a point, and a homology model of the pilus (based on the <italic>N. gonorrhoeae</italic> pilus) is shown to be 6.5 nm wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al. 2003</xref>). The <italic>Thermus</italic> closed channel tapers from 8 nm at the widest point to 4 nm at the narrowest point, changing to a more constant 7 nm in the open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Therefore it is apparent that very large conformational changes allow the width of the channel to alter considerably on pilus extrusion. Thus we see no reason why the <italic>Neisseria</italic> channel formed by PilQ could not accommodate a pilus of 6 – 6.5 nm. We have made this point clearer in the text (Results and Discussion).</p><p><italic>ii) Is there any independent verification that T4P channels have 12-fold symmetry? The authors make heavy use of the symmetry, but it seems from the MS that they are relying on someone else's result</italic>.</p><p>We do make use of 12-fold symmetry, but this is in fact based on our own published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkhardt et al. 2011</xref>), which is also supported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Collins et al. 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Collins et al. 2004</xref>). We did not think it was necessary to verify the symmetry again in this work and have made the point clearer in Materials and methods (in the subsection headed “Subtomogram averaging”).</p><p><italic>iii) How confident can we be of the correspondence between the rings in the image from subtomogram averaging and the rings in the projection from negative staining of PilQ (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3C</italic></xref><italic>)? The spacings seem rather different. Could other components contribute to the rings in the intact sheath?</italic></p><p>The spacing between the rings is slightly different in the detergent-solubilized stained structure, and in situ in cells. However the complexes are in very different environments. The in situ environment has been cryo-preserved and the complexes, presumably with all their accessory proteins, are still embedded in the membrane, whereas the isolated PilQ is detergent-solubilized and stained. It is not surprising that a large complex that can undergo such major conformational changes may look slightly different after detergent solubilization and air-drying in negative stain. Nevertheless, whilst the ring spacing appears marginally altered, the dimensions of the subtomogram average of PilQ (diameter of complex, diameter of pore and length of complex) perfectly matches that of isolated PilQ. We have now included more of these comparative dimensions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> to make this point clear. Therefore, as also explained in point B), we do not think that other proteins contribute to the rings that have been assigned to PilQ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
