Here, we provide the neurosensory lineage reconstruction of a complex sensory organ, the inner ear, by imaging zebrafish embryos in vivo over an extended timespan, combining cell tracing and cell fate marker expression over time. We deliver the first dynamic map of early neuronal and sensory progenitor pools in the whole otic vesicle. It highlights the remodeling of the neuronal progenitor domain upon neuroblast delamination, and reveals that the order and place of neuroblasts’ delamination from the otic epithelium prefigure their position within the SAG. Sensory and non-sensory domains harbor different proliferative activity contributing distinctly to the overall growth of the structure. Therefore, the otic vesicle case exemplifies a generic morphogenetic process where spatial and temporal cues regulate cell fate and functional organization of the rudiment of the definitive organ.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22268.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22268.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Our ears, eyes and other sensory organs collect information about the world around us.

developmental biology is to explain how spatiotemporally controlled cell specification and differentiation occur alongside morphogenesis in the construction of functional organs. The inner ear is an attractive model to take on this challenge since it is accessible to manipulation, and it undergoes dynamic self-organization. It contains a manageable number of distinct cell types, which develop rapidly on an organized schedule to generate the functional units of the mature organ – the sensory patches. The key cell types of the inner ear, the supporting cells and the hair cells of the sensory patches, and the sensory neurons that innervate them, originate early during embryonic development from progenitors located in the otic vesicle, a 3D-structure arising from the otic placode adjacent to the developing hindbrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durruthy-Durruthy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Raft et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sapède et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Satoh and Fekete, 2005</xref>), and they are easy to score by morphology, position and specific markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haddon and Lewis, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raft and Groves, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whitfield, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>). All these features have established the inner ear as a model widely used for the study of patterning and cell specification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cai et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fritzsch et al., 2006a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Whitfield and Hammond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Despite a good understanding about the molecular hierarchies, the knowledge of how individual progenitors behave throughout patterning, proliferation, and morphogenesis remains elusive. Neuronal vs. sensory specification is achieved through well-defined bHLH transcription factors: <italic>atoh1</italic> for hair cell formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Millimaki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bermingham et al., 1999</xref>), <italic>neurog1</italic> for sensory neuron determination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andermann et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ma et al., 1998</xref>), and <italic>neuroD</italic> for sensory neuron differentiation and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jahan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2001</xref>). Signals arising in the surrounding tissues regionalize the otic vesicle along axes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maier and Whitfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Radosevic et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Riccomagno et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sapède and Pujades, 2010</xref>), and this multiple step process implies a gradual restriction of cell fates over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Whitfield and Hammond, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu and Kelley, 2012</xref>). However, the phenotypes of targeted mutants for these signaling pathways are not always easy to reconcile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Raft and Groves, 2015</xref>), due to the limited comprehension of how developmental gene regulatory networks are integrated. For this, cellular data are needed as it can address how patterns can be achieved while the cells proliferate and the tissue undergoes morphogenesis, which may affect cell positioning and exposure to signals, and therefore cell specification.</p><p>Recent developments in 4D-microscopy imaging and cell tracking tools permit now simultaneous measurements at high spatial-temporal coverage and resolution, and therefore the assessment of cell lineages and cell behaviors including displacements and proliferations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amat et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blanpain and Simons, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Keller, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Olivier et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Truong et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, it is time to progress in filling the void between gene regulatory networks and tissue architecture. With this purpose, we reconstructed the otic neurosensory lineage and investigated their single cell behavior by using in vivo imaging technologies paired with image processing tools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Faure et al., 2016</xref>). Our dynamic analyses revealed some surprising results such as the impact of neuroblast delamination and otic vesicle morphogenesis on the size and shape of this progenitor domain, and further that place and order of neuroblast delamination foreshadow their position within the statoacoustic ganglion (SAG). The comparative map of neuronal and sensory progenitors in the whole otic vesicle allows understanding how their distribution changes over time, being largely segregated with a small region of putative overlap. These findings provide the cellular data helping to understand how gene regulatory networks may work during development, tissue degeneration and regeneration.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expansion of the neuroblast delamination domain and formation of the SAG rudiment.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of the imaging and image processing strategy: inner ears of zebrafish embryos stained for cell membrane, nucleus and cell fate markers were imaged between 14-42 hpf.

We observed the first delamination events at 18 hpf in the most anterolateral region of the otic floor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–a’</xref>). This domain expanded towards middle and posterior regions with cells delaminating very close to the neural tube (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b–c´</xref>), as had been described by analysis of serial transverse sections from 22 hpf onwards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haddon and Lewis, 1996</xref>). Segmentation of the epithelial neuroD-domain allowed us to illustrate the quick expansion of this territory from anterolateral to posteromedial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d</xref>), and when comparing three different embryos this emerges as a common trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d</xref>). After the delamination domain is established many more cells delaminate from this territory, accumulating in the SAG just below the epithelium in close intimacy with the anterior lateral line ganglion (ALLg; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1i</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>).<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22268-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.006</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Early organization of neuroblasts within the SAG.</title><p>Tg[cldnb:lynGFP]Tg[Brn3c:GFP] embryos injected with H2B-mCherry mRNA were imaged, and reconstructed cell centers were color-coded according to their location/identity (see legend).

massively. The lineage tree shows that within six hours a big bulk of neuroblasts delaminates (see white, yellow and orange lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref> corresponding to single delaminated neuroblasts), and many neuroblasts can divide after exiting (see lines branching in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vemaraju et al., 2012</xref>). This lineage analysis allowed ascribing delamination time (see hpf in x-axis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>) and delamination position to each neuroblast. Then, we color-coded the reconstructed cell centers according to these two criteria and displayed them (i) early when in the otic vesicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,d,f</xref>), and (ii) late when within the SAG (c-c’,e-e’,g-g’). The first observation was that neuroblasts delaminated randomly in space and time (see intermingled colors of the reconstructed cell centers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), but their organization within the SAG relies on the delamination order as delaminated cells aggregate laterally to the preexisting ganglion (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>), thereby generating a mediolateral (ML) growth pattern with early-delaminated cells (white) located more medially than late-delaminated ones (red) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–c</xref>´; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref> for additional analysis). While the inner ear grows and undergoes morphogenesis, the SAG becomes squeezed in the space between the ventromedial wall of the ear and the neural tube, such that its organization is gradually converted from ML to dorsoventral (DV), with early-delaminated sensory neurons located in close contact with the neural tube (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). Thus, the time of neuroblast delamination foreshadows the ML gradient of neuronal differentiation in the SAG.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.010</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The organization of cells within the SAG relies on specific temporal and spatial cues.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Flat representation of the neuroblast lineage tree with branches indicating cell divisions.

We found that the relative position of progenitors foresees their final location in the SAG: neuroblasts from the anterior portion of the SAG delaminated from the anterolateral floor of the otic vesicle, while the ones of the posterior SAG derived from the posteromedial otic epithelium (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">Video 4</xref>). Next, we addressed whether the epithelial coordinates prefigure the position of neuroblasts in the SAG primordium. We observed that the anteroposterior (AP) coordinates of neuroblasts delamination (see differently colored epithelial cell center populations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) generally defined their relative AP position within the SAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–e’</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c–d’</xref> for additional analysis). These data show that progenitors delaminating within similar spatial regions along the AP axis maintain similar relative positions later on, and indeed the analysis of their trajectories indicates that cells, while in the otic epithelium, maintain their neighbor relationships. No such correlation was observed regarding the ML axis, because cells that were originally separated in the epithelium were found close in the SAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f–g’</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>), suggesting that the AP and time cues prevail. These findings establish a link between the place and order of neuroblast delamination and their neuronal (functional) identity within the SAG, and suggest the existence of a spatial and temporal regulation in the otic epithelium of the fate and exit of SAG neuroblasts.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media4" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22268-media4.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.013</object-id><label>Video 4.</label><caption><title>The anterior and posterior SAG neuronal populations derive from the anterior and posterior otic epithelium, respectively.</title><p>Neuroblasts belonging to distinct SAG neuronal populations, anterior or posterior (cyan/red), were backtracked to their otic epithelial origin prior to delamination.

Overall, these analyses suggest that (i) epithelial neuroblasts’ divisions give rise to cells that will delaminate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), and (ii) cell division is not necessary as a trigger for delamination.</p><p>Finally, we used the same dataset (ID Dataset: 140426aX; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>) to understand how the neuronal progenitor domain changes upon cell delamination and morphogenesis of the inner ear over time (orange circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>; n = 131 at 18 hpf). We followed as well the behavior of the surrounding otic epithelial cells as a repair for the edge of the progenitor domain (see grey circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, n = 64 at 26 hpf). Due to the massive cell delamination in a relatively short time (more than 150 delamination events in the period 18-26 hpf), the neuronal progenitor domain undergoes dramatic size and shape changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, compare the territory containing orange cell circles at 18 hpf and 26 hpf), as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haddon and Lewis (1996)</xref>. Upon delamination a large amount of cells exits from the otic epithelium: about 25% of total otic cells at 18 hpf are lost by delamination between 18 hpf and 22 hpf. The exit of neuroblasts and the growth of the vesicle are part of the morphogenetic processes that progressively restricted the progenitor field to a more lateral region of the ventral floor of the vesicle (orange cell centers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, 26 hpf).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Spatiotemporal development of the sensory patches</title><p>Hair cells are key cell types for building a functional sensory patch, and they are specified in the otic vesicle in the same way in all vertebrates. However, one difference is that in the fish the first hair cells differentiate while neuronal precursors are still delaminating, and that hair cells continue to be produced throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Haddon and Lewis, 1996</xref>). This raises the question of how neuronal and hair cell production is coordinated from progenitor domains located very close within the otic epithelium, and this led us to compare the progenitor maps for hair cells and neurons.</p><p>Up to date, the formation of the anterior (AM) and posterior (PM) maculae (the first sensory patches to arise) has been followed up by gene or transgene expression mainly in 2D, and therefore their proper allocation within the 3D-otocyst was difficult to assess. In order to understand how these sensory patches arose we followed in vivo the incorporation of newly differentiated hair cells. The first hair cells to arise -the so called tether cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Riley et al., 1997</xref>)- constituted the posterior pole of each of the maculae (white-dotted cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,c</xref>) and prefigured the position of these sensory patches within the otic vesicle (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Next, these two sensory patches gradually increased their size incorporating differentiated hair cells at their anterior pole with a specific pattern (see color-coded cell centers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>; ID Dataset: 140507aX; and see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,c</xref> for additional samples exhibiting the same pattern). At the same time, growth and morphogenesis of the vesicle led to a structure in which the AM remained anterior and ventral, and the PM positioned in the posterior ventral edge of the medial wall of the vesicle. Once hair cells differentiate they become postmitotic (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>). Thus, the formation of the sensory patches depends on a pool of progenitors providing postmitotic differentiated hair cells. AM and PM develop asynchronously, with the incorporation of new hair cells being delayed in the PM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sapède and Pujades, 2010</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Spatiotemporal pattern of hair cell differentiation and map of sensory progenitors.</title><p>Differentiated hair cells were tracked during 18 hr in control and MO-neurog1, and reconstructed cell centers were color-coded according to the differentiation time displayed in the legend (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).

To do so, we first undertook the dynamical analysis of maculae generation upon neurog1-downregulation by injection of translation-blocking morpholino (ID Dataset: 140519aX, <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>), which fully recapitulates the phenotype of <italic>neurog1<sup>hi1059</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sapède et al., 2012</xref>).

Tracking the differentiated hair cells allowed us to compare the dynamics of sensory development at the single-cell level: the overall spatial pattern of hair cell generation in the AM/PM was very similar between control and morphant embryos (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b–c with g–h</xref>); however the kinetics of hair cell production in the PM differed due to a boost of differentiation in MO-neurog1 from 34 hpf onwards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). All supernumerary hair cells in the MO-neurog1 originate from newly differentiated cells, and not from differentiated hair cells re-entering the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Video 6</xref>).</p><p>To unveil the organization of the PM hair cell progenitor pool we generated the map of hair cell progenitors in the whole otic vesicle over time (ID Datasets: 140507aX, 140326aX). For this, differentiated hair cells at 42 hpf were backtracked to their progenitor state, and information about differentiation time (color-code) and progenitor distribution was combined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d–e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). 3D-reconstructions revealed that progenitors for hair cells of the PM were distributed over the ventromedial domain of the otic vesicle at early stages of embryonic development (see color-coded cell centers in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), and that upon neurog1 inhibition the hair cell progenitor pool expanded along the anteroposterior dimension allocating more medially (ID Dataset: 140519aX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4i</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media7">Video 7</xref>). Furthermore, the position of hair cell progenitors foreshadows the organization of differentiated cells within the sensory patch, demonstrating that otic epithelial cells did not rearrange during early stages of hair cell differentiation. However, the relative positions of the maculae changed upon morphogenesis, resulting in the growth of the PM towards the anterior region while growth of the AM was mainly anterior and towards dorsal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c,h</xref>).

For this, we estimated the distribution of local cell densities over the entire otic epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m–n</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). While upon neurog1 abrogation the number of cells was greatly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5o</xref>; control = 384 ± 17 cells n = 3 vs<italic>. neurog1<sup>hi5109/hi5109</sup></italic> = 479 ± 14 cells n = 3 or MO-neurog1 = 506 ± 14 cells n = 2), the global pattern of cell densities did not change: cells in either condition are most densely packed in the anterolateral and ventral region and most spaced in the dorsal domain (see red and blue cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m–n</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). This suggests that the impact of non-delaminated cells in the compaction of the otic epithelium is low. Thus, if in the MO-neurog1 cell density is not altered but cell numbers are higher in the vesicle, the volume of the otic structure should be larger than the control one. Indeed, when assessing the volumes by 3D-point-cloud segmentation the otic vesicles of MO-neurog1 were larger than the control ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). Altogether these results show that the otic epithelium is a heterogeneous tissue, where proliferative activity and cell compaction differ between sensory and non-sensory domains during the generation of the neurosensory cellular elements.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media10" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22268-media10.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.025</object-id><label>Video 10.</label><caption><title>Local cell densities across the whole epithelium in control and MO-neurog1.</title><p>All cells of the otic epithelium in a control and a MO-neurog1 embryo are plotted and color-coded according to their estimated local cell density at 24 hpf.

These results enable us to: (i) understand the proportions of the system, (ii) reveal the impact of morphogenesis in the spatiotemporal distribution of neurosensory cell progenitor pools, and (iii) provide the cellular data to complement the well described gene regulatory networks involved in neurosensory specification. Our strategy has been to analyze in depth and detail few selected embryos, and support our findings with lower power analyses of other specimens. This analysis of progenitor populations in their native environment over extended timespans provides the opportunity to understand in vivo cell behaviors, both at the single cell level and at the cell population level. However, due to the technically demanding nature of the experiments and analyses the sample size could not be very high. All biological systems have intrinsic noise, and therefore variability: absolute cell numbers may differ between embryos, the onset of developmental processes might occur at slightly different times, or even distinct transgenic backgrounds may behave different. Therefore, to overcome these possible biases we analyzed additional specimens with lower power analysis and demonstrate that our approach can yield reproducible results in terms of cell type proportions and cellular behaviors.</p><p>To assure the robust outcome of a functional inner ear, with sensory patches containing the precise number of mechanosensory hair cells properly innervated by sensory neurons arranged in a precise topology (<xref ref-type="other" rid="media11">Video 11</xref>), the developmental strategy used by distinct progenitor populations differs: neuronal specification is concomitant with proliferation (before/after delamination), while hair cell specification and differentiation lead to postmitotic cells indicating that the final number of sensory cells relies on the control of the progenitor pool. Interestingly, the position of hair cell progenitors foreshadows the organization of differentiated cells within the sensory patch, demonstrating that although the otic vesicle undergoes morphogenesis and cells do extensively proliferate, progenitors do not rearrange within the epithelium during early stages of hair cell differentiation.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media11" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-22268-media11.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.026</object-id><label>Video 11.</label><caption><title>Innervated sensory patches in the embryonic inner ear.</title><p>Animation of a Tg[Brn3:GFP]Tg[Isl3:GFP] embryo displaying the sensory patches with differentiated cellular neurosensory elements in green at 48 hpf.

However, their epithelial origin and how SAG neuroblasts acquire their specific identity are still open questions. Here we show the importance of place and time of neuroblast delamination in their allocation within the SAG, and shed light on how distinct information may converge in the progenitor cells. Delamination place confers position along the AP axis of the SAG, and therefore function, most probably as the result of the integration of patterning signals involved in the emergence of the different domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Maier and Whitfield, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Radosevic et al., 2011</xref>). Additionally, delamination time prefigures the relative position of early-delaminated neuroblasts vs. late-delaminated ones and therefore, the gradient of neuronal differentiation within the SAG. Consequently, an epithelial neuroblast will need to integrate spatial (its position in the epithelium) and temporal (its time of delamination) information for its final allocation within the SAG. However, to achieve the fully functional organ, complexity needs to increase later on possibly by some new delamination events, division of SAG neuroblasts and changes in morphology. Given that auditory neurons, which innervate the PM, accumulate later than the vestibular neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sapède and Pujades, 2010</xref>), it is possible that the majority of neuroblasts becoming auditory neurons may delaminate from posterior domains, since no specific increase in cell proliferation has been observed at later stages in the posterior part of the SAG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vemaraju et al., 2012</xref>). However, if this is the mechanism and how it is controlled remain to be explored.</p><p>The knowledge of how the gradient of neuronal differentiation within the SAG is built up helps the comprehension of its differential gene expression pattern according to the neuronal differentiation state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zecca et al., 2015</xref>), and the organized distribution of differentiated neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vemaraju et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, our results provide (i) a model to discuss how the selection of different progenitors and the determination of their relative population size could be regulated, which would not be possible to derive by gene expression only, and (ii) a framework to challenge the system –both in silico and in vivo- upon modification of key factors for cell fate decisions and patterning.</p><p>Interesting to note is that during a relatively short period of time, 18-30 hpf, a big proportion of epithelial neuroblasts delaminate. This drives a dramatic remodeling of the neurosensory progenitor domain that may lead to changes in the exposure of progenitor domains to sources of signals, such as Shh from the floor plate and the ventral neural tube. This loss of epithelial cells is probably compensated for by the active proliferation in the dorsal non-sensory territory in order to keep the homeostasis of the organ.</p><p>Finally, we provide the dynamic map of neurosensory progenitors based on in vivo cell lineage studies supplying a global and temporal perspective to previous otic neurosensory lineage analyses, which were mainly focused on the spatial dynamics of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Durruthy-Durruthy et al., 2014</xref>). This permits targeting and challenging progenitor pools specifically. Therefore, our findings establish a ground to further explore intrinsic vs. extrinsic models for cell fate determination, and will contribute to the mechanistic understanding of the developmental gene regulatory networks.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish strains</title><p>Zebrafish embryos were obtained by mating of adult fish using standard methods.

The delamination domain (identified by otic epithelial neuroD:GFP expression) and the otic vesicle volume (determined from the lyn-TdTomato signal) were segmented, and the resulting. vtk files were used to display neuroD-epithelial neuroblasts and membrane signal of the otic epithelium only (FIJI-3D viewer).</p><p>For cell lineage analysis, validated centers were grouped in selections and displayed with different appearances either alone or in context of the original data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1h–i</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–g’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–d’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c,f–h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b–c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a–b,d–e,g–h,j–k</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Cell lineages were also displayed as lineage trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>).</p><p>For analysis of cell proliferative activities over time, cell centers were grouped in selections according to cell states (eg. dividing or non dividing) and these data were further explored within SciPy, a Python-based ecosystem for scientific computing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Namely the data was imported as Pandas DataFrames; different time points and samples were registered using the iterative closest points transformation algorithm as implemented in. vtk and the results were plotted using matplotlib and seaborn.</p><p>To estimate the local cell density the other cell centers within 20 µm of each center were counted, and this number was then divided by the volume of a sphere of that radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5m–n</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">Video 10</xref>). The nearest neighbor distance (NN-distance) was used instead when comparing subsets of cell centers to limit boundary effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a,b</xref>). Both estimates were calculated using <italic>k</italic>-d-trees as implemented in the SciPy library.</p><p>For studying cell shape changes upon delamination, single neuroblasts delaminating from the ventromedial aspect of the otic vesicle were chosen for automatic segmentation (n = 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–g’</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">Video 2</xref>). Additionally to the reconstructed cell center that defines the lineage of the cell, two more cell centers were added to each cell at each time step to serve as seed points for segmentation. Automatic segmentation of these cells was then generated by the GSUBSURF method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mikula et al., 2011</xref>), which is an image segmentation method based on solving a level set partial differential equation of the form<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">|</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">|</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">|</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mo fence="false" stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>,</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> is an edge detector function depending on the intensity function of the segmented grayscale image and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are positive real constants steering strength of advective velocity field and curvature regularization.

The equation is solved numerically on image voxel grid by the semi-implicit finite volume scheme, and the initial condition is constructed so that we have a reasonable initial approximation of the segmented cell (e.g. a union of spheres or ellipsoids centered in the provided cell centers).</p><p>To calculate the volume of the otic vesicle a semi-automatic strategy was applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>), because a fully automatic segmentation of the otic vesicle structure is a rather complicated task – it is not trivial to construct an appropriate initial condition and to distinguish the borders of the vesicle from the borders of the surrounding cells. A set of points (usually containing 100–300 points) lying on the surface of the vesicle was marked manually using FIJI; the inner and the outer surfaces were represented by separate point sets. Then, we used a method for the reconstruction of 3D objects from point clouds based on Lagrangian evolution of surfaces in 3D and the corresponding evolution model reads<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∂</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">∇</mml:mi><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Δ</mml:mi><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>υ</mml:mi><mml:mi>T</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Here, we directly evolve the surface represented by the map (parametrization) <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>.

The evolving surface is approximated by a triangulated surface. That means that at the end of the evolution, we directly obtain a triangular representation of the otic vesicle surfaces that can be easily used to compute the volume of the vesicle. As in the case of cell segmentation, the evolution model is discretized semi-implicitly in time and by a finite volume method in space.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We are grateful to T Pujol for his valuable help in SPIM imaging and Zeiss for use of the Lightsheet Z.1 microscope.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by K VijayRaghavan (Senior editor), and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Although all three reviewers are positive about the work and agree that it represents a technical tour de force, the issue of generalising from the low sample sizes has resulted in considerable discussion between the reviewers, Reviewing Editor and Senior Editor. Overall, we are supportive of the work, and so would like to give you the opportunity to address our remaining concerns.</p><p>Specifically, the following points should be addressed:</p><p>1) The authors need to be much more explicit about stating the sample sizes in the text. Numbers of embryos and numbers of ears, and how these relate to the datasets presented in the tables, should be stated clearly throughout the text.</p><p>2) The partial datasets presented in the tables and the numbers of ears/embryos analysed should be supported, where possible, by presentation of the additional data in supplementary form. The reviewers are hopeful that these partial datasets can be used more effectively to lend support to the main findings.</p><p>3) The authors should acknowledge and discuss the limitations of their work and the risks of generalising from small sample sizes.</p><p>Further detail is given in the full reviews, which are appended below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>As before, I am generally supportive of this work, in principle. The writing is improved and all of my minor concerns have been addressed. However, the revised manuscript still does not address my only major concern – e.g. that most data reflect detailed analysis of only single embryos. The tables provided in the revision indicate that multiple embryos were examined for each set of experiments, but analysis of the &quot;extra&quot; embryos does not appear to be shown in any figures, and the bulk of data presented in the main display figures does not include more than one embryo. For example, a single embryo was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Videos 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">5</xref>. It is also possible that this same embryo was used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, although this is ambiguous. Similarly, it is possible that only one control embryo and one neurog1 morphant were used for the bulk of data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media6">Videos 6</xref>–<xref ref-type="other" rid="media10">10</xref>. Information about which embryos were analyzed should be explicitly stated in the figure legends. These figures do provide tremendous detail about a few select embryos, but I am still concerned about whether the patterns and trends they display are reproducible. For the &quot;extra&quot; embryos mentioned in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, presumably the data could be presented in supplemental figures even if they are not as extensive of those in the display figures. Additionally, I feel there should greater effort to consider average trends taken from multiple embryos and somehow display such trends in the figures, such as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5O</xref>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is the second revision of this manuscript that I have reviewed previously. The first revision was primarily a rewrite, with no additional data. In this revision, the authors have added some samples of normal and Neurog1 morphants to quantify the total number of cells in the otic vesicle. A few additional embryos were added to analyze delamination kinetics, location of delamination (using unpublished data provide to the reviewers) and the pattern of hair cell differentiation. I also think this version does a better job of describing how the tracing of single cells through the stages of neurogenesis, gangliogenesis and hair cell formation, adds to the current state of knowledge about inner ear morphogenesis in the zebrafish. The movies are beautiful, the image analysis is sophisticated, and the insights gained primarily concern prepatterning of the neural progenitors based on location and timing of delamination. Additionally, by tracing progenitor proliferation in the neurog1 morphants, the authors ask whether or not the absence of neuroblast delamination could alter the proliferation or behavior of the cells that are thus remaining in the otocyst. This gives rise to otocysts that are larger, but no significant changes in cell behavior. The resulting increase in sensory cells does not, apparently, come from a change in proliferation of the progenitors, but is most likely a fate switch.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript is improved over the previous version and the authors have dealt with many of the referees' comments. It is clear that the work represents considerable effort and will be of use and importance as a reference study for those working on the zebrafish ear. There are interesting observations concerning the place and timing of the emergence of otic neuroblasts from the zebrafish otic epithelium. This is the first time that such a detailed imaging study has been performed on the live embryo to address the process of otic neurogenesis.</p><p>I still find that the quantification is not entirely clear. The authors state in their rebuttal that 'our approach provides information about the scale of the system, as stated throughout the manuscript, not in absolute cell numbers that as we know they may differ among individuals'. I find this confusing. What do the authors mean by a difference between scale and absolute cell numbers? The data show individual nuclei and therefore they do appear to provide very precise information about absolute cell numbers, but only in a few individuals, and thus is it hard to generalise these findings.</p><p>Information about datasets is now provided in two tables, but it is still very difficult to work out from these exactly how many fish have been used, and how many ears (one or both) from each fish have been imaged. Given the concerns raised from the earlier version of the manuscript, the authors must be up-front in stating exactly how many embryos and ears their analyses are based on. This information is hidden, and the descriptions do not always appear to match the tabled information. For example, the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> states that 'embryos' (plural) were used, but in the table, this transgenic and time combination refers to a single dataset. Is this one ear from one embryo? Information on numbers of ears and embryos should be provided at the start of the Results section, before a description of the findings, in addition to statements in the Materials and methods section and in the Figure legends. The relationship between datasets in the tables and numbers of individuals should be explained. This applies both to the wild-type studies and those in the neurog1 morphants.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22268.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] Specifically, the following points should be addressed:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) The authors need to be much more explicit about stating the sample sizes in the text. Numbers of embryos and numbers of ears, and how these relate to the datasets presented in the tables, should be stated clearly throughout the text.</italic> </p><p>To improve this point we made the following changes:</p><p>1) We now clearly state at the beginning of the Results section that: “We addressed these questions by exploring in depth and detail a selected number of embryos and support our findings with less extensive analyses of additional embryos, which we provide in supplementary form.”</p><p>2) We explain in the Materials and methods (section “Embryo mounting and SPIM imaging”) and in <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref> legends that each dataset corresponds to the imaging of a distinct embryo inner ear except for 140402aX in which both ears were imaged. We included that we have performed deep and detailed analyses in few datasets and supported the main findings with partial analyses of additional datasets mainly included in supplementary figures.</p><p>3) We improved <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">2</xref>, explaining the ID datasets characteristics (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>) and for what questions they were used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>), and indicating in which figures they were employed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We organized the datasets in both tables by order of appearance within the manuscript. We think <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref> might be a bit repetitive with the information provided in figure legends, but we consider it can be helpful and would like to keep it.</p><p>4) We named the ID dataset used in every figure legend, and when a supplementary figure including additional analyses applies (to the presented finding) it is clearly indicated (eg: ID Dataset: 140210aX; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> for additional analyses).</p><p>5) We mention, throughout the text, when not disturbing, the ID Dataset used in that experiment.</p><p><italic>2) The partial datasets presented in the tables and the numbers of ears/embryos analysed should be supported, where possible, by presentation of the additional data in supplementary form. The reviewers are hopeful that these partial datasets can be used more effectively to lend support to the main findings.</italic> </p><p>We have made an effort to present better the data obtained from the additional datasets in supplementary figures, and always – when possible – we displayed the data from multiple embryos together to show the average trend. We have included the following:</p><p>1) A new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> with the comparative analysis of four ears from three datasets (140210aX, 140225aX, 140306aX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). This supports the observation made in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B-D</xref>, about the expansion of the delamination territory towards posterior. Accordingly, description of these results can be found in p5.</p><p>2) A new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) displaying the analysis performed with another dataset (140423aX), to support that place and time of neuroblast delamination prefigure their position within the SAG.</p><p>3) Two new panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> showing that the order of hair cell differentiation and their relative position within the otic epithelium follow the same pattern in distinct embryos (in three ears from two datasets: 140402aX; 140326aX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>).</p><p>4) Panel C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> displays as well the PM hair cell progenitor map obtained with this dataset (ID Dataset: 140326aX). This supports our conclusion that the position of hair cell progenitors foreshadows the organization of differentiated cells within the sensory patch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>5) A new panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, displaying a plot with the NN-distances of ventral vs. dorsal or ventromedial vs. dorsolateral territories in four inner ears (ID Datasets: 140507aX, 140519aX, 140430aX, 140426aX; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This allows to see a common trend: cells within the ventral domain are more compacted that in dorsal territories.</p><p><italic>3) The authors should acknowledge and discuss the limitations of their work and the risks of generalising from small sample sizes.</italic> </p><p>We have largely discussed the limitations of our approach at the beginning of the Discussion section, in order to make the reader aware of the sample size.</p><p>In addition we have rephrased and properly explained what we meant with 'our approach provides information about the scale of the system. Our point is that these analyses allow us to seize the proportion of the system and to help us understand how it behaves, in terms of proportions rather than in absolute numbers.</p></body></sub-article></article>
