This involves a spino-bulbospinal control circuit incorporating Barrington’s nucleus in the pons (Barr). Ponto-spinal glutamatergic neurons that express corticotrophin-releasing hormone (CRH) form one of the largest Barr cell populations. Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons can generate bladder contractions, but it is unknown whether they act as a simple switch or provide a high-fidelity pre-parasympathetic motor drive and whether their activation can actually trigger voids. Combined opto- and chemo-genetic manipulations along with multisite extracellular recordings in urethane anaesthetised CRH<sup>Cre</sup> mice show that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons provide a probabilistic drive that generates co-ordinated voids or non-voiding contractions depending on the phase of the micturition cycle. CRH itself provides negative feedback regulation of this process. These findings inform a new inferential model of autonomous micturition and emphasise the importance of the state of the spinal gating circuit in the generation of voiding.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>barrington's nucleus</kwd><kwd>micturition</kwd><kwd>bladder</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK098361</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fry</surname><given-names>Christopher H</given-names></name><name><surname>Kanai</surname><given-names>Anthony J</given-names></name><name><surname>Drake</surname><given-names>Marcus J</given-names></name><name><surname>Pickering</surname><given-names>Anthony E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108899/Z/15</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sales</surname><given-names>Anna C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Ponto-spinal CRH neurons in Barrington’s nucleus are a core component of an inferential circuit that regulates autonomous micturition and generates voids when the bladder is full.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The regulated production, storage and elimination of liquid waste as urine (micturition) plays a critical homeostatic role in maintaining the health of organisms. Like breathing, this involves precisely co-ordinated autonomic (parasympathetic and sympathetic) and somatic motor drives and has both voluntary and autonomous (involuntary) control mechanisms. The power of the autonomous drive is illustrated by the challenge faced by anyone <italic>‘caught short’</italic> away from a socially acceptable location for urination. Disorders of autonomous micturition (resulting in involuntary voiding) are seen in overactive bladder syndrome, enuresis and following frontal lobe lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drake et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Banakhar et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nevéus, 2017</xref>). Barrington’s nucleus, also known as the pontine micturition centre, is a key site for the control of urination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrington, 1925</xref>). The prevailing concept of the neural control of micturition is that afferent information from the bladder is conveyed via the spinal cord to the brainstem and periaqueductal gray (PAG) in the midbrain where it is integrated with information from higher centres such as hypothalamus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blok and Holstege, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Shefchyk, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drake et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">de Groat and Wickens, 2013</xref>). The synaptic drive from these centres is relayed to Barrington’s nucleus which appears to be a key command point for micturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Valentino et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>When the bladder is full, a threshold is reached and a neural command to void is relayed from Barrington’s nucleus to the lumbosacral parasympathetic neurons and urethral sphincter motoneurons. Lesions of Barrington’s nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrington, 1925</xref>) or acute transection of the pons abolishes micturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">De Groat, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sadananda et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, supra-collicular decerebration or transection of PAG does not stop micturition in cats, rats or mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takasaki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sadananda et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Similarly, co-ordinated voiding is seen under anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavcovich and Valentino, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>) when the contextual element of volitional voiding is removed. This constitutes autonomous micturition. Electrical or chemical stimulation of Barrington’s nucleus induces bladder contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holstege et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noto et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mallory et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sasaki and Sato, 2013</xref>). Functional imaging studies in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blok et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nour, 2000</xref>) and rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tai et al., 2009</xref> found activity in the dorsal pons during voiding. Thus, Barrington’s nucleus is pivotal in the voiding reflex and is part of the minimal spino-bulbospinal circuit that generates autonomous voids and is believed to be the pre-parasympathetic control centre.</p><p>One of the largest populations of Barrington’s nucleus neurons expresses corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ruggiero et al., 1999</xref>) and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vincent and Satoh, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Valentino et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valentino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verstegen et al., 2017</xref>) and their axons terminate in the vicinity of the sacral parasympathetic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valentino et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verstegen et al., 2017</xref>). The role of these CRH-positive neurons in Barrington’s nucleus (Barr<sup>CRH</sup>) has recently been explored using CRH<sup>CRE</sup> mice to enable specific opto- and chemo-genetic manipulation of their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). These studies indicated that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons were glutamatergic, their activation caused bladder contraction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>) and increasing their excitability increased the probability of micturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>). A second smaller subgroup of oestrogen receptor type-1 positive neurons in Barrington’s nucleus (Barr<sup>ESR1</sup>) have been shown to be important for control of the urethral sphincter in voluntary scent marking with urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). Further a group of layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the primary motor cortex plays a role in the descending control of voluntary urination via their projections to Barrington’s nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). A common feature of many of these functional studies is that they have focussed on volitional voiding behaviours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>), such as scent marking of males in the presence of females which depends on descending inputs to the brainstem to trigger the voiding behaviour. This has led to different hypotheses about the role of the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in mediating voids in conscious mice with several studies concluding that they play a supporting rather than a primary role in generating voids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Single-unit recordings of micturition-related neurons in the vicinity of Barrington’s nucleus in rats and cats showed multiple different patterns of activity with either increased or decreased firing during bladder contractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sugaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sasaki, 2005a</xref>). These results were thought to reflect the neural heterogeneity within Barrington’s nucleus and/or be due to the complex neural circuits in nearby brainstem sites involved the regulation of other pelvic visceral functions. More recent microwire recordings of the dorsal pons in rats reported neurons in the vicinity of Barrington’s nucleus that have more homogeneous firing patterns, characterised by tonic activity with phasic bursts that were temporally associated with the voiding phase of the micturition cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>) but they also show bursts of activity between voids that were not associated with increases in bladder pressure. A common technical limitation of these pontine neural recordings is the difficulty of identifying specific cell populations during or after recordings. This has been addressed for populations of Barrington’s neurons through fibre-photometry of genetically encoded calcium indicators in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yao et al., 2018</xref>) to show that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> and Barr<sup>ESR1</sup> neuronal activity increases around the time of voiding/scent marking respectively. However, the limited temporal and spatial resolution of the indicator and technique limits the ability to address whether this activity drives or follows micturition behaviour and the associated increase in bladder pressure. Therefore, the exact role of the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in micturition and specifically in autonomous micturition remains unclear – although it has recently been suggested they may play a more prominent (but relatively weak) role in promoting voids in anaesthetised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>). It is presumed that they act as a central control centre generating a pre-parasympathetic drive to the bladder but it is not known whether they are sufficient on their own to generate a co-ordinated void through their actions on spinal circuits.</p><p>Here, we study the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in the autonomous micturition cycle in anaesthetised mice using opto- and chemo-genetic interventions as well as recordings of the firing activity of identified Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in vivo. This has informed the development of a model indicating that these Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons provide a probabilistic signal to spinal circuits that is gated to trigger either non-voiding bladder contractions, which enable inferences to be made about the degree of bladder fullness, or voiding if a threshold level of pressure has been reached.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons modulate micturition</title><p>Recent studies have drawn apparently contrasting conclusions about the role and importance of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in the regulation of volitional voiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). To further define their role, the light-activated cation channel ChR2 (channelrhodopsin-2) was selectively expressed in Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons of CRH<sup>CRE</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>) using a Cre-dependent adeno-associated viral vector (AAV-EF1α-DIO-ChR2-mcherry) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Tonic unilateral activation of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons (5–20 Hz x 20 ms, 465 nm light pulses, applied for three completed voiding cycles) produced an increase of micturition frequency (to 153.2 ± 15.6% of basal after 10 Hz stimulation, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) manifesting as a significant shortening in inter-void interval associated with a reduction of the threshold pressure for voiding (84.0 ± 4.7% at 10 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

However, the activity of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons, is not a simple switch mechanism for voiding nor do they provide a direct drive to bladder pressure (as might be expected for an autonomic command neuron). Instead these neurons play a more nuanced, probabilistic role. Their influence on the bladder depends on the state of priming of the downstream parasympathetic motor circuit. This identifies the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons as being the efferent limb of an inferential circuit that assays bladder state repeatedly during the storage phase of the cycle.

We suggest that such descending control provides an internalised signal, replacing the need for additional external peripheral sensory input, to trigger the void. Dysfunction of this descending control system, as is seen following spinal cord injury, results in a loss of voluntary control and initially in a complete loss of continence, but this tends to be restored as the spinal micturition reflex re-emerges (albeit in a poorly co-ordinated manner). This situation was mimicked experimentally herein by the chemogenetic inhibition of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons – leading to a prolongation of the inter-void interval and retained volumes with progressive bladder distension – indicating that this is a necessary and critical component of the micturition circuit.</p><p>We used cystometry in anaesthetised mice to examine the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons specifically in the core processes of autonomous micturition in the absence of behavioural influence. This has produced a number of different findings from previous optogenetic studies of the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in micturition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>) which we have ascribed to the contrast between volitional and autonomous micturition behaviour. However, an important caveat is that anaesthetic agents by definition alter neuronal function, typically suppressing activity, and they have been found to affect aspects of murine micturition by a number of authors (see review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2017</xref>). Urethane has been adopted by many research groups as the agent producing the least autonomic suppression and for its stable plane of anaesthesia. The cystometric profile and the characteristic activity of the EUS seen in this study is akin to that seen in awake mice and in decerebrate arterially perfused preparations in the absence of anaesthesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, the fact that we find an apparent increase in the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons argues against urethane anaesthesia accounting for the differences between our findings and those in conscious mice. This remains to be definitively tested and we hypothesise that the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in autonomous voiding may be best demonstrated in sleeping rather than conscious, behaving mice.</p><p>Rodents also use social urine scent marking, for example male mice use strategic urine ‘spotting’ to express their dominance and territorial ownership (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Desjardins et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Maruniak et al., 1974</xref>). Although autonomous micturition and scent marking with urine are related processes, likely with some shared physiology, there are also differences in the patterns of urination with greater frequency (&gt;10 urine spots per minute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>) and accordingly smaller volumes in each urine spot compared to a primary void (typically 80–120 ul) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ito et al., 2018</xref>). A role has recently been described for Barr<sup>ESR1</sup> neurons in social urine spotting evoked by female urine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>). These Barr<sup>ESR1</sup> neurons preferentially target a spinal inter-neuronal circuit that is proposed to be involved in generating the bursting drive to the EUS as well as causing a bladder contraction. In contrast, in the same study, the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons were reported to be relatively ineffective in generating voids under similar conditions (without active filling of the bladder) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A similar conclusion was reached by Verstegen and colleagues who compared the effect of activating Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons with the activation of all the glutamatergic neurons in Barrington’s nucleus (including the ESR1 neurons) and found that global glutamatergic activation produced obligatory voiding with the characteristic of incontinence. In contrast activation of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons only sporadically produced co-ordinated voiding with a delay and only with 6% of activations although this was a little higher at 17% in anaesthetised mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>). This evidence led both groups to conclude that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons only played a minor supporting, augmentative role in the generation of voids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavcovich and Valentino, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ito et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>). This is somewhat surprising given that the majority of spinally projecting Barr neurons are CRH positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verstegen et al., 2017</xref>) raising the question of why they have such an apparently minor role in voiding. With hindsight, a clue to this puzzle may have been offered by the finding of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al. (2019)</xref> that genetic, diphtheria toxin-mediated, ablation of the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons produced a phenotype of increased voided volume in awake mice and markedly delayed voiding during cystometry in anaesthetised mice.</p><p>Our study shows that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons can effectively trigger co-ordinated voiding with the characteristic pattern of external urethral sphincter bursting when the bladder is sufficiently filled. This triggering is not just a simple consequence of the pressure rise produced by Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neuronal activation (ie a switch) - as prolonged activation of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons leads to increased voiding frequency with a lowered threshold for voiding (and chemogenetic inhibition has the opposite effect). Indeed, the concept of the existence of a simple pressure threshold for triggering a void is challenged by the observation that large spontaneous non-voiding contractions occurred just prior to a void that exceed any estimated threshold for a subsequent void. Rather we believe that the drive from Barr<sup>CRH</sup> needs to be integrated at a spinal level with feedback from bladder afferents in order to generate a complete void – and thus the probability of evoking a void depends on the degree of bladder filling. When the bladder is partially filled, activation of the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons evokes bladder contractions (eNVC) without any sphincter activity, suggesting that the drive to the sphincter is also dependent on the state of a downstream pattern generator and is not directly engaged by the firing of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons at all stages of the micturition cycle. Our preliminary experiments found no evidence for the involvement of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in the control of the distal colon, suggesting they are bladder specific.</p><p>Given the mechanistic differences between the processes of autonomous micturition and voluntary scent marking in males, it is quite likely that there are distinct circuit drives for each type of urination. This would be consistent with the proposition that there are parallel pathways from Barrington’s nucleus to the downstream spinal pattern generators: the Barr<sup>ESR1</sup> neurons driving spotting behaviour which can be triggered irrespective of the degree of fullness of the male mouse bladder; and the other mediated by Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons which conditionally requires the bladder to be distended before a void can be generated. This may also explain why chemogenetic inhibition of the Barr<sup>ESR1</sup> but not Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons blocked spotting whereas similar inhibition of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons inhibited autonomous micturition in the current study. Our study did not set out to identify gender differences in Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neuronal function in micturition and we included mice of both sexes. Although female mice had smaller bladder capacities along with larger basal and micturition pressures on CMG there were no differences in their other parameters and their EUS-EMG trace was qualitatively similar in pattern during voiding. Equally both sexes showed similar responses to activation/inhibition of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons which presumably relates to underlying commonalities in the processes of autonomous micturition.</p><p>In this context it is also important to acknowledge that the pattern of micturition varies to a degree across species and humans and cats do not show the same ‘squirting’ behaviour as their EUS relaxes to allow voiding – this likely involves some distinctive neuronal circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fowler et al., 2008</xref>). However, there are also many similarities including, surprisingly, in the time taken to void irrespective of body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yang et al., 2014</xref>) indicating that many of the fundamental principles of operation are conserved. Importantly, lesions or inhibition of Barrington’s nucleus abolishes voiding in multiple species including humans, cats, rats and mice consistent with it being a core circuit component reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Verstegen et al. (2017)</xref>.</p><p>The pattern of firing activity seen here in optogenetically-identified Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in anaesthetised mice is similar to that previously noted in recordings from Barrington’s nucleus in the conscious rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Manohar et al., 2017</xref>) and is also reminiscent of a subset of the neurons identified in anaesthetised or decerebrate rats and cats that showed a ramping activity with voiding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Groat et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sugaya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sasaki, 2005b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sasaki, 2005a</xref>). The bursting activity seen in the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> recordings clearly precedes the changes in bladder pressure (and with a similar lag to bladder pressure response to that found from optogenetic activation of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons) indicating that they are driving rather than responding to the changes in pressure. The Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons showed a pattern of spiking activity that is also consistent with that noted from the Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging recordings seen with fibre photometry in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>) although we can see both the temporal precedence and that this activity decays promptly at the end of the void. It is also worth noting that in none of these recordings (from Barr<sup>CRH</sup> or indeed any of the neurons in the vicinity) was any pattern of activity seen that resembled the high frequency bursting of the urethral sphincter seen in mice and rats – to date such activity has never been observed in any of the recordings from Barrington’s nucleus which is consistent with the idea that it is generated from a spinal motor pattern generator such as the LSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>The probabilistic nature of the influence of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons on bladder pressure seems initially at odds with the clear relationship between their activity and bladder pressure noted herein (and previously in the E2 class of neurons recorded in rat Barrington’s nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tanaka et al., 2003</xref>] and also in fibre photometry recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al. (2016)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Verstegen et al., 2019</xref>). However, this relationship only holds in the late stage of the micturition cycle when Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons do indeed act as a tightly-coupled, direct command neuron. This is not the case during the early phases of the micturition cycle when there is a weak relationship between the activity of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons and the bladder pressure, in the extreme case leading to ‘failures’ of stimulation to evoke any contraction. Our recordings indicate that this happens downstream of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> at a spinal level, as the ability to optogenetically drive Barr<sup>CRH</sup> is unchanged and spinal activation of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> axons also shows failures. We propose a model for this action that integrates an incrementing and summating, but still sub-threshold, afferent drive from the bladder to PPN that enables a phasic burst of activity from Barr<sup>CRH</sup> to generate progressively larger numbers of action potentials and hence contraction when the bladder is sufficiently filled. In support of this idea, previous electrical stimulation studies of Barrington’s nucleus in the rat indicated that the degree of excitation of the parasympathetic motor outflow to the bladder was strongly dependent upon the degree of bladder filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noto et al., 1991</xref>). The mechanisms enabling such priming of the parasympathetic control circuit will merit further investigation at a spinal level.</p><p>The inhibitory action of CRH released from Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons on micturition at a spinal level initially appears counterintuitive given the overall excitatory effect of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons (mediated via fast glutamatergic signalling, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>) on micturition and the known excitatory effects at a cellular level of CRH receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lovejoy et al., 2014</xref>). However, a similar inhibitory spinal action of CRH on micturition has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pavcovich and Valentino, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiddoo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wood et al., 2013</xref>). This inhibition may act to suppress the segmental excitatory activity in the spinal parasympathetic circuit. This process may also be involved in the transition from the immature spinal voiding circuit in the neonate that is supplanted by the top down requirement for Barrington’s nucleus signals. The mismatch between the differential time-course of action of CRH-mediated inhibition (metabotropic) and the fast, glutamatergic excitation (ionotropic) may enable the initial rapid excitation of parasympathetic preganglionic neurones at the onset of voiding, but may also in turn act to help terminate voids and facilitate the unopposed relaxation of the bladder. The spinal mechanism of CRH actions at a spinal circuit level constitutes an intriguing target for therapeutic intervention potentially allowing modification of the gain of the micturition reflex in disease states.</p><p>We noted that bursts of activity in Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons precede both voids and also NVCs. There has been considerable debate about the origin of NVCs with respect to whether they are intrinsically generated by the bladder and their functional significance although there is a suggestion that they provide a means to infer the degree of bladder filling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drake, 2007</xref>). An increase in their frequency and amplitude has been linked to diseases of the LUT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vahabi and Drake, 2015</xref>) and also with loss of descending control from the brainstem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sadananda et al., 2011</xref>) which could conceivably be related to the loss of CRH-mediated spinal inhibition. There is also evidence of their peripheral generation by the bladder early in development which becomes less coordinated in adult bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kanai et al., 2007</xref>). We provide evidence that NVCs are generated by the ‘noisy’ probabilistic drive from Barrington’s nucleus that repeatedly assesses the status of the spinal circuit during each micturition cycle and that the magnitude of the bladder pressure response reflects the phase of the micturition cycle. The resulting afferent signal provides an active way of inferring the degree of bladder fullness (analogous to the ‘sampling’ that assesses rectal fullness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rao, 2004</xref>) and could prime the neural control circuits and indeed could conceivably provide a stream of information that may enable a conscious awareness of bladder fullness and the ability to make volitional predictions about the need to void. We also note the homology with the development of other motor systems where spontaneous motor activity, initially generated in the periphery, becomes progressively embedded centrally as motor representations in the nervous system with developmental maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Llinás, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our postulated model of such a circuit organisation with afferent feedback from the bladder both priming the spinal parasympathetic motor circuit and also determining the magnitude of the drive from Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons (perhaps via integration by the PAG which functions as a probabilistic firing switch) recapitulates many of the observed features of autonomous micturition. The generation of NVCs provides inference about the degree of bladder fullness and the afferent signal advances the progression through the cycle. The spinal priming mechanism enables a regenerative burst of activity from Barr<sup>CRH</sup> to drive the voiding contraction and the modelled release of spinal CRH that follows such a large discharge serves to reset the spinal circuit enabling passive filling to resume. A feature of this circuit organisation is that a direct volitional drive to Barr<sup>CRH</sup> from cortex as recently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yao et al., 2018</xref>) would not be subject to the probabilistic firing switch at a supraspinal level and could therefore trigger a void earlier in the cycle if behaviourally appropriate albeit still contingent on the priming status of the spinal gate. Hypothetically, a parallel synaptic drive from the Barr<sup>ESR1</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Keller et al., 2018</xref>) that was stronger than the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons could also generate parasympathetic activity without requiring co-incident afferent activity – hence bypassing the gate to produce urine ‘spotting’ on behavioural demand.</p><p>On this basis we conclude that the Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons form a key component of the micturition circuit that generate a pre-motor drive to the bladder late in the cycle. The recording and stimulation data suggest that this drive is not generated by a burst generator residing within this cell population but is a product of the integration of inputs from both bladder sensory afferents and upstream centres such as the PAG but also including hypothalamus and motor cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yao et al., 2018</xref>). We predict that failures of control at this key integrating locus are likely to be involved in both acute disorders of lower urinary tract function such as retention as well as in chronic diseases like nocturnal enuresis, detrusor-sphincter dyssynergia and overactive bladder syndrome where there is dysregulation of detrusor contractions and sphincter relaxation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The sorting analysis was carried out using the facilities of the Advanced Computing Research Centre, University of Bristol - <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/">http://www.bristol.ac.uk/acrc/</ext-link>. Manual curation of clusters was performed in ‘Phy’ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib">https://github.com/kwikteam/phy-contrib</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rossant et al., 2019</xref>) in order to select only well isolated units with clear refractory periods, and to remove artefacts. All further analysis of spike trains and cluster characteristics was carried out in MATLAB.</p><p>The centre channel of each cluster was defined as the probe channel on which the waveform was recorded with the maximum range. Representative waveforms were extracted on the centre channel for each cluster by sampling 2000 spikes from the group (if the cluster had fewer than 2000 spikes present, all spikes were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B,D</xref>). Autocorrelations and cross-correlations were calculated by binning spike trains (1 ms bins) and using the MATLAB function ‘xcorr’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Smooth firing rates during laser stimulation events were calculated by convolving the spike train with a normalised Gaussian of standard deviation of 10 ms, using the MATLAB function ‘conv2’. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Where z-scored firing rates were required, the MATLAB function ‘zscore’ was used in with binned spike counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15-2"><title>Analysis of bladder pressure and spike trains</title><p>Bladder pressure and external urethral sphincter EMG were recorded in Spike2 (CED) and analysed in MATLAB. To compare changes in bladder pressure over multiple recordings, bladder pressure was normalised to between 0 and 1 in each recording, where one represents the maximum pressure recorded during the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). The times of voids were identified using the MATLAB function ‘findpeaks’; correct identification was verified by eye. Where the bladder pressure was split into phases of the voiding cycle, the period between successive voids was split into the required number of equal time intervals (100 phases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, 10 phases in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>). Spike counts during these phases were converted to firing rates by dividing by the width of the relevant time window. This enabled calculation of the mean firing rate in each phase of the voiding cycle (over multiple cycles and cells). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref> firing rates were z-scored to enable comparison between multiple voiding cycles recorded in different animals. Where voiding/inter voiding periods were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10E</xref>), ‘voiding periods’ were defined as a window of 15 s either side of the peak of bladder pressure during a void; ‘intervoid periods’ consisted of all remaining times.</p><p>Cross correlograms and Pearson correlation coefficients between spike count and bladder pressure were calculated by downsampling both data to a sampling rate of 1 hz (i.e. 1 s bins for the spike count, 1 hz sampling for the bladder pressure), z-scoring and using the MATLAB function ‘xcorr’ and ‘corr’. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D,E</xref>). All curve fitting was carried out using the MATLAB curve fitting toolbox.

Pressure measurements during these periods were detrended (using the MATLAB function 'detrend') and NVC peaks were detected using the MATLAB function 'findpeaks', using parameters to select only those peaks greater than 0.1 mmHg above the baseline, between 1.5 and 8 s wide, and at least 5 s from any other such peak. These provided well isolated examples of NVCs for analysis. Spike trains for each cell were binned (2 s bin width for the longer timescales shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>; 0.5 s bin width for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>) to extract estimates of firing rate around each NVC and to examine the difference in spike counts during 1.5 s windows beginning 6 s and 3 s before each NVC. For shuffled data a vector of random times was generated for each recording (taken from intervoid periods only) and examined in the same way. The number of shuffled NVC times and real NVC times was equal in each recording To create the trace of bladder pressure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>, bladder pressure was extracted during a 10 s window around each identified or shuffled NVC. Values were referenced to the initial value of pressure recorded during the window in order to extract the change in pressure around the NVC. Windowed measurements were then averaged to generate the mean change in bladder pressure around each identified or shuffled NVC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Code availability</title><p>Custom MATLAB scripts used to analyse the data are available along with example data are at DOI:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5523/bris.20l920gl27ufi204brn8ilonsf">10.5523/bris.20l920gl27ufi204brn8ilonsf</ext-link> along with the MATLAB code for the model of autonomous micturition and the Parasympathetic Preganglionic NEURON model.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>Funded by US NIH R01 DK098361 (Anthony J Kanai, Marcus J Drake, Christopher H Fry, Anthony E Pickering).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Bernardo L Sabatini as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ronald Calabrese as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Rita J Valentino (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. In recognition of the fact that revisions may take longer than we typically allow, until the research enterprise restarts in full, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Ito et al. augments our understanding of the function of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in autonomous micturition. The authors use a combination of optogenetic and chemogenetic manipulations alongside in vivo electrophysiological recordings to build a model of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neuron function. All experiments are performed in anesthetized mice, using cystometry to accurately measure bladder contractions and in some cases using EMG to measure external urethral sphincter (EUS) contractions. This approach is useful as it targets the core autonomous spino-bulbospinal circuit rather than the (potentially more complex and less tractable) volitional circuits. The key novel findings of this paper are twofold. First, the effect of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> activity is state-dependent; despite being equally excitable throughout the micturition cycle, Barr<sup>CRH</sup> optogenetic activation only produces contractions in the late stages of the micturition cycle. The effect of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> activity is therefore dependent on the state of the bladder. Second, the authors report that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neuronal firing precedes an increase in bladder pressure, suggesting that Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons provide pre-motor drive to the bladder. Generally, the paper is clearly written and the results are nicely presented within the context of previous work in this field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These are all changes suggested for the text and figures – no new experiments required.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to define the various micturition metrics upfront (in Figure 1 or 2) using a schematic. It is not immediately clear how each metric is calculated or how dependent or independent they are of one another (e.g. micturition pressure, threshold pressure, basal pressure, infused volume). A good model would be the schematic in Figure 3C.</p><p>2) The chemogenetic experiment is lacking an extended baseline control (e.g. how does void latency change over 120 minute time scales as in Figure 2E). Do the authors have the data to provide this baseline?</p><p>3) In Figure 4 the authors argue that &quot;the effect of bilateral stimulation on eNVC amplitude was additive rather than synergistic.&quot; This claim is not clearly quantified, and appears to only be true at 20Hz. The effect appears sub-additive at all other frequencies. Please clarify.</p><p>4) There are certain considerations that need to be mentioned, particularly when comparing to other studies. It seems that all experiments including neuronal recordings were done under urethane anesthesia. This needs to be explicitly stated in the Abstract. If only some experiments were done under anesthesia, this needs to be made clear. And this needs to be stated in the Discussion as a caveat. Species differences should also be mentioned as a caveat as studies of the micturition reflex have been based on cats, mice and rats and anatomical connections should not be assumed to be identical.</p><p>5) There are several concerns about the recordings. First the authors need to indicate whether these were done in the anesthetized or unanesthetized state. It is concerning that out of 113 neurons recorded in 3 animals, only 12 were optically identified. How many neurons were optically activated in each of the three animals? Does that mean that in the other experiments that did not involve recordings, few neurons were activated? Did the authors ever examine fos expression or get some other measure of neuronal activation with optogenetic stimulation? The figure does not suggest that the probe is going through the heart of BN but rather a caudal, sparsely populated section of the nucleus and also is recording from medial locus coeruleus neurons. There are 3 different color traces in Figure 8B which you can only tell when you zoom in greatly. The figure shows traces lateral to the probe as yellow (optically activated) that seem to be in the LC. Some of the &quot;CRH-like&quot; cells in this manuscript appear to be in the medial LC and are even more lateral than the green &quot;non-CRH&quot; cells. A figure showing the probe going through a section of BN that is at the mid-level with a lot of BN neurons and not the major part of the LC is needed. In supplementary data, sections from all three recorded animals should be provided.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.56605.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>These are all changes suggested for the text and figures – no new experiments required.</p><p>1) It would be helpful to define the various micturition metrics upfront (in Figure 1 or 2) using a schematic.

There was no change in control mice (no DREADD with CNO dosing) in the volume infused before a void was triggered (equivalent to the inter-void interval at a constant infusion rate) over the period of 120 minutes. This was not repeated for the infuse-stop protocol in Figure 2E but it can be seen that the effect of CNO was starting to reverse after 120 minutes (as shown in Figure 2D and in 3/5 animals) indicating that its action was not a consequence of a deterioration in the animal’s LUT function over time.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 4 the authors argue that &quot;the effect of bilateral stimulation on eNVC amplitude was additive rather than synergistic.&quot; This claim is not clearly quantified, and appears to only be true at 20Hz.

It seems that all experiments including neuronal recordings were done under urethane anesthesia. This needs to be explicitly stated in the Abstract. If only some experiments were done under anesthesia, this needs to be made clear. And this needs to be stated in the Discussion as a caveat.“Urethane anaesthesia” is now specified in the Abstract. Also specifically stated in each of the relevant sections of the Materials and methods, and added to the Discussion as a caveat: “We used cystometry in anaesthetised mice to examine the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons specifically in the core processes of autonomous micturition in the absence of behavioural influence. […] This remains to be definitively tested and we hypothesise that the role of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons in autonomous voiding may be best demonstrated in sleeping rather than conscious, behaving mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Species differences should also be mentioned as a caveat as studies of the micturition reflex have been based on cats, mice and rats and anatomical connections should not be assumed to be identical.</p></disp-quote><p>The following text has been added to the Discussion: “In this context it is also important to acknowledge that the pattern of micturition varies to a degree across species and humans and cats do not show the same “squirting” behaviour as their EUS relaxes to allow voiding – this likely involves some distinctive neuronal circuitry (Fowler et al., 2008). […] Importantly, lesions or inhibition of Barrington’s nucleus abolishes voiding in multiple species including humans, cats, rats and mice consistent with it being a core circuit component (reviewed in (Verstegen et al., 2017)).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) There are several concerns about the recordings. First the authors need to indicate whether these were done in the anesthetized or unanesthetized state.</p></disp-quote><p>All of the recordings were made in the anaesthetised state (now explicitly stated in multiple places as noted above) with the exception of the pelvic nerve stimulation experiment which was made in the decerebrate arterially perfused mouse (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is concerning that out of 113 neurons recorded in 3 animals, only 12 were optically identified.</p></disp-quote><p>We recorded around 40 identified single units per animal in the dorsal pons – which is probably close to the number that can be independently isolated from a 32-contact probe in such a small brainstem structure (Barr is ~400µm DV dimension). We report 12 opto-identified Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons and a further 32 that are likely CRH<sup>+</sup> based on their similar pattern of activity. Thus, our recordings indicate that ~40% (46/113) of the cells are CRH<sup>+</sup> which is in close agreement with the figures of Hou et al., 2016, who estimate 44% of Barr neurons to be CRH<sup>+</sup>. In terms of the proportion that are opto-identified (~30%) we believe that this is to be expected given that some neurons will be too distant from incident light / shadowed by the recording probe or not sufficiently strongly excited to be driven reliably with a short light pulse (we used a stringent criterion for identification).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many neurons were optically activated in each of the three animals?</p></disp-quote><p>There were 8, 3 and 1 Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons opto-identified in the 3 mice.

We also note that the magnitude of our bladder responses to Barr<sup>CRH</sup> opto-activation were similar to that reported in the work of Hou and colleagues (Hou et al., 2016) suggesting that we were opto-activating a similar proportion of neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the authors ever examine fos expression or get some other measure of neuronal activation with optogenetic stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not try cfos or any other measure beyond the important functional measure of the bladder responses to opto-activation. This was used as a reliable marker indicating the proximity of the optical fibre to Barrington’s nucleus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The figure does not suggest that the probe is going through the heart of BN but rather a caudal, sparsely populated section of the nucleus and also is recording from medial locus coeruleus neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown the section showing the best combination of features from a 1:3 series of 40µm sections through Barr. This means we get only 2-3 sections containing Barr neurons. In this particular case the probe track was most obvious in this section and so it was selected for illustration purposes (always something of a compromise between the best anatomy, clearest demonstration of the location of the probe, etc) – we think it provides a noteworthy juxtaposition of probe recording site, the distribution of opto-identified cells and labelled neurons. We believe that the location of the track will have allowed recordings from neurons in the core of Barr (its recording surface was oriented to face rostrally) and certainly this is borne out by the close similarity between our extracellular recordings and those in other papers using fibre photometry to sample the population signal of Barr<sup>CRH</sup> neurons (Hou et al., 2016, Keller et al., 2018 and Verstegen et al., 2019).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are 3 different color traces in Figure 8B which you can only tell when you zoom in greatly.

The position of the spikes refers to their clustering onto the probe recording sites (the site with the strongest signal) rather than their specific location within the brain section as shown. We definitely did not transduce the LC with the opsin in these experiments (hence none of the opto-identified neurons can be from the LC). However, we agree that we may have made some recordings from LC neurons that could conceivably have been included in the Barr<sup>CRH-like</sup> neurons or the non-identified category. Therefore, to test our characterisation with respect to the Barr<sup>CRH-like</sup> vs. LC neurons, we have included new data showing recordings from opto-identified LC neurons in mice (n=3) that had been selectively transduced with ChR2 using CAV-PRS-ChR2-mCherry (Li et al., 2016). We used an identical recording configuration except the recording probe was introduced 100µm lateral to our usual recording position for Barrington’s nucleus. These opto-identified mouse LC neurons (n=29) showed the characteristic pattern of tonic activity with a phasic response to pinch. Interestingly they also showed a phase locked activation during voiding (like that reported in rats by Manohar et al., 2017) whose magnitude was significantly smaller than that seen in either Barr<sup>CRH</sup> or in Barr<sup>CRH-like</sup> neurons but is larger than that seen in the non-identified population. We have included this LC data as a supplementary figure (Figure 10—figure supplement 1) and revised the manuscript (subsection “Barr<sup>CRH</sup> activity anticipates bladder pressure during the micturition cycle”, last paragraph) to support our identification of these distinct neuronal groups.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A figure showing the probe going through a section of BN that is at the mid-level with a lot of BN neurons and not the major part of the LC is needed.

However, we have included another image from this mouse to help convince the reviewers that the probe track was also evident in a section at the mid-level (#94) but this section was of lower quality and so we chose not to use it. We also include a histological image of pontine tissue from another recording (#83) with the location of the track. We confirmed the location of the third recording (#80) as being within Barr but those sections were damaged in processing (torn at the recording site) and unfortunately they were not imaged (as they were not felt to be of publication quality). We do not think it adds much value to the reader to add these images to a supplementary figure, but they could be included in the transparent review process for the interested.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-56605-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></body></sub-article></article>
