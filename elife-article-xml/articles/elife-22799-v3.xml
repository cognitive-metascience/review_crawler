Chromatin assembly factor 1 (CAF-1) is a H3-H4 histone chaperone that associates with the replisome and orchestrates chromatin assembly following DNA synthesis. Little is known about the mechanism and structure of this key complex. Here we investigate the CAF-1•H3-H4 binding mode and the mechanism of nucleosome assembly. We show that yeast CAF-1 binding to a H3-H4 dimer activates the Cac1 winged helix domain interaction with DNA. This drives the formation of a transient CAF-1•histone•DNA intermediate containing two CAF-1 complexes, each associated with one H3-H4 dimer. Here, the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer is formed and deposited onto DNA. Our work elucidates the molecular mechanism for histone deposition by CAF-1, a reaction that has remained elusive for other histone chaperones, and it advances our understanding of how nucleosomes and their epigenetic information are maintained through DNA replication.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.22799.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.22799.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>chromatin assembly</kwd><kwd>DNA replication</kwd><kwd>histone chaperones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luger</surname><given-names>Karolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM067777</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luger</surname><given-names>Karolin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 1267-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mattiroli</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004622</institution-id><institution>KWF Kankerbestrijding</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-6649</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mattiroli</surname><given-names>Francesca</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB-1330019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stargell</surname><given-names>Laurie A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM114594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ahn</surname><given-names>Natalie G</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM102253</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitehouse</surname><given-names>Iestyn</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>After DNA replication, nucleosomes are assembled by two histone chaperone complexes each bound to an H3-H4 histone dimer, suggesting the feasibility for a semi-conservative mode of epigenome inheritance.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Dynamic assembly and disassembly of nucleosomes regulates accessibility to the genome during the processes of DNA transcription, replication and repair. DNA replication constitutes a particularly challenging context, as nucleosomes and the epigenetic information they encode need to be reestablished and duplicated onto daughter strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alabert and Groth, 2012</xref>).

This is a non-trivial process in light of the complex architecture of the histone octamer in the nucleosome, requiring the ordered deposition of histone pairs.

The unique role of CAF-1 in integrating chromatin assembly with DNA synthesis and epigenetic signaling makes it indispensable for the maintenance of cell identity and for life in multicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barbieri et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cheloufi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Houlard et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ishiuchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Song et al., 2007</xref>). In yeast, CAF-1 deletion is viable but results in aberrant transcriptional silencing programs and sensitivity to DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaufman et al., 1998</xref>).</p><p>CAF-1 is a histone H3-H4 chaperone, composed of three distinct subunits, all of which are conserved from yeast (named Cac1, Cac2 and Cac3) to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almouzni and Méchali, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smith and Stillman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tyler et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Verreault et al., 1996</xref>). Previous biochemical studies have suggested that one CAF-1 complex can bind more than one H3-H4 dimer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), and other studies have proposed models where CAF-1 dimerization may be important for its function in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Quivy et al., 2001</xref>). To date, the mechanism by which CAF-1, and indeed any histone chaperone, assembles the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer onto DNA is unknown. Understanding how CAF-1 deposits H3-H4 is essential for our understanding of the mechanisms that govern the inheritance of epigenetic modifications and epigenome maintenance.</p><p>Here, we describe the mechanism by which CAF-1-mediates deposition of the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer onto DNA. A coordinated sequence of events is set in motion by H3-H4 binding to CAF-1, and promoted by CAF-1•DNA interaction. The mechanism culminates in the DNA-mediated association of two CAF-1•H3-H4 complexes to form the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer, which is then transferred to DNA. These findings elucidate the histone deposition mechanism by this key histone chaperone complex, with significant implications on our understanding of chromatin propagation in DNA replication.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>tCAF-1 is sufficient for nucleosome assembly in vitro</title><p>Whether recombinant CAF-1 assembles nucleosomes in vitro in absence of the replication machinery or other nuclear proteins remains an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaillard et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadyrova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kaufman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Smith and Stillman, 1991</xref>), which we set out to resolve in a purified in vitro system. We developed a quantitative nucleosome assembly assay (NAQ). Commonly used nucleosome assembly assays rely on native gel-based readouts, where the formation of the canonical nucleosome band is monitored over a range of histone chaperone concentrations. This readout is not suitable for proteins that bind DNA or the histone•DNA products, such as FL CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, lanes 3–6, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Therefore, we added a Micrococcal Nuclease (MNase) digestion step that allows us to monitor the DNA protection pattern induced by histone deposition. A further DNA purification step and addition of a DNA loading control allows accurate size determination and quantification of the recovered DNA fragments, hence the formation of nucleosomes.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22799.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>tCAF-1 is competent for nucleosome assembly in absence of other factors.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Products from the nucleosome assembly assay on 207 bp DNA, with FL CAF-1 or tCAF-1.

The nucleosome assembly reactions on 207 bp DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>) suggested efficient nucleosome formation by both FL and tCAF-1.

Our results also indicate that the N-terminal portion of Cac1, which in vivo is associated with PCNA, is not required for the nucleosome assembly activity, and that tCAF-1 contains all the requisite components for histone deposition. Nucleosome assembly activity increases in a CAF-1 dose dependent manner, and reaches its maximum at a two-fold excess of CAF-1 complex per (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

H3-H4 exists in an equilibrium between dimeric and tetrameric states in absence of DNA or a histone chaperone.

We therefore tested whether CAF-1 binds H3-H4 in its dimeric or tetrameric form. We used sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (SV-AUC) to characterize the complexes formed between CAF-1 and histone H3-H4 combined at different molar ratios (1:1 or 1:2 CAF-1 to H3-H4 dimer), comparing wild type H3-H4 (WTH3-H4) with a constitutively dimeric H3-H4 mutant (DMH3-H4) that binds CAF-1 with the same affinity as WTH3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>).

These experiments were performed at 4 µM concentration where WTH3-H4 is expected to be primarily tetrameric, while DMH3-H4 remains a dimer.

Here, we used wild-type histones, constitutively dimeric DMH3-H4 and constitutively tetrameric XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> prepared by cross-linking two H3-H4 dimers via a single cysteine residue on H3K115C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Arcy et al., 2013</xref>). This reaction yields a XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> preparation where about 80% of the histones are tetramers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1d</xref>), in a conformation that is compatible with the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> observed in the nucleosome structure. Notably, XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> binds to FL or tCAF-1 with the same affinity as WTH3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e</xref>). In stoichiometry experiments, performed under conditions where WTH3-H4 is primarily in its dimeric form, we observe one CAF-1 complex binding to one WT or DMH3-H4 dimer, while two CAF-1 complexes are bound to one XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer. This is observed for both FL and tCAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f</xref>), supporting the idea that each CAF-1 complex has a single binding site for one H3-H4 dimer and confirming that the Cac1 N-terminus has no role in H3-H4 binding. Further confirmation for this stoichiometry comes from SEC-MALS (size exclusion chromatography coupled to multi-angle light scattering) experiments with tCAF-1, where significant increases in apparent molar mass are observed with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> but not with WTH3-H4, compatible with two tCAF-1 complexes binding to the XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these experiments indicate that each CAF-1 complex has a single binding site for one H3-H4 dimer, and that CAF-bound H3-H4 is still able to tetramerize, either with or without its own bound CAF-1 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1h</xref>). These assemblies are not stable enough to be isolated using WTH3-H4, but are observed with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>. This suggests that the four-helix bundle formed by two H3 molecules in the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer is important for this complex formation and perhaps the only point of contact between the two CAF-1 moieties.</p><p>To further characterize the tCAF-1•H3-H4 complex, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange coupled to mass spectrometry (HX-MS). CAF-1 binding to H3-H4 induces protection from exchange of an extended area on both WT and DMH3-H4, as opposed to a distinct region of protection. This suggests that CAF-1 binding to histones elicits a global conformational effect, which was also observed for other chaperone-histone complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Arcy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeNizio et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>).

This global conformational effect makes it difficult to identify the direct binding interfaces on H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Importantly, no significant changes in HX were detected in the H3 region mediating H3-H4 tetramerization through a four-helix bundle (α3; aa 111–126) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), confirming our interpretation that this region is exposed and available for tetramer formation in the CAF-1•H3-H4 complex. Together, these data indicate that CAF-1 binds to one H3-H4 dimer that results in its overall stabilization, and that permits tetramerization in its CAF-1 bound form.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>H3-H4 binding activates DNA binding by the Cac1 winged helix domain (WHD)</title><p>In our HX-MS experiments we observed HX changes distributed throughout all three CAF-1 subunits upon H3-H4 binding, with no direct evidence pointing towards a specific interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The observed HX changes are in agreement with recently published data from similar HX-MS experiments using the FL CAF-1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), confirming that deleting the N-terminal portion of Cac1 has no significant effect on histone binding. Moreover, by using both WT and DMH3-H4, we further support the idea that the mutations in DMH3-H4 do not affect its interaction with CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>). The broadly distributed HX changes suggest extensive structural rearrangements in the CAF-1 complex upon histone binding, with likely implications for the mechanism of histone deposition. In particular, we noticed that the C-terminal Cac1 WHD, recently identified as a DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>), showed deprotection upon histone binding in the HX-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>), also seen when FL CAF-1 was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, tCAF-1 does not bind DNA in absence of histones, despite containing a functional WHD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref> and below).</p><p>We therefore asked if an intramolecular interaction between the histone binding region and the WHD may be masking the DNA binding activity of tCAF-1 in absence of histones. The acidic region, which constitutes part of the histone binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>), is a likely candidate for mediating this intramolecular interaction due to its complementary charges to the basic WHD. Indeed, mutant tCAF-1 complexes in which the Cac1 acidic region was neutralized or deleted, namely tCAF_Nac and tCAF_∆ac respectively, gained DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–b</xref>, lanes 5–10). This indicates that in absence of histones the WHD may be inhibited by an intramolecular interaction with the acidic region on Cac1, a component of the histone binding module (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>) together with Cac2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>) (histone binding module is referred to as HBM, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1a</xref>). We therefore performed a competition experiment by adding the HBM of CAF-1, or only Cac2 as control, to DNA-bound isolated WHD. Strikingly, the HBM could compete the WHD away from DNA, while Cac2 alone could not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). Moreover, using in solution cross-linking experiments we were able to trap the complex between the WHD and the HBM, a complex that contains the acidic region and Cac2, but not between the WHD and Cac2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1b</xref>).

We used an 18 bp DNA (18DNA) fragment, which represents the minimal substrate for binding to the WHD domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gajiwala et al., 2000</xref>), but is of insufficient length for wrapping the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer. This is important, as using longer DNA promotes rapid histone deposition and would therefore not allow us to demonstrate the DNA binding activity of histone-bound tCAF-1. As expected, tCAF-1 did not bind to 18DNA in absence of histones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, lane 2). However, when tCAF-1 was pre-incubated with histones, we observed a distinct high molecular weight complex, migrating slower than the tCAF-1•H3-H4 complex without DNA, and containing DNA, H3-H4, and tCAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, lanes 3–5 and 11–14). To confirm that DNA binding in this ternary tCAF-1•H3-H4•18DNA complex is mediated through the Cac1 WHD, we tested tCAF-1 complexes with a mutated WHD (tCAF_WHD**, containing Cac1 K564E K568E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). This mutant complex does not form the DNA-bound intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, lanes 15–18), even though it still binds H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>, lane 10) with the same affinity and stoichiometry as tCAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>). These data strongly suggest that H3-H4 triggers DNA binding by the WHD, by releasing it from an inhibitory intramolecular interaction with the histone binding region.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>DNA promotes the association of two CAF-1 complexes to form the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer</title><p>This ternary complex may well represent a relevant intermediate in the histone deposition mechanism of CAF-1. To determine the structural organization of the tCAF-1•H3-H4•18DNA complex, we investigated the effect of using a constitutively dimeric DMH3-H4 or a constitutively tetrameric XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> in this context. First, we wondered if a dimeric DMH3-H4 could form this ternary intermediate. Indeed, tCAF-1•DMH3-H4 assembles a similar complex with 18DNA to what observed with tCAF-1•WTH3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lanes 11–14) indicating that histone tetramerization is not required for the formation of this intermediate. This in turn also supports the idea that CAF-1 binds an H3-H4 dimer, and that binding to a histone H3-H4 dimer is sufficient to release the WHD and engage it in DNA binding. In addition, we wondered whether a constitutively tetrameric XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> was still capable to assemble this intermediate.

To this end, we used tCAF-1 mutated in the WHD, in complex with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). We saw no interaction of (tCAF_WHD**)<sub>2</sub>•XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> with 18DNA, confirming that the Cac1 WHD is the primary point of contact to DNA and that both dimers in tetrameric XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> are shielded from DNA binding. As 18DNA can interact with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, lane 4, demonstrated by disappearance of the free DNA band into the well), this strongly suggests that two CAF-1 moieties remain bound to the XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer, otherwise the exposed H3-H4 dimer in the constitutive tetramer XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> would remain free to mediate DNA binding even with a complex with a mutated WHD. Because the tCAF-1•WTH3-H4•18DNA and the tCAF-1•DMH3-H4•18DNA complexes migrate similarly to the complex formed with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>, which we know contains two tCAF-1 moieties (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b–c</xref>), and considerably slower than the tCAF-1•WTH3-H4 complexes without DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, lane 5–9, 488-H3-H4 red signal), we postulated that 18DNA promotes the association of two tCAF-1•WTH3-H4 moieties, and in this assembly histone tetramerization is not a requirement for complex formation.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we performed in solution cross-linking studies. This allowed us to trap the assemblies without the potential artifact of the gel or column media, and also provided us with an opportunity to test our model with the FL CAF-1 complex, as the readout does not depend on DNA binding. Strikingly, titrating 18DNA into a FL CAF-1•WTH3-H4 complex strongly promoted the formation of a discrete high molecular weight assembly, which did not accumulate when the histones were omitted or when the Cac1 WHD was mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). By analyzing these reactions through SEC-MALS, we confirmed that this species has a molar mass consistent with the assembly of (CAF-1)<sub>2</sub>•(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>•18DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). In line with the cross-linking data, this species was not favored when the WHD was mutated, and the most abundant assembly was composed of a single CAF-1•H3-H4•18DNA complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This association was further supported by monitoring the formation of this band with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> and DMH3-H4, where a (CAF-1)<sub>2</sub>•(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> species is formed with XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> even in absence of 18DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4e</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), as predicted by our binding stoichiometry data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1f and h</xref>). Importantly, titrating 18DNA into H3-H4 in absence of CAF-1 did not significantly stimulate the formation of (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer, confirming that the association of two H3-H4 dimers under these conditions requires the presence of the CAF-1 chaperone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>). Together, these data demonstrate that two FL CAF-1 complexes associate on a 18DNA via their WHD domains, but only do so when bound to histones.</p><p>To conclusively confirm that an 18DNA is sufficient to bridge two CAF-1 moieties, we measured the stoichiometry of the isolated Cac1 WHD when binding to 18DNA. In EMSA, we noticed that titration of an isolated WHD on longer DNA results in an alternate binding pattern that suggests a cooperative binding mode, while on 18DNA we only observed a single species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). SEC-MALS experiments demonstrate that this species contains two WHD domains, and that the binding of two WHDs to a 18DNA is preferred even at a 1:1 WHD to DNA stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). Importantly, the Cac1 WHD elutes as a monomer on SEC-MALS in absence of DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>). This indicates that two Cac1 WHDs cooperatively bind DNA, as observed for other WHDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cornille et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gajiwala et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng et al., 1999</xref>) and suggest that this can bring together two CAF-1•H3-H4 complexes on 18DNA.</p><p>Overall, our data support a model in which the interaction between DNA and the WHD is triggered by histone binding to CAF-1, and this promotes the juxtaposition of two CAF-1 complexes, each pre-loaded with an H3-H4 dimer. Thus, the DNA-mediated association of two histone-bound CAF-1 complexes may promote the formation of the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer on DNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>DNA length promotes (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> deposition</title><p>How then is the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer deposited onto DNA? Our data indicate that the H3 α3 helix in the H3-H4 dimers bound to CAF-1 is available for tetramerization with another H3-H4 dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Moreover, we show that two CAF-1 complexes bind on either side of a (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer, and that an obligate H3-H3’ interaction is sufficient to stabilize their association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting no additional significant contacts between the two CAF-1 moieties. Because of its limiting length, 18DNA only accommodates WHD binding, but cannot fully wrap the histone tetramer, which allowed us to trap the ternary complex. Because this complex can also be formed with dimeric DMH3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, lanes 11–14), we concluded that histone tetramerization is not required for the formation of the 18DNA-containing intermediate.</p><p>We next used longer DNAs to see if we could monitor subsequent steps in tetrasome formation, to understand how the two H3-H4 dimers are joined and to demonstrate that the (tCAF-1)<sub>2</sub>•(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>•18DNA complex is relevant in the nucleosome assembly reaction. We used a 33 bp DNA (33DNA) which is longer than required for WHD binding, but still shorter than the ~70 bp necessary for complete wrapping of the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>. tCAF-1 forms a ternary intermediate with WTH3-H4 and DNA, shown by EMSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, lanes 1–6). As observed with 18DNA, its formation is dependent on the integrity of the Cac1 WHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> lanes 7–10 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>), supporting the idea that this domain mediates the primary interaction with DNA. Strikingly, the ternary complex containing 33DNA could not be stabilized with the constitutively dimeric DMH3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>). This is surprising, as this histone mutant is sufficient to activate DNA binding by the WHD, as seen with the 18DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). These results demonstrate that histone tetramerization is required in this context. Hence, after the initial interaction via the Cac1 WHD, the formation of the ternary intermediate becomes dependent on the assembly of the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer with DNA of increasing length. This indicates that we are monitoring the step where the two H3-H4 dimers are joined to form the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22799.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>DNA of sufficient length sequesters (H3–H4)<sub>2</sub> from CAF-1.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) EMSA performed with 100 nM 33mer DNA. tCAF-1 or tCAF-1_WHD** were titrated 0.37–0.75-1.5–3 µM, and were added with WTH3-H4 to the DNA.

This interaction promotes the association of two histone-bound CAF-1 complexes, via cooperative DNA binding of the Cac1 WHDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Here, the two CAF-1 complexes join their H3-H4 dimers to form a (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer that can then be sequestered by the DNA tethered by the WHD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The exact mechanism by which DNA promotes histone unloading from CAF-1 remains yet to be determined. We propose two hypotheses. In one case, the DNA remains partially bound to one WHD as it begins to wrap around the tetrasome, in another scenario the DNA dissociates from the WHD as it becomes bound to the (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> in proximity to the H3-H3’ region, where it begins to pry the histones off CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). The restoration of the inhibitory intramolecular interaction between the Cac1 WHD and the histone binding region, which likely occurs as the histones are unloaded from CAF-1, may also contribute to their transfer to the DNA molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Together, our data suggest that the Cac1 WHD not only contributes to the mechanism by merely binding DNA, but by actively bridging together two CAF-1 bound H3-H4 dimers. Furthermore, by directly competing with the histone binding region, the WHD may facilitate the transfer of (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> from the chaperone to DNA.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22799.014</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model of the molecular mechanism of CAF-1 mediated tetrasome assembly.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The nucleosome assembly mechanism of CAF-1 is activated by H3-H4 binding, which releases the WHD domain from an intramolecular interaction with the acidic region on Cac1.

This band corresponds to the deposition of a single H3-H4 dimer onto DNA, as seen using the constitutively dimeric DMH3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7c</xref>). This finding indicates that either abrogating WHD-dependent DNA binding, or preventing H3-H4 tetramerization, result in the same deposition product in vitro, a single H3-H4 dimer bound to DNA. This fully supports our model in which (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramerization or deposition cannot occur in absence of CAF-1 DNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and indicates a direct role for the WHD in regulating the fidelity of the nucleosome assembly reaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22799.015</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>DNA binding by the Cac1 WHD is required for nucleosome assembly in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Quantification of the nucleosome bands (126–160 bp) from the NAQ assays.

A possible explanation for this observation is that in vitro in absence of PCNA, the DNA binding property of the N-terminal part of Cac1 may compensate for the mutation of the WHD. We therefore moved to an in vivo system to address if the WHD is required for FL CAF-1 activity in the cell. We first used a previously described assay that monitors epigenetic silencing of a telomere-proximal <italic>URA3</italic> reporter, a phenomenon which is dependent on the integrity of the Cac1 subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>). While WT Cac1 protein could completely rescue the growth phenotype on FOA plates, FL Cac1 WHD mutants did not, reflected by delayed growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7d</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1b</xref>). This indicates that the WHD domain is indeed important for Cac1 functions in the context of full-length Cac1 in vivo, in agreement with previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To specifically demonstrate that the phenotype observed with CAF-1 complex that is mutated in the WHD is due to an aberrant nucleosome assembly function of Cac1 in vivo, we took advantage of the fact that the length of Okazaki fragments generated during replication depends on proper nucleosome assembly by CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smith and Whitehouse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yadav and Whitehouse, 2016</xref>). We analyzed Okazaki fragment length in yeast strains that carry mutations or deletions in the Cac1 WHD domain. Strikingly, Okazaki fragments purified from these strains do not exhibit the periodicity characteristic of a proficient replication-coupled nucleosome assembly pathway, but rather peak at length above 400 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). This phenotype is not as drastic as the one observed when we mutated the histone binding region (HA-Cac1_Nac, where the Cac1 acidic region is neutralized by a Gly-Ser-Leu peptide substitution; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). Yeast strains harboring this mutant CAF-1 complex produced an Okazaki fragment pattern that resembled that of the Cac1 knock-out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7e</xref>). Unlike mutation of the Cac1 acidic region, Cac1 WHD deletion and mutation do not affect histone binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1c–e</xref>) and hence these mutant complexes, unlike HA-Cac1_Nac, are still able to recruit H3-H4 at the replication fork. We speculate that passive histone diffusion from these CAF-1 constructs to the DNA may occur, resulting in residual and inefficient histone deposition. The clear difference in Okazaki fragment formation between the WT and the WHD mutations confirms a deficiency in timely and accurate replication-coupled nucleosome assembly in vivo. These experiments show that the integrity of the Cac1 WHD is required for proper nucleosome formation on the lagging strand during DNA replication, fully supporting our model that places this domain at the heart of the CAF-1 nucleosome assembly mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Combined, our data suggest a complex mechanism for the nucleosome assembly function of CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We propose a model that involves DNA binding of two histone-bound CAF-1 complexes, thereby joining two H3-H4 dimers which are then transferred to adjacent DNA, resulting in tetrasome assembly. Our data identifies the central role of the Cac1 WHD in orchestrating the assembly reaction through its histone-triggered DNA binding activity, and through promoting the association of two CAF-1 complexes, which culminates in (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer and ultimately tetrasome formation.</p><p>Our work reveals that two CAF-1 complexes are needed for the formation of one tetrasome, with each complex contributing a single H3-H4 dimer. This provides direct evidence for previously proposed models based on in vivo observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakano et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, previous studies have suggested that one CAF-1 promotes (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer formation, based on FRET measurements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2016</xref>). Here, we have studied the CAF-1•H3-H4 stoichiometry using a variety of techniques, including label-free methods such as AUC, SEC-MALS and HX-MS. Our data indicate that CAF-1 has a single histone binding site that interacts with a H3-H4 dimer, although a second H3-H4 dimer (either with or without its own CAF-1 complex) can associate with the CAF-1-bound dimer. We propose that this mode of binding is essential in the nucleosome assembly mechanism to allow the juxtaposition of the histone dimers to form (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> prior to deposition onto the DNA. This ability of CAF-1 to form different complexes with histones, depending on their concentration and conditions, may be responsible for the apparent differences in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liu et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">2016</xref>).</p><p>We demonstrate the central importance of the WHD in the histone deposition process. A recent study has identified cross-links between the Cac1 WHD and histones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2016</xref>). While this was interpreted as a direct interaction between the DNA binding domain and the histones, our data suggest that this may be due to the physical proximity between the WHD and the histone binding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>). This interpretation is also corroborated by a different study, where the WHD was found to cross-link with Cac2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), another important component of the histone binding interface on CAF-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>). Together, these findings suggest that the WHD remains in close proximity to H3-H4 on CAF-1. This could be an important structural aspect of the last step of the nucleosome assembly mechanism, where WHD-bound DNA sequesters the histones from the chaperone.</p><p>Our proposed model also demands that two CAF-1 complexes must be located in close proximity to be able to function together in tetrasome assembly. This implies that at least two CAF-1 complexes may simultaneously bind to one PCNA trimer. This is possible considering the presence of three potential binding sites for CAF-1 on a PCNA trimer, but will require further investigations. We cannot exclude that the interaction with PCNA may elicit additional structural rearrangement in CAF-1 that could control the nucleosome assembly mechanism. The importance of the cross-talk between the CAF-1 nucleosome assembly function and PCNA is supported by the finding that Cac1 WHD and PCNA binding mutants exhibit a synergistic effect in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Overall, our data suggest that a combination of relatively low affinity interactions (WHD•DNA, and H3•H3’ in the H3-H4 tetramerization interface) work together to drive (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer deposition onto DNA. This combinatorial effect ensures timely and accurate assembly reactions by bringing together chaperoned histones and DNA. Furthermore, on Cac1, the WHD is separated from the histone binding module by a flexible region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mattiroli et al., 2017</xref>) which is post-translationally modified in a cell cycle dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Holt et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jeffery et al., 2015</xref>). These modifications may well play additional roles in fine-tuning the dynamic interactions of the WHD.</p><p>This study describes the mechanism of histone deposition by CAF-1, a reaction that has remained elusive for other histone chaperones. We demonstrate that an inhibitory intramolecular interaction poises CAF-1 for histone binding and deposition. H3-H4 dimer binding to CAF-1 activates the cascade of events required for its deposition, by unmasking the Cac1 WHD to bind DNA. This mechanism ensures that only histone-bound CAF-1 complexes are able to participate in the deposition process, thus optimizing the efficiency of tetrasome assembly and excluding inefficient participation of empty CAF-1 complexes. By mutating the WHD, we uncouple histone binding and deposition, and demonstrate that high affinity histone binding is not sufficient to sustain efficient nucleosome assembly. This suggests that not all proteins that bind histones (i.e. histone chaperones) are in fact efficient nucleosome assembly factors.</p><p>Finally, the observation that two CAF-1•H3-H4 complexes associate to form a tetrasome suggests that two independently chaperoned H3-H4 dimers are joined at the very last step of the deposition process, when the DNA is in proximity and available for sequestering the histones from CAF-1. While convincing evidence supports the conservative model, where parental (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> are deposited in the same nucleosome following DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xu et al., 2010</xref>), our proposed mechanism does not exclude the possibility of a semiconservative model for chromatin assembly coupled with DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tagami et al., 2004</xref>). Further experiments are required to fully elucidate how CAF-1 complexes are paired in cells to understand the mechanisms underlying histone inheritance during cell division.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning and reagents</title><p>cDNA for the yeast CAF-1 complex were received from Paul Kaufman.

The runs were performed in 20 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM TCEP at room temperature. 100 µL of protein sample at 15 or 100 µM (CAF-1 or WHD samples respectively) were injected at 0.4 ml/min, after being spun down at highest speed for 10 min. Data analysis was done using the ASTRA software (Wyatt) and GraphPad Prism was used to prepare figures. The WHD-18DNA experiments were run on a Superdex 75 10/300 column in line with a DAWN HELEOS II light scattering and a Optilab rEX refractive index detectors (Wyatt).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>EMSA experiments</title><p>Ternary complex formation was set up in 25 mM TRIS pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.02% Tween-20, 0.5 mM TCEP. Proteins were incubated 10 min (3 µM of a 1:1 ratio of tCAF-1 and H3-H4 dimer concentration, or titration as described in figure legend) before addition of DNA (100 nM, titration of DNA to higher concentration didn’t result in higher amount of ternary complex). Histone concentrations refer to histone dimers, even in the case of XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>. 10% final concentration of glycerol was added before loading the samples into a 6% PAGE, pre-run in 0.2x TBE buffer at 150V. Gels were either scanned for fluorescence directly (AttoN647-labeled 18 or 33 bp and labeled histones) or first stained with SybrGOLD and then scanned on a Typhoon FLA 9500.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In solution cross-linking</title><p>2 µM of a 1:1 ratio of CAF-1 and H3-H4 dimer were incubated for 30 min in 20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 75 mM NaCl, 1 mM DTT.

An HA-tag was introduced in the 5’ end of the ORF. This construct was used to transform the PKY106 strain obtained from PD Kaufman (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kaufman et al., 1997</xref>). Mutants were generated using site-directed mutagenesis and were treated as the WT sample. The empty pRS313 vector was used as a control. Transformed PKY106 strains were grown in synthetic media lacking histidine (-His). Clones were amplified overnight and then diluted in the morning and grown to an OD600 = 0.7–0.8. After washing the cells with water and then resuspending them to an OD600 = 1, four 10-fold dilutions from the initial stock were prepared. The undiluted sample and these dilutions were spotted on plates containing -His or -His-Ura media as controls, and -His supplemented with 1 mg/ml 5-Fluoroorotic Acid (FOA) for growth selection. Plates were left at 30°C for 2 days and then left at room temperature for up to the seventh day. To validate HA-Cac1 expression, 7 ml of cultures were harvested at OD600 = 0.7–0.8 and washed in water. The pellet was boiled for 3 min. 50 µl of PBS buffer containing 1 mM TCEP and COMPLETE EDTA-free protease inhibitors was added to the pellet. Cells were lysed using glass beads and the lysate was then spun down. The supernatant was loaded on a SDS PAGE gel and transfer to a PVDF membrane. The blot was probed with anti-HA antibodies (Abcam ab9110 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_307019">AB_307019</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Okazaki fragment assay</title><p>Budding yeast strains yIW347 (wild-type, WT) and yIW397 (Δcac1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yadav and Whitehouse, 2016</xref>) carrying degron-tagged doxycycline-repressible alleles of CDC9 were transformed with empty vector pRS313. yIW397 was also transformed with pRS313,HA-Cac1 construct described above. All transformants were verified and maintained by growth on YC-HIS minimal media. For the Okazaki fragment preparation, all strains were grown at 30°C in YC -HIS liquid medium supplemented with 2% glucose. 50 ml cultures were used for labeling experiments. At OD600 ∼0.3, cells were harvested and re-suspended into 50 ml YEP medium and doxycycline was added to final concentrations of 40 mg/l and the culture shaken at 30°C for 2.5 hr. Genomic DNA was prepared from spheroplasts, radio-labeled, and visualized as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smith et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank P Kaufman for providing the cDNAs of the CAF-1 subunits and the PKY106 strain used in the in vivo silencing assays, I Berger for the MultiBac vectors, Y Liu for the WHD expression construct, the Biofrontiers sequencing facility at CU Boulder for Bioanalyzer runs, and S D’Arcy for the optimization of the XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> crosslinking procedure.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DNA-mediated association of two histone-bound CAF-1 complexes drives tetrasome assembly in the wake of DNA replication&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers find that the paper describes an interesting study of the mechanism of histone (H3/H4)<sub>2</sub> tetrasome deposition by Chromatin Assembly Factor-1, illuminating dependency relationships among protein domains involved in binding histones and DNA.</p><p>Central conclusions:</p><p>1) In the absence of the N-terminal region of the large Cac1 subunit, yeast CAF-1 displays little affinity for DNA, but instead binds histones H3/H4.</p><p>2) Histone binding stimulates DNA binding by the winged-helix domain (WHD) of the large CAF-1 subunit.</p><p>3) Binding of the WHD of CAF-1 to short DNA fragments facilitates H3/H4 tetramerization (while still bound to two CAF-1 proteins).</p><p>4) Different lengths of DNA lead to different requirements for complex formation, with longer DNAs requiring tetramerization of H3/H4 and favoring the release of CAF-1.</p><p>5) Deletion of the WHD domain causes defects in Okazaki fragment length and heterochromatic gene silencing, indirect measures of nucleosome deposition. In vitro, WHD mutations cause modest defects in nucleosome deposition, but only if the N-terminal DNA binding domain of the large CAF-1 subunit is missing.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A) The following points describe concerns or questions raised by the reviewers, where additional experiments would be helpful. Please consider whether these experiments can be done. If not, please explain why and clarify the issues in the revised manuscript.</p><p>1) The authors should address whether the deletion of the WHD alters the kinetics or fidelity of the nucleosomes assembly reaction. Currently, it is unclear whether this DNA binding is only involved in localization of CAF-1 to the substrate DNA or whether binding to the DNA also involves a facilitated transfer of the DNA from CAF-1 to the newly formed nucleosome/tetrasome. Would binding to PCNA substitute for the role of the WHD?</p><p>2) The complex with tCAF-1, H3/H4, and DNA reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is particularly intriguing. Some structural or dynamic data, perhaps from HX, using this complex would add substantial insight into the authors' model for the mechanism of tetrasome assembly by CAF-1.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, Lane 3. XL-H3-H4 seems to have the same effect as DNA in promoting (FL CAF-1)<sub>2</sub>.(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> formation. This suggests that the formation of this species requires cross-linking between H3-H4 dimers by DSS that may be promoted by the 18-mer of DNA. DSS cross-linking assays with H3-H4 +/- 18mer-DNA would be a good control for this.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>. The WHD mutants seem to work very differently than the empty vector control. Why is this? The authors should compare to other mutants (e.g. in the acidic region required for histone binding and/or in the PCNA interaction domain). Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> – a different color should be used to illustrate the WT sample and the DNA ladder.</p><p>B) The following points should be clarified in the revised manuscript, and additional experimental work is not essential.</p><p>1) The text should be amended according to the concerns in sections a-d below.</p><p>a) The main claims of the paper are stated with a strong tendency for hyperbole and these claims should be toned down. For example:</p><p>The authors claim their study is the &quot;…first direct mechanism for histone deposition by a histone chaperone…&quot;. &quot;Direct&quot; seems too 'user-defined' in this instance. And &quot;first&quot; will certainly be contested by others in the field.</p><p>In the Abstract: &quot;here we elucidate the CAF1:H3-H4 binding mode and mechanism of nucleosome assembly.&quot; This work provides insight to the process, but the matter is far from solved, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicates that there may be multiple H3/4 binding modes and assembly mechanisms.</p><p>Discussion: &quot;This suggests that not all proteins that bind histones (i.e. histone chaperones) are in fact nucleosome assembly factors.&quot; This is already well appreciated in the field and not addressed in the current work.</p><p>b) There are a number of statements that should be better referenced. For example:</p><p>In several places the authors refer to H3-H4 binding sites in CAF-1 (Cac1 acidic domain and Cac2) and refer to their own related but unpublished manuscript. It would be more appropriate to cite Liu et al., 2016 and Kim et al., 2016 unless their data do not agree with those reported in the related manuscript by the authors.</p><p>Results: &quot;it appears that the primary role of CAF-1 is to promote the formation of an ordered (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>-DNA complex, the tetrasome.&quot; This statement corroborates previous work that should be referenced.</p><p>c) The authors need to do a better job of explaining/synthesizing earlier results/conclusions from others (e.g. <italic>eLife</italic> paper from Liu et al. 2016). Likewise, the conclusions of this paper seem to contradict those of Winkler et al. 2012 from the same laboratory. Yet this paper is not cited in the places where the authors refer to previous studies showing CAF-1 promoting H3-H4 tetramer formation (Liu et al. 2012, 2016) (e.g., Introduction, fifth paragraph). The authors should clarify how the new work differs from previous results both their own and other labs, and discuss potential reasons (different assays, buffers, etc.) why different conclusions have been reached previously. This discussion may become quite technical, but it is essential to clarify the advances made here and distinguish them from previous studies. The current discussion misses the opportunity to clarify how the authors think previous experiments 'got it wrong' on issues of stoichiometry and/or to synthesize the findings coming from other studies.</p><p>d) The highly speculative discussion of the authors' ideas on how stoichiometry might yield inheritance of histones at replication should be shortened/eliminated as it is not clear that the current studies provide new insights into this process. Indeed, it is not clear that CAF-1 functions in this process at all (CAF-1 may only function during new histone deposition).</p><p>2) The authors use HX-MS experiments to probe changes in CAF-1 conformation upon H3-H4 binding. Similar experiments were carried out by Liu et al. 2016. The authors should compare the data sets and highlight potential differences or, if there is not substantial new information, remove the figure.</p><p>3) The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> predicts that the WHD interacts with the acidic region.

Please consider whether these experiments can be done. If not, please explain why and clarify the issues in the revised manuscript.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The authors should address whether the deletion of the WHD alters the kinetics or fidelity of the nucleosomes assembly reaction.</italic></p><p>The current experimental setup does not allow us to follow the kinetics of the reactions, due to the use of gel-based assays. We are therefore unable to comment on the effect of the WHD on kinetics. However, our data show that in absence of the WHD, the fidelity of the reaction is drastically compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). With a mutated or deleted WHD, tetrasome assembly is disfavored and formation of a disome is preferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B-C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We propose that fidelity of tetrasome assembly is primarily due to the cooperative mode of DNA binding of the WHD domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We added a comment about this in the first paragraph of the subsection “The WHD dictates nucleosome assembly”.</p><p><italic>Currently, it is unclear whether this DNA binding is only involved in localization of CAF-1 to the substrate DNA or whether binding to the DNA also involves a facilitated transfer of the DNA from CAF-1 to the newly formed nucleosome/tetrasome.</italic></p><p>We first want to emphasize that because the WHD binds DNA in a cooperative manner (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), its function goes beyond simply tethering the complex to the DNA. The assembly mechanism is based on our finding that during DNA binding, two CAF-1/H3-H4 complexes are joined to promote product formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><p>However, to further drive home this point, we have now performed competition experiments where we titrate excess DNA to solutions containing a constant concentration of tCAF-1•H3-H4 complexes. In these experiments, DNA titration stimulates histone discharge from CAF-1 in a manner that is WHD-dependent, supporting the notion that the effect of the cooperative DNA binding of the WHD persists even in presence of excess DNA (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>, subsection “DNA length promotes (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> deposition”, fourth paragraph).</p><p>Furthermore, we propose that the return of the WHD to its auto-inhibited position on the Cac1 acidic region may contribute to a facilitated transfer of the histones from CAF-1 to DNA. Although this would be very challenging to prove experimentally, we think it is worth pointing out in light of this reviewer’s comment. We have added these suggestions in the last paragraph of the aforementioned subsection.</p><p><italic>Would binding to PCNA substitute for the role of the WHD?</italic></p><p>We indeed tested whether PCNA could stimulate the association of two CAF-1/H3-H4 complexes, using in solution cross-linking experiments. Here, we see that PCNA interacts with both FL CAF-1 and FL CAF_WHD**, as expected because the WHD mutations do not affect the PCNA-binding region located in the N-terminal part of Cac1. Our experiments clearly show that PCNA, in absence of DNA, does not stimulate the association of two CAF-1 complexes, and hence PCNA itself does not seem to substitute for the role of the WHD-dependent cooperative binding to the DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). This is in line with in vivo data from the Zhang lab (Zhang et al., 2016 NAR) showing that PCNA interaction and WHD mutation have a synergistic effect, and therefore contribute to CAF-1 function through different mechanisms.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.22799.020</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>In solution cross-linking studies of the complexes formed by FL CAF-1/H3-H4 in presence of 1 18 bp DNA (18DNA) or PCNA.</title><p>CAF-1/H3-H4 was kept at 2 µM, 18DNA and PCNA were added at 4 and 8 µM, respectively.

For example, DNA loading of PCNA may be a requirement to fully recapitulate the system; but in our opinion this exceeds the scope of this manuscript. For these reasons, we have not included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref> in the final version of the manuscript, but only include it for the reviewer’s information.</p><p>Overall, our data support a complex role for the WHD that extends beyond DNA binding, and that involves the cooperative association of two complexes, and we propose that this may actively facilitate histone transfer. These activities may not be substituted by the interaction with PCNA.</p><p><italic>2) The complex with tCAF-1, H3/H4, and DNA reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> is particularly intriguing. Some structural or dynamic data, perhaps from HX, using this complex would add substantial insight into the authors' model for the mechanism of tetrasome assembly by CAF-1.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that this complex is interesting and that any structural information would be extremely valuable. We have not yet been able to perform such in-depth analysis, including using HX-MS, because we have had difficulties isolating a stoichiometric, stable and homogenous sample of this ternary complex. Attempting HX-MS or other analyses with complexes that are not stoichiometric or stable will impede valid interpretation of the results. More precisely, because HX-MS results report a measurement of the entire population, the simultaneous analysis of a heterogeneous mixture of species that represents variable conformations for incompletely bound vs. unbound states can lead to results that cannot be distinguished. We are currently developing strategies to increase our molecular understanding of this complex, but this will require a considerable investment of effort and time that we think is beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>However, to further strengthen the characterization of the reaction intermediate, we have now included new SEC-MALS experiments to confirm that the cross-linked complex presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (lane 9) has indeed a molecular mass consistent with the stoichiometry of (CAF-1)<sub>2</sub>•(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>•18DNA (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Formation of this complex is favored in presence of wild-type FL CAF-1, while the WHD mutated complex (FL CAF_WHD**) favors the single CAF-1•H3-H4 complex, in line with our other data (i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, lane 13).</p><p><italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, Lane 3. XL-H3-H4 seems to have the same effect as DNA in promoting (FL CAF-1)<sub>2</sub>.(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> formation. This suggests that the formation of this species requires cross-linking between H3-H4 dimers by DSS that may be promoted by the 18-mer of DNA. DSS cross-linking assays with H3-H4 +/- 18mer-DNA would be a good control for this.</italic></p><p>It is indeed true that crosslinking of the histones (by means of using XL(H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> prior to addition of DNA) promotes the association of two CAF-1 complexes, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, lane 4. We have now performed the suggested control experiment (shown in new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which clearly shows that addition of 18 bp DNA to H3-H4, in absence of CAF-1, does not promote histone tetramerization. This result confirms our hypothesis that the DNA-mediated association of two CAF-1 complexes, each with its histone cargo, precedes the joining of the CAF-1-bound H3-H4 dimers.</p><p><italic>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>. The WHD mutants seem to work very differently than the empty vector control. Why is this? The authors should compare to other mutants (e.g. in the acidic region required for histone binding and/or in the PCNA interaction domain). Also, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref> – a different color should be used to illustrate the WT sample and the DNA ladder.</italic></p><p>We have now added the suggested control (Cac1 with a neutralized acidic region, Cac1_Nac, shown in the updated <underline><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref></underline>) and we have changed the color code.</p><p>The reviewer is correct in that there is a difference in Okazaki fragment distribution between the KO and the WHD mutants. Interestingly, the suggested control mutant Cac1_Nac behaves like a Cac1 deletion strain (updated <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In this mutant, the acidic region has been replaced by a neutral linker, leading to defective histone binding (binding affinity for H3-H4 in vitro is 10-fold lower, shown in the related manuscript).</p><p>We believe that this difference is because CAF-1 WHD mutants bind H3-H4 with the same affinity and stoichiometry as WT CAF-1 and hence they recruit H3-H4 to the replication fork through the interaction between CAF-1 and PCNA which is not affected by the WHD mutations (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>). This may result in passive transfer of H3-H4 onto the nascent DNA, which is likely less efficient than nucleosome assembly mediated by cooperative interaction of two CAF1 moieties through their WHD. In contrast, the Cac1_Nac mutant, which exhibits greatly reduced binding affinity for H3-H4, may fail to efficiently recruit H3-H4 to the replication fork, resulting in the more drastic phenotype that resembles that of the Cac1 KO strain.</p><p>Importantly, the lack of periodicity of the Okazaki fragments purified from WHD mutant strains, together with their extended length (above 400 bp) strongly suggest that timely and controlled replication-coupled nucleosome assembly is compromised in vivo, in line with our model in which the Cac1 WHD is central in orchestrating the accurate histone deposition mechanism.</p><p>We have clarified these issues in the last paragraph of the subsection “The WHD dictates nucleosome assembly”.</p><p><italic>B) The following points should be clarified in the revised manuscript, and additional experimental work is not essential.</italic></p><p><italic>1) The text should be amended according to the concerns in sections a-d below.</italic></p><p><italic>a) The main claims of the paper are stated with a strong tendency for hyperbole and these claims should be toned down. For example:</italic></p><p><italic>The authors claim their study is the &quot;…first direct mechanism for histone deposition by a histone chaperone…&quot;. &quot;Direct&quot; seems too 'user-defined' in this instance. And &quot;first&quot; will certainly be contested by others in the field.</italic></p><p>We have now rephrased these statements in the Abstract and in the text (Introduction, last paragraph and throughout the Discussion).</p><p><italic>In the Abstract: &quot;here we elucidate the CAF1:H3-H4 binding mode and mechanism of nucleosome assembly.&quot; This work provides insight to the process, but the matter is far from solved, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref> indicates that there may be multiple H3/4 binding modes and assembly mechanisms.</italic></p><p>We have now toned down this sentence in the Abstract.</p><p><italic>Discussion: &quot;This suggests that not all proteins that bind histones (i.e. histone chaperones) are in fact nucleosome assembly factors.&quot; This is already well appreciated in the field and not addressed in the current work.</italic></p><p>While this reviewer clearly appreciates this distinction, to our knowledge this has not been explicitly made in literature. Therefore, we prefer to leave this comment in the Discussion. Although this distinction is not directly addressed by our work, we think it makes an important point that will further refine our understanding of histone chaperones.</p><p> <italic>b) There are a number of statements that should be better referenced. For example:</italic></p><p><italic>In several places the authors refer to H3-H4 binding sites in CAF-1 (Cac1 acidic domain and Cac2) and refer to their own related but unpublished manuscript. It would be more appropriate to cite Liu et al., 2016 and Kim et al., 2016 unless their data do not agree with those reported in the related manuscript by the authors.</italic></p><p>We have now improved our references to the recent articles, with regard to the histone binding site (e.g. subsection “CAF-1 has one binding site for a H3-H4 dimer”, first paragraph and subsection “H3-H4 binding activates DNA binding by the Cac1 winged helix domain (WHD)”, second paragraph). These articles do not identify a role for Cac2 in histone binding, which we have demonstrated in our work in the related manuscript. We have also clarified this point in these statements.</p><p><italic>Results: &quot;it appears that the primary role of CAF-1 is to promote the formation of an ordered (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub>-DNA complex, the tetrasome.&quot; This statement corroborates previous work that should be referenced.</italic></p><p>We agree and we have now added a reference to this statement: Smith and Stillman, 1991.</p><p><italic>c) The authors need to do a better job of explaining/synthesizing earlier results/conclusions from others (e.g. eLife paper from Liu et al. 2016). Likewise, the conclusions of this paper seem to contradict those of Winkler et al. 2012 from the same laboratory. Yet this paper is not cited in the places where the authors refer to previous studies showing CAF-1 promoting H3-H4 tetramer formation (Liu et al. 2012, 2016) (e.g., Introduction, fifth paragraph). The authors should clarify how the new work differs from previous results both their own and other labs, and discuss potential reasons (different assays, buffers, etc.) why different conclusions have been reached previously. This discussion may become quite technical, but it is essential to clarify the advances made here and distinguish them from previous studies. The current discussion misses the opportunity to clarify how the authors think previous experiments 'got it wrong' on issues of stoichiometry and/or to synthesize the findings coming from other studies.</italic></p><p>We have now expanded the Discussion to address these comments. We want to make several additional points regarding the apparent discrepancies with the literature, which pertain to the stoichiometry of the CAF-1-histone interaction:</p><p>1) We do not cite the earlier publication from our lab (Winkler et al., 2012), because in the course of this work we have identified reproducibility issues with some of the older data from our lab. We are in correspondence with the journal to rectify these issues in the appropriate manner.</p><p>2) Consequently, the only published work that shows biochemical evidence that CAF-1 binds a (H3- H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer is based on a FRET assay developed by the Churchill lab (Liu et al. 2012 and 2016), without directly measuring the stoichiometry of the CAF-1•H3-H4 complex. We have not been able to set up a similar FRET assay in a reproducible manner. In our manuscript, we use a variety of techniques to directly probe the stoichiometry of the CAF-1•H3-H4 complex. Some are based on FRET (job plot), but others (analytical ultracentrifugation, HX-MS and SEC-MALS) are label-free approaches.</p><p>3) All of these independent approaches documented in the current manuscript support the hypothesis that one CAF-1 complex binds a H3-H4 dimer, which is able to tetramerize with another H3-H4. We should point out that this conclusion is in agreement with the experimental observations in the Liu papers, yet is in contradiction with their interpretation.</p><p>4) We would like to point out that in the Liu et al. 2016 paper, the HX-MS results on the histone proteins are omitted. Nonetheless, from the online “author response” letter to the reviewers on the <italic>eLife</italic> website, we deduced that their conclusions from those experiments were not supportive of binding of a (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> to a CAF-1 complex, but rather in line with our findings.</p><p>We copy the available letter below:</p><p>“6) […] Such a scheme could be helpful in rationalizing why there is no change at the H3/H3' 4- helix bundle; at first glance, one would think that these regions should gain protection going from a dimer to a tetramer (based on published HXMS results). It appears there are insufficient (any?) peptides that could be used to measure this histone interaction – can the authors comment why this might be?</p><p>Please see point 7 below. 7) […]</p><p>We used a slightly different buffer with a different pH in order to stabilize the H3/H4 alone sample for the HX experiment. Therefore, the results between the H3/H4 and CAF-1-H3/H4 samples should not be compared, as the buffer differences alone may explain the differences in HX. Accordingly, we have removed the histone dataset from the manuscript. The HX data indeed had poor coverage, especially around the histone N-terminal tails and α3 of H3; however, the CX data has much better coverage and is sufficient to support our conclusion that CAF-1 interacts with both the N-terminal tails and α helical cores of H3 and H4. Removing these data do not significantly change any conclusions of this study.”</p><p>To our knowledge, our finding that CAF-1 binds a H3-H4 dimer that is capable of forming a (H3-H4)<sub>2</sub> tetramer, either with or without a second CAF-1 molecule, is consistent with the published data, with the exception of the Winkler paper from our lab, which is in the process of being corrected.</p><p>We have included a streamlined version of these observations in the Discussion.</p><p> <italic>d) The highly speculative discussion of the authors' ideas on how stoichiometry might yield inheritance of histones at replication should be shortened/eliminated as it is not clear that the current studies provide new insights into this process. Indeed, it is not clear that CAF-1 functions in this process at all (CAF-1 may only function during new histone deposition).</italic></p><p>We have now shortened this part.</p><p><italic>2) The authors use HX-MS experiments to probe changes in CAF-1 conformation upon H3-H4 binding. Similar experiments were carried out by Liu et al. 2016. The authors should compare the data sets and highlight potential differences or, if there is not substantial new information, remove the figure.</italic></p><p>We have now improved the representation of our HX-MS data, in light of the Liu 2016 paper (now in subsection “H3-H4 binding activates DNA binding by the Cac1 winged helix domain (WHD)”, first paragraph). We decided to maintain our HX-MS data in the manuscript for the following reasons:</p><p>1) We have used a different Cac1 construct (tCac1, instead of FL Cac1 that is used in the Liu 2016 paper) and the data included here demonstrate that tCac1 behaves similarly to FL-Cac1 used in Liu et al.</p><p>2) We include HX-MS results from two different H3-H4 isoforms (WT and DM), which show the same conformational effects on CAF-1. In the Liu 2016 paper, the authors have not included the deuterium uptake results for the histones, which makes this part of our data novel and important for the complete understanding of the complexes.</p><p>3) Compared to Liu et al., we have measured additional time points (1-10-30-60 minutes).</p><p>4) We have identified more peptides overall than in the previous study, which provides a higher resolution look at the HX changes in CAF-1.</p><p>5) The results are largely confirmatory, but also serve two important purposes – that is, 1) to build on the Liu et al. data set by increasing the amount of peptide coverage and HX data collected and, 2) to provide confidence in the HX-MS patterns presented in both manuscripts.</p><p><italic>3) The model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> predicts that the WHD interacts with the acidic region. Can the authors confirm this with direct binding assays or is there already evidence for this in the recent crosslinking studies of CAF-1 (Liu et al., 2016; Kim et al., 2016)?</italic></p><p>In the original paper, we presented support for this hypothesis by performing a competition experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Indeed, in the Liu et al. 2016 paper, they report one EDC cross-link between the Cac1 WHD (aa 583) and a residue adjacent to the acidic region in the Cac2-binding region (aa 460, no cross-links are reported for the acidic regions in their MS experiments) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 1C</xref> in Liu et al. 2016). Strikingly, this cross-link is not detected when H3-H4 are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> in Liu et al. 2016), in line with our data that histone binding releases the WHD from the intramolecular interaction.</p><p>We have now added in solution cross-linking experiments that further validate that in presence of the histone binding module, which contains the Cac1 acidic region and Cac2, we can see the formation of a higher molecular weight complex, which is not formed when we use only the Cac2 subunit, as control (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> and subsection “H3-H4 binding activates DNA binding by the Cac1 winged helix domain (WHD)”, second paragraph), confirming our interpretation that an interaction between the WHD and the acidic region can occur.</p><p><italic>4) As mentioned by the authors, crosslinking experiments showed contacts between the WHD and histones. This seems at odds with the model predicted in this paper. Could it be that the WHD aids histone binding for non-chromatin bound CAF-1, and</italic> in vivo <italic>only switches to bind DNA once the N-terminal region has recruited CAF-1 to PCNA and new DNA? The authors should consider this possibility.</italic></p><p>If we understand this question correctly, the reviewer is proposing a model where PCNA binding may affect the binding “partners” of the Cac1 WHD, which could switch from histone to DNA binding.</p><p>It is possible that PCNA may induce structural changes that affect CAF-1 architecture and we included this idea in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion. However, we have no evidence that the WHD contributes to histone binding:</p><p>1) Liu et al. (in their <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> in the 2016 paper) report a marginal binding affinity between the WHD and histones, significantly lower than what is measured for the CAF-1 complex or the histone binding module.</p><p>2) The cross-linking data may result from the physical proximity of the WHD to the histone binding site that we identify here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B-C</xref>), rather than a direct interaction, as described in our Discussion (third paragraph).</p><p>3) We show that a WHD deletion in CAF-1 does not affect the binding affinity and stoichiometry of CAF-1 to H3-H4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C-E</xref>).</p><p>We have therefore no data to support the idea that the WHD may at any time engage in direct histone binding, so we decided not to include this concept in the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
