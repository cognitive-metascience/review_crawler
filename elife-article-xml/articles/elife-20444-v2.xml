Individuals with suppressed immunity, or suffering from chronic inflammatory conditions such as COPD, are particularly susceptible to influenza. Here we show that suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS) five has a pivotal role in restricting influenza A virus in the airway epithelium, through the regulation of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). <italic>Socs5</italic>-deficient mice exhibit heightened disease severity, with increased viral titres and weight loss. <italic>Socs5</italic> levels were differentially regulated in response to distinct influenza viruses (H1N1, H3N2, H5N1 and H11N9) and were reduced in primary epithelial cells from COPD patients, again correlating with increased susceptibility to influenza. Importantly, restoration of SOCS5 levels restricted influenza virus infection, suggesting that manipulating SOCS5 expression and/or SOCS5 targets might be a novel therapeutic approach to influenza.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.20444.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.20444.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20444.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Influenza, commonly referred to as the flu, is a highly contagious disease caused by a virus. When an infected person coughs or sneezes, droplets containing the virus are released into the air. Other individuals nearby may breathe in the virus, which then enters the cells lining the lungs and multiplies.</p><p>Some people are more susceptible to the influenza virus than others. In particular, individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) often suffer much worse flu symptoms and are more likely to be admitted to hospital. COPD results from smoke exposure, including cigarette smoke and, in developing countries, the smoke from cooking fires, but it is not clear why individuals with COPD are more susceptible to the influenza virus.</p><p>The influenza virus gains entry to lung cells by manipulating receptors on the cell surface. A protein called SOCS5 is present inside these cells and has been suggested as a potential regulator of these receptors. Here, Kedzierski et al. reveal that SOCS5 plays a critical role in protecting lung cells in mice and humans from the virus.</p><p>The experiments show that mice lacking the gene that encodes SOCS5 were more susceptible to infection by the influenza virus, had more severe symptoms of disease and increased amounts of virus in their lungs. Further experiments in lung cells collected from human volunteers show that SOCS5 levels increased in both healthy smokers and non-smokers in response to influenza infection. Conversely, SOCS5 levels in lung cells of smokers with COPD remained low after infection. This suggests that SOCS5 might be an important factor in the susceptibility of these patients to influenza.</p><p>The next is step is to understand exactly how SOCS5 works, which may make it possible to develop new treatments that boost SOCS5 activity in influenza patients.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi"

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus is a single stranded RNA virus that infects the upper respiratory tract and has a major impact on global health. In most instances the effects are largely socioeconomic, with infected individuals requiring bed-rest and recovering at home. However, for the very young, pregnant women, the elderly and the infirm, severe influenza can result in hospitalisation and even death, with seasonal strains accounting for 500,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vanders et al., 2015</xref>). Those that succumb to the disease can die as a result of an unrestrained inflammatory response (often referred to as a ‘cytokine storm’), which together with cell death irretrievably damages the airways releasing fluid into the alveolar spaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Short et al., 2014</xref>). Individuals who suffer from pre-existing respiratory conditions such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are at increased risk of influenza and suffer more severe clinical symptoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glezen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Griffin et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The global community is constantly on the alert for novel avian influenza strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hansbro et al., 2010</xref>) that might acquire the ability to spill over from birds to humans and against which we have no pre-existing antigenic immunity, thus raising the very real threat of a global pandemic (as occurred during the 1918 Spanish Flu). For example, the virulent H5N1 virus, when transmitted from birds to humans has a 50% mortality rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fauci, 2006</xref>) and since 2013, bird-to-human transmission of the H7N9 virus has resulted in over 600 confirmed cases with a mortality rate of approximately 38%, triggering an emergency response in China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hsu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). If such a virus evolved the capacity to transmit efficiently from human-to-human, the effects would be devastating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fauci, 2006</xref>).</p><p>It is not clear why only some individuals respond to infection with exacerbated inflammatory responses. Similarly, the aetiology surrounding sufferers of chronic respiratory disease and their susceptibility to influenza remains poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2012b</xref>). We are however, beginning to understand the innate immune sensors that initiate the immune defence to viral pathogens and the ability of the influenza virus to evade and indeed hijack the host defence to facilitate viral entry and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Encapsulated within the influenza viral envelope are eight RNA segments that encode 11 proteins. Viral entry occurs via attachment of the surface glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) to sialic acid residues on the surface of host respiratory epithelial cells. Endocytosis of the viral particles is accompanied by clustering of adjacent receptor tyrosine kinases into lipid rafts. The EGF receptor (EGFR) is one such example, and virus-dependent clustering of the receptor results in activation of EGFR kinase activity and downstream phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) signaling, which not only facilitates viral entry, but has been shown to suppress interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-induced interferon (IFN) production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Viral RNA generated during replication is detected by host pattern-recognition receptors, specifically by the retinoic-acid induced gene I (RIG-I)-like RNA sensors RIG-I and Melanoma Differentiation-Associated gene 5 (MDA-5) in the cytoplasm and by Toll-like receptor (TLR)s 3, 7 and 8 in the late endosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guillot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hsu et al., 2012b</xref>). Activation of these pathways induces production of type I (IFNα/β) and type III (IFNλ) interferons and subsequently, the transcription of interferon response genes, which are critical for generating an anti-viral state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Crotta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Seth et al., 2005</xref>). The constitutive production of type I IFNs also contributes to anti-viral immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hsu et al., 2012a</xref>). Ultimately, TLR and RIG-I signaling pathways converge to induce pro-inflammatory chemokines and cytokines, and recruit a wave of infiltrating immune cells.</p><p>Several influenza viral proteins thwart the host response, most notably the multi-functional non-structural 1 (NS1) protein, which interacts with numerous host proteins to inhibit mRNA processing and export, prevent IFN production and alter the intracellular environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marc, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Samji, 2009</xref>). For instance, NS1 interacts with the p85 subunit of PI3K to stabilise the kinase complex and promote AKT phosphorylation, enhancing viral entry and inhibiting protective apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrhardt and Ludwig, 2009</xref>).</p><p>The suppressor of cytokine signaling proteins (CIS, SOCS1-7) are an important family of small intracellular proteins which act to limit the duration of signaling responses. They primarily act as adaptor proteins to recruit an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex and facilitate the ubiquitination of substrates bound to the SOCS-SH2 domain or N-terminal region, marking them for proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Linossi and Nicholson, 2012</xref>). While the physiological role and mechanism of action of SOCS1 and particularly SOCS3, are well understood, much less is known about the other family members (SOCS4-7), which in addition to the central phosphotyrosine-binding SH2 domain and C-terminal SOCS box, contain an extended N-terminal region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). Although SOCS5 has been suggested to regulate EGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kario et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholson et al., 2005</xref>) and IL-4 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Seki et al., 2002</xref>), there is a paucity of data to support a role for SOCS5 as a physiological regulator of these pathways in mammalian cells.</p><p>Here we show for the first time that SOCS5 has a unique role in restraining the early phase of influenza A infection in airway epithelial cells. We highlight a novel role for SOCS5 in the regulation of PI3K signaling and demonstrate that SOCS5 primarily protects against viral infection by inhibiting EGFR activity. Given the reduced SOCS5 levels in epithelial cells from COPD patients, this provides a hitherto unknown link that may explain the increased susceptibility of COPD patients to influenza virus infection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice show increased susceptibility to influenza A virus infection</title><p>To examine the role of SOCS5 during an infectious challenge, we infected wild-type and <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> BALB/c mice with the influenza virus strain A/Puerto Rico/8/32 (H1N1; PR8).

Further, mutation of the SOCS5-SH2 domain (R406K) or deletion of the N-terminal 349 residues (ΔNT) reduced SOCS5 interaction with the PI3K complex, whereas mutation of the SOCS box (L484P, C488F) had no effect on binding.

SOCS5 protein was induced in healthy cells 24 h post-H1N1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>) and was consistently reduced in cells from COPD patients, both at a basal level and with limited induction in response to virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). SOCS5 expression inversely correlated with p110α levels and virus-induced EGFR phosphorylation, AKT phosphorylation and viral protein, which was elevated in COPD hAECs as indicated by detection of intracellular viral HA protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether SOCS5 expression -was functionally linked to pathogenicity, hAECs were cultured from healthy individuals or COPD patients and SOCS5 either reduced using siRNA (SOCS5-si) or increased by transient transfection (SOCS5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Depletion of SOCS5 resulted in enhanced levels of the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit in both healthy and COPD hAECs and this occurred independently of virus. Depletion of SOCS5 also resulted in increased viral-induction of EGFR phosphorylation, and the changes in EGFR and PI3K again correlated with increased viral HA levels 2 h post-infection. Phosphorylation of AKT was also enhanced in some experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplements 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">3</xref>).

In this context the requirement for EGFR kinase activity predominates over EGFR-mediated PI3K activity.</p><p>In summary, these data encapsulate several important findings. SOCS5 expression is upregulated in response to influenza A virus infection in hAECs, suggesting that it has an important role in modulating innate host defense. SOCS5 levels are reduced in hAECs from COPD patients and a highly pathogenic avian virus (H5N1) actively reduced SOCS5 expression, thus linking SOCS5 to influenza pathogenesis. Finally, we have shown in vivo and in primary human cells, that SOCS5 acts to negatively regulate EGFR and PI3K signaling and while both are important positive mediators of influenza virus infection, it is SOCS5 restriction of EGFR activity, which limits viral infection in lung epithelium.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Our data position SOCS5 as a pivotal regulator of influenza, a major global disease. Mortality related to infection with highly pathogenic influenza strains is associated with the production of high levels of inflammatory cytokines in the airways (in particular IL-6): the ‘cytokine storm’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Jong et al., 2006</xref>). COPD is a progressive inflammatory disease of the airways that results from smoke exposure (cigarette smoking and biomass smoke) and individuals suffering from COPD are at risk of severe complications following infection with influenza and other respiratory viruses. We suggest that SOCS5 acts as a central switch point, with changes in SOCS5 levels and/or activity impacting disease outcome in individuals such as those with COPD, who exhibit increased susceptibility to influenza.</p><p>The <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice present a novel model of exacerbated human influenza, displaying increased viral load, exaggerated cytokine production in the early phase of the infection and increased neutrophil trafficking into the airways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Although total depletion of neutrophils results in worsened disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tate et al., 2011</xref>), their role is more complex. Neutrophils are strongly associated with the inflammatory pathology observed in severe infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brandes et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Narasaraju et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Perrone et al., 2008</xref>), and the process of NETosis has recently been shown to induce inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">McIlroy et al., 2014</xref>). Our results suggest that in <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, amplification of the inflammatory cascade occurs as the neutrophils die via NETosis, releasing pro-inflammatory molecules such as HMBG1 and 2.</p><p>Influenza virus-induced EGFR, PI3K and AKT activity have each separately been shown to increase viral entry and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ehrhardt and Ludwig, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2015</xref>). Here we link all three to the susceptibility and pathology associated with COPD patients and identify SOCS5 as a key negative regulator of these pathways. While the individual differences observed in AECs may appear modest, the defects in EGFR, PI3K and AKT need to be considered in combination and importantly, in the context of the entire lung. If these small differences occur across a large part of the whole airways in COPD, then the airways will become more susceptible to influenza, as will the patient. There is a fine balance between resistance and susceptibility to infection and these changes could alter the balance towards infection, especially when combined with other immune defects in COPD. Another example is the modest difference seen in IFN signaling in SOCS1-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brysha et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wormald et al., 2006</xref>). While these differences appear small, the consequences in vivo are devastating, SOCS1-deficient mice die of an IFN-driven inflammatory disease shortly after birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 1999</xref>) and similarly <italic>Socs1<sup>−/−</sup> Ifng<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice die rapidly when injected with IFNγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brysha et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>Influenza virus binding to sialic acids on the epithelial cell surface, results in clustering of lipid rafts and crosslinking of surface receptors such as c-Met, PDGF and EGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eierhoff et al., 2010</xref>). The Class I PI3Ks consist of a heterodimer between a regulatory (p85) and a catalytic (p110) subunit of which there are multiple variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantley, 2002</xref>). Phosphorylated EGFR recruits p85 PI3K to the receptor and activation of PI3K results in phosphorylation of phospholipids at the cell membrane, facilitating endocytosis of the virus, presumably through reorganisation of the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ehrhardt et al., 2006</xref>). In addition to this important role for PI3K signaling at the early stages of infection, at later stages direct binding of the viral NS1 protein to PI3K enhances its stability and activation, reducing cell death and maintaining a replicative niche for the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hale et al., 2006</xref>). EGFR signaling can also suppress the host anti-viral response, inhibiting RIG-I-driven type I interferon production by an as yet, unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although PI3K is often activated downstream of EGFR, our data also suggest that PI3K signaling might be targeted by SOCS5 independently of the EGFR. Firstly, PI3K p110α levels were elevated in the lungs of uninfected mice with no apparent corresponding increase in EGFR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Secondly, we captured a specific SOCS5/PI3K p85/p110 complex in 293T cells, in the absence of an EGFR interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). Although the PI3K p110α catalytic subunit was constitutively elevated in <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mouse lungs, expression of the p85 regulatory PI3K subunit appeared to vary with infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). A change in p110:p85 ratio in uninfected cells may prime for enhanced PI3K catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ueki et al., 2002</xref>) following receptor tyrosine kinase activity or direct activation by the influenza virus NS1 protein. This is further supported by the increased phosphorylation of the PI3K downstream substrate AKT in the lungs of <italic>Socs5</italic>-deficient mice during infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6E</xref>).</p><p>Reduced SOCS5 expression in primary human epithelial cells also resulted in increased viral HA protein within 2 h of infection, indicating that early events in the viral life cycle such as viral entry and trafficking are enhanced. This appears to result from EGFR-driven PI3K activity, as inhibition of either kinase ablated the SOCS5-dependent effects on HA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Activation of the viral detection pathways results in the cleavage and shedding of EGFR ligands such as TGFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ito et al., 2015</xref>). If this were the case, EGFR activity may be enhanced in the absence of SOCS5. Ligand-independent EGFR clustering is thought to preferentially result in autophosphorylation of the PI3K docking site (Tyr 992), but not that of other more distal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Huang et al., 2016</xref>). We speculate that SOCS5 may inhibit virus-induced receptor clustering and autophosphorylation and when SOCS5 is reduced, selective activation of the PI3K sites. Coupled with increased PI3K p110 levels, this would give a net increase in PI3K activity at the membrane, resulting in increased receptor endocytosis (enhanced entry).</p><p>Interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the increase in viral titres observed in <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice at 24 h post-inoculation did not resolve with the inhibition of PI3K activity, despite the importance of PI3K activity in this system and the evidence that SOCS5 can independently target PI3K (as discussed above). This suggests that in vivo, SOCS5 regulates PI3K-independent EGFR effects that are required for restraint of the infection. There are many consequences of EGFR signaling, not least of which is a Ras/MAPK-driven transcriptional response, which may explain the difference between the in vivo results and the short-term infections in vitro in primary human cells.</p><p>The SOCS proteins are known to function as adaptors for E3 ubiquitin ligases. If SOCS5 regulated phosphorylated EGFR or PI3K p110α by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, pEGFR/PI3K levels should increase in the presence of a proteasomal inhibitor such as MG132 and the differences observed with reduced or increased SOCS5 expression should be equalized. However, incubation with MG132 did not change the levels of either target (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, the differences consistently observed with altered SOCS5 levels, were retained in the presence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>). Additionally, we were unable to demonstrate SOCS5-mediated ubiquitination of PI3K p110α in an in vitro assay using recombinant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>). Collectively, this suggests that SOCS5 does not regulate either pEGFR or PI3K through proteasomal degradation.</p><p>While proteasomal degradation would have been a reasonable explanation for the elevated pEGFR and PI3K p110α levels in SOCS5-deficient lungs and cells, these results suggest that SOCS5 has alternate ways to modulate protein function and that its regulation of EGFR signaling is more complex than earlier suppositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholson et al., 2005</xref>). SOCS1, SOCS3 and cytokine-inducible SH2-containing (CIS) protein can interact with and inhibit the enzymatic activity of the JAK kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Delconte et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Linossi et al., 2013a</xref>). SOCS5 belongs to the sub-group of SOCS proteins with an extended N-terminal region (369 residues). It is likely that the N-terminal region acts as a scaffold to regulate multiple proteins, in addition to its activity as an E3 ligase.</p><p>Whilst we don’t fully understand the mechanism, SOCS5 may inhibit the ability of EGFR to suppress RIG-I-IFN I production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2013</xref>), possibly through scaffolding larger complexes or targeting an unknown substrate for ubiquitination. Alternatively, SOCS5 may effect a switch in EGFR signaling the result of which is greater viral dependence on EGFR. This is apparent in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor, where even larger differences are observed between SOCS5 wild-type and depleted cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and where the levels of virus in <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells drop below that of wild-type cells in the presence of EGFR inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>Although overexpression of SOCS5 in mammalian cells has been shown to downregulate EGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nicholson et al., 2005</xref>), <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice have no gross EGF-related phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brender et al., 2004</xref>). Further, we have cultured <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> embryonic fibroblasts and found no differences in EGF-induced signaling (data not shown). Thus there is a unique role for SOCS5 in regulating viral activation of the EGFR in lung epithelial cells and this study confirms an important role for endogenous EGFR activity in facilitating viral infections.</p><p>Identifying SOCS5 as a protective regulator of influenza infection and the subsequent hyper-inflammatory response in airway epithelium, offers the potential to target either SOCS5 itself (enhancing SOCS5 expression or using mimetics) or SOCS5 interacting proteins such as PI3K, to reduce the damaging inflammation that is characteristic of severe influenza and chronic respiratory diseases. Similarly, this study also raises the possibility that short-term use of EGFR inhibitors in severe influenza may be beneficial, particularly when coupled with direct delivery to the lung; facilitating rapid action, whilst reducing systemic toxicity.</p><p>We have shown SOCS5 to be a critical regulator of the intracellular pathways that control influenza virus infection. Mice lacking SOCS5 have higher viral loads and exhibit a neutrophilic inflammatory response associated with increased morbidity. Importantly, restoring SOCS5 expression in bronchial epithelial cells from COPD patients reduced viral entry, suggesting that targeting SOCS5 and/or its interacting partners may be valid intervention strategies to alleviate the severe pathology associated with influenza virus infection in COPD patients, immunocompromised individuals or infection with highly pathogenic influenza strains. Future studies will attempt to understand why SOCS5 levels are reduced in epithelial cells from COPD patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Influenza viruses</title><p>Human influenza A/Puerto Rico/8/1934 (H1N1; PR8), A/Auckland/1/2009 (H1N1) A/Wellington/43/2006 (H3N2) and A/Vietnam/1203/04 (H5N1) strains and the avian influenza A/sharp-tailed sandpiper/Australia/6/2004 (H11N9) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hurt et al., 2006</xref>) strain were obtained from the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza (Parkville, Victoria, Australia).

Peptide mixtures were loaded on a 20 mm trap column with 180 mm inner diameter (nanoAcquity UPLC 2 G-V/MTrap 5 mm Symmetry C<sub>18</sub>) at 1% buffer B, and separated by reverse-phase chromatography using a 150 mm column with 75 mm inner diameter (nanoAcquity UPLC 1.7 mm BEH130 C<sub>18</sub>) on a 60 min linear gradient set at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min from 100% buffer A (0.1% formic acid, Milli-Q water) to 30% B (0.1% formic acid, acetonitrile). The Q-Exactive was operated in a data-dependent mode, switching automatically between one full-scan and subsequent MS/MS scans of the ten most abundant peaks. The instrument was controlled using Exactive series version 2.1 build 1502 and Xcalibur 3.0. Full-scans (m/z 350–1850) were acquired with a resolution of 70,000 at 200 m/z. The 10 most intense ions were sequentially isolated with a target value of 10000 ions and an isolation width of 2 m/z and fragmented using HCD with normalized collision energy of 19.5 and stepped collision energy of 15%.

Deamidation of arginines was used to identify citrullinated peptides, resulting in a mass increase of 1 Da. The mass tolerance for precursor ions and fragment ions were 20 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively.

A feature was defined as the combination of peptide sequence, charge and modification. Features not found in at least half the number of replicates in each group were removed. Proteins identified from hits to the reverse database and proteins with only one unique peptide were also removed. To correct for injection volume variability, feature intensities were normalized by converting to base two logarithms and then multiplying each value by the ratio of maximum median intensity of all replicates over median replicate intensity. Features assigned to the same protein differ in the range of intensity due to their chemico-physical properties and charge state. To further correct for these differences, each intensity value was multiplied by the ratio of the maximum of the median intensities of all features for a protein over the median intensity of the feature. Missing values were imputed using a random normal distribution of values using the mean of the real distribution of values minus 1.8 standard deviations, and a standard deviation of 0.5 times the standard deviation of the distribution of the measured intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cox et al., 2014</xref>). The probability of differential expression between groups was calculated using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test excluding any non-unique sequences and any features with modifications other than oxidation and carbamidomethylation.

In this manuscript, the authors report studies of influenza virus infection of SOCS5 knockout mice, cell cultures and biochemical analysis of EGFR-PI3K signaling pathway. They propose that SOCS5 is a critical regulator of influenza virus infection by regulating EGFR-PI3K signaling. The study also suggests the decreased level of SOCS5 gene is responsible for increased susceptibility of individuals with COPD to flu infection. It has been known for some time that SOCS5 can physically associate with EGFR, the activity of EGFR/PI3K and AKT has also been linked to flu infection in previous studies. This is the first study linking all these parts together and it provides some new insights into the host-virus interaction of this important virus. However, evidence provided in the manuscript is only suggestive and cannot support the major claims of the paper.</p><p>1) A large amount of studies using gene knockout mice have indicated many genes, for example SOCS4 and innate immunity sensors, are involved in regulating influenza virus infection. The importance of SOCS5 gene in the infection should be compared with at least one or two of them, however, no such data was presented.</p><p>2) In addition to EGFR, additional ErbB/EGFR family members were also found to be regulated by SOCS5; moreover, it's known that influenza virus doesn't use a specific protein receptor on the cell surface, but instead binds to sialic acid of many cell surface proteins and glycolipids. It is likely that other receptors engaged with SOCS5 might also contribute to the infection by signaling and/or mediating viral entry.</p><p>3) Although an intrinsic epithelial cell defect may be responsible for the phenotype observed in <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice, no convincing evidence showing viral entry was enhanced.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>In this study, authors found that <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice were more sensitive to influenza virus infection than WT mice, and SOCS5 limited influenza virus entry. They also found that SOCS5 elves were lower in epithelial cells from COPD patients, which is consistent with increased susceptibility to influenza.

While the data are incremental in that they take forward the directions indicated by recent literature, they do provide important new information well worth publication, if the following issues are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>It would be useful to have four sets of concerns addressed substantively.</p><p>1) The first concern relates to the mechanisms by which SOCS5 affects EGFR or PI3K activities. Authors should provide more clear biochemical data of SOCS5-mediated EGFR or PI3K suppression. Authors addressed the possibility in the Discussion that SOCS5 inhibits cluster-induced autophosphorylation. The reduction of SOCS5 expression leads to selective activation of the PI3K sites that would give a net increase in PI3K activity at the membrane, resulting in increased receptor endocytosis. However, this possibility is quite speculative. Another possibility may be that the SOCS5 binding to PI3K p110 leads to ubiquitination dependent degradation. This hypothesis is supported by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, which shows increased protein levels of PI3K p110 in <italic>Socs5<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells, and also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> which showed interaction of SOCS5 with PI3K complex. Authors should show in vitro ubiquitination of p110 by SOCS5 and enhanced proteasomal degradation of p110 by SOCS5 in infected or EGFR activated cells. If second possibility is the case, increase of p110 levels in COPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) can be explained easily.</p><p>2) The claimed differences in phosphorylation and/or upregulation of several signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) between healthy persons and COPD patients might be statistically significant, but the question remains whether some of these very weak differences are leading to a real biological difference. Only clear effects are seen when SOCS5 was exogenously overexpressed or silenced, indicating that the decreased induction of SOCS5 by H1N1 in COPD patients has very partial effects on EGFR, PI3K and AKT activity.</p><p>3) The observation that both EGFR and PI3K inhibition ablated the SOCS5-dependent effects on virus load and that only EGFR inhibition reversed the increase in virus load both in vivo and in vitro, raises more questions and demands more clarification then the explanation given in the Discussion, which is quite speculative.</p><p>4) The final concern relates to the mechanisms of how SOCS5 regulate influenza virus infection via EGFR signaling. This was explained by ligand-independent receptor activation as a consequence of receptor clustering. RIG-I and MDA-5 and TLR3, 7 and 8 are likely to be initial activation signal leading to receptor clustering. It was shown before that Influenza A virus infection induces TGF release and EGFR activation in AECs (Ito et al., 2015). Also, SOCS5 levels were shown to be elevated after EGF stimulation (Kario et al., 2005). However, their explanation was not adequately answered.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20444.025</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>[…] It has been known for some time that SOCS5 can physically associate with EGFR, the activity of EGFR/PI3K and AKT has also been linked to flu infection in previous studies. This is the first study linking all these parts together and it provides some new insights into the host-virus interaction of this important virus. However, evidence provided in the manuscript is only suggestive and cannot support the major claims of the paper.</italic> </p><p>We have now addressed this critique by using EGFR and PI3K inhibitors both in vivo in mice and in ex vivo primary mouse and human epithelial cells. The data obtained in all three systems (in vivo and ex vivo mouse and human) are strikingly consistent and clearly demonstrate that the increased viral load observed in the absence of SOCS5 is due to alterations in EGFR kinase activity and <italic>not to</italic> increased PI3K activity. This data does not negate the role of PI3K in influenza virus infection (and indeed confirms it), nor does it detract from the observation that SOCS5 regulates PI3K signaling. This remains an important novel finding of this study. It specifically addresses the concerns of the reviewer and demonstrates conclusively that SOCS5 restrains influenza virus infection by regulating EGFR kinase activity.</p><p>These data have been incorporated as a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) with appropriate detail in the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p><italic>1) A large amount of studies using gene knockout mice have indicated many genes, for example SOCS4 and innate immunity sensors, are involved in regulating influenza virus infection. The importance of SOCS5 gene in the infection should be compared with at least one or two of them, however, no such data was presented.</italic> </p><p>As requested by the reviewer, we have compared the SOCS5 phenotype with that of mice lacking functional SOCS4. In addition, we also compared the SOCS5 phenotype with that of Rag2<sup>-/-</sup>IL-2Rgc<sup>-/-</sup> SirpA mice, which lack T/B cells, NK cells and ILCs (Legrand et al., PNAS 2011). We were limited by the availability of gene-targeted mice on the Balbc background, but given that NK cells are a major lymphocytic population in the lung and are important in restraining early viral loads (Stein-Streilein et al., Reg Immunol 1998; J Immunol 1996), we felt that the SirpA mice would be a useful comparison. It is worth noting that very few studies have examined viral loads at 24 h post-inoculation. Loss of SOCS4 function resulted in a significant increase in influenza virus which was greater than that observed with loss of <italic>Socs5</italic>. The increased levels of virus in the <italic>Socs5<sup>-/-</sup> </italic>were comparable to those observed in Rag2<sup><sub>-/-</sub></sup>IL-2Rgc<sup><sub>-/-</sub></sup>SirpA mice. These data reveal that (i) the Socs5 phenotype is at least as significant as that observed in mice lacking innate lymphocytes, and (ii) SOCS4 appears to have an additional role to that described in Kedzierski et al., PLOS Pathogens 2014. This latter could be due to SOCS4 regulating EGFR, JAK/STAT or TLR2 signaling (Arts et al., J Intern Med 2015; Linossi et al., PLOS One 2013; Bullock et al., Structure 2007) and will be investigated further in a subsequent publication. This data has been added in as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) In addition to EGFR, additional ErbB/EGFR family members were also found to be regulated by SOCS5; moreover, it's known that influenza virus doesn't use a specific protein receptor on the cell surface, but instead binds to sialic acid of many cell surface proteins and glycolipids. It is likely that other receptors engaged with SOCS5 might also contribute to the infection by signaling and/or mediating viral entry.</italic> </p><p>To date, all of the evidence for SOCS5 regulation of EGFR family members is either correlative or derived from overexpression studies. Ours is the first study to conclusively demonstrate a role for SOCS5 in regulating EGFR signaling at the level of endogenous proteins. The requirement for influenza virus binding to sialic acid is undisputed. However, there is substantial evidence supporting a role for EGFR in viral entry and suppression of the anti-viral response (e.g. Eierhoff et al., Plos Pathogens 2010; Ueki et al., JEM 2013). Our new data further support this, with inhibition of EGFR signalling reducing viral loads in primary mouse and human wild-type epithelial cells. Furthermore, using a selective EGFR inhibitor we have now demonstrated that loss of SOCS5 regulation of EGFR activity is responsible for the increased susceptibility of <italic>Socs5<sup><sub>-/-</sub> </sup></italic>mice to influenza virus. We agree that SOCS5 may also regulate other receptors, which might be involved in viral infection, but while receptors such as c-Met have been implicated, there is currently no data to suggest that they are regulated by SOCS5.</p><p><italic>3) Although an intrinsic epithelial cell defect may be responsible for the phenotype observed in Socs5<sup>−/−</sup> mice, no convincing evidence showing viral entry was enhanced.</italic> </p><p>Our in vitro human data show differences in viral HA expression with SOCS5-depletion within 2 h of infection and this was normalised by either EGFR or PI3K inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>, new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Differences at this timepoint are strongly supportive of a change in viral entry and/or trafficking, particularly in the context of known roles for EGFR-PI3K in viral infection. As a preliminary step towards investigating this, we compared the viral loads by adding inhibitors before or after addition of virus inoculum (plaque assay, 24 h post-infection). Our logic being that if the differences resulted from increased viral entry/trafficking then when the EGFR inhibitor Erlotinib was added post-infection we should retain the increased viral replication in Socs5-deficient cells. If the differences occurred during replication, then addition of EGFR inhibitor post-infection should have the same effect as that observed when added before infection (loss of the Socs5 difference). The latter occurred (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Author response image 1</xref>), suggesting that the critical effect of Socs5 loss was <italic>not</italic> on viral entry.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20444.021</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Primary hAECs- infected with H1N1.</title><p>Left-hand-side of graph: EGFR inhibitor (Erlotinib) and P13K inhibitor (Wortmannin) were added prior to influenza virus infection.

The reduction of SOCS5 expression leads to selective activation of the PI3K sites that would give a net increase in PI3K activity at the membrane, resulting in increased receptor endocytosis.

This hypothesis is supported by the data of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, which shows increased protein levels of PI3K p110 in Socs5<sup>−/−</sup> cells, and also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> which showed interaction of SOCS5 with PI3K complex. Authors should show in vitro ubiquitination of p110 by SOCS5 and enhanced proteasomal degradation of p110 by SOCS5 in infected or EGFR activated cells. If second possibility is the case, increase of p110 levels in COPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) can be explained easily.</italic> </p><p>We agree that examining whether SOCS5 regulates p110 by ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation is an important point to address. We took several approaches to investigate this:</p><p>i) We reduced (siRNA) or increased (exogenous) expression of SOCS5 in combination with a proteasomal inhibitor (MG132) and examined pEGFR, pAKT and PI3K p110α levels in a minimally immortalised bronchial epithelial cell line (BCi-NS1.1). If SOCS5 regulated these targets by proteasomal degradation, we would predict that target levels would increase in the presence of MG132 and that differences observed with knockdown or increased SOCS5 expression would be equalized in the presence of MG132. Consistent with all of our previous data, siRNA knockdown of SOCS5 resulted in increased phosphorylation of EGFR (pEGFR) and AKT (pAKT), increased PI3K p110α levels and increased viral load (HA), whilst constitutive expression of SOCS5 had the converse effect, resulting in reduced pEGFR, pAKT, p110 and HA. However, incubation with MG132 for 4 h did not alter the level of the targets, suggesting that at the endogenous level, degradation through the proteasome is not a major source of regulation. Similarly, the differences observed with either SOCS5 knockdown or expression did not significantly change in the presence of MG132. These results show a consistent phenotype resulting from changes in SOCS5 in a human bronchoepithelial cell line (now consistent across primary bronchial human and mouse epithelial cells, and a human cell line) and the results have been included as part of the Discussion (eighth paragraph) and in the supplementary data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>ii) Our second approach utilised an in vitro ubiquitination assay. This assay incorporated recombinant SOCS5-SH2-SOCS box protein produced as a trimeric protein with the adaptors Elongin B/C for stability, and the necessary proteins involved in ubiquitination (recombinant E1, E2, Rbx2, Cullin-5; as in Delconte et al., Nat Immunol 2016). Recombinant PI3K p110α was also added (Promega). These results were negative and we did not observe SOCS5-mediated ubiquitination of PI3K p110α (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 2</xref>).<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.20444.022</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>SOCS5 does not ubiquitinate PI3K p110α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Recombinant PI3K p110α (Promega) was incubated with the SOCS5-E3 ligase complex (GST-SOCS5-SH2-BC with Cullin5 and Rbx2) or GST alone as a control, together with ubiquitin, E1 and E2 enzymes at 37°C for the times indicated.

While this would have been a ‘nice’ explanation for the elevated PI3K p110α levels, these results suggest that SOCS5 uses other ways to modulate protein function, such as by altering the stability of the target protein (either by direct interaction or by ubiquitination). How this occurs is an interesting question and worthy of further investigation, but beyond the scope of the current manuscript. Discussion of these results has been included in the eighth paragraph of the Discussion as “data not shown”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response images 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">3</xref> are not currently included in the manuscript. We are willing to include these figures in supplementary material (currently 7 supplementary figures) if the editors think that this would be a useful addition.</p><p><italic>2) The claimed differences in phosphorylation and/or upregulation of several signaling proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) between healthy persons and COPD patients might be statistically significant, but the question remains whether some of these very weak differences are leading to a real biological difference. Only clear effects are seen when SOCS5 was exogenously overexpressed or silenced, indicating that the decreased induction of SOCS5 by H1N1 in COPD patients has very partial effects on EGFR, PI3K and AKT activity.</italic> </p><p>Some of these differences may be small in AECs, but we think of this in the context of the whole airways. If these small differences occur across a large part of the whole airways in COPD, then they will become more susceptible to influenza virus infection, as will the patient. Further evidence for this is provided by the observation that <italic>Socs5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice are more susceptible to influenza viral infection. There is a fine balance between resistance and susceptibility to infection and this could tip the balance towards infection, especially when combined with other immune defects in COPD. Collectively, the defects in EGFR, PI3K and AKT will be compounded when they occur together, compared to each in isolation. These are typical effects seen in AECs (Hsu et al., AJRCCM 2015).</p><p>Another example that we can point to is the modest differences seen in IFN signalling in SOCS1 knockout cells (Brysha et al., JBC 2001; Wormald et al., JBC 2006). While these differences are small, in vivo the consequences are devastating, SOCS1-deficient mice die of an IFN-driven inflammatory disease shortly after birth (Alexander et al., Cell 1999) and similarly <italic>Socs1<sup>-/-</sup>IFNγ<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice die rapidly when injected with IFNγ (Brysha et al., JBC 2001).</p><p>It is also worth reiterating that these results are very consistent and the effects of reducing <italic>Socs5</italic> expression have now been confirmed in a human cell line, in primary human broncho-epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), and in mice.</p><p>We have extended the discussion around this point: “While the individual differences observed in AECs may appear modest, the defects in EGFR, PI3K and AKT need to be considered in combination and importantly, in the context of the entire lung. […] While these differences appear small, in vivo the consequences are devastating, SOCS1-deficient mice die of an IFN-driven inflammatory disease shortly after birth (Alexander et al., 1999) and similarly <italic>Socs1<sup>-/-</sup>IFN</italic>γ<sup><italic>-/-</italic> </sup>mice die rapidly when injected with IFNγ (Brysha et al., 2001).”</p><p><italic>3) The observation that both EGFR and PI3K inhibition ablated the SOCS5-dependent effects on virus load and that only EGFR inhibition reversed the increase in virus load both in vivo and in vitro, raises more questions and demands more clarification then the explanation given in the Discussion which is quite speculative.</italic> </p><p>These data highlight the complexity of anti-viral responses. They show that both EGFR and PI3K/AKT are important in the <italic>Socs5</italic>-dependent effects on viral replication. Essentially, we have examined this in vitro at an early point in viral internalization (2 h post-infection, prior to viral replication) and in vivo at a later timepoint (24 h, prior to adaptive immune response). These results show that EGFR signalling is important in both instances and is responsible for the elevated viral load observed in <italic>Socs5</italic>-deficient mice, whilst SOCS5 regulation of PI3K signalling is only critical during the early phase of viral infection. We agree that these data do raise more questions, and that the explanation given is quite speculative. However, we also consider these to be complex events, which can’t be simplified to provide an easy answer.</p><p>Accordingly, we have revised and broadened the discussion around this point: “Interestingly and somewhat surprisingly, the increase in viral titres observed with in <italic>Socs5<sup>-/-</sup></italic>mice at 24 h post-inoculation did not resolve with the inhibition of PI3K activity, despite the importance of PI3K activity in this system and the evidence that SOCS5 can independently target PI3K (as discussed above). […] It is likely that the N-terminal region acts as a scaffold to regulate multiple proteins, in addition to its activity as an E3 ligase.”</p><p><italic>4) The final concern relates to the mechanisms of how SOCS5 regulate influenza virus infection via EGFR signaling. This was explained by ligand-independent receptor activation as a consequence of receptor clustering. RIG-I and MDA-5 and TLR3, 7 and 8 are likely to be initial activation signal leading to receptor clustering. It was shown before that Influenza A virus infection induces TGF release and EGFR activation in AECs (Ito et al., 2015). Also, SOCS5 levels were shown to be elevated after EGF stimulation (Kario et al., 2005). However, their explanation was not adequately answered.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention. Ito et al., AJPLCMP 2015, showed that A/PR/8 infection of primary human AECs resulted in TGFα release and activation of EGFR signalling. Pro-TGFα cleavage is thought to occur via a TLR/ROS/ADAM protease cascade (Koff et al., AJPLCMP 2008). It is possible that a similar mechanism occurs here and that RIG/TLR activation results in the shedding of EGFR ligands. However, it seems unlikely that this would occur within 2 h of viral infection (as in our human in vitroassays), with the majority of the published data examined at 24 h post-infection.</p><p>We have extended our discussion in consideration of this point as follows: “Activation of the viral detection pathways results in the cleavage and shedding of EGFR ligands such as TGFα (Ito et al., 2015). […] We speculate that SOCS5 may inhibit virus-induced receptor clustering and autophosphorylation and when SOCS5 is reduced, selective activation of the P13K sites.”</p><p>Shortly after the paper by Kario et al., JBC 2005, was published showing EGF-induction of SOCS5 expression, we attempted but were unable to reproduce the data showing upregulation of SOCS5 in HeLa cells (Nicholson unpublished). However, this does not exclude the possibility that EGF ligands are inducing SOCS5 expression in epithelial cells in vivo, in response to virus.</p></body></sub-article></article>
