The Cricket Paralysis Virus employs an Internal Ribosomal Entry Site (CrPV-IRES) to express its structural genes in the late stage of infection. Ribosome hijacking is achieved by a sophisticated use of molecular mimicry to tRNA and mRNA, employed to manipulate intrinsically dynamic components of the ribosome. Binding and translocation through the ribosome is required for this IRES to initiate translation. We report two structures, solved by single particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM), of a double translocated CrPV-IRES with aminoacyl-tRNA in the peptidyl site (P site) of the ribosome. CrPV-IRES adopts a previously unseen conformation, mimicking the acceptor stem of a canonical E site tRNA. The structures suggest a mechanism for the positioning of the first aminoacyl-tRNA shared with the distantly related Hepatitis C Virus IRES.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34062.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Viruses cannot replicate themselves, but instead depend on components of the host cell for their own survival. Once a virus successfully enters a cell, it must use part of the cell’s machinery – specifically the ribosomes – to produce its own proteins. Ribosomes normally make the cell’s proteins by reading instructions written in molecules known as messenger RNAs (or mRNAs for short). Viruses hijack ribosomes using structured RNA segments in its mRNAs that can mimic natural components of the cell’s protein-producing machinery. These RNA sequences, known as IRESs, feature a refined balance between rigidity and flexibility. Their flexible nature has made them difficult to study in the past, though the latest advances in electron cryo-microscopy mean that IRESs can now be directly observed in complex with ribosomes.</p><p>Pisareva et al. sought to image a prototypical IRES sequence from the Cricket Paralysis Virus as it is transitioned through the ribosome. The idea was to characterize the late stages of ribosome hijacking. First, all the essential components were purified, mixed in the laboratory, and then imaged via electron cryo-microscopy. Image processing and sorting algorithms were then used to visualize the process at a high level of detail. Unexpectedly, this showed that the IRES changes shape dramatically to mimic part of another RNA molecule, a tRNA, when it reaches the so-called exit site of the ribosome. Short for transfer RNAs, tRNAs are molecules that bring the building blocks of proteins (called amino acids) to the ribosome, ready to be linked together. The shape change in the IRES is coupled with the placement of the first amino acid-loaded tRNA in a site on the ribosome that commits it to producing the viral protein.</p><p>These results illustrate the remarkable ability of RNA molecules, in general, and IRES sequences, in particular, to adopt distinctive and context-specific shapes. These features seem to be widely conserved among diverse virus families as a similar shape change has been see in the IRES of the distantly related Hepatits C Virus. Together these new insights could lead to new strategies to interfere with viral replication and further studies that deepen our understanding of how ribosome and RNA-based mechanisms work generally inside cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rabbit</kwd><kwd>reticulocyte</kwd><kwd>ribosome</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM097014</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pisarev</surname><given-names>Andrey V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A conformational change in the Cricket Paralysis Virus IRES upon double translocation in the ribosome uncovers an unexpected similarity with the Hepatitis C Virus IRES.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Translation initiation is the most complex and highly regulated step of protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schmeing and Ramakrishnan, 2009</xref>). Canonical initiation results in the formation of an elongation-competent ribosome with an aminoacyl-tRNA base paired with messenger RNA (mRNA)at the peptidyl site (P site) of the ribosome. Translation initiation in eukaryotes is achieved by a highly sophisticated mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). Most eukaryotic mRNAs contain a unique nucleotide structure at their 5’ end, known as the cap structure. The multi-subunit initiation factor eIF4F binds the cap structure and recruits the 43S complex consisting of the small ribosomal subunit (40S), eIF2/GTP/Met-tRNA<sup>Met</sup> ternary complex, eIF3, eIF1, eIF1A, and eIF5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>). The attached 43S complex scans the 5’-untranslated region of the mRNA downstream to the initiation codon, where it forms the 48S initiation complex with the established codon-anticodon base-pairing in the ribosomal P site. Finally, eIF5B, the eukaryotic ortholog of the bacterial initiation factor 2 (IF2), promotes the recruitment of the large ribosomal subunit (60S) and the formation of the elongation-competent 80S ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fernández et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic viruses have evolved refined molecular strategies to interfere with canonical initiation factors, leading to the hijacking of host ribosomes to produce viral proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jackson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hertz and Thompson, 2011</xref>). A common strategy used by different types of viruses relies on structured RNA sequences at the ends of their mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</xref>).These sequences are called Internal Ribosomal Entry Sites (IRES) and form specific three-dimensional structures able to manipulate and co-opt the host translational machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yamamoto et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>IRES sequences are classified according to the subset of factors they require for initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Filbin and Kieft, 2009</xref>). Type IV IRES sequences, including the Cricket Paralysis Virus IRES (CrPV-IRES) and the Taura Syndrome Virus IRES (TSV-IRES) do not require initiation factors and are the best studied IRESs. Biochemical and structural studies have provided a detailed view on how these approximately 200-nucleotide-long sequences interact with and manipulate the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wilson et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petrov et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A modular architecture of three pseudoknots (PKI, PKII and PKIII, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is crucial for these IRESs to establish a balance between structural flexibility and rigidity, essential for interaction with the ribosome and with two elongation factors (eEF2 and eEF1A) required for IRES translocation through the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jan et al., 2003</xref>).

Similarly, after peptidyl-transfer in canonical translocation, the ribosome alternates between rotated and non-rotated configurations of the small ribosomal subunit with respect to the large ribosomal subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Voorhees and Ramakrishnan, 2013</xref>). This pre-translocation stage of the ribosome is recognized by a protein translocation factor (EF-G in Bacteria, eEF2 in Eukarya), which in GTP-bound form induces an additional rotation of the small subunit and blocks the A site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tourigny et al., 2013</xref>). Translocation proceeds forward by a back rotation of the small subunit to recover a canonical configuration of the ribosome. This is accomplished by a swiveling movement of the head of the small subunit in an orthogonal direction respect to that of the rotation of the small subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ratje et al., 2010</xref>). The back-rotation of the small subunit accompanied by the swiveling of the head is performed while EF-G/eEF2 are still bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ramrath et al., 2013</xref>). Once the translocation factor EF-G/eEF2 leaves the ribosome, the head of the small subunit returns to its non-swiveled configuration, rendering a ribosome primed with a peptidyl-tRNA in the P site, a deacylated tRNA in the E site and a vacant A site ready to accept the next aminoacyl-tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Noller et al., 2017</xref>). The L1 stalk, a component of the large ribosomal subunit, also contribute to the vectorial movement of tRNAs, offering additional anchoring points to the leaving deacylated-tRNA in the E site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fei et al., 2008</xref>). The movements of the L1 stalk are coordinated with those of the small subunit. Type IV IRESs require two translocation events to place the first aminoacyl-tRNA in the P site making use of the intrinsic dynamic elements of the ribosome involved in canonical translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeyrathne et al., 2016</xref>). However, less is known about the second translocation event, required for the first aminoacyl-tRNA to enter the P site, ending the unusual initiation pathway followed by this type of IRESs.</p><p>We report the visualization by means of single-particle electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) of two related states of the mammalian ribosome with a double translocated CrPV-IRES and P site aminoacyl-tRNA at 3.2 and 4.75 Ångstroms resolution. The head swiveling of the small ribosomal subunit plays a fundamental role in the late step of this translocation event, inducing a remarkable conformational change on the PKI of the CrPV-IRES, which becomes disassembled, to mimic the acceptor stem of a E site tRNA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To analyze the integrity and stability of complexes for cryoEM, we assembled ribosomal complexes with a double translocated CrPV-IRES in a mammalian reconstituted system from individual components in the presence of GTP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).The translocation efficiency was monitored by toe-printing. A pre-translocation complex, assembled by mixing of CrPV-IRES with 40S and 60S subunits, results in a +14–15 nt toe-print signal from the CCU (sequence belonging to the PKI) and thus indicate the presence of PKI in the ribosomal A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 3). The addition of elongation factors leads to a 5–6 nucleotides toe-print shift showing the double translocation event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 4). However, the similar intensity of several bands, with difference in one nucleotide, suggests instability of the double translocated IRES or frame ambiguity. We reasoned this ambiguity could be explained by the absence of an A site ligand, what would allow partial back translocation of the IRES even in the presence of a translocated aminoacyl-tRNA in the P site. Similarly, in the single translocated CrPV-IRES cryoEM reconstruction, it was necessary the addition of an A site ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). In this report, the mutation of the first sense codon to a stop codon and the addition of the release factor 1 (eRF1) were applied to prevent spontaneous back-translocation of the IRES. Thus, to stabilize a double translocated complex, we mutated the second sense codon to a UAG stop codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).The supplementation of the reaction with a mutated and catalytically inactive version of the release factor 1 (eRF1*, AGQ mutation) causes a +20 nt toe-print signal from the first sense codon (leucine CUU codon) in the P site, which is in a good agreement with previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>), indicating proper binding of eRF1* (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lane 5). The simultaneous decrease of intensity for the 5–6 nucleotides toe-print suggests a more homogeneous complex, suitable for structural studies. Given the conformation of the P site tRNA is completely compatible with that of a translating ribosome, we believe the addition of eRF1* in the present sample does not significantly affect the conformation of the CrPV-IRES.</p><p>Maximum likelihood particle sorting methods implemented in RELION (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Scheres, 2012</xref>) were applied to a large cryoEM dataset at two different stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). An initial classification in two dimensions allowed for the separation of full ribosome (80S) from small subunit (40S) particles. The two sorted subgroups were further classified using masking methods with signal subtraction with focus in the inter-subunit space, where this type of IRES binds as well as canonical translation factors. The L1 stalk was also included in the masked area to allow for a wider sampling. This strategy revealed, in a single classification step, several sub-populations, reflecting the heterogeneity of the sample. A binary 80S/CrPV-IRES complex in a pre-translocation conformation could be identified as well as two sub-populations with CrPV-IRES in a double translocated state. In the double translocated reconstructions, the ribosome adopts a non-rotated configuration of the small subunit, with clear density for aminoacyl-tRNA in the P site and a either eEF2 or eRF1* in the A site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34062.004</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Data collection, model refinement and validation statistics.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th colspan="3" valign="top">Data collection</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"> Voltage (KV)</td><td valign="top">300</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Defocus range (μm)</td><td valign="top">−0.5/–3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Pixel size (Å/pixel)</td><td valign="top">1.08</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Electron dose (e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup>)</td><td valign="top">64</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Images collected</td><td valign="top">16,303</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top">Model Refinement</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">CrPV-IRES/eRF1<sup>*</sup></td><td valign="top">CrPV-IRES/eEF2</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Program/Protocol</td><td valign="top">Refmac5/Reciprocal space</td><td valign="top">Phenix/Real space</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Resolution:</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> FSC 0.143 (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.2</td><td valign="top">4.75</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Used in refinement (Å)</td><td valign="top">3.8</td><td valign="top">7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Map sharpening (Å)</td><td valign="top">−91.86</td><td valign="top">−113.6</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Average B-factors (Å)</td><td valign="top">169.58</td><td valign="top">394.12</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> R.m.s deviations:</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Bonds (Å)</td><td valign="top">0.011</td><td valign="top">0.0033</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Angles (<sup>o</sup>)</td><td valign="top">1.58</td><td valign="top">0.83</td></tr><tr><td colspan="3" valign="top">Validation</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Molprobity score</td><td valign="top">2.81</td><td valign="top">1.50</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Clashcore, all atoms</td><td valign="top">5.74</td><td valign="top">3.86</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Favored rotamers (%)</td><td valign="top">88.51</td><td valign="top">99.7</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Ramachandran plot:</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Outliers (%)</td><td valign="top">3</td><td valign="top">0.02</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"> Favored (%)</td><td valign="top">83.23</td><td valign="top">95.3</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Recent studies by single-molecule FRET (smFRET) have characterized the kinetics of the translocation events required for the CrPV-IRES to deliver an aminoacyl-tRNA to the P site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petrov et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>).

In the pre-translocated as well as in the single translocated conformation of the IRES, PKII and PKIII interact by a network of non-covalent interactions involving sugar–sugar stacking interactions as well as A-minor interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pfingsten et al., 2006</xref>). This compact configuration adopted due to the physical proximity of PKII and PKIII seems to be a requirement for the initial binding to the ribosome as well as for the first translocation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). In the state described here, these interactions are no longer established and a pronounced gap could be observed between both pseudoknots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, bottom right and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34062.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Structure of a double translocated CrPV-IRES.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overview of a mammalian ribosome with double translocated CrPV-IRES (green), aminoacyl-tRNA (purple) and eRF1* (orange).

The L1.1 part of CrPV-IRES remains attached to the L1 stalk along this process whose position relative to the 60S is similar to the one described in the complex with eEF2 and a non-hydrolyzable GTP analog or after the first translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>).

Combining the structures with published biochemical and smFRET data allows us to propose a comprehensive working model for how the CrPV-IRES (and type IV IRES in general) recruits, manipulates and redirects host ribosomes for the synthesis of its own proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As suggested by classic cross-linking experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pestova et al., 2004</xref>), smFRET data ( <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petrov et al., 2016</xref>) and cryoEM reconstructions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Spahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>), CrPV-IRES initially assembles a binary 80S/CrPV-IRES complex by either directly recruiting empty 80S or by a step-wise pathway in which CrPV-IRES first recruits the 40S subunit and then the 60S subunit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, bottom left). Once the binary 80S/CrPV-IRES is assembled, the 40S oscillates between rotated and non-rotated states, with PKI inserted in the A site and minimum changes in the overall conformation of the IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Koh et al., 2014</xref>). These movements are coupled to oscillations of the L1 stalk. The rotated state is the substrate of eEF2, which, in its GTP-bound form, induces an additional rotation of the small subunit and additional displacement of the L1 stalk, to facilitate the translocation of the PKI from the A to the P site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, top left). Back rotation and back swiveling of the 40S, combined with ribosome-induced GTP hydrolysis by eEF2 results in the first translocation event of the CrPV-IRES, positioning PKI in the P site, mimicking a translocated, canonical aminoacyl-tRNA. This intermediate is unstable and prone to back-translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>), unless a cognate aminoacyl-tRNA, delivered to the ribosome in complex with eEF1A and GTP, captures the frame in the A site of the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petrov et al., 2016</xref>). Formation of this complex is a rate-limiting step in this kinetically driven process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Petrov et al., 2016</xref>). In the single translocated IRES state, SL-IV and SL-V, which are initially attached to the ribosome, are solvent exposed, the PKI occupy the P site of the 40S and an aminoacyl-tRNA occupies the A site. It is reasonable to assume this state will oscillate between rotated and non-rotated configurations of the small subunit as a canonical pre-translocation complex with tRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budkevich et al., 2011</xref>). The second translocation step is required to place the first aminoacyl-tRNA in the P site and thus finish the initiation phase of translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, bottom right). At this stage, CrPV-IRES translocation should be coupled with the movement of the aminoacyl-tRNA occupying the A site, and this seems to happen with a conformation of the IRES similar to the one reported for the first translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Muhs et al., 2015</xref>). This conformation is maintained until the very last moment as the intermediate captured here with eEF2 presents a back-rotated configuration of the 40S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeyrathne et al., 2016</xref>). However, a pronounced swiveling of the 40S head is in place, probably induced by the presence of eEF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abeyrathne et al., 2016</xref>). Once eEF2 leaves, the back-swiveling movement of the 40S head triggers a dramatic conformational change in the CrPV-IRES: PKI is disassembled resulting in the ASL-like segment relocating to mimic the acceptor stem of a canonical E site tRNA. The mRNA-like element of the disassembled PKI remains in the E site of the 40S. These conformational changes in the PKI of the CrPV-IRES upon back swiveling are combined with a reconfiguration of the relative positioning of PKII and PKIII. This new conformation is stabilized by a newly reported IRES/40S interaction with the ribosomal protein eS25, which is also involved in the early recruitment of the IRES to the 40S (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Murray et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34062.012</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Comprehensive model describing CrPV-IRES strategy to hijack host ribosomes.</title><p>Bottom left, CrPV-IRES can directly recruit 80S to assemble a binary 80S/CrPV-IRES complex which, in its pre-translocation state, oscillates between rotated and non-rotated configurations of the 40S.

Structural studies using cryo-EM and x-ray crystallography have shown that the IRES occupies the E, P and A sites of the tRNA to manipulate the ribosome. Recent structures include a single translocated ribosome on the IRES as it moves from the initial A site to P site. Here, Fernandez et al. reconstitute ribosome translocation on the IRES to capture a structural view of a double translocated ribosome on the IRES by cryo-EM. Remarkably, the pseudoknot I (PKI) domain, which mimics an anticodon stem loop (ASL) of a tRNA and initially occupies the A site, undergoes a dramatic rearrangement in the double translocated complex. The PKI is disrupted and now rearranges such that the ASL domain resembles a tRNA acceptor stem loop in the E site. The authors provide a comparison to the HCV IRES-ribosome complex, where the domain II of the HCV IRES and the ASL of the CrPV IRES occupies the same tRNA acceptor stem space on the ribosome, thus revealing a similar strategy in manipulating the ribosome. In sum, the finding is surprising and highlights the amazing gymnastics of this IRES. The authors build on the model of IRES-ribosome translation and reveal a shared mechanism with a divergent HCV IRES. In general, the manuscript is clearly written in places but can be improved by providing more details and rationale in the experimental design in order to reach out to readers outside the IRES field.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper is aimed at a specialist audience, and is very difficult to read for people outside of the ribosome and IRES fields. The paper is also overly brief, and can use expansion to more fully explain points as well as to justify the conclusions. In particular:</p><p>- More description is needed of how the double translocated ribosome complex is reconstituted. Why use eRF1*? Can complexes be resolved without this? More details and rationale in this experiment is required, especially for the non-expert audience.</p><p>- There is a new interaction of eS25 with the IRES in the double translocated ribosome – this is quite vague. Are there any insights into the element (seems like the shoulder) of the IRES that is interacting? If so, maybe mutate that region to see effects on IRES translation and/or trap a double-translocated ribosome? Further proof of the eS25 interaction with this region would support the structural analysis.</p><p>- PKII and PKIII re-orient and become wider apart – the authors should explain more about the interactions that keep PKII and PKIII together (ex. A-minor interactions) and how these are disrupted in the final translocated step. Figure 4C should include these.</p><p>- The description of the new state (with the ASL-like part of PKI mimicking the E-tRNA acceptor arm) lacks detail and mechanistic insight. The major question is whether the interpretation of the map in this region is unambiguous. The following changes are required to address this question:</p><p>a) To illustrate the fit of PKI into the map, show a larger close-up view than in current figures (they are shown in tiny panels such as Figure 3C) to demonstrate the RNA hairpin features in the map (helical twist, backbone if visible etc.).</p><p>b) In canonical 70S-tRNA and 80S-tRNA complexes, the acceptor arm of E-tRNA is stabilized by interactions with the large subunit rRNA (including backbone-backbone packing with helices of 23S/25S/28S rRNA). Describe whether the PKI hairpin contacts the same elements of 28S rRNA.</p><p>c) Describe how the PKI hairpin interacts with L1.1 part of the IRES, which to some extent mimics the tRNA elbow? Does the map allow to say whether there is similarity to the structure of tRNA, in which the acceptor stem is coaxially stacked on the T stem?</p><p>- The fit and interpretation of the structure depend on the quality of the structural model, which is not reported in this manuscript (protein/RNA quality). The low local resolution of the IRES region makes misinterpretation possible. For example, the model of tRNA in Figure 6 (upper right box) looks distorted – is it due to over-refinement? To address this criticism, the authors should add (a) overall model statistics and (b) local IRES model statistics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34062.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The paper is aimed at a specialist audience, and is very difficult to read for people outside of the ribosome and IRES fields.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded the Introduction with two detailed paragraphs explaining briefly but accurately two main aspects of canonical translation which are relevant for understanding the biology of the CrPV IRES. The first added paragraph (Introduction, first paragraph) discusses the mechanism of translation initiation and how the initiator aminoacyl-tRNA is delivered to the ribosome in a canonical initiation. The second added paragraph (Introduction, fourth paragraph) is centered on canonical translocation and what is known on how the mobile ribosomal components are exploited to productively contribute to the movement of tRNAs and mRNA through the ribosome. We think non-specialist readers will find enough information in these two paragraphs to understand the results described in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper is also overly brief, and can use expansion to more fully explain points as well as to justify the conclusions.

In our map of the double translocated CrPV IRES we found a new contact with this protein and we have added new panels with the experimental density in Figure 3 (panel B, bottom), Figure 4 (panels B right and C right, top). We have also added the following sentence:</p><p>“The α-helix of eS25 comprising residues 52 to 65 could be observed in interacting distance with a helical segment of the CrPV formed by residues 6123-6127 and 6159-6164”.</p><p>These IRES residues as well as eS25 are implicated in earlier binding events of the IRES to the ribosome, what would preclude a mutational analysis as it would be impossible to distinguish the effects impacting the initial binding from the translocation effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- PKII and PKIII re-orient and become wider apart – the authors should explain more about the interactions that keep PKII and PKIII together (ex.

Details on how PKII and PKIII are co-stacked by a network of non-covalent interactions as well as the direction of the movement affecting mainly PKIII are illustrated (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). We have also included in the manuscript these sentences:</p><p>“In the pre-translocated as well as in the single translocated conformation of the IRES, PKII and PKIII interact by a network of non-covalent interactions involving sugar-sugar stacking interactions as well as A-minor interactions (Figure 4—figure supplement 1,). […] In the state described here, these interactions are no longer established and a pronounced gap could be observed between both pseudoknots (Figure 4B), bottom right.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The description of the new state (with the ASL-like part of PKI mimicking the E-tRNA acceptor arm) lacks detail and mechanistic insight.

The helix 68 of the 28S rRNA, which is described to mediate interactions with the acceptor stem of a deacylated tRNA, is also indicated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Describe how the PKI hairpin interacts with L1.1 part of the IRES, which to some extent mimics the tRNA elbow?

Additionally, the L1.1 segment of the IRES do not mimic the elbow of a tRNA in the present reconstruction or in any other. The interaction of the L1.1 region is established with the L1-stalk at the initial recruitment of the large subunit and is maintained remarkably similar as the IRES transit through the different tRNA binding sites of the ribosome. We can confirm with the present study and is illustrated in Figure 4A, that this L1-stalk/L1.1 interaction is maintained even after two translocation steps of the IRES.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The fit and interpretation of the structure depend on the quality of the structural model, which is not reported in this manuscript (protein/RNA quality). The low local resolution of the IRES region makes misinterpretation possible. For example, the model of tRNA in Figure 6 (upper right box) looks distorted – is it due to over-refinement? To address this criticism, the authors should add (a) overall model statistics and (b) local IRES model statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a table with relevant information of data collection, model refinement and validation statistics. In regard to the specific point of the Figure 6, we would like to remind the reviewer the tRNA illustrated in this panel is from the final model presented in this work which is a Leu-tRNA<sup>Leu.</sup> In contrast to all other tRNAs containing 4-5 nucleotides in the variable-arm (V-arm), tRNA<sup>Leu</sup> has a long V-arm structure comprising 14 nucleotides, which is directly oriented towards the reader in this figure and thus it could be interpreted as a non-usual tRNA view.</p></body></sub-article></article>
