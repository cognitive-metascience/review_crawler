These physiological changes require time and therefore cause a lag phase during which the cells do not function optimally. Interestingly, past exposure to an environmental condition can shorten the time needed to adapt when the condition re-occurs, even in daughter cells that never directly encountered the initial condition. Here, we use the molecular toolbox of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to systematically unravel the molecular mechanism underlying such history-dependent behavior in transitions between glucose and maltose. In contrast to previous hypotheses, the behavior does not depend on persistence of proteins involved in metabolism of a specific sugar. Instead, presence of glucose induces a gradual decline in the cells’ ability to activate respiration, which is needed to metabolize alternative carbon sources. These results reveal how trans-generational transitions in central carbon metabolism generate history-dependent behavior in yeast, and provide a mechanistic framework for similar phenomena in other cell types.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cellular memory</kwd><kwd>lag phase</kwd><kwd>metabolic shift</kwd><kwd>glucose repression</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd><kwd>single-cell analysis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerulus</surname><given-names>Bram</given-names></name><name><surname>Vermeersch</surname><given-names>Lieselotte</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004727</institution-id><institution>Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CoG682009</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cerulus</surname><given-names>Bram</given-names></name><name><surname>Jariani</surname><given-names>Abbas</given-names></name><name><surname>Perez-Samper</surname><given-names>Gemma</given-names></name><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>AB-InBev-Baillet Latour Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>246 RGP0050/2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jariani</surname><given-names>Abbas</given-names></name><name><surname>Swain</surname><given-names>Peter S</given-names></name><name><surname>Verstrepen</surname><given-names>Kevin J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>SULSA Postdoctoral Exchange Scheme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pietsch</surname><given-names>Julian M J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Live-cell microscopy and genome-wide screens reveal how slow transitions in metabolism can underlie metabolic memory, providing a model for organisms demonstrating similar history-dependent behaviour and routes to improve industrial microbes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells can face sudden and dramatic changes in their environment such as nutrient depletion, temperature shifts, and osmotic shock. In general, cells adapt to such changes by activating and repressing specific genes and processes required to function in the new environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brewster et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jacob and Monod, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitchell et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>). Such physiological re-programming can take a considerable amount of time and resources during which the cells do not function optimally, a phenomenon known as the lag phase. Interestingly, recent exposure to a specific environment can shorten the lag time needed to adapt when the same stimulus re-occurs, even in daughter cells that have not directly experienced the initial change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). This phenomenon is referred to as ‘history-dependent behavior’ (HDB). HDB is believed to allow cells to more quickly adapt (i.e. reduced lag duration) when a similar environment returns. Such HDB often extends over several cellular generations, and is therefore sometimes considered to be a form of rudimentary epigenetic behavior or ‘cellular memory’.</p><p>HDB has been described in various organisms and cell types, ranging from microbes to humans. Some of the best-documented cases, sometimes referred to as ‘metabolic programming’, involve a switch in nutrient status. One example occurs in pancreatic cells, where previous exposure to high glucose levels leads to long-lasting stress and damage, even after the glucose levels have been normalized, and inversely, prolonged tight control of glycemic values results in lasting improvements, even when glucose levels are not tightly controlled (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tonna et al., 2010</xref>). Similarly, prolonged changes in blood glucose levels linked to dietary changes may affect muscle and adipose tissue development, even in a next generation that has never been directly exposed to the nutritional stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharples et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, trans-generational shift in metabolic state is also observed in exponentially growing yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slavov et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms underlying metabolic programming have not been fully elucidated, although changes in chromatin state have been implicated in the effect.</p><p>HDB is easily studied in single-cell organisms because during the lag phase, these cells arrest their growth, making it easy to observe the adaptation process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acar et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Friedman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kundu and Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mitchell et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockwell et al., 2015</xref>). One of the best-documented examples of HDB occurs when <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cells are repeatedly shifted between glucose and galactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockwell et al., 2015</xref>). The first shift from glucose to galactose generates a slow induction of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes, with an associated long lag phase. When the same population is returned to glucose and subsequently switched back to galactose, the <italic>GAL</italic> induction rate and growth response is significantly faster. This HDB can extend for up to 12 hr after the shift from galactose to glucose. The 12 h-period in glucose during which the HDB is retained corresponds to approximately five cellular generations, at which point less than 4% of the cells has directly experienced galactose before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kundu and Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sood et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stockwell and Rifkin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). A similar phenomenon occurs when <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells are switched between glucose and maltose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">New et al., 2014</xref>), and when <italic>E. coli</italic> cells are switched between glucose and lactose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The molecular principles underlying this type of HDB are only recently being uncovered. In general, transcriptional induction of genes which are crucial for rapid growth in the inducing environment (e.g. <italic>GAL</italic> gene induction in galactose) are assumed to be the rate-limiting step determining the length of the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lambert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">New et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, HDB observed at the level of growth is often thought to be linked to a similar effect in the induction of specific genes. More specifically, the regulatory networks governing induction of these specific genes are believed to have intrinsic properties that allow faster re-induction if the genes have been recently induced, which in turn leads to a faster resumption of cellular growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). Importantly, however, the assumption that growth resumption is directly governed by the induction kinetics of nutrient-specific genes has not been supported by strong experimental evidence.</p><p>Two major molecular mechanisms have been proposed for HDB on the level of transcription. First, a previous induction of a gene may generate an epigenetically heritable shift in local chromatin structure that allows for quicker re-induction after a short time in the repressive condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brickner, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">D'Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tan-Wong et al., 2009</xref>). The second proposed mechanism is the transgenerational persistence of specific proteins, referred to as ‘protein inheritance’ or ‘protein perdurance’. This mechanism assumes that proteins needed in one environment do not immediately disappear when cells are shifted to a new environment. During cell division, some of these lingering proteins can be transmitted to the daughter cell and influence how this cell functions, leading to HDB. One of the best-studied examples of such protein inheritance occurs in galactose-to-glucose shifts in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Cells growing in galactose have high levels of the galactokinase enzyme Gal1p. When these cells are shifted to glucose, the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene is repressed and the Gal1 proteins that were present are gradually diluted as the cells divide. However, when the cells are shifted again to galactose before the cellular Gal1p levels reach a basal level, the remaining Gal1 proteins may allow faster re-induction of the whole set of Gal proteins needed to resume growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stockwell et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Though these are both plausible mechanisms, it is important to note that the causative role of Gal1 protein inheritance has not yet been confirmed and that environmental shifts can cause much broader changes in transcriptional activity. Transitions to glucose stimulate genes involved in fermentation and cellular growth and repress genes involved in respiration, the glyoxylate and TCA cycles, gluconeogenesis, synthesis of fatty acids and storage carbohydrates, and stress resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Conrad et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zaman et al., 2008</xref>). Some of these processes could be prime determinants (bottlenecks) of the lag time, while the activation of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes is a vital last step to resume growth, but could be less important in determining the lag time and HDB.</p><p>To obtain a systematic and thorough understanding of HDB in fluctuating carbon sources, we combine genome-wide assays (Bar-Seq and transcriptomics) with various single-cell analyses. Specifically, we show that the duration of the lag phase when cells are switched from glucose to maltose depends on the duration of growth in glucose, with longer exposure to glucose eliciting longer lag times. In contrast to what has been previously suggested, our results show that this HDB does not rely on inheritance of dedicated nutrient-specific proteins (in this case the Mal proteins). Instead, several lines of evidence point towards the existence of a much broader mechanism for HDB than previously assumed. Repression of respiratory pathways during glucose growth and the subsequent re-induction upon shift to maltose appears to be playing a key role in HDB. Firstly, we observe that not only pre-growth in maltose, but also pre-growth in galactose leads to shorter lag in maltose. Secondly, using heterokaryon cells with two nuclei with distinct pre-growth conditions, we show that the HDB is linked to the cytoplasm rather than the nucleus. Thirdly, genome-wide assays show that genes involved in mitochondrial function and respiration play a central role in HDB. Fourthly, inhibiting respiration prolongs the lag phase even in cells that only grew for short periods in glucose. Finally, over-activating respiration through overexpression of the <italic>HAP4</italic> respiratory regulator abolishes the HDB and results in nearly constant short lag phases.</p><p>Taken together, our data shows that, in contrast to previous suggestions, HDB in changing carbon environments is not the consequence of changes in chromatin state or persistence of a few metabolism-specific proteins.

Indeed, even though the correlation between Mal12p/Mal11p levels and the population lag time is strong after maltose pre-growth, there is little correlation between Mal protein levels and glucose-to-maltose lag duration when cells are first pre-grown in galactose before they are shifted to glucose and then to maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Therefore, the observed correlation after pre-growth in maltose seems to only reflect the number of generations of growth in glucose.</p><p>A similar set of experiments was performed to test whether Gal protein inheritance causes HDB after a glucose-galactose shift. Galactose pre-growth increased the timescale over which HDB occurs and resulted in generally shorter lags compared to the maltose pre-growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). The inverse correlation between remaining Gal1p levels and lag times appears to support the previously reported hypothesis that Gal protein inheritance is indeed responsible for quicker re-activation of <italic>GAL</italic> genes and subsequent escape from the lag phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). However, pre-growth on maltose, which does not result in measurable Gal1p levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), also leads to considerable HDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, whereas there is a clear correlation between Gal1p levels and the population lag time after galactose pre-growth, there is little correlation when cells are pre-grown on maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Together, these results suggest that, similar to what we observed for the role of Mal proteins in shifts from glucose to maltose, Gal protein levels are not the major determinants of HDB after glucose-galactose shifts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Mal or gal protein inheritance does not explain cell-to-cell variability in lag duration</title><p>The lag duration of cells within an isogenic population is typically heterogeneous when observed at the single-cell level, and the heterogeneity increases with longer pre-growth in glucose before the switch to maltose or galactose. Some cells escape the lag phase within 6 hr, others take more than 20 hr, and some never resume growth within the timeframe of our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To investigate whether this variability is linked to protein perdurance, we correlated Mal and Gal protein expression levels immediately after cells leave glucose with the individual lag times after the respective carbon source shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G,H,I</xref>). In both cases, we find that variability in the level of inherited proteins does not explain the variability in single-cell lag times (R<sup>2</sup> &lt;0.11). Such absence of a strong correlation further confirms that there are other factors apart from Mal or Gal protein inheritance influencing the lag time after shifts from glucose to either maltose or galactose.</p><p>We hypothesized that the observed heterogeneity in single-cell lag times could potentially be explained by cell cycle stage or replicative age. We investigated the effect of cell cycle stage on lag time by observing whether the cells were budding at the time of the shift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). This parameter was included as a covariate in a Cox proportional hazard model and was found to be a significant factor in 5 out of 16 experiments, increasing the likelihood of escape on average by 60%. However, this factor on average describes less than 4% of the variability in single-cell lag times (all Cox pseudo-R²&lt;0.094), indicating that the influence of cell cycle stage on single-cell lag times is neglectable. The effect of replicative age was investigated by staining bud scars with Calcofluor White (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The number of bud scars was counted for individual cells, and this number was included as a covariate in the Cox model, together with the (un)budding covariate. Under this model, cells with different replicative ages were not found to have significantly different lag times.</p><p>In summary, the variability in single-cell lag times can neither be explained by variability in Mal and Gal protein levels nor by variability in cell cycle stage nor in replicative age.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title><italic>MAL</italic> gene induction correlates with escape from the glucose-to-maltose lag phase</title><p>Our results thus far indicate that HDB in shifts from glucose to maltose or galactose does not depend on inheritance of Mal or Gal proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In fact, the fact that lag duration does not correlate with Gal and Mal protein levels, and the slow growth before <italic>MAL</italic> gene expression suggests that other mechanisms may be the main rate-limiting step for cells escaping the lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Effect of constitutive <italic>MAL</italic> gene expression on HDB</title><p>So far, our results suggest that <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction is the final, but not the only, event that controls full escape from the lag phase and that the rate of <italic>MAL</italic> induction does not depend on Mal protein inheritance. To investigate this further, we measured HDB in strains with single or dual overexpression of the genes encoding the maltose-cleaving enzyme Mal12p and the transporter Mal11p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). In these experiments, HDB was measured after pre-growth in either maltose or galactose. After maltose pre-growth, we observed the combined effects of constitutive expression and protein inheritance of the Mal proteins that are expressed under their native promoters. After galactose pre-growth, we only observe the effect of constitutive expression.</p><p>If induction of the Mal proteins is the crucial step allowing escape from a glucose-to-maltose lag phase, constitutive overexpression of the maltose importer Mal11p and the maltase Mal12p in glucose should reduce the lag to a minimum and abolish the HDB in glucose-to-maltose transitions. As expected, we find that the dual <italic>MAL11</italic> and <italic>MAL12</italic> overexpression strain indeed shows a strongly reduced lag phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). In contrast, this is not the case when only one of the <italic>MAL</italic> genes is overexpressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>).</p><p>It is important to note that our overexpression strains also still contain a copy of the <italic>MAL</italic> genes under control of their native promoter. Thus, to only observe the effect of overexpression, and remove the potential effect of protein inheritance of the other <italic>MAL</italic> gene expressed under its native promoter, we should consider the results after pre-growth on galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). After galactose pre-growth, overexpression of <italic>MAL12</italic> strongly increases lag time, while overexpressing <italic>MAL11</italic> slightly reduces the lag time. This result is consistent with their roles in positive and negative feedback loops in the <italic>MAL</italic> regulatory network: the transporter Mal11p would increase the intracellular concentration of maltose, which acts as an inducer of the network, whereas overexpression of the maltase Mal12p lowers intracellular maltose concentrations by enzymatic breakdown.</p><p>Constitutively high levels of both Mal12p and Mal11p are sufficient to allow rapid resumption of growth after the shift to maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). However, we also found that there is no correlation between lingering Mal11p and Mal12p proteins prior to a glucose-to-maltose shift in a wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that in the wild-type strain, at least one of these proteins is inherited in a non-functional form during glucose growth. Previous reports indeed suggest that Mal11 is rapidly internalized and inactivated after a shift from maltose to glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Görts, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horak and Wolf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lucero et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riballo et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>To investigate this further, we measured HDB of the single <italic>MAL11</italic> and <italic>MAL12</italic> overexpression strains after pre-growth in maltose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). We then see the effect of <italic>MAL</italic> overexpression of one gene and protein inheritance of the other gene expressed under its native promoter. If the natively expressed Mal protein is inherited in a functional form, it should be able to complement the other constitutively expressed Mal protein leading to a short lag time. We would actually expect the lag time to be particularly short after short glucose periods, when the inherited protein levels are still high. This is in fact the case for the <italic>MAL11</italic> overexpression strain, where inheritance of native Mal12p elicits minimally short lag times after short glucose periods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). However, for the <italic>MAL12</italic> overexpression strain, there seems to be little to no effect of native Mal11 protein inheritance, even in a maltose-glucose-maltose transition where the glucose growth is limited to only 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting that even if Mal11 proteins are present during glucose growth, they are not able to import maltose, most likely because they have been internalized.</p><p>In summary, Mal11p and Mal12p levels have the potential to strongly influence the lag time only if both are present at sufficiently high levels and in an active form. This requirement is not fulfilled in wild-type cells because only the maltase Mal12p is present at high enough concentrations and/or in an active form after glucose growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HDB depends on a growth-promoting factor</title><p>So far, our results show that the presence of high levels of both the Mal11 maltose transporter and Mal12 maltase are sufficient for cells to escape the lag phase. However, the results also show that Mal protein inheritance is not the cause of HDB during glucose-to-maltose shifts. A next set of experiments is therefore aimed at determining what is the actual cause of the HDB. HDB must be caused by at least one factor that gradually changes during glucose growth. This factor could be a promoting factor and enhance <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction and growth resumption, in which case its concentration would gradually diminish during growth in glucose. Alternatively, it could be a repressor and its concentration would increase during growth in glucose, thereby gradually increasing its repression of <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction and growth resumption.</p><p>To distinguish between these two scenarios, we measured the lag phase of diploid cells generated by mating haploid cells pre-grown in separate cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>). These two haploid cultures are mixed and grown in glucose for 4 hr, during which a fraction of the cells mate and form diploid cells. This mixed culture is transferred to maltose and the lag phase of the individual cells is scored. When the two parents are grown on the same pre-growth medium (either both in glucose or both in maltose), the resulting diploids and the haploid parental populations demonstrate the same lag behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, top panels). Interestingly, when one parent has been pre-grown on maltose and the other parent is pre-grown on glucose, the resulting diploid demonstrates a lag similar to the parent pre-grown on maltose, and thus has a short lag phase. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, bottom panels). This suggests that the diploid has received a high concentration of a growth-promoting factor from the parent that has been grown on maltose. In other words, this result suggests that the factor determining HDB in glucose-maltose shifts promotes growth resumption and is gradually reduced during glucose growth.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>HDB in <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction is independent from nuclear-retained factors</title><p>Now that we have evidence to support the presence of growth-promoting factor(s) and that <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction is crucial for complete growth resumption, we investigated whether the events leading up to <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction are restricted to the nucleus or if they involve at least one cytoplasmic event. We performed a similar mating assay as the experiment described above with a slight alteration: one of the parents contains a <italic>kar1-1</italic> allele, which allows for cytoplasmic fusion but prevents nuclear fusion during the mating process. Mating the <italic>kar1-1</italic> parent with a <italic>KAR1-</italic>containing parent generates a heterokaryon instead of a regular diploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>).

We found that the rate of <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction is not biased towards one of the two nuclei in the heterokaryon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3—figure supplement 7</xref>), indicating that the events leading up to <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction are not restricted to the nucleus, but must involve at least one cytoplasmic step.

The graphs consist of an upper and a lower panel. When the lag time after a certain time in glucose could be quantified for a mutant, this lag time is plotted on the lower panel. If, however, we could not detect a clear escape within the timeframe of the experiment, we use the upper panel to plot the (small) relative change in cell density of the mutant during the lag phase. Using this approach, we identified four types of mutants based on their lag behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Two large groups contain mutants that consistently show either a shorter or a longer lag phase compared to wild-type cells. The interaction networks for the genes of these two groups are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>, respectively. A third category of mutants demonstrates a long lag time after short glucose periods, but average-to-short lags after long glucose periods.

Similar to the setup of the Bar-Seq experiment, cultures were pre-grown in maltose, then shifted to glucose for different durations, and washed back to maltose and the population lag phase was measured.

This behavior resembles the Warburg effect observed in mammalian tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Warburg, 1956</xref>).</p><p>We hypothesized that when cells are shifted from maltose to glucose, the cells reduce their respiratory metabolism, but do so gradually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slavov et al., 2014</xref>). When cells are shifted from glucose to maltose, they need to re-induce respiration to continue growth. This implies that cells demonstrating higher respiration activity while growing on glucose would have shorter lag times upon a shift to maltose or galactose. We would therefore expect a negative correlation between the level of respiratory proteins in glucose and the lag time.</p><p>To test this hypothesis, we used flow cytometry to track the presence of a set of respiratory proteins during glucose growth after pre-growth in either maltose or galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, we measured the level of these proteins during lag phase using fluorescence microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We chose key proteins of the TCA cycle (Cit1p, Mdh1p and Kgd2p) and the electron transport chain (Ndi1p, Sdh2p and Cox6p). The expression levels of these proteins have been shown to correlate with the degree of respiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fendt and Sauer, 2010</xref>). Their levels correlate well with the population lag times, for pre-growth in maltose and also for pre-growth in galactose, suggesting that the link between respiration and lag duration is a general phenomenon (R² between 0.76 and 0.97) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Moreover, in contrast to the correlation between population lag times and Mal protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), the correlation between respiratory activity and lag times upon a switch to maltose holds after pre-growth in maltose, as well as after a pre-growth in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Also, consistent with the hypothesis that the ability to induce respiration decreases with residence time in glucose, we observe that the transcript levels of COX6 and CIT1 respiratory genes during lag phase is induced to its peak earlier in cells with shorter pre-growth in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39234.034</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Decrease of respiratory protein levels during glucose growth correlate with HDB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Population-level correlation between respiratory protein levels of Cit1-, Mdh1-, Kgd2-, Ndi1-, Sdh2- and Cox6-yECitrine and the lag time.

Using our microcolony tracking set-up (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we found that only microcolonies that induce these respiratory genes show substantial growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the induction of these genes occurs around the same time as the start of the slow growth period observed within many microcolonies and precedes the induction of the <italic>MAL</italic> genes by several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). To better demonstrate this point, the induction of these respiratory proteins as well as MAL11 maltose transporter and MAL12 maltase during the lag phase was compared to the growth dynamics of the cells. The time-resolved cross-correlation between the growth rate and the protein expression was calculated for a range of time offsets (see (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kiviet et al., 2014</xref>) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The cross-correlation for Mal11p and Mal12p peaks right after the cells resume growth. The correlation for Cit1p and Cox6p, however, peaks around 4 hr earlier and is stronger, indicating that expression of these respiratory proteins precedes escape from the lag phase, whereas, on average, expression of the maltose proteins only occurs around the time of escape.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Respiratory activity determines HDB</title><p>To investigate if respiratory activity directly affects the lag phase and HDB, we altered the cells’ respiratory capacity and measured HDB after a glucose-to-maltose shift. We used a chemical inhibitor of respiration (antimycin A) to decrease respiration as the cells transition from glucose to maltose. Furthermore, we examined a respiratory deficient mutant (<italic>cox6Δ</italic>). For both methods, altering the respiratory capacity led to substantially longer lag phases and a stronger increase in lag with extended pre-growth in glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Conversely, to increase respiratory activity during glucose growth and the lag phase, we overexpressed the transcription factor <italic>HAP4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lascaris et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lascaris et al., 2004</xref>). On average, the <italic>HAP4</italic> overexpression strain showed a two-fold decrease in lag duration and a much smaller increase in lag with extended pre-growth on glucose. This effect occurs both after pre-growth in maltose and pre-growth in galactose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Measurement of dissolved oxygen during lag phase and glucose growth indeed confirms that <italic>HAP4</italic> overexpression and respiratory deficient mutant (<italic>cox6Δ</italic>) strains consume oxygen at higher and lower rates respectively, compared to the wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>At first sight, the effect of <italic>HAP4</italic> overexpression on lag duration and HDB may appear similar to dual <italic>MAL11</italic> and <italic>MAL12</italic> overexpression, as both lead to reduced lag duration and a severe reduction in HDB. However, while activation of the M﻿AL genes is undoubtedly the final crucial step that allows cells to escape the lag phase, our results suggest that in contrast to what is often suggested, the induction of <italic>MAL</italic> genes is not the rate-limiting step and that inheritance of Mal proteins or <italic>MAL</italic> gene expression status does not explain HDB. Activation of respiration actually precedes <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction, and this activation of respiratory metabolism is the main rate-determining step. Together, these results show that the level of respiratory activity has a strong, direct influence on the duration of the lag time and the associated HDB.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we used single-cell analyses and genome-wide screens to dissect the molecular mechanism underlying the HDB that affects lag phase length after a shift in carbon source. Our experiments show that cells pre-grown on maltose before being shifted to glucose and then back again to maltose show a lag phase that depends on the time the cells spent in glucose.</p><p>HDB is often implicitly suggested to be caused by changes in the dynamics of the de-repression of specific genes. This hypothesis is often based on a correlation between the induction of certain genes and the resumption of growth, for example in shifts from glucose to galactose. In this case, the HDB has been proposed to be due to Gal protein inheritance. In this work, we provide several lines of evidence indicating that HDB in maltose-glucose-maltose shifts depends neither on the first encounter with maltose nor on inheritance of Mal proteins. Instead, the HDB is linked to a previous exposure to any alternative carbon source that requires some degree of respiration, and consequently the gradual decline of respiratory activity during growth on glucose.</p><p>HDB does not depend on Mal protein inheritance. Firstly, intracellular Mal protein levels do not correlate with the population lag times across different pre-growth conditions. Specifically, we showed that the HDB that occurs when cells are shifted from glucose-to-maltose or glucose-to-galactose does not depend on a previous exposure to maltose or galactose, but rather on the time that the population was grown in glucose prior to the shift to the alternative carbon source (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–F</xref>). Secondly, the variability in Mal protein levels within cells from one population does not explain the heterogeneity in lag duration between single cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>). Thirdly, only high levels of both functional maltase (Mal12p) and maltose transporter (Mal11p) can affect HDB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>). The activity or concentration of the transporter appears to be too low to influence the lag time, even after only 2 hr of growth in glucose. This observation agrees with previous reports that the maltose transporter is rapidly internalized by endocytosis and degraded in the vacuole in the presence of glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Görts, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Horak and Wolf, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lucero et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Novak et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Riballo et al., 1995</xref>). Fourthly, while expression of <italic>MAL</italic> genes is required for cells to resume fast exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplements 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">5</xref>), <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction does not seem to be the primary bottleneck determining lag phase duration and thus HDB. Tracking microcolony growth and gene expression after the glucose-maltose shift showed that cells that eventually induce the <italic>MAL</italic> genes, often show a transient, slow growth phase before they induce these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Importantly, this slow growth is still observed in a mutant in which both the maltose transporter and the maltase genes were deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Together, these results suggest <italic>MAL</italic>-independent processes that precede and possibly stimulate <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction.</p><p>To identify processes that could precede <italic>MAL</italic> gene activation and thereby determine HDB, we performed two genome-wide screens. This allowed us, for the first time, to obtain unparalleled insight into the molecular mechanisms underlying HDB. In both Bar-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments, genes involved in mitochondrial function and respiration demonstrated strong effects. Deletion mutants of genes involved in mitochondrial function and respiration showed longer lag times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Moreover, the same genes were repressed during glucose growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">3</xref>; and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). We confirmed that respiratory activity directly influences the lag phase by testing a respiratory deficient mutant as well as chemically inhibiting respiration, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) and on the other hand by increasing respiratory activity using <italic>HAP4</italic> overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lascaris et al., 2004</xref>). These experiments confirmed that changes in the respiratory activity cause changes in HDB. Specifically, reduced respiratory activity results in longer lag phases and over-activation of respiration yields shorter lag phases. Moreover, the slow growth observed in cells that just escaped the lag phase only occurs in microcolonies that induce respiratory proteins, with slow growth starting around the same time as respiratory gene induction, hours before <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction is observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>)</p><p>Our hypothesis that HDB is due to a gradual decrease in respiratory activity during glucose growth is consistent with a previous report demonstrating a gradual decrease of respiration over multiple generations in glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Slavov et al., 2014</xref>) as well as with a recent study showing the importance of respiration for a switch from glucose to other carbon sources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Perez-Samper et al., 2018</xref>). Our results from the mating and heterokaryon experiments are also consistent with this hypothesis. The mating experiment indicated that HDB is caused by a growth-promoting factor that is diluted during glucose growth. A caveat in the mating experiment is that after mating, the proteins uniquely present in each of the two cells are diluted two-fold which might render a repressor non-functional. However, this does not seem likely given the graded HDB for different glucose pre-growth times. The heterokaryon experiment showed that the rate of <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction is determined by at least a cytoplasmic process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplements 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">7</xref>). The gradual decrease in respiratory activity could be either directly due to protein inheritance of respiratory proteins or complexes during glucose growth, and/or indirectly by the gradual change in an upstream factor determining respiratory activity independently of the respiratory protein levels. Our population-level lag times correlated well with respiratory protein levels, supporting the former hypothesis. Moreover, this could explain the observation that pre-growth in galactose leads to shorter lag times compared to pre-growth in maltose as the levels of respiratory proteins are higher in galactose than in maltose. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).</p><p>Why would respiration play such an important role during the shift from glucose to alternative sugars? We hypothesize that upon the sudden loss of glucose, cells enter an energy-deficient state because they are not yet able to metabolize maltose. This energy-deficient state would be exacerbated by a decreased respiratory activity in response to glucose: respiration is a more energy-efficient pathway per carbon molecule compared to fermentation. Finally, this energy-deficient state likely prevents <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction and subsequent escape from the lag. In cells that successfully induce the <italic>MAL</italic> genes, it is unlikely that <italic>MAL</italic> gene expression is prevented by the complete depletion of factors that are required for protein expression (e.g. ATP). Indeed, in these cells, protein synthesis of other proteins occurs well before synthesis of Mal proteins. However, it is possible that for the majority of cells that never resume growth, protein expression is inhibited altogether by the depletion of necessary factors. Indeed, these cells show no sign of any protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). An intriguing possibility is that in the cells that will eventually induce the <italic>MAL</italic> genes, <italic>MAL</italic> gene induction might be prevented until the cells have at least partly recovered from the dip in metabolic flux and ATP production before the energetically costly proton gradient over the cell membrane is used to support maltose import via the H<sup>+</sup>-maltose symporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Serrano, 1977</xref>). The hypothesis that respiration is required for bridging the energy-deficient state during the lag phase is in agreement with the observation that lag phase in maltose is similar for cultures with pre-growth in maltose or galactose since respiration is active during growth on both sugars and repressed during glucose growth.</p><p>Previous investigations into HDB in carbon sources have not identified the general metabolic state as a central determinant. More commonly, such studies have noted inheritance of the corresponding metabolic proteins directly involved in either the uptake or processing of the alternative sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kundu and Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stockwell and Rifkin, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). Such studies, however, focused on the induction of the genes directly involved in alternative sugar metabolism without showing that induction of these genes is the rate-limiting step in adaptation, and without screening more broadly for processes that may precede and control induction of these genes. Although these studies revealed a correlation between residual Gal1p levels and the lag duration, they did not show that this correlation implied causation. It should, however, be noted that the experimental setups differ between studies, which may influence the main determinants of the duration of lag. Finally, the role of respiration in previously published omics expression studies on diauxic shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Murphy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Radonjic et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zampar et al., 2013</xref>), might have been masked by the fact that in their case the secondary carbon source (ethanol) can be solely utilized by respiration.</p><p>Our single-cell experiments, measuring lag time in maltose for cells that have experienced glucose repression for various durations, show that not only the lag time depends on glucose growth time, but also the fraction of cells resuming growth is as well dependent on the duration of previous exposure to glucose repression: upon shift to maltose after longer exposure to glucose, cells will have a longer lag phase and a smaller fraction of cells will manage to make the shift within the observed window of 24 hr. Considering the key role of respiration in the lag phase, one could speculate that after repression of respiration in glucose, some cells maintain some level of respiratory functionality while others do not. Such heterogeneity could be attributed to inheritance of a bistable positive feedback loops in regulation of respiration. Similar mechanism of inherited bistability is shown in the Lac operon of <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Novick and Weiner, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ozbudak et al., 2004</xref>). Moreover, our results also show that although HDB is present in three different genetic backgrounds, the extent of the effect can vary greatly. We are currently dissecting the exact genetic differences that control the extent of HDB in natural yeast strains.</p><p>Our results reveal how slow transitions in central carbon metabolism cause transgenerational cellular HDB. This is not only interesting for our basic understanding of HDB, but also opens new routes in microbial biotechnology. One of the most common problems in industrial fermentations where complex substrates are used is that the microbes sometimes fail to switch between the different carbon sources and other nutrients in the medium, which leads to stuck or sluggish fermentations that cause important economic losses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bisson and Butzke, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Verstrepen et al., 2004</xref>). It will be interesting to see whether engineering strains, for example by overexpressing <italic>HAP4</italic>, can lead to more efficient fermentations.</p><p>In summary, our results demonstrate that HDB after a glucose-to-maltose shift does not only depend on the inheritance of Mal proteins required for the uptake and breakdown of maltose. Although activating the uptake and metabolism of alternative sugars is the last crucial step for cells to resume growth on a new carbon source, other processes precede this step and seem to be more important bottlenecks. Specifically, we find that during the switch from glucose to an alternative sugar such as maltose, cells need to activate respiratory metabolism. However, cells that have grown for extended times on glucose gradually repress respiration in favor of fermentation, and experience difficulties to re-activate respiratory metabolism, which results in much slower adaptation. We therefore conclude that HDB is not specific to a particular sugar. Instead, HDB is more general, with cells likely ‘remembering’ growing on any alternative carbon source that does not repress respiration as much as glucose does. It is tempting to speculate that similar slow transitions in metabolic states also govern HDB in other cell types, including some of the cases of nutritional programming observed in mammals. In fact, the genes identified in our genome-wide screen shows overlap with a recent screen for oxidative phosphorylation in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arroyo et al., 2016</xref>), which could provide a good basis to explore the role of these genes in metabolic programming in higher organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

have been derived from BY4742 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>). The wild-type is AN63, which is derived from BY4742 by making it maltose-prototrophic, reducing its high-petite frequency and finally switching its mating type to <italic>MATa</italic>. Specifically, this strain contains a functional <italic>MAL</italic> regulator allele that was introduced in the locus of <italic>MAL13</italic> on chromosome VII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2010</xref>), has been rescued from a frameshift mutation in <italic>SAL1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dimitrov et al., 2009</xref>) and its mating type has been switched to <italic>MATa</italic>.

In order to see the effect of overexpression, <italic>MAL12</italic>, <italic>MAL11</italic> or both were put under the control of the strong <italic>TDH3</italic>-promoter. The <italic>MAL</italic> gene deletion mutant was constructed by deleting the two complete loci that contain all the <italic>MAL</italic> genes on chromosome II (locus 3) and VII (locus 1). The Bar-Seq experiment was performed using the haploid <italic>MATa</italic> yeast deletion collection, after incorporation of a functional <italic>MAL</italic> regulator and fluorescent protein fusions into each individual mutant using the Synthetic Genetic Array technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tong et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>All experiments were performed at 30°C using rich media. The media that were used were YP (10 g/L yeast extract, and 20 g/L peptone) supplemented with 5% glucose, 10% maltose, 5% galactose or 5% glycerol. A concentrated YP solution is autoclaved, while the concentrated sugar solutions are filter-sterilized. After cooling, they are mixed in the right proportions. In specific experiments, the respiratory inhibitor antimycin A, or the chitin-staining dye Calcofluor White were added to the medium.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Culturing and growth conditions</title><p>To measure the effect of the time grown on glucose on the lag phase length, we pre-grow cultures in the following way. In general, all growth occurs in 150 µL volume in 96-well plates which are sealed with plastic seals to avoid evaporation. In order to control cell density of these cultures, serial dilutions of 50–100 µL into 150 µL are made across the plate before incubation. Incubation lasts maximally 24 hr, after which cultures are transferred to fresh medium. At each transfer, optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) is measured using a plate reader and only cultures with an OD<sub>600</sub> &lt;0.05 are selected to be transferred. This OD<sub>600</sub> threshold corresponds to a cell density &lt;8*10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL as measured using a Bio-Rad TC20 Automated Cell Counter. The cell density is controlled in this way throughout the experiment until the final shift from glucose to the alternative sugar, where the cultures experience a lag phase. Only during the specific experiments that were designed to measure the effect of OD<sub>600</sub> on the lag time, cultures were allowed to reaches higher densities during the pre-growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplements 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">6</xref>).</p><p>The 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hr glucose cultures are grown for two overnights in the pre-glucose sugar (usually maltose or galactose). Next, at different times during the day, cultures are washed twice and transferred to glucose. The 0 hr glucose condition is grown in the same way, but is never transferred to glucose. For the 24 hr glucose condition, cultures are grown for one overnight in the pre-glucose sugar, after which they are washed twice and transferred to glucose for another overnight. The next morning, another dilution is made into fresh glucose to avoid overgrowth. Finally, cultures from all the above conditions with OD<sub>600</sub> &lt;0.05 are selected at the same time, washed twice and transferred to the post-glucose sugar (usually maltose or galactose). To measure the lag time of these cultures, they are transferred to the Bioscreen C plate reader (population-level measurement) or the microscope for time-lapse imaging (single-cell level measurement). The lag phase under each condition is measured in duplicate or more.</p><p>Given the 90 min doubling time in glucose, the 2, 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hr of glucose growth corresponds to 1.3, 2.6, 4, 5.3, 6.6 and 8 doublings.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Population-level lag time measurements using an automated plate reader</title><p>To measure the growth dynamics during the lag phase, cultures pre-grown as described above are transferred to the Bioscreen C plate reader. This plate reader allows continuous medium-amplitude shaking and temperature control at 30°C while measuring the OD<sub>600</sub> every 15 min. Per honeycomb plate, only 20 – 25 wells are filled with culture in such a way that no culture is directly neighboring another. The remaining 75 – 80 well are filled with blank medium. Once all cultures have reached stationary phase, the experiment is stopped.</p><p>Population lag times are calculated from the acquired growth curves using R and MS Excel. First, the background OD<sub>600</sub>-signal as measured in the wells containing blank medium is subtracted from all OD<sub>600</sub>-measurements.

The detailed setup of such pre-growth conditions is described above. The cells were washed and transferred to maltose media after this pre-growth. The cultures are then loaded into a 96-well plate with fluorescent oxygen sensor embedded at the bottom of the wells (OxoPlates, PreSens Precison Sensing). To calibrate the oxygen levels, air saturated growth media was used as the 100% saturated condition, while water containing 10% Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> was used as the 0% saturated condition. Wells with only growth media and no inoculation were used as blank controls. The measurements during glucose growth condition are performed similarly except that the cells are pregrown for two overnights in glucose, washed in fresh glucose medium and then transferred to the OxoPlate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Single-cell-level lag time measurements using time-lapse microscopy</title><p>To measure the growth dynamics during the lag phase at the single-cell-level, cultures pre-grown as described above are sandwiched between an agar pad containing the same medium as used for the final resuspension, and a coverslip (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cerulus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">New et al., 2014</xref>). The agar pad is wrapped in plastic foil so it does not dry through the experiment. This allows tracking growth and gene expression of hundreds of single cells during the lag phase by periodically (every 15–30 min) taking differential interference contrast (DIC) and fluorescence pictures. The time-lapse movies are acquired automatically by the Metamorph software (version 7.8.0.0; Molecular Device, LLC) in combination with an inverted Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope equipped with a DL-604M-#VP camera (Andor<sup>TM</sup> technology), and Lambda XL (Sutter Instruments) light source for fluorescent measurements. The microscope is placed in a temperature-controlled incubator (30°C). All images are taken using a 60 × 1.4 NA oil immersion lens, and the image focus is controlled using an image-based Z-plane focusing algorithm. Single-cell lag times are analyzed manually by scoring the time of growth resumption.</p><p>For cells with a bud, the time at which the bud increased in size was scored. For cells without a bud, the time of the first morphological change leading to a new bud was scored. Under our experimental set-up, individual cells form microcolonies as they resume growth.</p><p>For all the single-cell microscopy experiments, except for the heterokaryon experiment, the microcolony area and gene expression changes (as measured using fluorescent protein fusions) are scored semi-automatically using a pipeline based on MATLAB and CellProfiler scripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carpenter et al., 2006</xref>). Only microcolonies originating from single cells (with or without a bud) are scored. First, the DIC and fluorescence pictures are aligned correctly. Second, a mask is created using CellProfiler to indicate pixels corresponding to cells (mask value become 1), and pixels which are background (mask value becomes 0). In this way, adjacent pixels corresponding to microcolonies form individual objects. In our pipeline, each image is subjected to a Sobel edge detection algorithm, followed by a thresholding step, and a series of consecutive dilation and erosion steps to generate continuous objects. This procedure is based on a series of image processing steps inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Levy et al. (2012)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ziv et al. (2013)</xref>. Third, microcolony tracking through time is done by (1) a manual selection of objects corresponding to single cells in the initial images, followed by (2) an automatic detection of related objects in the images from the following time points. Tracking of individual colonies is prematurely aborted when the microcolony grows outside of the field of view, or when it collides with another microcolony. Occasional out-of-focus images were excluded from the analysis. Fourth, the microcolony area (number of pixels) and the background-corrected mean fluorescence within each tracked object are calculated. Finally, other qualitative parameters such as the presence of a bud, or the amount of bud scars detected after Calcofluor White staining are scored manually. The induction time of <italic>MAL11</italic> and <italic>MAL12</italic> fluorescent protein fusions was scored by calculating the time at which the signal increased distinguishably above its initial level. Visualization of the microcolony area and fluorescence changes is done using kymographs, where horizontal lines represent individual microcolonies tracked versus time. The color scale represents either the mean fluorescence or the relative area increase. The individual tracks are sorted based on the pattern of area increase (from an early to a late area increase).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Time-resolved cross-correlation analysis between microcolony growth rate and protein expression</title><p>For microcolonies that resumed growth during the experiment, the growth rate was estimated as a function of time by smoothing the logarithm of that colony’s area (i.e., the number of pixels at each time point) over time using a Savitzky-Golay filter (2nd order polynomial; window of length 15) and computing the first order derivative of the filter.

At the end of glucose growth, cultures were washed into maltose and prepared for time-lapse microscopy on an agar pad with maltose media.

Only the 8-shaped cells (which are the diploids resulted from mating) are considered for the analysis. The induction time of the Mal12-mCherry or MAL12-yECitrine was quantified for each single cell by comparing the average signal within a window of three time points, centered at a given time point to the basal level. The basal level was calculated as the mean signal from time zero to the given time frame. If the difference between these two values was larger than a given threshold, induction time was scored at that given time point. The threshold for this comparison was chosen by inspecting the intensity distribution at the very first time point. For both of the yellow and red channels, each diploid cell initially has one channel at an undetectable level and the other channel at a detectable level. This is because each diploid has risen from two haploids: one haploid with no recent pre-growth in maltose and hence no detectable Mal protein while the other haploid had recent exposure to maltose (4 hr ago) so it has a detectable level of Mal protein. For the yellow channel the mean of this detectable signal level at time point zero is set as the threshold for induction detection. For the red channel due to the lower brightness of mCherry compared to yECitrine, twice the mean of the detectable signal at time point zero is set as the threshold.</p><p>Number of cells in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> upper-left panel is 33 for <italic>MATα</italic>, 38 for <italic>MATa</italic> and 34 for diploids.

Samples were taken at different time points by centrifugation and resuspension in 25% glycerol, and frozen at −20°C. All samples were thawed and analyzed on the same day, using the Attune NxT Flow Cytometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). For each sample, a total of 50,000 single-cell events were acquired. To analyze the yECitrine-signal, excitation at 488 nm and a 530/30 emission detector were used. The analysis was done in R using the flowCore package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hahne et al., 2009</xref>). The function ‘norm2Filter’ with parameter scale = 2 was used to filter out events that did not fit a bivariate normal distribution based on their side-and forward-scatter dimensions. After filtering, the mean fluorescence of each sample was calculated using the arithmetic mean. Changes in gene expression are measured using biological duplicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Construction of a maltose-prototrophic yeast deletion collection</title><p>The barcode sequencing experiment was done using the haploid <italic>MATa</italic> yeast deletion collection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Winzeler et al., 1999</xref>). However, this collection is made using a parental strain that has growth defects on maltose due to the absence of a maltose-responsive MAL-activator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brown et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pougach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Voordeckers et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we first constructed a maltose-prototrophic yeast deletion collection, by incorporating a functional <italic>MAL</italic>-regulator into each mutant using the synthetic genetic array (SGA) technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hin Yan Tong and Boone, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xiao, 2006</xref>). The query strain that was used to cross with the deletion collection was the standard query strain Y7092, which was modified to 1) replace the non-functional <italic>MAL13</italic>-activator with the functional <italic>MAL63</italic>-regulator linked to a natamycin resistance marker (<italic>NAT<sup>R</sup>:MAL63::MAL13</italic>), and (2) contain fluorescent protein fusions of <italic>MAL12-yEcitrine</italic> linked to a leucine auxotrophic marker (<italic>LEU2</italic>), and <italic>MAL11-mCherry</italic> linked to a uracil auxotrophic marker. All these modifications occur within a 17 kb region on the subtelomere of chromosome VII. Since this region is flanked by a <italic>NAT<sup>R</sup></italic> on the centromeric side, and <italic>LEU2</italic> on the telomeric side, this whole region could be selected during SGA by simultaneous selection on natamycin resistance and leucine prototrophy.</p><p>In our hands, initially 4722 deletion mutants could be retrieved from our original frozen stock. A total of 616 mutants were lost during the SGA procedure, leading to a maltose-prototrophic collection containing 4128 mutants. In order to generate a pool of deletion mutants that were pre-adapted to maltose growth, these mutants were individually grown for 5 days in 96-well plates containing 150 µL of YP-maltose 2% until most cultures reached stationary phase. All of these cultures were then pooled without accounting for potential differences in cell density between cultures, and aliquots were made of 1 mL.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Bar-sequencing experiment and analysis</title><p>For the Bar-sequencing experiment, cultures were grown in the following way. The first day, one aliquot containing the maltose-adapted gene deletion pool (see above) was inoculated in a 1 L flask containing 500 mL of maltose medium, and incubated overnight. The second day, when the cell density was around 6*10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, the culture was split into two. The first part became the ‘0 h-glucose’ condition. A volume of ±50 mL was washed twice with maltose medium, resuspended in a 1 L flask containing 500 mL of maltose medium, and incubated. The second part became the ‘2,4,6,8,10,12 h-glucose’ conditions. A volume of ±200 mL was washed twice with glucose medium and resuspended in the same volume of glucose medium. Different aliquots of this resuspension were used to inoculate different 1 L flasks containing 500 mL of glucose medium, and these flasks were incubated for 2,4,6,8,10 and 12 hr. These aliquots were calculated so that the cell density at the end of glucose growth was always 3–4*10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. At the end of glucose growth, the cultures were transferred to maltose medium where they experienced a lag phase. This was done in such a way that the initial cell density in maltose was ±6.25*10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Again, transferring involved two washes and a final resuspension in maltose medium. Finally, these cultures were stopped when they increased to ±5*10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL, which corresponds to three population doublings. Cultures were grown in biological duplicates. At the end of each growth phase (pre-growth maltose, glucose, maltose) a sample was taken. Chloramphenicol was added to the medium to avoid bacterial contamination during the experiment. Cell counts were measured through the experiment using the Bio-Rad TC20 Automated Cell Counter.</p><p>DNA was extracted using a Zymolyase-based protocol, and the genomic DNA extracts were equalized based on the cell density of the samples. PCR barcode amplification of the UP and DN barcodes was done using primer sets (UP-tag: U1 and p69; DN-tag: D1 and D2) that generate respectively 168 bp and 190 bp fragments containing these barcodes at one of their ends. Ex-Taq polymerase (TaKaRa) was used using standard cycling conditions, including 30 s of elongation time and an annealing temperature of 55°C. A limited number of amplification cycles (16) was done to avoid issues associated with over-amplification. Finally, PCR product from the UP and DN reaction were pooled per sample and were sequenced using Illumina NextSeq 500. Analysis of the sequencing reads was done by blasting them to in-silico generated sequences corresponding to the different gene deletion mutants, allowing for 2 mismatches and three gaps. The frequency of each mutant in a sample was calculated by dividing its count by the total count of matched barcodes.</p><p>In order to determine growth rates and the lag time, the frequencies were multiplied by the total population growth of the culture during the experiment. This transforms relative growth (change in frequency) to absolute growth (change in absolute numbers), and allow calculation of growth rate and lag, when the following assumptions are made. To calculate the adapted maltose growth rate (GR<sub>mal</sub>), we assume exponential growth during the final round of maltose growth of the ‘0 h-glucose’ condition.

These gene lists were analyzed using GO enrichment for ‘biological processes’ using the GO Term Finder tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boyle et al., 2004</xref>). GO categories with a Holm-Bonferroni-corrected p-value&lt;0.05 were considered to be significantly enriched within the lists of up- and down-regulated genes. Since this returned many GO categories, we focused on a smaller number of relevant categories using two selection steps. First, GO categories that were significantly enriched in either up- and down-regulated genes in less than 4 out of the 29 samples were discarded, leading to a reduction from 486 to 285 GO terms. Second, redundant GO terms were removed using REVIGO filtering out categories with a similarity &gt;0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Supek et al., 2011</xref>), reducing the total number of 83 GO terms.</p><p>The mean and slope of the expression change during glucose (relative to the maltose pre-growth condition) were calculated based on the samples taken in glucose, and excluding the initial reference conditions. The mean was calculated from by taking the arithmetic mean of the log<sub>2</sub> expression changes, while the slope (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>) was calculated using a simple linear regression model of log<sub>2</sub> expression change versus the time grown in glucose:<disp-formula id="equ6"><mml:math id="m6"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>ε</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>being the expression level in glucose relative to the reference maltose conditions, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>representing the time in glucose, and ‘<italic>i’</italic> representing the different glucose conditions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgments</title><p>We thank the GeneCore Sequencing Facility (EMBL, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genecore.embl.de">http://www.genecore.embl.de</ext-link>) for sequencing of the RNA-Seq experiment.

Your article has been reviewed by Naama Barkai as the Reviewing and Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Florian Bauer (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers all recommended publications, but have raised some important points, please address them in full. Of particular note are the controls requested by reviewer 3, and the need to examine additional strains, as requested by reviewer 2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The ability of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to respond more quickly to galactose given a previous exposure to galactose was an interesting and 'tractable' example of history dependent behavior (HDB). Before Cerulus et al., multiple papers had examined this specific phenomenon and had focused on either persistent proteins or chromatin state as being the critical mechanism for the &quot;cellular memory&quot;. In this paper, the authors show the surprising result that sugar HDB has a component that is not specific to the specific sugar, i.e. maltose can give galactose HDB and vice versa. The authors then track down the mechanism and give several lines of correlative evidence (microarray and bar-seq) to suggest metabolic state can play a critical role. They then tighten the correlation through single cell analysis of gene expression and perturbation with the metabolic state. I can come up with experiments that I might have done if my lab had made this observation or a slightly different focus, e.g. determine more quantitively the contribution and kinetics of protein persistence and metabolic state, but I believe the work performed is of sufficient quality and interest to warrant publication. Because one could argue that we already know that metabolic state can affect sugar response, in retrospect this result could to some seem trivial. But, typically it was thought that the switch from secondary to preferred carbon source was rapid and it was only the reverse directly where there was a strong pregrowth effect. No one had clearly established the role of metabolic state in the HDB and hence I think this paper both leads to more clarity in the field and will spark more careful and potentially critical analysis of how cells transition from respiration to fermentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript Cerulus et al., investigated the nature and molecular cause of the growth lag that is observed when yeast cells are shifted from a fermentable to a non-fermentable carbon source. They report that the lag depends on the exact pre-growth regimen, whether the cells have already before experienced a non-fermentable carbon source, and how long they have been growing on the fermentable carbon source meanwhile. They employ population level and single cell studies to characterize population diversity and growth behaviour. In the first part of the paper they explore this phenomenon using different types of growth regimen and they conduct several experiments to follow up on the question whether resumption of growth is correlated with the expression of the non-fermentable sugar specific genes (MAL and GAL genes). While they report that higher levels of MAL genes are prompting growth, they argue, also using gene expression tracking in single cells, that the lag phase is not determined by the time it requires to express these sugar specific genes, in individual cells or on the level of populations, but that other factors are limiting.</p><p>They subsequently conducted two types of screens to identify factors and genes related to the length of the lag phase and how it is impacted by the pre-growth regimen, i.e. using the barcoded yeast deletion collection, and mRNA abundance measurements.</p><p>Taken together this analysis provides a main insight that led to the hypothesis that the deterministic factor for the lag phase is the presence of respiratory components at the time point of the fermentation-&gt;respiration switch. They convincingly argue that these proteins (or the organelle, where they reside) becomes diluted upon a shift to a non-fermentable carbon source and only cells that have lost this 'equipment' are prone to a strong lag. They provide experiments in support of this hypothesis, i.e. by showing that the lag phase correlates with the amount/activity of a transcription factor involved in the regulation of respiratory genes.</p><p>Altogether I found the work very well executed, convincing and relatively easy to follow, despite the complexity of the subject. While the work clearly requires &quot;yeast&quot; knowledge for full appreciation, it still serves as a paradigm for studies in other cells and organisms where large metabolic shifts matter.</p><p>As a non-insider to this exact field I found the first part of the introduction very reference-sparse and it was hard to for me judge the knowledge-base of the initial statements, in particular the first paragraph that introduces 'HDB'.</p><p>Table with strain names and exact genotypes of strains and ancestry should be included.</p><p>Plasmid constructions and a plasmid list should be included.</p><p>Any paper dealing with complex growth regimen involving different media should carefully list the source of all media components. The same is true for sugars, here also the exact quality needs to be detailed, since sugars are sometimes cross-contaminated with each other, and traces of glucose in e.g. galactose can ruin a growth experiment if the inoculum is too diluted (and it takes ages for the cells to eat up the glucose before they can respond to the galactose).</p><p>Screen – screens need independent validations, and at last a few hits should be tested individually.</p><p>Strain background: The study is based on work exclusively done with the BY4741 strain, although they used a variant that has been cured for the mitochondria related defect. Still, it would be nice to have some overview about HDB penetrance in other backgrounds, diverse other lab strains and wild type strains that have not undergone any laboratory evolution. I find this an important point, because the Gal promoter is (was?) the workhorse of a regulatable promoter in yeast. While many labs use pre-growth on raffinose – Galactose addition then yields a synchronous and rapid induction of the Gal (but not Mal) promoter- other labs are not aware of this and the literature is full of Glc -&gt; Gal switches to induce the Gal promoter. Would be nice to know how bad the lag can get in different strains. Does not need experiments, if there is some data or knowledge around?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript describes a well designed, holistic and thorough examination of history-dependent behaviour (HDB) of yeast cells in fluctuating carbon sources. The authors proceed logically and use state-of-the-art methodologies at both population (culture behaviour, RNAseq), individual cell (bar-code deletion mutants, single cell microscopy) and selected individual gene and protein levels to characterize the molecular mechanism underlying HDB when cells are transferred from one carbon source to another. Overall, they generate a very impressive data set.</p><p>The findings are of general interest and suggest that previously reported mechanisms, in particular the persistence of certain proteins required for carbon source utilization after transfer, may not primarily account for HBD, but rather that the general physiological state of the cells, and in particular respiration-related factors, are responsible for the phenomenon.</p><p>I have some general suggestions for further improvement of the manuscript:</p><p>1) There is one important control missing: A transfer Glu-Glu-Glu.</p><p>The different periods of times spend on glucose in the experimental set-up will indeed not only impact on the carbon source, but all other nutrients (and in this context oxygen is a nutrient as well). It is essential to show that a transfer back to Glu, instead of to Mal and Gal, will or will not result in (proportionally) similarly extended lag phases. Every transfer involves exposure to a fresh medium with 100% dissolved oxygen from media which have been differentially depleted of other nutrients as a function of time. Many of these nutrients could in principle cause delays in the lag phase by requiring some re-adjustment (if such nutrients had been exhausted or limited in the previous culture).</p><p>2) The authors present all the data in terms of time spend in the glucose medium, but in the text sometimes refer to generations (for example subsection “HDB does not depend on Mal or Gal protein inheritance”).

However, I am less convinced by the link to &quot;growth on glucose&quot; as the primary driver of the system. The problem lies in the fact that the authors are in a self-anaerobic system (as the dissolved oxygen data show). The question therefore is whether it is &quot;growth on glucose&quot; or lack of oxygen that drives the system. For this purpose, it would be necessary to repeat the same experiment in a fully oxygenated environment. Considering the quality and overall significant contributions of the manuscript, I would only ask the authors to discuss the potential role of oxygen and of oxygen supply (and not only of glucose) on the system. There are data that suggest that the primary driver of adaptation for fermentative growth is oxygen availability, and not carbon source.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.39234.048</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this manuscript Cerulus et al., investigated the nature and molecular cause of the growth lag that is observed when yeast cells are shifted from a fermentable to a non-fermentable carbon source.

The problem lies in the fact that the authors are in a self-anaerobic system (as the dissolved oxygen data show). The question therefore is whether it is &quot;growth on glucose&quot; or lack of oxygen that drives the system. For this purpose, it would be necessary to repeat the same experiment in a fully oxygenated environment. Considering the quality and overall significant contributions of the manuscript, I would only ask the authors to discuss the potential role of oxygen and of oxygen supply (and not only of glucose) on the system. There are data that suggest that the primary driver of adaptation for fermentative growth is oxygen availability, and not carbon source.</p></disp-quote><p>This could have been a possibility if the cultures were grown to higher cell densities, however in these experiments the cells are kept at OD<sub>600</sub> below 0.05 and as shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 3 (top panel) in these conditions, the oxygen is above 85-90% of the saturation control.</p></body></sub-article></article>
