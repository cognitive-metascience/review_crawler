decisions that are transmitted by descending neurons to the nerve cord circuitry that produces behaviors. In insects, only a few descending neurons have been associated with specific behaviors. To explore how descending neurons control an insect’s movements, we developed a novel method to systematically assay the behavioral effects of activating individual neurons on freely behaving terrestrial <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>. We calculated a two-dimensional representation of the entire behavior space explored by these flies, and we associated descending neurons with specific behaviors by identifying regions of this space that were visited with increased frequency during optogenetic activation. Applying this approach across a large collection of descending neurons, we found that (1) activation of most of the descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, (2) in many cases multiple descending neurons activated similar behaviors, and (3) optogenetically activated behaviors were often dependent on the behavioral state prior to activation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>optogenetics</kwd><kwd>descending interneurons</kwd><kwd>behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cande</surname><given-names>Jessica</given-names></name><name><surname>Namiki</surname><given-names>Shigehiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Korff</surname><given-names>Wyatt</given-names></name><name><surname>Card</surname><given-names>Gwyneth M</given-names></name><name><surname>Stern</surname><given-names>David L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM09809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shaevitz</surname><given-names>Joshua W</given-names></name><name><surname>Berman</surname><given-names>Gordon J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Optogenetically activated individual descending neurons in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> drive varied stereotyped motor patterns that are often influenced by the animal's initial behavioral state.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>As animals navigate a dynamic environment, their survival depends on their ability to execute specific motor programs and to adjust motor output in response to external stimuli. While the brain performs computations essential for behavior, the motor circuits that directly control behavior are located close to the muscles that they control in the vertebrate spinal cord and insect ventral nerve cord. Information to drive motor patterns must therefore be transmitted from the brain to the nerve cord to direct behavior. Since there are many fewer descending neurons than neurons in the central brain, descending neurons generate an information processing bottleneck, which may generate a fundamental problem in information coding.</p><p>In flies, descending commands from the brain to the ventral nerve cord are transmitted through an estimated 250–550 pairs of descending neurons that arborize in 20 highly conserved clusters in the brain involved in sensory processing and motor behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gronenberg and Strausfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsu and Bhandawat, 2016</xref>). Each descending neuron extends a single axon through the neck connective to the ventral nerve cord, where they synapse onto interneurons associated with leg, neck, and wing motor circuitry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Little is known about how so few neurons – approximately 0.5% of all neurons in the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alivisatos et al., 2012</xref>) – encode signals from the brain to control the full range of movements performed by a freely moving fly. Several potential models have been suggested. One possibility is that, as with vertebrates, many stereotyped insect behaviors, such as walking, flying, or ‘singing’ can be decomposed into individual motor modules controlled by central pattern generators located in the ventral nerve cord. Several recent findings in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, together with earlier electrophysiological studies in larger insects, support this idea. Activation of some individually identifiable descending neurons triggers specific motor outputs, such as courtship song (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>) backwards walking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>), or escape behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">King and Wyman, 1980</xref>). However, some descending neurons modify motor programs, rather than trigger them. For example, cricket walking initiation, speed, and turning appear to depend on separately encoded descending commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhm and Schildberger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gras and Kohstall, 1998</xref>). Alternatively, motor activity may result from the summed activity of multiple descending neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrich, 2002</xref>). For example, a cluster of descending neurons linking fly visual centers in the brain to the flight apparatus in the ventral nerve cord (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Strausfeld and Gronenberg, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>) supports the idea that at least some descending neurons may function this way.</p><p>Descending neuron function may also be altered by behavioral state. For example, descending neuron sensory responses have been shown to be modified by locomotor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Staudacher and Schildberger, 1998</xref>). This kind of modulation has been observed in other contexts, such as the effect of the neuromodulator pyrokinin on the oscillatory mechanisms underlying the crustaecean gastric mill central pattern generator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marder, 2011</xref>). However, it has not previously been possible to undertake a systematic analysis of the context dependency across the descending neuron population.</p><p>Systematic dissection of descending motor control is challenging for two reasons. First, it has been difficult to precisely manipulate a large number of descending neurons individually in freely behaving animals. Second, we have not had a high-throughput, unbiased behavioral phenotyping pipeline capable of objectively categorizing all of an individual’s movements. Historically, insect descending neuron anatomy, connectivity and function have been described by backfilling neurons with dye and recording from individual neurons in locusts, grasshoppers, and cockroaches (for a review see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Strausfeld et al., 1984</xref>]), with more recent studies performing similar experiments in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hsu and Bhandawat, 2016</xref>). While this approach has allowed researchers to describe the anatomy and electrophysiological responses of individual neurons, it is inherently low throughput and biased toward larger or otherwise more accessible neurons. Additionally, because experiments are typically carried out on immobile preparations, only in rare cases have investigators been able to link individual neurons to behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Staudacher and Schildberger, 1998</xref>). While recent technical and genetic advances in the model fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have improved our ability to access and manipulate individual descending neurons, to date only a handful of <italic>Drosophila</italic> descending neurons have been linked to specific motor outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bidaye et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zacarias et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">von Reyn et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To assess how descending neurons control motor behaviors on a system-wide scale, it will be necessary to move beyond isolated examples and to describe the behavioral functions of large numbers of descending neurons. Our goal was to identify all the behavioral phenotypes observable in one particular setting, freely behaving flies moving within a two-dimensional arena, for many descending neurons, without any a priori expectation about the neurons’ effects on behavior. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Namiki et al. (2018</xref>) created a collection of transgenic <italic>Drosophila</italic> strains that target descending neurons using the split-GAL4 intersectional system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Luan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pfeiffer et al., 2010</xref>) in a cell-type specific manner. We screened 130 of the sparsest lines in this collection, targeting approximately 160 neurons that are divisible into 58 distinct anatomical cell-types. Forty of these cell types consist of a single pair of bilaterally symmetric descending neurons, while the remaining 18 categories target populations of 3 to 15 descending neurons with similar neuroanatomy. We used this split-GAL4 collection to drive the expression of the red-shifted channel rhodopsin <italic>CsChrimson</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klapoetke et al., 2014</xref>) in specified subsets of descending neurons, allowing us to photo-activate these neurons in a temporally precise fashion. We combined these genetic reagents with a recently described method for objective, quantitative analysis of behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2014</xref>) to comprehensively identify the behaviors associated with the activation of specific neurons in an unbiased fashion. Unlike supervised machine learning approaches for classifying behavior, this approach does not rely on a human-trained classifier to decide which behaviors are of interest. Instead, it captures a wide range of movements by converting high-dimensional postural dynamics into a two-dimensional map using dimensionality reduction techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2014</xref>). Using this method, we associated 80% of the descending neurons in our collection with specific behaviors.</p><p>We have generated a behavioral dataset that comprehensively describes the activation phenotypes of roughly one third to one half of the total number of fly descending neurons in the context of freely walking flies. The size of this dataset has allowed us to move beyond individual examples to extract general features of descending neuron function, and therefore to consider how these neurons might encode information to modulate behaviors. We find that, with a few exceptions, descending neuron control of behavior appears to be largely modular. In addition, we find many cases in which descending neuron function is context dependent, even for a single fly confined to a two-dimensional substrate.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishing a framework for large-scale analysis of descending neuron activation phenotypes</title><p>Mapping fly behavior using postural dynamics requires high temporal and spatial resolution video data from a large number of animals. Accordingly, we built a red light activation apparatus with an array of 12 USB cameras that allowed us to film 12 flies in separate chambers simultaneously at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We crossed each split-GAL4 line to a UAS-CsChrimson line and filmed six experimental progeny that had been fed retinal, a co-factor necessary for neuronal activation via channelrhodopsin, and six genetically identical control flies whose food had not been supplemented with retinal. The flies were backlit using custom light tables, each consisting of an array of infrared and red LEDs covered by a diffuser. Each chamber was a 3 cm ‘fly bubble’ coated with silicone to encourage flies to remain on the flat floor of the chamber, which was in the focal plane of the camera (see Materials and methods). Each recording consisted of 30 trials of a 15 s pulse of red light followed by a 45 s recovery interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34275.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Descending neuron phenotyping pipeline and behavior space.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The red light activation rig.

To identify behavioral phenotypes in an unbiased manner, we utilized the behavior mapping methods described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al. (2014</xref>). First, we generated a comprehensive ‘behavior space’ of stereotyped actions that single flies could produce in our assay. We collected a dataset of approximately 700 million images, which included behaviors recorded from activation of descending interneuron split-GAL4 lines, previously characterized sparse GAL4 drivers (<italic>fruitless-GAL4</italic> and <italic>pIP10</italic>) that trigger courtship-related behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stockinger et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>), and interneuron drivers targeting the flight neuropil. The additional lines that are not part of the descending neuron screen were included to sample fly behaviors as widely as possible, allowing for higher resolution mapping within the space of behaviors. We computed the behavior space by (1) aligning video images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), (2) decomposing the pixel value dynamics (which correspond to the fly’s posture changes) into a low-dimensional basis set using principal component analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), (3) projecting the original pixel values onto this basis set and transforming those values using a spectral wavelet function to produce a time series that was (4) embedded into a two-dimensional ‘behavior space’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) using <italic>t</italic>-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Each position in the behavior space corresponds to a unique set of postural dynamics. Nearby points represent similar motions, that is those involving related body parts executing similar temporal patterns.

By definition, we could not detect behaviors occuring over time-scales faster than 50 Hz, the Nyquist frequency of our system. Approximately 93% of all video image data points could be embedded in this space, including approximately equal fractions of frames when the red light was on or off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), indicating that the majority of red light activated behaviors are well represented in the behavior space.

We focused on 130 split-GAL4 lines that targeted descending neurons with little, or no, extraneous expression in other neurons. We first considered the timing and duration of red light triggered behaviors. If descending neuron activation triggered a particular behavior represented in the behavior space, then the density of that line in the behavior space should shift into the region that represents that behavior during periods of red light activation. For example, upon red light activation, retinal-fed flies expressing <italic>CsChrimson</italic> in a descending neuron line targeting DNg07 and DNg08 (SS02635) groomed their heads (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>).

Entropy measures the degree of uncertainty inherent in the distribution of the flies in the behavior space. When the red light was off, flies exhibited a range of different behaviors, and the probability that they performed any one behavior was low. This resulted in a low probability density distributed throughout the behavior space and correspondingly high entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Upon red light activation, the experimental fly line engaged in red light triggered behaviors at the expense of other natural behaviors. This increased the probability that a small region within the behavior space showed a relatively high density, generating a drop in entropy whose timing and duration mirrored that of the red light triggered behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>).

We then re-tested most of the 41 lines that did not produce a significant density increase by driving CsChrimson at higher levels by growing the flies on food containing an increased retinal concentration and exposing flies to higher intensity red light (9 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>).

For example, the DNp09 line shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> repeatedly ran and then paused throughout the entire 15 s activation period. The pausing observed in this case has been shown to be a defensive freezing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zacarias et al., 2018</xref>). The increased density in the run region of the behavior space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, red) appeared before the increased density in the paused region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, blue), reflecting the sequential timing of the two behaviors. Running followed by freezing upon DNp09 activation is also reported by Zacarias and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zacarias et al., 2018</xref>). However, the flies rapidly became asynchronous as they repeated this series of behaviors, so this behavioral series was detected as simultaneous density increases in the running and still regions throughout the red light activation window. A line targeting descending neuron DNb01 displayed a simple behavior series; flies produced an anteriorly directed twitch of the front legs when the red light was turned on (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, red region), then froze for the majority of the red light activation period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, black region), and then twitched when the light was turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, blue region). Thus, examining the timing of density shifts illuminates the more complicated behavior series produced by red light activation. This level of analysis is provided for all lines in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>. To facilitate study of these activation phenotypes by others, we also provide a compilation of videos slowed down 4X showing one second before and after activation for all animals and all trials (available via Dryad <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fr89c0c">https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.fr89c0c</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Behavioral effects of descending neuron activation are often context dependent</title><p>Why does activation of some descending neurons result in multiple, distinct behavioral outputs? One possibility is that the behavioral output of some descending neurons depends on the behavioral context of the fly when the descending neuron is activated. To address this possibility, we calculated the mutual information between the density distribution of the experimental flies in the behavior space at 1.5 to 0.5 s before the red light was turned on versus the first second after red light activation. Mutual information is a non-linear measure of the degree of dependence between two variables and is typically measured in units of bits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cover and Thomas, 2005</xref>). The higher the mutual information, the more the first variable, here the behavior of flies immediately prior to red light activation as measured by their distribution in the behavior space at t = −1.5 to −0.5 s, informs the value of the second variable, the region of the behavior space occupied in the first second of red light activation.</p><p>We found that all experimental animals displayed non-zero mutual information between the pre- and post-stimulation behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). In addition, for most lines, more information was available in the experimental flies than in the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This means that even in those cases where red light activation produced only one significant region in the behavior space, the fly’s activity prior to red light activation influenced whether or not it performed the behavior. However, lines with multiple red light activated regions in the behavior space were also those with a relatively high level of mutual information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Thus, a given fly’s behavior before red light activation was highly informative of which behavior that fly would perform after red light activation, as indicated by the different significantly activated regions in the behavior space. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> displays this phenomenon for one of the lines with the highest mutual information, SS02542 (asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Here, if the flies were performing an action in the wing/abdomen movement regions of the behavior space prior to stimulation, then they were likely to perform an anterior movement (region 1) immediately following stimulation. Similarly, flies performing anterior grooming were likely to transition to the small anterior twitch region (region 2), and flies that were initially still tended to remain still post-stimulation (region 3).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34275.023</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutual information between behaviors performed before and during red-light activation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mutual information between pre-stimulation and post-stimulation behavior for experimental flies, calculated using the density of the flies in the behavior space at t = −1.5 to −0.5 s prior to red light activation versus density at t = 0 to 1.0 s after red light activation.

Using this method, and combining it with those descending neurons for which we had only a single representative split-GAL4 line, we estimated phenotypes for 47 of the 58 descending neuron cell types. We have also included six lines and line averages that target two different types of descending neurons cleanly, but for which we have no lines that target each type individually. Twenty-six descending neurons drove locomotion phenotypes and ten drove anterior directed foreleg movements. We also identified six new descending neurons that triggered wing and abdomen movements (plus the previously published pIP10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">von Philipsborn et al., 2011</xref>]), two that drove anterior grooming, one that drove abdomen stroking, and four that drove still or slow behaviors.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34275.024</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Averages of representative lines for individual descending neurons.</title><p>Descending neurons are organized according to the region of the behavior space that they activate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

For example, some descending neurons drove slow locomotion, whereas others drove fast locomotion. Only a few, such as DNa01, DNa02 and DNp26, seemed to produce a global increase in locomotor activity. Likewise, we found descending neurons that produced different types of grooming, such as head grooming (DNg07 and DNg08, and DNg12) or abdomen grooming (DNp29), different types of anterior reaching movements (DNg10 versus DNg13) and different types of slow movements (e.g. DNd02 versus DNp02).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Using optogenetic activation and automated behavioral quantification, we assigned behavioral phenotypes to 80% of the descending neurons cell types in our collection of lines, or one third to one half of the estimated total number of descending neurons present in the fly. Using a dataset of this scope, it is possible for the first time to move beyond isolated examples to consider systems-level trends in how descending neurons control behaviors. We found that activation of most descending neurons drove stereotyped behaviors, that in many cases multiple descending neurons activated the same behaviors, and that activated behaviors were often dependent on prior behavior states.</p><p>There are several, non-mutually exclusive ways a limited number of seemingly highly modular descending neurons could encode the wide range of behaviors undertaken by freely moving animals. First, descending neurons could be more important for triggering and maintaining behaviors than for controlling individual details of a given motor program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrich, 2002</xref>). Many motor programs, particularly those controlling repetitive, rhythmic actions such as walking or stridulation, can function in the absence of descending control ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bentley, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kien, 1983</xref>], for a review on walking circuits see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ritzmann and Bü Schges 2007</xref>]). For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hedwig, 1992</xref> identified two pairs of descending neurons that control stridulation in grasshoppers. In this system, tonic activation of the descending neurons was sufficient to induce and modulate the activity of the stridulation central pattern generator in the thorax, indicating that the descending neurons play only a limited role in patterning stridulation. Several of our lines, including the DNg07 and DNg08 head grooming line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), appear to reflect a similar phenomenon, driving a repeated stereotyped behavior during the entire CsChrimson activation window.</p><p>Second, behaviors might be controlled not by single descending neurons acting as command neurons, but by combinations of descending neurons acting in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heinrich, 2002</xref>). For example, several previous studies have illustrated that multiple descending neurons control the same specific behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kien, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Griss and Rowell, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rowell and Reichert, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gronenberg and Strausfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kien, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milde and Strausfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hensler, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kanzaki et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Staudacher, 2001</xref>). In these cases, it has been suggested that sufficiently strong stimulation of one neuron in a command cohort or module is sufficient to recruit the activity of the other descending neurons, resulting ultimately in triggering of the behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Larimer, 1988</xref>). Evidence from neuroanatomy further supports this hypothesis. For example, roughly a third of described descending neurons appear to have unique projection patterns in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Calliphora</italic>, but the rest share common input and/or output regions in the brain and ventral nerve cord with other descending neurons, suggesting they may act in concert (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gronenberg and Strausfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Milde and Strausfeld, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Namiki et al., 2018</xref>). Our data do not allow us to definitively address this question. However, the large number of descending neurons that drive similar patterns of fast locomotion, slow locomotion and anterior reaching in our dataset suggests that, for these motor circuits at least, these neurons may act in concert. Alternatively, it is possible that many of these descending neurons modulate distinct aspects of these motor programs, a potential dynamic that we did not address here.</p><p>Third, another way to generate behavioral complexity is by coding different behaviors via combinations of descending neurons. We examined a few lines that target multiple descending neurons. We compared behaviors produced by these ‘multi-hit’ split-GAL4 lines with lines that targeted the individual neurons and found only weak evidence for the emergence of new behaviors when descending neurons were triggered in combination. For example, both DNa05 and DNd02 produce slightly different phenotypes when activated in combination with DNa07 and DNd03, respectively, as compared to when lines targeting these neurons are activated alone (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). However, our collection contains, by design, few lines driving expression in combinations of descending neuron types. Therefore, further exploration of this idea will require the generation and characterization of additional lines.</p><p>Finally, descending neurons could be re-used in multiple behavioral contexts. While there are to date no published examples of a single descending neuron triggering different context-dependent behaviors, there are multiple cases in which descending neurons exhibit different physiological responses depending on the state of the animal (e.g. walking, flying, courting, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Olberg, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Strausfeld and Bassemir, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olberg and Willis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Böhm and Schildberger, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Staudacher and Schildberger, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hedwig, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Staudacher, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zorović and Hedwig, 2011</xref>). Our results strongly support a role for context dependency for two reasons. First, the high level of mutual information between behaviors immediately before and after red light activation seen in lines that have multiple red light activated regions indicates that even within the relatively simple confines of our assay, the behavior of the fly immediately before descending neuron activation biases the behavioral output in many cases. Second, our observation that substrate specific behaviors, such as foreleg tapping, reaching, and locomotion are strongly represented in our dataset, while flight and courtship behaviors are less prevalent suggests that descending neuron outputs may be context dependent. By forcing the flies to remain on a two-dimensional substrate in isolation, we may have observed predominantly indirect results of behaviors that would normally take place in a different context. For example, when we activated a line expressing in descending neuron DNp01, the giant fiber, a neuron known to elicit a rapid escape response initiated by a jump when optogenetically activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lima and Miesenböck, 2005</xref>) we only detected the flies running after returning back to the ground because the jump was too fast (~30 ms) to be detected in our assay. It is also possible that some of the descending neurons we screened are never naturally activated in the two-dimensional context of walking and that proprioreceptive feedback may have generated abnormal behaviors in our assay.</p><p>There are futher limitations of our dataset. First, behaviors performed more quickly than the Nyquist frequency of 50 Hz for our movies could not be detected. Second, we assayed only behaviors that can be activated when flies are standing and walking. Descending neurons controlling flight-related behaviors, for example, would not be detected. Third, we assayed only males, so any female-specific behaviors may not be identified. Finally, we assayed solitary flies, so any behaviors dependent on social interactions, for example courtship, may not have been detected.</p><p>Our objective, quantitative assessment of a descending neuron activation screen provides a foundation for understanding descending neuron functions more broadly. Using similar analytical approaches to study the results of descending neuron activation and inactivation in other behavioral settings in the future will broaden our understanding of how descending neurons direct motor patterns in specific behavioral contexts and reveal how the fly’s rich behavioral repertoire can be encoded with only a few hundred descending neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks and fly handling</title><p>The descending neuron split-GAL4 driver collection is described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Namiki et al.

This concentration was increased to 0.4 mM for animals that were re-assayed at a higher light intensity.

Flies were imaged at age 7–12 days, within 4 hr of lights on.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data collection</title><p>Single flies were loaded into individual trays made from 4.5 mm clear acrylic topped with a fly ‘bubble’ 3 cm in diameter and 4 mm at its tallest point, which was vacuum molded from clear 0.020’ PETG thermoform plastic (WidgetWorks Unlimited) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Klibaite et al., 2017</xref>).

To further encourage the flies to remain on the two-dimensional acrylic surface, the bubbles were coated with Sigmacote siliconizing reagent 1 day prior to imaging and lightly wiped with ethanol to remove the excess silicone.</p><p>For each descending neuron split-GAL4 line, six retinal-fed experimental animals and six non-retinal-fed control animals were imaged simultaneously. For imaging, flies were placed in individual fly bubbles atop custom light tables (three identical light tables, each imaging four flies). These tables consisted of a custom light board topped with a 0.75’ 3D printed white plastic standoff that was lined with infrared reflective tape, and which was capped with a diffuser made from 0.125’ white plexiglass acrylic (available from eplastics.com, # ACRY24470.125PM24 × 48), which had 50% light transmittance. The light board itself consisted of an array of 256 IR LEDs (Osram Opto SFH 4050-Z, 850 nm wavelength) arrayed in a 16 × 16 pattern, spaced 7.14 mm apart, and 64 red LEDs (Philips Lumileds, LXM2-PD01-0050, 627 nm) arranged in an 8 × 8 pattern, spaced 14.28 mm apart. IR and red LED intensity was controlled separately by 0–2.5V control voltages, yielding 0-100mA for the IR LEDS and 0–400 mA for the red LEDs. We set the IR LEDs to 1V, which provided even illumination without overheating the flies. We used 0.2V (4.5 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) red light in the initial screen and 1.0V (9 mW/cm<sup>2</sup>) red light when re-screening a subset of lines. All three light tables were connected to a 68-Pin unshielded I/O connector block (National Instruments, CB-68LP), then to an M Series multifunction DAQ board (National Instruments, NI USB-6281), so that all tables could be run simultaneously from a single computer. Each light table was topped with a 10” square frame constructed from off the shelf parts from Thorlabs, which supported four 1.3 MP grayscale USB cameras (Point Grey FL3-U3-13Y3M-C, one camera per fly) on optical rails, whose X/Y/Z coordinates could be adjusted relative to the fly bubble. Each camera was fitted with an HR F2/35 mm lens from Thorlabs and an 800 nm longpass filter (Thorlabs, FEL0800). Each set of four cameras was connected to a separate Dell Precision T3600 Tower Workstation containing two 100 GB internal solid state drives, so that two cameras wrote to each solid state drive.</p><p>Cameras were programmed using NI-MAX and custom software written in Labview (National Instruments). Data acquisition and the LED light tables were controlled by custom software written in Labview. In brief, a master computer ran a single program that (1) turned the red and infrared (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al., 2014</xref>) LEDs on for all three light tables, the former running a program of 15 s, then off for 45 s, for 30 cycles; (2) started all 12 cameras recording; (3) recorded the position of the fly’s centroid for each frame for each camera; and (4) grabbed the frame number for each camera over the network every 2–3 frames, and wrote the frame number and red LED status from the light tables to a single text file. All movies were recorded as uncompressed avi files at 100 frames per second. Each camera was set to 1024 × 1024 pixel resolution that encompassed the entire 3 cm arena. However, flies were tracked using a blob detector and only a 150 × 150 pixel box centered on each fly was saved and used for analysis.</p><p>To facilitate direct examination of individual activated behaviors, we have provided a subset of the complete dataset, consisting of 1 s before and after stimulation for all flies and all trials, which is deposited at Dryad (doi:10.5061/dryad.fr89c0c).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Behavior space generation</title><p>Our approach for generating a behavior space largely follows the methodology originally described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al. (2014)</xref>, which describes much of the procedure in additional detail. We first segmented flies using Canny’s method for edge detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Canny, 1986</xref>) and morphological dilation to find the outline of the fly. All pixels within the corresponding closed curve were considered part of the fly. We assumed that all flies had identical morphology but variable sizes. We calculated a rescaling factor for each fly by segmenting 100 randomly selected images from a single fly and finding the pixels belonging to that fly’s body (head, thorax, and abdomen) in each of them, ignoring pixels associated with the wings and legs. Body pixels were assigned via a two-component Gaussian mixture model, and the average value of the number of pixels was chosen as the body area. All frames from a single movie were then uniformly re-scaled to make the number of body pixels in the average image equal to that in a reference image of a fly. We then rotationally aligned segmented, recalled images by finding the maximal angular cross-correlation of the magnitudes of the two-dimensional polar Fourier transforms between the image and a reference image. This reference image was common to all aligned images. Translational registration was then performed by maximizing the spatial cross-correlation.</p><p>Postural decomposition was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al. (2014)</xref>. Images were Radon-transformed using a two-degree spacing, and the 9781 Radon-space pixels that contained the most variance were kept for further analysis (&gt;95% of the total variance). We then performed principal components analysis (PCA) on these data, keeping the 50 modes capturing the most variance (&gt;90% of the total variance). We projected the segmented and aligned images onto the found eigenvectors to create a set of time series that were representative of the postural movements of the fly. To obtain dynamic information about these time series, we applied a Morlet continuous wavelet transform to these time series. We transformed each mode separately, using 25 frequency channels that were dyadically spaced between 1and 50 Hz, retaining only the amplitudes of the resulting complex numbers.</p><p>Low-dimensional embedding of these wavelet time series using t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>) largely followed the approach in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al. (2014</xref>) as well. A distance metric between points in time was calculated via the the Kullback-Leibler divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cover and Thomas, 2005</xref>) between their associated normalized mode-frequency spectra. Because this data set contains several orders of magnitude more data than can be calculated through brute-force minimization of the t-SNE cost function, we used the sub-sampling technique described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al. (2014</xref>) to identify 600 representative data points from each of the recording sessions. From here, points were randomly assigned subsequent groupings such that each of these groups contained 36,000 data points. The same sub-sampling process was performed amongst these data points, but now keeping twice as many data points as in the previous iteration. This process was repeated until a data set of 36,000 points was obtained. We minimized t-SNE for this data set to create a low-dimensional embedding. We used the re-embedding procedure described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berman et al. (2014</xref>) to include data from outside the 36,000-point training set into the embedding, resulting in the overall density seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Our main goal for the statistical analysis of the behavior space data was to isolate regions of the map that were significantly affected by optogenetic stimulation. Here, we assessed significance by (1) comparing the flies’ behaviors when the LED was on versus when the LED was off, and (2) requiring that the effect of the LED stimulation be larger in the experimental flies than in the control flies. Specifically, we compared the flies’ behaviors during the first three seconds of stimulation (t=0s to t=3s, where the LED turns on at t=0) to their behavior between stimulation (t=30s to t=45s).

Finite data-size corrections were performed by drawing subsets of the data with replacement and extrapolating to an infinite number of trials, and error bars were generated by extrapolating the calculated variance in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bialek, 2012</xref>). The region of transition for each trial was assigned by finding the mode of the behavior space distribution during the first second subsequent to the onset of the stimulus. If the location of the mode of the distribution for that trial was within or closer than 5-pixels to the edge of a region, it was assigned to that region, unless another region was closer. Trials not assigned to any of the regions were given a ‘zero’ label, as reflected in the previous equation.</p><p>To provide a sense of scale, if there are <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> significantly activated regions, the maximum possible mutual information one could potentially measure between the prior distribution and the activated region would be <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> bits. Note, however, that we assigned an additional state corresponding to the fly performing a behavior outside of the significantly activated regions subsequent to the light turning on, thus making the maximal possible mutual information <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf25"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">log</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. This additional ‘zero’ state is necessary to account for the possibility that the significant regions might be exhibited only in a context-dependent manner, leading to no significant phenotype when the fly is performing some behaviors at the onset of red light stimulation and leading to a phenotype if other actions are being exhibited.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Vivek Jayaraman for reagents and feedback, Jan Ache and Ugne Klibaite for discussions, Todd Laverty and members of the Janelia Fly Core for their support, and Steven Sawtelle, Igor Negroshov, Ben Arthur and Roger Rogers for help with the rig, fly bubble design and fabrication.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Optogenetic dissection of descending behavioral control in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Andrew D Straw (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, Cande and colleagues leverage three new tools to dissect the role of descending neurons in controlling <italic>Drosophila</italic> behavior: split-Gal4 lines targeting DNs, a high-sensitivity, long-wavelength optogenetic channel, and t-SNE based behavioral analysis. They claim that activation of most DNs yield stereotyped actions, these actions are common across DNs, and the resulting action depended on previous behavioral expression. The manuscript is well written and the study is very timely given the emergence of new tools permitting the comprehensive study of DNs and behavior. Perhaps the most valuable aspect of the paper will be by providing behavioral phenotypes to use when investigating the more detailed physiology and behavioral function of the relevant circuits. Although this is a very exciting study, significant concerns were raised regarding the video data and analysis that need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The Videos 1-5 purporting to illustrate the behaviors in question are not of sufficient quality and, in some cases, rather poorly processed. They have the following deficiencies, each of which calls into question the quality of the experiments and, therefore, the validity of the subsequent behavioral analysis:</p><p>i) Dark shaded regions appear in the video data (e.g., S03 1:58).</p><p>ii) Portions of flies are lost in some video data (e.g., S03 2:11).</p><p>iii) Boxes appear in lieu of fly images (e.g., S03 3:02).</p><p>iv) Fly orientations are sometimes wrong (e.g., S04 1;00).</p><p>v) In contrast to the text asserting that animals were imaged from the dorsal surface, flies seem to be recorded while walking on the dome (the reader sees their sides or ventral surfaces).</p><p>vi) The reader cannot easily see the relevant details of leg movements. They are rather fast. Perhaps it would help to add the human annotation information on each video segment to make it clear how the authors annotated the data.</p><p>vii) It would be useful to include longer than a couple seconds of fly videos between each cut. It is too difficult to look at extended behaviors in the current form and one cannot simply pause the video because many of the behaviors are dynamic.</p><p>2) Comparisons between experimental and control animals are not provided to the extent necessary. For example, to what extent does the entropy decrease following 'high-power' red light stimulation in control animals?</p><p>3) The watershed determination of behavior space do not seem well-aligned with the underlying heat map (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Perhaps a higher-resolution image would better serve the authors.</p><p>4) The idea of looking at entropy reduction seems to assume that a DN's role would be to elicit specific actions rather than to modulate actions. For example, entropy would not be expected to be reduced if a DN changed behavioral state without biasing which final state was chosen.</p><p>5) In Figure 2—source data 1 and elsewhere, showing the t-SNE results without the underlying video data is too far removed from the real data to be useful to readers interested in interpreting or using the data presented in this study. Please provide relevant videos or tell the reader where to look within Videos 1-5.</p><p>6) Figure 5B is perplexing. Why should the experimental animals have a higher mutual information between behavioral states only a few seconds apart? Please expand.</p><p>7) There are apparent &quot;anticipation&quot; responses to light-off. For example, in Figure 4C and 4D, there are density changes starting just prior to the end of the lights-on period. Does this indicate that the flies anticipated the light change of the periodic stimulus, or is this an artifact arising from analysis? Please discuss.</p><p>8) There are apparently large differences between the behaviors exhibited by experimental and control flies prior to the stimulus onset (e.g. Figure 2C, F). Is this due to the repetitive nature of the stimulus? Where does this arise? Is it present already prior to the first lights-on event? If there are such large differences in fly behavior without optogenetic activation, it does makes me wonder if the two genotypes are in different states.</p><p>9) The authors need to make their data analysis methods more accessible by providing source code. They indicate that the tSNE embedding technique can be found in the Berman et al., 2014 paper, but I think it would be appropriate to link what seems to be the relevant source code on github https://github.com/gordonberman/MotionMapper. The authors additionally indicate that the statistical classification approach here is new and likely to be useful and I agree. Other aspects are also of likely useful, such as calculating mutual information. Therefore, as stated in the <italic>eLife</italic> guidelines, please &quot;Include code used for data analysis.&quot;</p><p>10) The details of the &quot;fly bubble&quot; are not given. Another paper (Klibaite 2017) is referred to, but the construction details are not present in that paper, nor is even the word &quot;bubble&quot; mentioned.</p><p>11) It would be useful to link the behavioral findings with the underlying anatomy of DNs. Are DN inputs and outputs differently represented for different behaviors? The anatomy paper proposes different sets of DNs involved in locomotion versus flight. Do DN innervations in the VNC correlate with different behaviors? Some effort to relate the anatomy to the behavior seems important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34275.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The Videos 1-5 purporting to illustrate the behaviors in question are not of sufficient quality and, in some cases, rather poorly processed.

It is too difficult to look at extended behaviors in the current form and one cannot simply pause the video because many of the behaviors are dynamic.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers have identified multiple non-optimal features of the videos, including the fact that occasionally flies wandered outside the bounding box that was captured, sometimes the flies walked on the dome or were captured in the middle of a jump or recovery, and, in rare instances, the video processing pipeline resulted in some corruption of the videos. The videos shown in these supplementary figures are a randomly selected subset of video samples from each region of behavior space. Since our data set contains 700 million frames of video, it is not reasonable (nor do we think it would be unbiased) to manually filter out these “bad” frames from the large data set. Instead we chose, as the reviewers have noted, to present the data with the flaws intact so that the reader could get an honest sense for the quality of the data.</p><p>Although the human eye is quickly drawn to the rare video clips that do not seem to match the overall pattern, we do not think that these undermine the overall mapping of the 700 million analyzed frames. It is worth noting that the vast majority of video clips show a coherent pattern of behaviors. The videos showing the response to optogenetic perturbation reflect this as well. For example, none of the videos of behaviors after optogenetic activation display image processing problems, providing confidence that our statistical signals reflect real changes in behavior and not image processing artifacts.</p><p>Regarding (vi) above, note that we did not initially manually annotate any of the video frames. Instead, regions of behavior space were manually annotated after the algorithm had clustered the behaviors. The position in behavior space for each group of sampled videos is shown just prior to the appearance of the videos. We chose to present randomly selected videos from each behavior space, rather than expert-annotated “representative” movies, to honestly represent the data that is included in the analysis.</p><p>In order to help clarify evaluation and use of the data by readers, we are preparing a ~5GB collection of videos divided not by region space, as above, by descending neuron line. These videos show clips of control and experimental flies from one second before to one second after optogenetic light activation, slowed down 4X for ease of examination. This new set of videos will allow readers to perform their own evaluation of activated behaviors and to judge the quality of the videos. We will deposit the videos in a data repository, such as Dryad, or whichever repository is preferred by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Comparisons between experimental and control animals are not provided to the extent necessary. For example, to what extent does the entropy decrease following 'high-power' red light stimulation in control animals?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point and we have added two additional panels (C and D) to Figure 3 showing the control flies and have noted the results in the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The watershed determination of behavior space do not seem well-aligned with the underlying heat map (Figure 1—figure supplement 2).

For example, entropy would not be expected to be reduced if a DN changed behavioral state without biasing which final state was chosen.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that if descending neuron activation caused all behaviors to change to a randomly selected other behavior, then we would not observe a drop in the entropy. A descending neuron could, in this framework, be thought of as a “reset” switch. We would not be able to detect such a reset switch as a drop in entropy.</p><p>There is another meaning of modulatory activity, where the probability of a behavior being performed is changed or where the performance of an ongoing behavior is modified slightly, and these we should be able to detect. Note that we find that activation of many of the descending neurons alters the features of an ongoing behavior, such as walking speed, and these changes were readily detected as a drop in entropy.</p><p>To clarify the specific benefits of using entropy to detect activation phenotypes, we have added clarifying text to the “Entropy of behavior space density provides a quantitative and sensitive measure of optogenetic activation phenotypes” section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 2—source data 1 and elsewhere, showing the t-SNE results without the underlying video data is too far removed from the real data to be useful to readers interested in interpreting or using the data presented in this study. Please provide relevant videos or tell the reader where to look within Videos 1-5.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers that providing the corresponding video data would be of great use to the reader. As described above, we are now preparing a large set of videos that corresponds to this line-by-line analysis and that will be freely available from a data depository.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5B is perplexing. Why should the experimental animals have a higher mutual information between behavioral states only a few seconds apart? Please expand.</p></disp-quote><p>This figure panel illustrates that the majority of experimental lines display more predictable behaviors after the activation light comes on than the control lines do. We interpret this to mean that in most experimental lines the behavior elicited by descending neuron activation shows more dependence on prior state than in control flies where the descending neuron is not manipulated. In other words, control flies have more freedom to produce a diversity of behaviors after red-light activation than do experimental flies. For example, Figures 2 and 3 provide examples of control fly behavior that is not affected by turning-on the red light. We have tried to clarify this point for readers by editing the caption to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) There are apparent &quot;anticipation&quot; responses to light-off. For example, in Figure 4C and 4D, there are density changes starting just prior to the end of the lights-on period. Does this indicate that the flies anticipated the light change of the periodic stimulus, or is this an artifact arising from analysis? Please discuss.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that this rise in density is an artifact of the temporal smoothing of the behavior data introduced by the wavelet transform and does not reflect behavioral anticipation of the light stimulus. We have added text to the caption of Figure 4 to clarify this point.</p><p>As described in Berman et al., (2014), and in the Materials and methods section here, we quantify the temporal dynamics of a fly’s posture by applying a wavelet transform to the data. Wavelet transformation involves an inherent trade-off between temporal and frequency resolution. For slower behaviors (~a few Hz) especially, this leads to a fundamental uncertainty as to when precisely the behavior starts or stops. Since the observed onset is at most 1 second before the stimulus onset, our results are consistent with the hypothesis that this apparent anticipation in fact reflects temporal smoothing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) There are apparently large differences between the behaviors exhibited by experimental and control flies prior to the stimulus onset (e.g. Figure 2C, F). Is this due to the repetitive nature of the stimulus? Where does this arise? Is it present already prior to the first lights-on event? If there are such large differences in fly behavior without optogenetic activation, it does makes me wonder if the two genotypes are in different states.</p></disp-quote><p>The time “before” stimulus onset is actually the average of 30 time periods between stimulations. We found an increase in the amount of “Idle/Slow” dynamics for experimental flies in the interstitial times between stimulations. Thus, the difference between experimental and control animals in the time “before” stimulation most likely reflects this increase in the amount of Idle/Slow behavior for experimental animals in the time between stimulation. We have clarified this point in the Figure 2 legend.</p><p>It is possible that the presence of state-dependent dynamics in the experimental animals could affect the found significant regions. However, we did not find significant differences between the first stimulation period and subsequent ones. Thus, regardless of the initial state of the fly, we found robust performance of stereotyped behaviors for most experimental flies.</p><p>Finally, we should clarify that the experimental and control flies have the same genotype and differ only in whether they were fed retinal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) The authors need to make their data analysis methods more accessible by providing source code.

Other aspects are also of likely useful, such as calculating mutual information. Therefore, as stated in the eLife guidelines, please &quot;Include code used for data analysis.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and this was part of our plan upon resubmission. We have posted replication-enabling code on GitHub at https://github.com/gordonberman/Fly_Optogenetic_Analysis so that others can assess our analysis methodology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10) The details of the &quot;fly bubble&quot; are not given. Another paper (Klibaite 2017) is referred to, but the construction details are not present in that paper, nor is even the word &quot;bubble&quot; mentioned.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that we had provided insufficient details to allow replication of this apparatus. We have added additional details that we hope are sufficient to allow a reader to replicate our methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11) It would be useful to link the behavioral findings with the underlying anatomy of DNs. Are DN inputs and outputs differently represented for different behaviors? The anatomy paper proposes different sets of DNs involved in locomotion versus flight. Do DN innervations in the VNC correlate with different behaviors? Some effort to relate the anatomy to the behavior seems important.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed some of these suggested analyses, but the results were not straightforward to interpret. In some cases we see association between anatomy and behavior, but in other cases we do not. There are multiple possible causes for the lack of correlation in some cases and we believe that this problem requires significant further analysis before it would be helpful to readers. This is a focus of our future efforts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
