sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The microbes that inhabit the human body, collectively referred to as the human microbiome, catalyze a diverse range of chemical reactions that can have profound impacts on human health (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Joice et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koppel et al., 2017</xref>). The most densely populated microbial environment among human body sites is the gastrointestinal (GI) tract with an estimated 10<sup>11</sup> bacterial cells per gram (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tropini et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sender et al., 2016</xref>). Due to the largely anoxic nature of the GI tract, this body site is inhabited by facultative and obligate anaerobes that perform a wide variety of challenging chemical transformations. Recent studies suggest correlations between changes in gut microbiome composition and diseases, such as metabolic disorders, cardiovascular diseases, autoimmune diseases, and neurological disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sharon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kang et al., 2013</xref>). Although it is clear that the gut microbiome plays a significant role in human health, the biochemical reactions governing bacterial-host homeostasis remain unclear.</p><p>Elucidating the activities of uncharacterized enzymes present in the human gut microbiome can enhance our understanding of this microbial community. <italic>trans</italic>-4-Hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp) dehydratase (HypD) is a newly discovered glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) that catalyzes the transformation of Hyp to (<italic>S</italic>)-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C) and water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). Hyp is an abundant nutrient in the GI tract. Generated from hydroxylation of Pro residues within proteins like collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gorres and Raines, 2010</xref>), this nonproteinogenic amino acid represents the most abundant post-translational modification in mammals and is also found in the human diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vázquez‐Ortíz et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Verbeken et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Valiente et al., 1995</xref>). Bioinformatic analyses of metagenomes indicate HypD is one of the most abundant GREs in the healthy human gut microbiome, thus suggesting it plays an important role in many bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Levin et al., 2017</xref>). P5C is a central metabolite in amino acid biosynthetic pathways, providing a source of building blocks for protein synthesis and/or of carbon and nitrogen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In gut Clostridiales, Hyp enables amino acid fermentation, also known as Stickland fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stickland, 1934</xref>). These organisms encode HypD near a P5C reductase (P5CR), which reduces the product P5C to L-proline (Pro), which can undergo further reduction. The formation of Pro as a downstream metabolite during Hyp fermentation by Clostridiales results in the chemical reversal of the post-translational modification of Pro to Hyp, which was not previously thought to occur. In addition to commensal Clostridiales, HypD is found in the prominent antibiotic-resistant opportunistic pathogen <italic>Clostridioides difficile</italic>, formerly known as <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic>. In 2015, <italic>C. difficile</italic> was responsible for approximately 500,000 infections and 29,000 deaths, making this pathogen a major health concern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leffler and Lamont, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lessa et al., 2015</xref>). As a key metabolic enzyme, with no protein homolog in humans, HypD could be a promising antibiotic target for <italic>C. difficile</italic> and other pathogens.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hyp dehydration is catalyzed by the GRE HypD in a prominent gut microbial metabolic pathway.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Anaerobic microbial metabolism of <italic>trans</italic>-4-hydroxy-<sc>l</sc>-proline (Hyp) is catalyzed by Hyp dehydratase (HypD), a glycyl radical enzyme (GRE). The product of this transformation, (S)-Δ<sup>1</sup>-pyrroline-5-carboxylate (P5C), is an intermediate in many primary metabolic pathways.

This evolutionarily ancient protein superfamily is essential for anaerobic primary and secondary metabolism in bacteria and archaea. All GREs use a glycine-centered radical cofactor for catalysis. Briefly, these enzymes are activated by a cognate <italic>S</italic>-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet)-dependent activating enzyme (AE), generating a protein-based radical on a conserved Gly residue positioned within the GRE active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conradt et al., 1984</xref>). The glycyl radical in turn generates a catalytically essential thiyl radical on a conserved Cys, which initiates the chemical transformation. Upon product formation, the thiyl radical is regenerated and the radical species is returned to the Gly residue for storage.</p><p>HypD is part of the eliminase class of GREs, which includes glycerol dehydratase (GD), propanediol dehydratase (PD), choline trimethylamine-lyase (CutC), and the recently identified isethionate sulfite-lyase (IslA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kalnins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>). Interestingly, several of the eliminases catalyze transformations with reactivities that are also performed by adenosylcobalamin (coenzyme B<sub>12</sub>)-dependent enzymes. For example, dehydration of 1,2-propanediol and glycerol was first discovered in the 1960s as an activity catalyzed by a B<sub>12</sub>-dependent propanediol dehydratase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zagalak et al., 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rétey et al., 1966</xref>). Additionally, choline cleavage by CutC resembles the activity of ethanolamine ammonia-lyase, a B<sub>12</sub>-dependent enzyme that catalyzes an analogous C–N bond cleavage of ethanolamine using radical chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Craciun and Balskus, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mori et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, dehydration of Hyp to P5C does not have precedence in B<sub>12</sub> enzymology, nor does the C–S bond cleavage of IslA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>). In particular, the oxidation of a C–N bond that occurs in HypD is unprecedented among GREs since all other eliminases catalyze the oxidation of a C–O bond to generate aldehyde products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Another notable feature of HypD is that its substrate is a conformationally constrained pyrrolidine ring lacking a freely rotatable C<sup>α</sup>–C<sup>β</sup> bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">2</xref>). Among GREs, the enzyme with the most similar substrate is the class III ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), which also acts on a substrate with a 5-membered heterocyclic ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The reaction of RNR, however, is more similar to that of diol dehydratases than it is to HypD. Perhaps the enzyme-catalyzed reaction most similar to the reaction catalyzed by HypD is the dehydration of the ribose-containing substrate cytidine triphosphate (CTP) performed by the recently characterized AdoMet radical enzyme viperin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gizzi et al., 2018</xref>). This reaction is reminiscent of Hyp dehydration because it involves the elimination of a hydroxyl group on the carbon position β to a C–O bond within the 5-membered ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gizzi et al., 2018</xref>), although it lacks the C–N oxidation catalyzed by HypD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In order to gain insight into the chemical mechanism of HypD, we set out to elucidate the structure of this GRE to identify active site residues that may be important for catalysis. This information could guide analysis of microbiome sequencing data and development of enzyme inhibitors. Here, we present a Hyp-bound structure of HypD from <italic>C. difficile</italic> 70-100-2010 along with biochemical assays performed with enzyme variants and deuterated substrate to better understand how this newly discovered GRE eliminase performs Hyp dehydration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Overall architecture of HypD is similar to other GRE eliminases</title><p>A structure of HypD from <italic>C. difficile</italic> 70-100-2010 was solved by molecular replacement to 2.05 Å resolution using the GRE homolog CutC (PDB: 5FAU) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>) as the search model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). During model refinement, we observed electron density resembling glycerol in the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although we believe that glycerol binding is an artifact (glycerol was used as a cryoprotectant), it is not surprising that glycerol is able to bind given HypD’s high sequence similarity to GD. To obtain a Hyp-bound structure, we used a different cryoprotectant (see Methods) and included Hyp in both the crystallization buffer and cryoprotectant solution.

A preference for the C<sup>γ</sup>-<italic>exo</italic> pucker has also been noted for free Hyp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lesarri et al., 2005</xref>) and peptidyl Hyp in the context of collagen structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shoulders and Raines, 2009</xref>). The C<sup>γ</sup>-<italic>exo</italic> puckering of the pyrrolidine ring orients C5 of Hyp in closest proximity to Cys434, prompting us to propose C5 as the site of hydrogen atom abstraction. The distance between C5 and the sulfur atom of Cys434 is 3.8 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), a typical distance between the site of hydrogen atom abstraction and the catalytic cysteine in other structurally characterized GREs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vey et al., 2008</xref>). We calculate that in the observed C<sup>γ</sup>-<italic>exo</italic> pucker conformation, the dihedral angle between the amino group and the hydroxyl leaving group of Hyp is 75.8°, similar to the dihedral angles (~60°) observed for substrates bound to other GRE eliminases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>). In contrast, Hyp in the C<sup>γ</sup>-<italic>endo</italic> pucker conformation has a dihedral angle of 165° between the amino group and the hydroxyl leaving group. Hyp is distinct from other GRE eliminase substrates in that it contains a constrained 5-membered ring and thus has decreased conformational flexibility; the similarity in the conformations of different GRE eliminase substrates may indicate an important role for this binding mode in catalysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Hyp leaving group is pointing toward a conserved CXE motif</title><p>Hyp is positioned in the active site through a series of hydrogen bonds that include: Glu436 of the Cys loop, Asp278 of the β1 strand, Ser334 of a short α-helix between the β2 and β3 strands, Thr645 of β8 strand, and a water molecule that interacts with Asp339 of the β3 strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In addition, hydrophobic contacts may play a role in the positioning of Hyp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The Cys loop of HypD contains the CXE motif (Cys434-Val435-Glu436) that is conserved among GRE eliminases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>). In previous GRE eliminase structures, the Glu of the CXE motif is observed to interact with a hydroxyl group of substrate through a hydrogen bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>). In these cases, the Glu is proposed to deprotonate the substrate’s hydroxyl group to form a ketyl radical intermediate that aids in the elimination of a different hydroxyl group (diol dehydratases), trimethylamine (CutC), or sulfite (IslA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>). Thus in these GREs, the hydroxyl group, which is ultimately converted to a product aldehyde, is pointing toward and interacting with the Glu of the CXE motif, and the substrate’s leaving group is pointing away from the Glu. In HypD, we also find that Glu436 is positioned to hydrogen bond with the hydroxyl group of Hyp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in HypD, the Hyp hydroxyl group <underline>is</underline> the leaving group, and therefore it is the leaving group that points toward and interacts with the Glu of the CXE motif rather than pointing away as is the case for the other GRE eliminases. Thus, the orientation of the substrate’s leaving group with respect to the CXE is reversed and the fate of this hydroxyl group is unique in the HypD-catalyzed reaction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Active site of HypD has unique features that enable Hyp dehydration.</title><p>Conserved Gly and Cys loops in addition to active site residues are displayed for (<bold>A</bold>) HypD, (<bold>B</bold>) GD, and (<bold>C</bold>) CutC.

Previous studies have shown that energetically favorable interactions occur between proline and aromatic residues within proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zondlo, 2013</xref>).

A series of HypD variants were constructed to disrupt putative interactions with the hydroxyl group of Hyp (E436Q, H160Q, D278N), the amino group of Hyp (D278N), and the ordered water molecule (D339N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Detection of glycyl radical by EPR spectroscopy confirmed that substitution of these residues did not abolish activation by HypD-AE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, these variants were all activated at substantially reduced levels, indicating these residues may participate in interactions that affect glycyl radical formation and/or stability.</p><p>The D278N variant lacked Hyp dehydration activity, supporting a crucial role for Asp278 in catalysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The close proximity of Asp278 to both the amino (3.1 Å) and hydroxyl (3.5 Å) moieties of Hyp suggests that this residue could both deprotonate the amino group of zwitterionic Hyp and protonate the departing hydroxyl group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,E</xref>). Either or both of these roles would explain the loss of activity in the D278N variant. Additionally, E436Q and H160Q variants lacked Hyp dehydration activity in an endpoint assay, confirming that these residues are also essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Because of the close proximity of Glu436 to His160 (2.5 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we propose that His160 tunes the protonation state of Glu436, potentially allowing it to be a hydrogen bond acceptor of the hydroxyl group of Hyp (2.7 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As discussed above, this role for Glu436 would be unique in comparison to other GRE eliminases.</p><p>Strikingly, the D339N HypD variant also lacked Hyp dehydration activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The lack of activity in this variant is particularly surprising because of its distance from the HypD active site (6.3 Å in the Hyp-bound structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; 7 Å in the glycerol-bound structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, the biochemical data and the absolute conservation of Asp339 among HypD sequences support a critical role for this residue.</p><p>The residues predicted to mediate acid-base chemistry (His160, Asp278, Asp339, Glu436) are part of an extensive hydrogen-bonding network surrounding the hydroxyl and amino groups of Hyp and the conserved water molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–E</xref>). This network provides a plausible route for the proton transfer required to reset the protonation states of active site residues for subsequent rounds of turnover. Participation in proton transfer may contribute to the lack of activity observed when any one of these residues is altered. Notably, the presence of a similar network was also reported in CutC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>). Overall, the loss of detectable activity in these variants strongly supports catalytic roles for His160, Asp278, Asp339, and Glu436.</p><p>We also altered additional HypD residues predicted to be important for substrate binding (F340A, S334A, Y450F, and T645A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Interestingly, although HypD-F340A was activated by HypD-AE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), it displayed no catalytic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This result provides support for the proposal that a proline-aromatic interaction with Phe340 is important for Hyp binding. Ser334, Tyr450, and Thr645 are positioned within hydrogen bonding distance of the carboxylate group of Hyp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). As expected, glycyl radical formation was detected in these three variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, these three variants had different effects on activity. No activity was observed in the S334A variant, indicating this amino acid is essential, likely because of a role in substrate binding/positioning and/or product release. In contrast, HypD-Y450F and HypD-T645A exhibited drastically reduced activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), suggesting that they may participate in important interactions but are not essential.</p><p>Kinetic assays were performed for HypD-Y450F and HypD-T645A to examine effects of these mutations on catalysis. The catalytic efficiencies for each HypD variant were 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than that of wildtype HypD due to increased <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> and decreased <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). Given that Tyr450 and Thr645 participate in hydrogen bonding interactions with the carboxylate group, increased <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values support a role for these residues in substrate binding. Decreases in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> could be explained by changes in Hyp orientation that might reduce the catalytic rate due to suboptimal distances between Hyp and the catalytic residues. Finally, conformational changes caused by these mutations may lead to protein destabilization and thus could also contribute to a reduction in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>. Since both Tyr450 and Thr645 interact with the same carboxylate oxygen atom of substrate, we generated a double-mutant variant, HypD-Y450F/T645A, to test if these two residues have redundant functions. HypD-Y450F/T645A was activated by HypD-AE as detected by EPR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>) but showed no detectable activity in the endpoint assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Experiments with deuterated Hyp suggest that a hydrogen atom is transferred from C5 to C4 of Hyp during catalysis</title><p>We next investigated whether the deuterated substrate, [2,5,5-D3]-<italic>trans</italic>-4-hydroxy-L-proline (2,5,5-D3-Hyp), could be used as a mechanistic probe in a coupled assay with P5CR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) to study the radical-based reaction of HypD. Concerned about the potential issue of deuterium wash-out from reaction intermediates in the coupled assay, we first conducted a control experiment. Nonenzymatic, hydrolytic ring-opening and tautomerization of the HypD product P5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>) and solvent accessibility of Cys434 could both lead to substantial deuterium wash-out for a reaction performed in H<sub>2</sub>O. To address these potential pitfalls, we performed the HypD coupled assay in D<sub>2</sub>O using unlabeled Hyp, reasoning that if ring-opening and tautomerization presented a major problem, and/or if Cys434 was solvent exposed during catalysis, we would see deuterium incorporation in the final product of the coupled assay, proline.

On the basis of these previous studies and the structural insights gained in this work, we propose a possible mechanism for HypD, similar to those proposed for other GRE eliminases, that involves a direct elimination of the hydroxyl group on Hyp to generate P5C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed mechanism for HypD dehydration of deuterated substrate 2,5,5-D3-Hyp.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-51420-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>After activation of HypD by HypD-AE, we predict that Hyp binds as a zwitterion in the active site based on its protonation state at neutral pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step I). The positive charge of the Hyp amino group is likely stabilized by a cation-π interaction with Phe340 and hydrogen bonding interactions with Asp292 and solvent. The Hyp carboxylate is anchored by hydrogen bonding with Ser334, Tyr450, Thr645, and Asp339 (through a water molecule), with its negative charge counteracted by nearby positively charged residues Lys326 and Arg156 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Once the radical has been transferred to the nearby Cys434 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step I), the transient thiyl radical can then abstract a hydrogen atom from the substrate. Based on the biochemical assay with 2,5,5-D3-Hyp and our structural data, we propose that hydrogen atom abstraction occurs at the C5 carbon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step II). In particular, the structure suggests that Cys434 abstracts the <italic>pro-S</italic> hydrogen atom of C5, which is the closest to Cys434 (2.6 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Hydrogen atom abstraction of the <italic>pro-S</italic> instead of the <italic>pro-R</italic> hydrogen atom is consistent with the stereochemistry determined for the reaction catalyzed by PFL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Frey et al., 1994</xref>) and that is proposed for most other GRE eliminases based on structural data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>). Since the initial hydrogen atom abstraction steps in GRE-catalyzed transformations have high activation energy barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Feliks and Ullmann, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), we propose that deprotonation of the Hyp amino group occurs first, as the lone pair of a free amino group could stabilize the radical forming on C5 through conjugative electron delocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step I to II) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viehe et al., 1985</xref>).

Although C<sup>α</sup>-centered radicals of amino acids are stabilized by delocalization of the unpaired electron onto adjacent amino and carboxyl groups (the captodative effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Viehe et al., 1985</xref>), HypD presents a unique case where an α-aminoalkyl radical intermediate forms in the absence of an adjacent carboxyl group. Although rarely reported in enzymatic chemistry, α-aminoalkyl radicals are often generated as reactive intermediates to drive substitution reactions in organic chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Renaud and Giraud, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nakajima et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mondal et al., 2014</xref>).

It is also possible that this elimination step occurs in a concerted manner with N-deprotonation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step VI to VII). Based on the structure and mutagenesis, we propose that the catalytic acid is Asp278, the same residue that likely deprotonates the Hyp amino group, which would reset Asp278’s protonation state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step II to IV). The structure also suggests that His160 and Glu436 are likely to be important in positioning the hydroxyl group of Hyp for protonation and elimination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step IV). Whereas the Glu residue of the CXE motif is generally believed to act as the catalytic base in other GRE eliminase mechanisms to generate ketyl radical intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O'Brien et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">LaMattina et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xing et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodea et al., 2016</xref>), here the role of Glu436 appears to be unique, but not less important. Mutagenesis experiments showed that Glu436, along with Asp278 and His160, are essential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The elimination of the hydroxyl group of Hyp generates a double bond, resulting in the generation of an enamine radical cation intermediate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step V). Because the HypD coupled assay with 2,5,5-D3-Hyp resulted in formation of 2,4,5-D3-Pro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–E</xref>), suggesting that the initial deuterium atom abstracted from C5 by Cys434 is transferred back to C4, we propose that the final radical transfer from P5C to Cys434 occurs at C4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step VII). This proposal also makes sense from a structural perspective. Formation of this double bond settles the Hyp’s C<sup>γ</sup>-<italic>exo</italic> pucker into a nearly planar pyrroline species. Manual docking of the product P5C into the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>) allows us to approximate how this change in ring puckering should affect the relative proximities of substrate/product atoms to the thiyl radical-forming Cys434 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Specifically, modeling suggests that C4 of P5C is closer to Cys434 than is C5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Formation of such a C4 radical species on product will be facilitated by resonance delocalization of the unpaired electron on the nitrogen atom across the adjacent alkene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, resonance structures V and VI). Hydrogen atom re-abstraction from Cys434 could occur at this point or may follow the deprotonation of an enamine radical cation intermediate (p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> ~5.5–7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jonsson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2017</xref>), which would be expected to generate a more nucleophilic, α-iminyl radical species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step VI to VII) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roberts, 1999</xref>). Asp339, which we show here is catalytically essential, appears well positioned to serve as the catalytic base via a water-mediated interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> step VI to VII). Asp339 could also serve as a catalytic acid in the subsequent protonation of the P5C carboxylate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step VII to VIII). Protonation of the P5C carboxylate should aid in its release as the very close interaction with the P5C carboxyl group and Ser334 (2.5 Å) would be unfavorable if the carboxyl moiety were protonated. The final mechanistic step is reformation of the glycyl radical species on HypD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>, step VIII) and product release.</p><p>Importantly, these structural and biochemical data have allowed us to identify a key set of HypD residues important for catalysis and substrate binding, leading to a deeper understanding of how this prominent human gut bacterial enzyme performs difficult radical chemistry.

Assays were carried out in triplicate and were initiated by adding Hyp into reaction mixtures, which were then incubated for 21 hr at 22°C. Upon removal from the anaerobic chamber, reactions were quenched with a 2 × volume of methanol, and precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (15,200 g, 10 min). LC-MS/MS analysis of Pro, Hyp, and deuterated products were performed on an Agilent 6410 Triple Quadrupole LC-MS instrument (Agilent Technologies) using a Luna SCX column (5 μm, 100 Å, 50 × 2.0 mm, Phenomenex).

Both the activation reaction and preparative bioconversion of [2,5,5-D3] <italic>trans</italic>-4-hydroxy-L-proline (2,5,5-D3-Hyp) were conducted in an MBraun chamber. For the activation reaction, solutions of acriflavine (100 μM final conc.) and bicine (50 mM final conc.) were added to reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl) and mixed. HypD-AE (60 μM final conc.) was slowly added to the solution and incubated about 10 inches from the Mbraun chamber light for 30 min. HypD (15 μM final conc.) and AdoMet (1.5 mM final conc.) were added to the activation reaction to a final reaction volume of 7.46 mL (all amounts of activation components were calculated using this final volume). The activation reaction was incubated in a 15 mL falcon tube about 10 inches from the Mbraun chamber light for 2 hr.</p><p>For the preparative bioconversion, NADH (4 equiv., 0.8 mM final conc.), P5CR (0.015 equiv., 3 μM final conc.), and activation reaction (HypD – 0.0015 equiv., 0.3 μM final conc.) were diluted with reaction buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl) to a final reaction volume of 373 mL in a 500 mL glass bottle. The reaction was initiated by adding 2,5,5-D3-Hyp (1 equiv., 0.2 mM final conc., 10 mg total), mixed, and incubated at 22°C without agitation. Conversion to product was monitored by LC-MS/MS using the protocol outlined above in ‘End point assays in D<sub>2</sub>O’ until no substrate could be detected. Upon full conversion, the reaction was removed from the MBraun chamber and enzymes were precipitated with aqueous HCl (1 M, until pH ~1–2). Precipitated protein was removed by centrifugation (28,000 g for 15 min.) and subsequent filtration of supernatant through a 0.22 μm filter. Filtrate was purified by strong cation exchange chromatography. Dowex resin was slurry-packed with methanol and washed with ~100 mL deionized water. The resin was acidified with HCl (1 M) until the flow through was pH &lt;2. The resin was neutralized with deionized water and acidic filtrate was added to the resin.

glycyl radical enzyme HypD. In addition to uncovering the elegant mechanistic logic of HypD-catalyzed 4-hydroxyproline dehydration, by describing the pathway by which prolyl hydroxylation is reversed, this work expands our understanding of metabolic processes performed by the gut microbiome.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Molecular basis for catabolism of the abundant metabolite trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline by a microbial glycyl radical enzyme&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom served as a guest Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Olivier Berteau (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission. While the reviewers agree that HypD is a mechanistically fascinating enzyme of interest, they have raised several important concerns about mechanistic conclusions drawn.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further biochemical support of the proposed mechanisms is necessary. Particularly, the position of H-atom abstraction and re-abstraction requires biochemical support. This is especially important as small differences in distances can easily be overcome by enzyme dynamics and change in substrate puckering. Tracking isotope through the reaction is the most straightforward experiment to address this especially since deuterated substrate is commercially available. Performing the reaction in D2O would further strengthen the mechanistic hypothesis put forward.</p><p>2) Clarify comparisons between the selected GREs/rewrite as per comment #1 of the reviewer 3 and enhance structural comparison analysis to support (or revise claims of) distinct orientation of the substrate relative to the CXE motif.</p><p>3) An alternative mechanism of elimination, as outlined in comment #5 of Rev 3 is conceivable. Authors should address this mechanistic possibility as an alternative or provide rationale against it.</p><p>4) Parts of the Discussion are highly speculative. In particular, the discussion about the stabilization of the putative C5 radical through interaction with the antibonding orbital of the hydroxyl group is vague, and its relevance to catalysis unclear. These highly speculative aspects of the Discussion should be substantially shortened and clearly indicated as a plausible rationale, or removed.</p><p>5) Similarly, in another speculative aspect of the Discussion, the authors are proposing that deprotonation of the enamine radical cation intermediate is required for the H-atom abstraction from Cys thiol, despite the low BDE of the S-H bond. Analysis of BDEs and the thermodynamic landscape of the reaction would shed light on whether deprotonation is truly required.</p><p>Additionally, the reviewers have identified to several minor revisions, as indicated below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Glycyl radical enzyme HypD, abundant in both gut microbiome and in prominent bacterial pathogens, catalyzes dehydration of Hyp to P5C. The key structural features include Gly loop characteristic of glycyl radical enzymes, and the Cys loop that harbors catalytic Cys, positioned in the vicinity of each other to enable formation of the thiyl radical. Moreover, unique hydrogen bonding interactions with Glu of CXE motif support protonation of the hydroxyl moiety of the substrate, facilitating its elimination. Hydrophobic packing and aromatic interactions with substrate proline further enable binding and catalysis in this unique GER pocket. Catalytic roles of Gly and Cys are further supported by mutagenesis, as are functions of residues that interact with the substrate. Authors have further performed EPR analysis to monitor the ability of mutants to form the glycyl radical, as well as careful quantitation of Pro (reduced P5C) to evaluate kinetic parameters of the mutants. Together, the findings support the mechanism proposed. Among notable features are: 1. the a-aminoalkyl radical intermediate which differs in its stabilization from the commonly formed a-amino alkyl radicals stabilized by the captodative effects; 2. binding orientations that supports elimination of the hydroxyl group and 3. Deprotonation of the enamine radical cation to generate a-iminyl radical.</p><p>Summary of substantive concerns: The manuscript would be significantly improved if the following questions are addressed:</p><p>1) Positioning of Hyp in active site suggest H atom abstraction, however this is not clear from the perspective under which structures are shown in Figures 2B and C, where it appears that C4 H atom is closer to the thiyl radial. What is the distance to C4, and how does it change with different puckering of the ring?</p><p>2) The mechanism proposed in Figure 6 would strongly benefit from further experimental support. Have authors been able to track the transfer of deuterium from C5 to C4 carbon? This experiment would be a strong addition to the structure of enzyme-bound substrate and mutagenesis presented in support of the mechanisms, and would serve as an important test to the mechanistic proposal put forward.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Backman and co-workers report the structure and functional investigation of HypD, a newly discovered glycyl radical enzyme (GRE) involved in the metabolism of trans-4-hydroxy-L-proline (Hyp), a major metabolite in the human GI tract. The authors succeeded to solve the high-resolution structure of HypD alone and in the presence of its substrate, allowing them to identify key active-site residues. Based on these structures, mutagenesis analysis, spectroscopic and biochemical data, the authors propose a unique mechanism for the conversion of Hyp to (S)-Δ1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate, implying notably a putative aminoalkyl radical intermediate.</p><p>The work has been very carefully executed and most hypotheses have been experimentally validated. The elimination of the hydroxyl group of Hyp and regeneration of the thiyl radical are the most difficult steps to investigate but the authors have provided solid explanations to support their conclusions.</p><p>This study represents a major contribution to our understanding of the human microbiome and enlightens how an important human pathogen (<italic>C. difficile</italic>) metabolizes Hyp and can strive in this complex ecosystem.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript describes a structural characterization of HypD, a 4-hydroxyproline dehydratase. HypD is a member of the glycyl radical eliminase family and is responsible for the metabolism of Hyp in gut microbes. The authors solved the structure of HypD in complex with its substrate Hyp. The catalytic residues were verified by site-directed mutagenesis and activity assays. The studies provide the structural basis of the mechanism of HypD catalysis. Therefore, I think the manuscript attracts the interests of the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, although authors make a significant amount of mechanistic conclusions, some of them are not reasonable or relevant. Also, the position of H-atom abstraction and re-abstraction requires biochemical support. Thus, I suggest acceptance of the manuscript after addressing the following concerns:</p><p>1) Introduction, fifth paragraph. These sentences do not make chemical sense, and I do not think the way authors are comparing HypD and RNR is appropriate. RNR does not catalyze dehydration, so it is not clear what comparison the first sentence is trying to make. The authors should be careful about the distinction between dehydration and hydroxide elimination. The second sentence is confusing because neither enzyme catalyzes oxidation. Dehydration reaction catalyzed by HypD is not oxidation as the overall oxidation state of the molecule is unchanged before and after the reaction. So, overall, I do not think the way authors are comparing RNR and HypD here is reasonable or informative. I do, however, noticed potential similarity/distinction in the mechanisms of radical assisted hydroxide elimination catalyzed by the two enzymes as well as viperin and other GRE eliminases. So, authors may want to rewrite this section by focusing on such a mechanism.</p><p>2) Subsection “HypD active site reveals interesting variations on a GRE eliminase theme”, end of first paragraph. Although the authors state that the orientation of Hyp with respect to C and E residues are distinct from those in other eliminases, the distinction is not clear. Earlier in the paragraph, authors focused on the conservation of CXE motif and the interaction of E with a hydroxyl group, but a distinct catalytic consequence. No structural comparison was made, and thus it is not clear how distinct the &quot;orientation of Hyp with respect to C and E residues&quot; is between HypD and other eliminases.</p><p>3) The authors made strong conclusions about the sites of H-atom abstraction and re-abstraction based on the difference of 0.5-0.6 A between two possible sites, which could easily be perturbed by a dynamic motion of the enzyme during catalysis or in the presence of glycyl radical. Thus, biochemical support is needed. Has an isotope experiment performed on this enzyme? According to the mechanism in Figure 6, the authors should observe a migration of D5 in Hyp to 4-position. 4-[2,5,5-D3]hydroxyproline is available from CIL, and thus it is relatively straightforward to test this hypothesis. Alternatively, if authors perform the reaction in D2O, they may be able to observe wash in of D.</p><p>4) –Discussion, third paragraph. I found the discussion about the stabilization of the putative C5 radical through interaction with the antibonding orbital of the hydroxyl group to be vague and speculative. It is not clear such effect is present or critical for the catalysis. Is this effect critical for the selective abstraction of pro-R H5? Or is it essential for catalytic activity at all? If authors want to propose such a mechanism, they should discuss the thermodynamics of such effects on the HypD catalysis.</p><p>5) The mechanism of hydroxide elimination in Figure 6 proceeds through aminyl radical carbanion intermediate, which is distinct from the concept of the spin-center shift in Wessig and Muehling, 2007. In the presence of a general base catalyst, the radical assisted β elimination proceeds in a concerted manner. A similar mechanism is conceivable for HypD, in which C5 radical intermediate undergoes concerted N-deprotonation, radical migration from C5 to C4 and elimination of 4-OH. How did the authors eliminate such a mechanism?</p><p>6) –Discussion, sixth paragraph. The authors are proposing that deprotonation of an examine radical cation intermediate is required for the H-atom abstraction from thiol. However, BDE of alkyl thiol SH bonds are also relatively low (86-88 kcal/mol; Handbook of BDE in organic compounds). Thus, the H-atom abstraction from Cys is unlikely a challenging step. I would suggest the authors compare these BDE's with that of the C5-H bond and discuss the thermodynamic landscape of the reaction.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51420.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Further biochemical support of the proposed mechanisms is necessary.

If authors want to propose such a mechanism, they should discuss the thermodynamics of such effects on the HypD catalysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this proposal from the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The mechanism of hydroxide elimination in Figure 6 proceeds through aminyl radical carbanion intermediate, which is distinct from the concept of the spin-center shift in Wessig and Muehling, 2007. In the presence of a general base catalyst, the radical assisted β elimination proceeds in a concerted manner. A similar mechanism is conceivable for HypD, in which C5 radical intermediate undergoes concerted N-deprotonation, radical migration from C5 to C4 and elimination of 4-OH. How did the authors eliminate such a mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer indicates, our data cannot rule out the possibility that deprotonation of the proposed aminyl radical occurs simultaneously with elimination of the C4 OH group.

The authors are proposing that deprotonation of an examine radical cation intermediate is required for the H-atom abstraction from thiol. However, BDE of alkyl thiol SH bonds are also relatively low (86-88 kcal/mol; Handbook of BDE in organic compounds). Thus, the H-atom abstraction from Cys is unlikely a challenging step. I would suggest the authors compare these BDE's with that of the C5-H bond and discuss the thermodynamic landscape of the reaction.</p></disp-quote><p>We have rewritten this section of the Discussion and have shortened this part of the Discussion as the overall consensus of the reviewers was that the Discussion was too long.</p></body></sub-article></article>
