Tumor-derived exosomes are emerging contributors to tumorigenesis. To understand how exosomes might contribute to cell transformation, we utilized the classic two-step NIH/3T3 cell transformation assay and observed that exosomes isolated from pancreatic cancer cells, but not normal human cells, can initiate malignant cell transformation and these transformed cells formed tumors in vivo. However, cancer cell exosomes are unable to transform cells alone or to act as a promoter of cell transformation. Utilizing proteomics and exome sequencing, we discovered cancer cell exosomes act as an initiator by inducing random mutations in recipient cells. Cells from the pool of randomly mutated cells are driven to transformation by a classic promoter resulting in foci, each of which encode a unique genetic profile. Our studies describe a novel molecular understanding of how cancer cell exosomes contribute to cell transformation.</p><p><bold>Editorial note:</bold> This article has been through an editorial process in which the authors decide how to respond to the issues raised during peer review.

The conversation at the primary tumor site, as well as at distant locations, is mediated through many secreted factors including exosomes; small (30â150 nm) secreted extracellular vesicles shed by normal and malignant cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kalluri, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stahl and Raposo, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colombo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willms et al., 2016</xref>). Exosomes and their mechanism(s) of biogenesis and function has emerged as a promising, yet controversial, field of research. Based on multi-omic studies, exosomes are known to carry heterogeneous cargo composed of proteins, metabolites, genetic material (DNA and microRNAs), and lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willms et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demory Beckler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kowal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kalluri and LeBleu, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). They are selectively packaged and transferred into recipient cells acting as vehicles for intercellular communication in normal physiological and pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hessvik and Llorente, 2018</xref>). A growing body of evidence shows exosomes are crucial in shaping the local tumor microenvironment to promote cancer progression by advancing tumor metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Costa-Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Although there is a major emphasis on describing the function of exosomes in metastasis and interactions in the local tumor microenvironment, less effort has been invested in analyzing their specific contribution to transforming a normal cell into a malignant cell. It has been shown that exosomes can contribute to the transformation of nontumorigenic cells to form tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdouh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonyak et al., 2011</xref>). However, a common feature among these studies is the use of cells that were either pre-exposed to transforming agents or treated with cancer patient sera or medium from cultured cancer cells, both of which contain cancer cell exosomes. Under these conditions, it is conceivable that other components, in addition to exosomes, are transforming cells.</p><p>Pancreatic cancer is a lethal metastatic disease that lacks efficient curative treatment. Even though there is continuing progress toward understanding the biology of pancreatic cancer, it remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vincent et al., 2011</xref>). This is mainly due to the lack of effective treatments against its highly metastatic behavior and therefore, understanding the key mechanisms underlying its progression is needed. Mutations in the four pancreatic driver genes, <italic>KRAS</italic>, <italic>CDKN2A</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic>, and <italic>SMAD4</italic>, occur frequently in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDAC) and are well described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giovannetti et al., 2017</xref>). An activating mutation in the <italic>KRAS</italic> gene is present in 90% of cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giovannetti et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, genetic heterogeneity and polyclonality have also been shown to be present in PDAC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Giovannetti et al., 2017</xref>). Together with the indications that cancer-cell-derived exosomes are emerging contributors to tumor promotion, we wanted to evaluate whether exosomes secreted by pancreatic cancer cells participate in a distinct role in the process of cell transformation.</p><p>Malignant transformation of a normal cell occurs in a stepwise fashion. Point mutations in the genome can result in the reprogramming of a normal cell to a less differentiated state that is receptive to additional genetic alterations resulting in uncontrolled growth and ultimately cancer. The classic two-stage in vitro cell transformation assay (CTA) is a tiered system for transformation that was created for screening potential carcinogenic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berwald and SACHS, 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kakunaga, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sakai and Sato, 1989</xref>). In this system, cells are first treated with a suspected carcinogen, called an <italic>initiator</italic>, such as the genotoxic carcinogen 3-MCA (3-methylcholanthrene). 3-MCA introduces random genetic changes in a pool of normal cells. Subsequently, these <italic>initiated</italic> cells are exposed to a <italic>promoter</italic>, such as TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate), which enhances proliferation in the <italic>initiated</italic> cells selectively, thus driving malignant transformation of the cells. The resulting transformed cells are observed as foci on a cell culture plate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sakai and Sato, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>). This reductionist approach provides sensitivity in detecting a wider range of <italic>initiating</italic> agents that may not show obvious transforming activity without a <italic>promoter</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sakai and Sato, 1989</xref>). Using this assay as a model system for malignant cell transformation, we assessed whether or not cancer-cell-derived exosomes could affect and/or potentially drive the transformation of a normal cell.</p><p>The results presented herein provide a detailed analysis of a previously unidentified molecular function of cancer cell exosomes for malignant cell transformation. We observe that exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cells can act as an <italic>initiator</italic> but not as a <italic>promoter</italic> in the two-stage CTA leading to malignant cell transformation. By contrast, exosomes derived from normal pancreatic cells have no effect on the cell transformation process. Specifically, using this two-stage CTA, we observe over a three-day initiator step that a single treatment of cancer cell exosomes acts in the same manner as a single treatment of the chemical <italic>initiator</italic> 3-MCA. As <italic>initiators</italic> of cell transformation, they incorporate random molecular changes into DNA. These random mutations then set the stage for a <italic>promoter</italic> to induce transformation of cells to form foci. In addition, we show that the cancer cell exosome-initiated transformed cells form aggressive tumors when injected into mice. In-depth analysis of the transformed cells using a combination of proteomics and exome sequencing reveals distinct differences between healthy cells and transformed cells with key insights into how cancer cell exosomes may be working on recipient cells to contribute to transformation. Overall, this study uncovers a specific function of pancreatic cancer cell exosomes in the malignant cell transformation process.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Exosome isolation, validation, and characterization</title><p>Exosomes were isolated using a combined ultrafiltration-ultracentrifugation protocol (described in detail in Materials and methods) from four pancreatic cancer cell lines, Capan-2, MIA PaCa-2, Panc-1, and BxPC-3, and two human normal cell lines, human pancreatic ductal epithelial cells (HPDE) and human primary dermal fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adamczyk et al., 2011</xref>).

In addition, three independent control foci were sequenced from untreated cells (gray) and TPA-only treated cells (gray); these are referred to as background foci. The total number of variants found by exome sequencing are visualized by Venn diagrams (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The total set of variant data was used to generate the principle component analysis (PCA) plot shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>. When all 12 foci samples were plotted together, the six transformed foci (MCA/TPA and Capan-2/TPA) appeared to cluster tightly while the six background foci (untreated and TPA-only) showed no clear relationship to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). When probed further, PCA of just the six transformed foci showed that there is no clear relationship between these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Additionally, the total set of variant data was analyzed using MutaGene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goncearenco et al., 2017</xref>) to investigate the specific types of nucleotide changes in the each of the 12 foci sequenced. MutaGene is a computational tool used to identify the most likely mutagenic processes associated with a set of variants found from whole exome or genome sequencing. The full mutational profile of each set of variants was decomposed into contributing COSMIC mutational signatures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig6sdata1">Figure 6âsource data 1</xref>). Clustering analysis of these signatures shows that all six transformed foci have similar mutational profiles that vary from the six background foci samples. The top mutational signatures found in each of the six transformed foci are COSMIC Signatures 20 and 15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), both of which are associated with defective DNA mismatch repair (MMR) and microsatellite instability. Foci from untreated cells and TPA-only treated samples did show signatures associated with microsatellite instability, but not as the top contributing signature. Instead, the top COSMIC Signature associated with each of the background foci was found to be COSMIC Signature 3, associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair. Considering that mismatch repair was found to be the top-contributing signature of each of the transformed foci, mismatch repair genes were analyzed in more detail for specific mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Missense mutations were found to be encoded in each of the transformed foci, but none of the foci contained the same mutations. None of the untreated background foci and only one of the TPA-only treated background foci had mutations in the analyzed MMR genes. Considering that mutations in oncogenes are often drivers of cell transformation, we also analyzed the mutational state of the 190 known oncogenes across the 12 foci samples. Results did not indicate a likely driver mutation as very few shared mutations were observed between independent foci of the same type and no common point mutations were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig5s1sdata1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1âsource data 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40226.021</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Principle component analysis (PCA) of transformed NIH/3T3 cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PCA plot showing relationship between three MCA/TPA transformed foci, three Capan-2 exosome (ExC)/TPA transformed foci, three control foci from TPA-only treated NIH/3T3 cells, and three control foci from untreated NIH/3T3 cells.

In this study, we explored whether pancreatic cancer cell exosomes have a distinct role in the transformation of a normal cell to a malignant form by utilizing a classic two-stage cell transformation assay. We were able to describe a previously uncharacterized function for pancreatic cancer cell exosomes as an <italic>initiator</italic> in malignant cell transformation. Specifically, cancer cell exosomes were only shown to affect cell transformation when used as an <italic>initiator</italic> in combination with a <italic>promoter</italic>. Exosomes had no effect on cells when tested as a <italic>promoter</italic> or when used as both an <italic>initiator</italic> and <italic>promoter</italic> in the two-step CTA. Moreover, exosomes isolated from normal cells were unable to <italic>initiate</italic> cell transformation. By utilizing proteomics and exome sequencing, we were able to gain more understanding on the process of cell transformation. We propose that a single treatment of cancer cell exosomes on NIH/3T3 cells over 3 days can act in a similar way as the chemical <italic>initiator</italic> MCA, by randomly incorporating molecular changes into DNA. These random mutations then set the stage for a <italic>promoter</italic> to induce transformation of cells to form foci that are able to induce tumors when injected into mice.</p><p>For studies aiming to elucidate the biological functions of exosomes, it is essential that exosomes are reliably isolated from interfering cellular debris or contaminants. One of the current challenges in the exosome field is the lack of a universally accepted purification method. There are many published protocols on exosome purification from cells but it remains difficult to effectively isolate exosomes from contaminants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willms et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kowal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">ThÃ©ry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vergauwen et al., 2017</xref>). Major improvements have been made in recent years, one being the recent update to the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV2018) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">ThÃ©ry et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, we aimed to meet the criteria posted in the MISEV2018 in order to produce exosome preparations with minimal co-isolating contaminants. To eliminate the possibility that contaminants might participate in the exosome <italic>initiator</italic> activity, we further purified exosomes using a sucrose density gradient in order to obtain âpureâ exosome fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiou and Ansel, 2016</xref>). Identical experiments with both populations of exosomes demonstrated that both samples could act as an <italic>initiator</italic> in the CTA, thereby establishing exosomes as the <italic>initiating</italic> factor in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>The classic two-stage CTA was specifically used as a tool to study cell transformation because it is rigorous, reproducible, and has a well-established phenotype. This assay does not stimulate the entire in vivo neoplastic process, but it can provide essential information about identification of potential carcinogens and their mode of action. We also appreciate that the exosomes used in these assays are derived from human cancer cell lines whereas the ânormalâ cells used in the CTA are NIH/3T3 cells from murine origin. Previous studies have shown highly conserved molecular functions across human and mouse, including the regulation of cell division, DNA replication, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Monaco et al., 2015</xref>). Through this assay, we were able to test the role that exosomes play in NIH/3T3 cell transformation in a well-controlled manner.</p><p>Recent studies demonstrate that cancer cell exosomes can in fact participate in cell transformation, however the details on how these exosomes contribute to transformation remained elusive. For example, Dai et al. showed that exosomes participated in the transformation process of normal cells after cells were treated with arsenite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dai et al., 2018</xref>). Another study described a transfer of malignant traits to BRCA1 deficient human fibroblast when treated with either cancer patient sera or isolated cancer cell exosomes, leading to malignant transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdouh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hamam et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, exosomes in breast cancer patient sera have been shown to promote nontumorigenic epithelial cells to form tumors in a Dicer-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Melo et al., 2014</xref>). In each of the aforementioned studies, non-transformed cells were either pre-exposed to transforming agents or treated with cancer patient sera or medium from cultured cancer cells. Interestingly, Antonyak et al. has demonstrated that sustained treatment of NIH/3T3 cells with breast cancer or glioma cell-derived microvesicles has the ability to induce transformation of recipient cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonyak et al., 2011</xref>). Contrastingly, in our studies, when cells were treated only with pancreatic cancer cell exosomes, increased cell transformation was not observed. While the specific details and effects on cell transformation attributed to exosomes vary between the studies, both demonstrate that exosomes are indeed playing a role in cell transformation.</p><p>Collectively, we observe that exosomes can function as an <italic>initiator</italic> in malignant cell transformation. Our results show that this activity is independent of the KRAS mutational state of exosome producing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Boiling exosomes destroys the membrane structures and releases the vesicle content into the media, demonstrating that intact vesicles are needed to induce cell transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, exosomes were found to work as a classic <italic>initiator</italic> and thus function with multiple <italic>promoters</italic> (TPA or CdCl<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Finally, when cells isolated from MCA/TPA and cancer cell exosome/TPA foci were injected subcutaneously into immunocompromised mice, tumors formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>).</p><p>We propose that, like MCA, cancer cell exosomes can cause random molecular changes to mediate the <italic>initiator</italic> step in cell transformation. Then, treatment with the <italic>promoter</italic> TPA forces cells to proliferate repeatedly and drives them to be fully transformed. The biochemistry associated with MCA-driven transformation is complex and diverse; it is known to produce bulky carcinogen-DNA adducts, which are associated with GÂ·C â TÂ·A transversions and thus introduces mutagenic and carcinogenic properties into DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malins et al., 2004</xref>). According to Malins et al., MCA creates an identifiable tumor phenotype long before the appearance of tumors and causes changes in DNA structure that could be expected to influence gene expression and further translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malins et al., 2004</xref>). Although we observe no major changes in the protein content in <italic>initiated</italic> cells based on qualitative proteomic analysis, it is logical that changes could not be feasibly detected because they are occurring in specific proteins among specific cells in the total population. Additionally, it is known that exosomes do not uniformly contain the same pool of proteins, lipids, metabolites, or microRNAs, but rather each exosome contains a unique repertoire of biological molecules thus possibly causing a variety of changes in the cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Willms et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kowal et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, potentially both MCA and cancer cell exosomes are causing random molecular changes across the population of treated NIH/3T3 cells that cannot be detected amongst the overall protein composition of cells by mass spectrometry. Ultimately, more studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanism of this cancer cell exosome-mediated <italic>initiation</italic> event.</p><p>To further investigate the effects of cancer cell exosome-initiated transformation on cells, we probed the transformed foci that are formed during the two-stage cell transformation by proteomics and exome sequencing. Comparing the proteins found in MCA/TPA foci and Capan-2 exosome/TPA foci (transformed foci) revealed a set of unique proteins not identified in the control NIH/3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Venn diagrams comparing the proteins found in each foci reveal that these unique proteins vary between foci of the same type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). GO enrichment analysis of the transformed foci highlight this diversity, as a minority of molecular functions are found to be enriched in all the transformed foci while the majority of enriched functions vary between foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). These studies, in contrast to the proteomic studies on the <italic>initiator</italic> treated cells, show major changes in the proteomic profiles of transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>We performed exome sequencing analysis on twelve foci samples in total: three untreated control foci and three TPA-only treated foci (referred to as background foci); three MCA/TPA foci and three Capan-2 exosome/TPA foci (referred to as transformed foci). As expected, we observed diversity in mutational variants for each of these pools of cells because each foci was derived from independent mutagenic events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). PCA demonstrated that the transformed foci appear to cluster together while the background foci show no clear relationship to one another. Using PCA for just the transformed foci, we do observe heterogeneity between each sample, supporting the diversity in variants observed from sequencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). We then used MutaGene analysis with the full set of variants for each foci to generate the mutational profile for each. The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> represents the relative contribution of the pan-cancer derived COSMIC signatures to the mutational profiles of each foci. Although all 12 samples are divergent at the molecular level, there is a distinct difference between the top contributing mutational signatures found in the six transformed foci as opposed to the six background foci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>The top signatures identified in the transformed foci (COSMIC Signatures 20 and 15), are associated with defective DNA mismatch repair and microsatellite instability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Consistent with this observation, analysis of MMR genes for specific mutations revealed mismatch repair gene mutations in these six transformed foci. Furthermore, based on in silico prediction analysis we observed that the mutations detected in mismatch repair genes may be deleterious or damaging for the activity of the mismatch repair proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">2</xref>). Concurrently, sequencing data shows that the wild-type allele for each MMR gene is still present in these six foci. While MMR genes usually comply with Knudsonâs two-hit hypothesis for tumor suppressor genes, the presence of the wild-type copy of a MMR gene in somatic cells is not always sufficient for a normal function. Haploinsufficiency may be function-specific; for example, it has been demonstrated that responding to DNA damage requires a higher dosage of MMR protein than the repair function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">PeltomÃ¤ki, 2016</xref>). Regardless, the dysfunction of the MMR system is supported by the presence of the COSMIC profiles 20 and 15. Interestingly, none of the foci contain the same mutations in the MMR genes, further supporting the proposal that transformed cells originated from distinct mutagenic events. By contrast, only a single sample from the background foci was observed to have mutations (two) in MMR genes. In addition, the main driver found for all six background foci was COSMIC Signature 3. This profile associates with a failure in DNA double-strand break-repair that compromises genomic integrity and likely contributes to the high number of variants found in these samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Analysis of the top signatures for all six transformed foci shows that mutations in mismatch repair machinery are most likely what drives the transformation of these cells. Although the <italic>initiators</italic> (MCA and Capan-2 exosomes) varied for these six transformed foci, all were derived from NIH/3T3 cells and used TPA as a <italic>promoter</italic> for cell transformation. Analysis of the top signatures and perusal of mutated genes for the background foci demonstrates drivers other than MMR genes were used for the transformation of the cells. These observations support the proposal that when TPA is used as a <italic>promoter (to drive proliferation)</italic> in combination with a functional <italic>initiator</italic> (<italic>an entity that creates a population of randomly mutated cells)</italic>, the molecular path of cells towards tumorigenesis may not be random. Rather, TPA may drive a path in a subset of randomly mutated cells that accommodates a course towards COSMIC signatures 20 or 15. Furthermore, future studies might reveal that another <italic>promoter</italic> acting on <italic>initiator</italic> treated cells might lead cells towards another common endpoint with regards to the 30 different signature profiles.</p><p>A recent study by Felsentein et al. described an interesting finding in which a portion of co-occurring IPMNs in PDAC patients appeared to be genetically unrelated, meaning they shared no mutations in the assayed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felsenstein et al., 2018</xref>). This elicits a fascinating question as to whether cells in a primary tumor could be derived from independent transformation events as opposed to exclusive clonal events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Felsenstein et al., 2018</xref>). Potentially, exosomes secreted by the primary tumor could orchestrate such events. Additional studies towards understanding the cancer cell exosome-mediated <italic>initiation</italic> are needed to address such questions, specifically, investigating the <italic>initiation</italic> capacity of cancer cell exosomes in more relevant cells like human epithelial cells.</p><p>In conclusion, we observe that cancer cell exosomes have the capacity to act as a classic <italic>initiator</italic> in the 2-stage CTA by incorporating random changes to NIH/3T3 cells over three days to mediate the first step in cell transformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We observe that exosomes from pancreatic cancer cell lines, independently from the KRAS mutation status, can <italic>initiate</italic> the transformation of NIH/3T3 cells, while exosomes from normal pancreatic cells do not possess this ability. Future studies expanding on how cancer cell exosomes can uniquely function as an <italic>initiator</italic> are under way. Importantly, these observations provide insight into the molecular role of cancer cell exosomes in cell transformation and how this activity might contribute to the dynamic conversation between normal and cancer cells.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40226.028</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic model of exosome mediated transformation.</title><p>Exosomes secreted by cancer cells are taken up by normal NIH/3T3 cells and have the capacity to act as an <italic>initiator</italic> by incorporating random changes into the recipient cell genome.

In detail, pancreatic cancer cells (CAPAN-2, Panc-1, MIA PaCa-2, and BxPC-3) and normal human cells (HPDE and human primary dermal fibroblasts) were grown in ten 225 cm<sup>3</sup> flasks in standard medium until they reached a confluency of approximately 70â80% (~3.5Ã10<sup>8</sup> cells). The carcinoma cell lines were then washed twice with medium and incubated in plain, serum-free medium for 72 hr. For HPDE cells and human primary dermal fibroblasts, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) was used for washing and plain Keratinocyte SFM medium without supplements was used for exosome production for 72 hr. This protocol did not measurably increase the rate of cell death as determined by trypan blue exclusion, which showed over 93% live cell counts after 72 hr incubation in conditioned media. Next, the conditioned media (approximately 450 mL) from serum-free cell cultures were cooled down on ice, centrifuged (200x<italic>g</italic>, 10 min), and passed through 0.2 Î¼m pore filters to remove cells, cell debris, and vesicles sized smaller than 220 nm. An inhibitor cocktail was added to protect the proteins from proteolytic digestion (PMSF and inhibitor cocktail complete Roche, Mannheim, Germany). Enrichment of exosomes was accomplished by subsequent ultrafiltration with Amicon Ultra 100K (4000x<italic>g</italic>, 25 min, 4Â°C), followed by ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g for 90 min at 4Â°C. The exosome pellet was washed in PBS followed by another ultracentrifugation at 120,000 g for 90 min at 4Â°C. The final exosome pellet was resuspended in PBS and validated by characterization via mass spectrometry analysis of proteins, western blot analysis, electron microscopy analysis (TEM), and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">LÃ¶tvall et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Witwer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">ThÃ©ry et al., 2018</xref>). Each exosome pellet, after final resuspension into PBS, was divided into 5 Âµl aliquots, stored at â80Â°C, and thawed right before use. The protein concentration of the exosome fraction was measured after each exosome isolation using CBQCA protein quantitation kit (Invitrogen). Exosomes were used in the cell transformation assay experiments at a concentration of 80 ng/mL (equivalent to 7 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> particles/mL) based on dose response studies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-1-2"><title>Sucrose gradient separation</title><p>In addition to the exosome isolation protocol described above, exosomes were further purified using floatation into a sucrose density gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chiou and Ansel, 2016</xref>). In detail, sucrose gradients were built manually as described in reference five by first preparing 12 sucrose stock fractions in PBS with sucrose concentrations ranging from 10â90%. Half of the exosome pellet from the isolation protocol described above was resuspended in 50 Âµl PBS with 1 ml of 90% sucrose stock solution and loaded at the bottom of a 13.2 mL ultra-clear Beckman ultracentrifuge tube. The gradient was layered by sequentially pouring 1 mL of each of the remaining 11 solutions in order from highest to lowest sucrose concentration. Tubes were centrifuged for 16 hr at 4Â°C at 100,000 g (24200 rpm) in a TH-641 rotor. At completion, six 2 mL fractions were collected from each of the tubes. Next, 9 mL of PBS was added to each of the 2 mL fractions and centrifuged at 4Â°C at 100,000 g for 1 hr. The supernatant was carefully aspirated before the pellet was resuspended in 50 Âµl of PBS and validated by mass spectrometry, western blot, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA). The protein concentration of the fractions was measured using CBQCA protein quantitation kit (Invitrogen).

In brief, cells were suspended in HNMEK lysis buffer (20 mM HEPES pH 7.4, 50 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM EDTA, 10 mM KCl, 50 nM EGTA, protease inhibitors) and lysed using a Dounce homogenizer. Lysates were centrifuged at 500 g for 10 min at 4<bold>Â°</bold>C to remove nuclei and cellular debris. The supernatant was collected and centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min to pellet ER and mitochondrial membranes (P2 fraction). Cytoplasmic S2 fraction was collected and kept for further analysis. P2 fraction was washed once in HNMEK lysis buffer, centrifuged at 10,000 g for 10 min, and the pellet was resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 8, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA pH8, 1% Nonidet P-40, 0.5% deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 1 mM PMSF, protease inhibitors). Protein concentration was measured from each fraction using the Bradford Protein assay (Bio-Rad).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-1-4"><title>TCA precipitation</title><p>The last fraction collected from the exosome isolation procedure was the flow through media (M). This flow through consists of 20% starting conditioned media after the ultrafiltration step, and was kept for deoxycholate-trichloroacetic acid precipitation (DOC-TCA) of the proteins. This medium represents a sample that should not contain any exosomal proteins when analyzed for exosome markers using western blot analysis. In brief, 0.15% DOC was added to media samples (1:10 ratio) and incubated on ice for 15 min followed by addition of TCA to 8% final concentration and incubated overnight at 4Â°C. Precipitated proteins were pelleted by centrifuging at 18,000 rpm and washed twice with cold acetone, prior to reâsuspension in 10 mM TrisâHCl pHÂ =Â 8.0.

In detail, the frozen stock of NIH/3T3 cells were thawed and cultured. Actively growing cells with passage numberÂ &lt;4 were seeded for the transformation assay at a density of 2.5 Ã 10<sup>3</sup> cells/well in a 6-well plate with 2 mL of culture medium. Two days after seeding, media was replaced with media containing an <italic>initiator</italic>, either MCA (0.5 Âµg/mL), exosomes (80 ng/mL), or 0.02% DMSO, and cells were grown for 3 days.

Cultures were then treated with a medium containing a <italic>promoter</italic>, either TPA (300 ng/mL), exosomes (80 ng/mL), CdCl<sub>2</sub> (120 ng/mL), or 0.2% DMSO, for 2 weeks. The cells were subsequently cultured in normal medium for 3 weeks. The medium was changed every other day during the <italic>promoter</italic> treatments and twice a week for the last 3 weeks of the experiment. The cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet for focus scoring. Each test chemical was dissolved in DMSO. The concentration of vehicle was below 0.2%, which did not affect the induction of transformed foci.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Foci scoring</title><p>The scoring of transformed foci was carried out according to established criteria on focus scoring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2012</xref>). Different categories of foci that can be observed are Type I, Type II, and Type III. Only Type III foci are scored as malignantly transformed and were counted as positive in this study. Foci were assessed for the following characteristics: deep basophilic staining, spindle-shaped cells, multilayer growth (piling up of cells), random orientation at the edge of the focus, and invasive growth into the background monolayer; each characteristic needed to be present for Type III classification. To ensure accurate scoring, foci scoring was performed in a double-blinded manner by two researchers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Tumorigenicity of transformed cells</title><p>All animals were housed in a pathogen-free facility with 24 hr access to food and water.

Six-to-8-week-old female NOD/SCID mice were obtained from an on-campus supplier.</p><p>At the end of the transformation experiment, prior to methanol fixation and staining with crystal violet, MCA/TPA-treated and cancer cell exosome/TPA-treated cells that had formed type III foci were isolated, expanded, and established as a transformed cell line. To assess their tumorigenic property, cells were injected subcutaneously into mice. To determine the sufficient cell density for tumor formation, cells were first isolated from MCA/TPA-treated and Capan-2 exosome (ExC)/TPA-treated experiments and injected into mice at three different cell concentrations (0.1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>, 0.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup>, and 2.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells). Untreated NIH/3T3 cells were injected into mice as a control at the highest concentration used (2.5 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells). Every group consisted of nÂ =Â 5 mice. Mice were observed for tumor formation by palpating twice a week and recording the weight of the mice and size of the tumor. The experiment was terminated 37 days post injection, when the tumor size in some of the animals had reached maximum allowable diameter. Histological analyses confirmed that the tumors are fibrosarcomas, as expected from the transformed cells of mesenchymal origin. Additional in vivo experiments include subcutaneous injection of mice (nÂ =Â 5/group) with 1 Ã 10<sup>6</sup> cells isolated after treatment with MIA PaCa-2 (ExM)/TPA, Panc-1 (ExP)/TPA, or BxPC-3 (ExBx)/TPA as well as injection of three background foci formed from untreated NIH/3T3 cells.

Next, cells were treated with 40, 120, 240, or 360 ng/mL CdCl<sub>2</sub>, 3-wells/each concentration, for 10 days. Media was changed on day 5. The cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet for counting the number of colonies. Only colonies comprisingÂ &gt;50 cells were scored. Relative colony formation efficiency was calculated as (%) = (number of test colonies/number of control colonies) x 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fang et al., 2001</xref>). At the two highest concentrations (240, 360 ng/mL) colony formation was reduced to 4% when compared to control, untreated cells. At 120 ng/mL colony formation was inhibited by 50% and cell viability maintained above 89%. The lowest concentration, 40 ng/mL, did not have any effect on the colony formation efficiency when compared to control colony formation. The highest CdCl<sub>2</sub> concentration to inhibit colony formation by 50% while retaining cell viability was 120 ng/mL and was therefore used in cell transformation assays.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Dose response studies</title><p>Dose response experiments were performed to determine a suitable concentration of exosomes for use as an <italic>initiator</italic> in cell transformation assays. Protein concentration was used as a normalization strategy. Transformation assays with different protein concentrations of exosomes were repeated twice to confirm reproducibility.

At the end of the cell transformation assay, cells were fixed with methanol and stained with crystal violet. Focus scoring were performed according to the method described in section 1.3. Equal transformation induction activity was observed for all concentrations except the two lowest ones, 0.08 ng/mL and 0.8 ng/mL. A standard concentration of 80 ng/mL (equivalent to 7 Ã 10<sup>7</sup> particles/mL) of proteins were used in each transformation assay.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-4"><title>Statistical analysis of foci scoring</title><p>Statistical analysis of foci scoring was performed by two-tailed unpaired t test with Welch's correction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-5"><title>Proteomic analysis by mass spectrometry</title><p>Sample preparation for mass spectrometry analysis included the excision of proteins from polyacrylamide gels via SDS-PAGE and Coomassie blue dye staining. Protein samples were reduced and alkylated using DTT and iodoacetamide, respectively. Samples were digested overnight using trypsin (37Â°C) and resulting peptides were de-salted using solid phase extraction (SPE). LC-MS/MS experiments were performed on a Thermo Scientific EASY-nLC 1200 liquid chromatography system coupled to a Thermo Scientific Orbitrap Fusion Lumos mass spectrometer. To generate MS/MS spectra, MS1 spectra were first acquired in the Orbitrap mass analyzer (resolution 120,000). Peptide precursor ions were then isolated and fragmented using high-energy collision-induced dissociation (HCD). The resulting MS/MS fragmentation spectra were acquired in the ion trap. MS/MS spectral data from exosome samples was searched using Proteome Discoverer 2.1 software (Thermo Scientific) against entries included in either the Human Uniprot protein database (173,060 entries) (exosome samples) or the Mus musculus (Mouse) Uniprot protein database (86,520 entries) (NIH/3T3 cell samples). Search parameters included Carbamidomethylation of cysteine residues (+57.021 Da) as a static modification and oxidation of methionine (+15.995 Da) and acetylation of peptide N-termini (+42.011 Da) as dynamic modifications. The precursor ion mass tolerance was set to 10 ppm and the product ion mass tolerance was set to 0.6 Da for all searches. Peptide spectral matches were adjusted to a 1% false discovery rate (FDR) and proteins were filtered to a 1% FDR.</p><p>For exosome samples, only a single run was analyzed for the presence of exosomal marker proteins.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jeffrey Settleman as the Senior Editor, with additional comment by Randy Schekman (Editor-in-Chief). The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing Editor has highlighted the concerns that require revision and/or responses, and we have included the separate reviews below for your consideration. If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors provide evidence that exosomes derived from pancreatic cancer cells can act as initiators of tumorigenesis. The primary evidence for this comes from a transformation assay in NIH 3T3 cells. This work adds to the growing body of evidence that exosomes can make major contributions to overall tumorigenic phenotypes.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>There were several major and significant concerns raised by the reviewers. They are outlined in detail below, but in general there were serious reservations about the informatic analysis and how it was performed, and a concern as to whether the mismatch repair interpretation is robust. More importantly, even if the informatics is corrected, there is no mechanistic insight into how these defects in mismatch repair occur, or even the necessity/sufficiency of this pathway.</p><p>After the review was completed, the Editor-in-Chief expressed additional concerns about the conclusions as drawn on the basis of experiments with a crude fraction of particulate material from conditioned medium:</p><p>Your claims are based on the use of &quot;exosomes&quot; as defined by what you refer to as established protocols for their isolation. Unfortunately, the standards in the field are inadequate and fail to account for many decades of experience in the fractionation of membrane organelles (please see Shurtleff et al., Annual Reviews of Cancer Biology, 2018). The crude particulate fraction obtained by filtration and differential centrifugation of conditioned medium contains other material including contaminating membranes and nonmembranous particles such as large RNPs. Thus, without further fractionation of the relevant sedimentable species, whether membranous or not, your conclusions about the roe of exosomes in the initiation of tumorigenesis will remain suspect.</p><p>As you are aware, in this <italic>eLife</italic> trial, we are committed to eventually publishing the paper if you are able to address these issues fully. However, given the extent of what the reviewers are requesting to make the manuscript suitable for <italic>eLife</italic>, you may want to consider withdrawing this work for further investigation. This is your decision, but please let us know your thoughts in either case.</p><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Stefanius et al. reports that exosomes from a tumor cell line can initiate the process of malignant transformation in NIH-3T3 cells, which is a non-malignant stromal cell line. The authors have used exosomes from 4 pancreatic cancer cell lines as well as non-malignant immortalized pancreatic cells as an initiator in the classical cell transformation assay. The authors report that exosomes from malignant cells but not normal cells can act as initiators of cell transformation in the presence of different promoters. In addition, the exosome-transformed cells can form tumors in immunocompromised mice which histologically resemble tumors of mesenchymal origin. Further, the authors perform proteomic and exome profiling on the exosome transformed cells and observe clear differences in the protein profiles of exosome-transformed NIH-3T3 cells when compared to normal cells.</p><p>Overall, the data in Figure 1 represent an interesting finding that is not too distant from other similar findings in the exosome field, which have demonstrated that exosomes can be oncogenic in certain situations. However, the larger concern here is two fold. First, I am not convinced that the data and interpretation in Figures 2 and 3 are correct, and may be misleading for the field. Second, without a clear mechanism by which the exosomes do this, it is in the realm of phenomenology and therefore not immediately generalizable outside of this one system. This manuscript would need extensive reworking and many additional experiments to make it appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the authors isolate foci from either MCA/TPA or ExC/TpA and then show that these grow in mice. However, they then compare this to parental 3T3 cells. This is not as useful a control since it is possible that the 3T3 culture contains cells capable of giving rise to tumors, and that what the exosomes did was select for that population. Thus, since the 3T3 cells do form foci (albeit at a smaller rate, as shown in Figure 1C) those should be the proper control, and would allow us to determine if exosome treatment is absolutely essential for tumor formation. In this model, the exosomes are not really initiators in the classic sense of the word, but instead just acting as a selection force.</p><p>2) It is unclear whether exosomes from normal pancreatic cells also have tumorigenic potential. In Figure 1C, you show that they give rise to foci at a similar rate to the DMSO control but these are never tested in the mice. This is important for the reasons related above, in that it is not clear whether the cancer cell exosome, per se, is required for tumor initiation rather than selecting for a pre-existing cell in the population.</p><p>3) The use of the 3T3 assay, while interesting and informative, does not tell us much about how general this phenomenon is. It is essential that the authors utilize other cells to tell us how unique this situation is to the 3T3. For example, they could use normal pancreas cells as well as other normal cell lines such as additional fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, etc.</p><p>4) The proteomic analysis of the foci is not especially informative. The authors state that the wide variation across the samples is due to &quot;random molecular changes across the population of treated NIH/3T3 cells&quot;. However, there is no evidence that this is really the case, since widespread variation across the samples could be due to technical artifacts from the proteomic analysis itself. How do you control for this possibility in this analysis? Moreover, the authors state &quot;As expected the NIH/3T3 cells left untreated show no marked global changes in protein contentâ¦&quot; yet then state that there were significant changes in the foci analysis. But how do you define what &quot;marked&quot; is in one context and not another in a way that is statistically rigorous? In its current form, I am not convinced this analysis is correct.</p><p>In addition, an important control experiment would be to perform the proteomic analysis on the tumors that emerged from the mice instead, since conceivably these might have more of a convergent profile that allows them to grow in the animal. In either case, it is difficult to understand how you can definitively state this is due to random effects of the exosomes without much larger numbers of samples and/or additional proteomic controls to eliminate technical artifacts.</p><p>5) In Figure 3B, the number of identified variants (more than 12,000) in each of those samples seems extraordinarily high. Were this rate of genomic alteration seen in the rest of the genome, assuming it is random mutation as the authors postulate, that would indicate that genome wide there would be nearly 600,000 mutations (i.e. if 12,000 mutations are seen in the 2% of the genome that is exonic, then one would expect 50X this number genome wide). This would be extraordinary even for highly mutated cancer such as melanoma. My expectation is that with proper stringency measures and false discovery correction, along with greater number of samples, this number of mutations would be markedly reduced.</p><p>Moreover, the authors provide no details about their use of the PLINK algorithm to cluster mutation profiles, calling into question how robust this segregation really is. This is especially concerning given the extremely high mutation burden they are seeing, which can make the interpretation of that data very problematic.</p><p>6) The interpretation that the exonic changes they are seeing is due to mismatch repair, as outlined in Figure 3 and Table 1, is not convincing. With a mutation rate this high, as outlined before, by random chance the likelihood of seeing a mutation in a mismatch repair gene is extremely high. In no way does this suggest that the mutation profile they are seeing is due to mismatch repair â the correlation is just not strong enough. The authors would absolutely have to restore mismatch repair proteins (i.e. overexpress it in the exosome treated cells) and demonstrate that this eliminates: 1) the foci formation, 2) mouse tumorigenicity, and 3) sequencing results. Otherwise, without this data, the assumption that exosomes induce random mutations via defects in mismatch repair may not be correct, and could lead the field astray.</p><p>7) Finally, the authors posit that some factor from the exosomes is inducing this initiator effect, presumably via changes in mismatch repair or possibly other mechanisms. However, no attempt to identify the mechanism for this effect is made â is it protein, mRNA, RNA, lipid, other? Although I recognize that the identification of the exosome component mediating this effect is a major challenge, without this information it is difficult to really determine the overall importance of these effects. This is an essential experiment, and likely to have major impacts on the interpretation of how exosomes act to induce oncogenic changes in nearby cells.</p><p>Additional data files and statistical comments:</p><p>The proteomic and exonic analysis is not convincing in its current form.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The manuscript by Stefanius and colleagues provides further evidence that cancer cell derived exosomes can initiate events that can lead to the transformation of NIH3T3 cells. Exosomes from cancer cells irrespective of the Kras mutation status can act as initiators that prime the promotors to transform cells and enable tumor formation by the NIH3T3 cells. This is an interesting paper but it is unclear as to its novelty and innovation as presented. The study has potential. Some comments are provided below.</p><p>1) While the use of MCA and TPA has been around for a while, it is not clear what the in vivo relevance is at this point. It would more relevant to use nonchemical promoters not generally found in human tissue. This should be attempted. Would the exosomes initiate NIH3T3 cells if they are injected into mice with their pancreas primed using relevant genetic promoters, and induce tumor formation? Such experiments would move the field forward. The basic discovery that exosomes can induce transformation of cells without such promoting agents (TPA) has been published and should be cited. Some studies actually use serum exosomes from cancer patients to illustrate their ability to induce tumor formation by cells.</p><p>http://www.pnas.org/content/108/12/4852/</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446899/</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28854931/</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179759/</p><p>2) It is unclear why foci were used to induce tumors versus the cells by themselves after the exosomes mediated initiation and TPA induced promotion. This should be addressed.</p><p>3) The amount of exosomes used is not clear and whether it represents physiologically relevant concentrations. What does 80ng/mL represent in particle number? Also, it is critical to perform dose response experiments in this setting.</p><p>4) The exclusive use of NIH3T3 limits the implication of the study. These are transformed cells. This study could include use of other cells of different lineages and just fibroblasts. The use of primary cells would make it relevant to human cancers.</p><p>5) More control lines others than just HPDE would make the observations more interesting.</p><p>6) Mechanistic insights are minimal in this study considering what has already been published. Important questions remain such as are exosomes initiating the purported events, and why is the identification of the mediators important. Why is the DNA damage and mismatched events induced, and why are these similar to MCA need a more experimental explanation. Gain of function and loss of function experiments are important.</p><p>7) The fact that the tumors did not identify any changes is interesting and needs to be further addressed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>This is a potentially interesting study that clearly shows that (1) Cancer-derived exosomes effectively initiate malignant transformation in mouse NIH3T3 cells in vitro; (2) The transformed NIH3T3 cells (capable of foci formation) form subQ fibrosarcomas; and (3) not unexpectedly, exosome-induced tumor initiation is related to defective DNA repair, however, the repair defects are random (not caused by one specific exosome-associated oncogene).</p><p>The manuscript is well executed, and provides multiple controls, such as additional promoters, transposition of initiator and promoter in two-step carcinogenesis assay, etcetera. However, the study its limited to investigation of NH3T3 transformation and these cells are notoriously easy to transform. Also, the biological relevance of the study is somewhat questionable and critical issues remain unresolved.</p><p>First, could a similar process occur in vivo, in mice or humans? If so, an individual with a primary pancreatic tumor should have a higher propensity to form other primary tumor(s). Is that the case? Do such individuals have a chance of exposure to promoters? Second, could this phenomenon be extended to other tumor types (not PDAC)? And last, would exosome-initiated tumors be exclusively fibrosarcomas? Other tumor types? Random tumors? Would PDAC exosomes act as tumor initiating agent in pancreatic epithelium?</p><p>These questions could be answered only by using PDAC exosomes in a classical two-step carcinogenesis assay, as opposed to in vitro transformation assay followed by tumorigenesis assay. Similar experiments demonstrating transformation events due to the transfer of exosomes' contents to the bystander cells have already been performed using exposures isolated from the tumor cell lines or from the sera of cancer patients (please see reference below). Most of these experiment are performed as a one step process, which also contradicts the conclusions from the present analysis.</p><p>Finally, the potential ability of exosomes to promote tumor growth by virtue of transforming host cells could be tested using fluorescent mice (GFP, RFP etc) as donors or acceptors of exosome-producing NIH-3T3 cells. The appearance of fluorescence tagged cells in a non-tagged exotic tumor formed by exosome-transformed NIH-3T3 cells, whose origin could be ascertained using other fluorescent makers would clearly ascertain such recruitment.</p><p>Regrettably, this potentially interesting study is insufficiently novel to be published in <italic>eLife</italic> in its present form, given limited scope of analyses performed and potential low relevance of the results.</p><p>In favor of the potential relevance of this study, 18% of co-occurring IPMN and ductal adenocarcinomas were likely independent, suggesting that the carcinoma arose from an independent precursor. By contrast, all colloid carcinomas were likely related to their associated IPMNs. However, to link this process to exosome-dependent tumor initiation, one has to analyze exosomes from patients from IPMNs and their potential capacity to induce pancreatic tumors. (Felsenstein et al). However, the present study is extremely preliminary in nature and does not unequivocally address such a possibility. Further experiments are needed to demonstrate the tumor-initiating capacity of exosomes from the neoplastic foci.</p><p>https://www.nature.com/articles/s41419-018-0485-1.pdf (Daie et all, Cell Death and Disease (2018)9:454); https://jeccr.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13046-017-0587-0 (Abdouh et al., Journal of Experimental &amp; Clinical Cancer Research (2017) 36:113);</p><p>http://www.pnas.org/content/108/12/4852 (Antonyak et al., 2011.

As you are aware, in this <italic>eLife</italic> trial we are committed to ultimately publishing the paper should you choose to proceed with it. However, all of the reviewer and editorial concerns about the validity of these findings will be published in parallel with the paper.</p><p>There remain several major areas of concern:</p><p>1) The methods used to isolate the exosomes.</p><p>Randy Schekman specifically commented upon the new data as follows:</p><p>&quot;I have examined the additional data relevant to the concern I raised about the crude fraction they use to claim an exosome activity. As far as I can tell this consists of one data point with a peak fraction of buoyant membranes assayed at one concentration. This would not pass muster by any standard biochemical analysis. I recommend assays across the peak fraction of exosomal marker proteins and a quantitative titration of activity vs. protein concentration in the peak fraction in comparison to the crude starting material. The expectation is that if this activity tracks with exosomes, the specific activity in their biological assay should have been enriched by the buoyant density separation. Without this it is premature to conclude that the activity is associated with exosomes.&quot;</p><p>2) The notion that exosomes are initiators.</p><p>Several of the reviewers raised concerns about using 3T3 cells as the sole evidence of initiation activity. This was not addressed experimentally, but instead the authors state that &quot;It will be very interesting to test this function in other cell types, and will be done in future studies.&quot; Despite this being a major concern, this is still left unaddressed.</p><p>Why this is important is related to the new data in Figure 3B, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, they show that the background foci actually do form tumors, albeit at a slower rate and with lower efficiency than the exosome treated 3T3 foci. But the fact that the background foci do indeed form tumors actually argues against a pure initiator activity â it seems to accelerate what is already happening in the background foci anyway. Thus, a central argument that these exosomes are true initiators does not seem fully accurate. In the absence of other cell types other than 3T3s, it is hard to state this definitively outside of this one context.</p><p>3) The proteomic analysis.</p><p>While the authors make it clear how they performed the analysis, it is still confusing to state &quot;However, proteins found in transformed cells shown in Figure 4 exhibit more divergence from control cells&quot; Divergence based on what statistical measure? Venn diagrams are not statistical methods, and it is not clear that the PANTHER data shows true statistical enrichment in the exosome treated cells.</p><p>4) Exome analysis.</p><p>In the rebuttal, the authors state that &quot;we feel confident that the method we used is sufficient to obtain reliable results&quot;. Yet the request to analyze this data with additional pipelines and more stringent statistics was not performed. There is no orthogonal validation of this pipeline to ensure that the results are accurate.</p><p>In looking at their more detailed methods, it is now clear that they are comparing their exomes to the human reference genomes (GRCm38), so that the variants being called are actually just variants that differ from this reference genome, and not the parental 3T3 cells. How do you know that most of the called variants are not just called SNPs or baseline point mutations between 3T3 cells and the human reference genome? Why not compare the exome data to the parental 3T3 cells rather than the human reference genome?</p><p>The authors now provide additional data, using the same pipelines, on bulk exome data on both untreated and TPA treated foci in Figures 5 and 6. In Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, they essentially show that the number of mutations in the untreated or TPA treated cells is similar to that in the MCA/TPA or ExC/TPA foci. But if the basic idea is that exosomes act as initiators through increases in mutation rate, then why are the number of mutations essentially the same. Furthermore, in the data in Figure 6, you show that the signature 20 is higher in the MCA/TPA or ExC/TPA samples compared to untreated/TPA, but this just looks like a modest increase, and there is no statistical analysis to say whether these are really different. How do you confirm that you are really enriching for this signature in this dataset other than a heatmap which looks to be so.</p><p>Finally, it is not clear that bulk sequencing of this population of highly mutated cells is appropriate. If we consider that each cell could have many different mutations, the more appropriate experiment is to create single cell clones out of the transformed foci, let that grow up, and then perform the exome analysis on these isolated clones. While this is an expensive and ultimately very time consuming method, it would ultimately be much more informative in understanding how the mutations occur in each cell, rather than a population of cells which may or may not have defects is mismatch repair.</p><p>5) The role of mismatch repair.</p><p>While we recognize that adding in single mismatch repair genes may not rescue the phenotypes, at the same time the authors are making a very bold claim that exosomes specifically lead to MMR defects. This is perhaps the most intriguing idea in the paper, but without any experiments to mechanistically dissect this it remains correlative.</p><p><italic>Evaluation of the paper after the second round of revision:</italic></p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have tried to address several of the issues brought up during the review process. As part of this trial, we will proceed with publication of the manuscript although we do feel several issues remain unresolved that could have further strengthened the paper.</p><p>First, Dr Schekman raised a point that dose response relationships comparing the more purified exosomes with the crude starting material would be required to establish that the buoyant density gradient achieved purification of the active vesicle species. The single concentration of the gradient fraction used in the new version of the paper fails to establish meaningful purification.</p><p>Second, while we agree that the 3T3 assay is a standard initiator assay, the development of other assays to confirm this potentially new and important function of exosomes would have provided significant confidence that this is a generalizable activity.</p><p>Third, the authors have used one informatic pipeline for their analysis, whereas adding in additional and complementary pipelines for mutation calling (i.e MuTect, etc) would have provided increased confidence that these are reproducible results from an informatic standpoint. Analysis of single cell clones from the transformed cells would have also given a more fine-grained analysis of the mutational pattern induced via exosomes, which cannot be achieved by bulk sequencing alone.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.40226.032</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>There were several major and significant concerns raised by the reviewers. They are outlined in detail below, but in general there were serious reservations about the informatic analysis and how it was performed, and a concern as to whether the mismatch repair interpretation is robust.

Text has been added to explain the informatic analysis to assure the reviewers that there is rigor in all methods used for our conclusions. Additionally, the informatics analysis, particularly the exome sequencing data, has been expanded upon as described in detail below. As mentioned in the title, summation, and manuscript, we have identified, for the first time, that cancer cell exosomes can act as classic initiators in the cell transformation. Our studies provide molecular mechanistic insight by demonstrating that cancer cell exosomes, like other classic chemical initiators, induce random mutations into cells. Cells from this pool of randomly mutated cells can then be driven to transformation by a classic promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>After the review was completed, the Editor-in-Chief expressed additional concerns about the conclusions as drawn on the basis of experiments with a crude fraction of particulate material from conditioned medium:</p><p>Your claims are based on the use of &quot;exosomes&quot; as defined by what you refer to as established protocols for their isolation. Unfortunately, the standards in the field are inadequate and fail to account for many decades of experience in the fractionation of membrane organelles (please see Shurtleff et al., Annual Reviews of Cancer Biology, 2018). The crude particulate fraction obtained by filtration and differential centrifugation of conditioned medium contains other material including contaminating membranes and nonmembranous particles such as large RNPs. Thus, without further fractionation of the relevant sedimentable species, whether membranous or not, your conclusions about the roe of exosomes in the initiation of tumorigenesis will remain suspect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that one of the current challenges in the exosome field is the lack of a universally accepted purification method. Discussion surrounding this and the current standards used to validate exosome isolation is included in the text. Exosomes were characterized according to guidelines laid out in the Minimal Information for Studies of Extracellular Vesicles (MISEV2018). Additionally, in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B, we show that further fractionation by sucrose density gradient does not change the transformation potential of cancer cell exosomes.</p><p>Discussion section:</p><p>âTo eliminate the possibility that contaminants might participate in the exosome initiator activity, we further purified the exosomes using a sucrose density gradient in order to obtain âpureâ exosome fractions (32). Identical experiments with both populations of exosomes demonstrated that both samples could act as an initiator in the CTA, thereby establishing exosomes as the initiating factor in this assay (Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Separate reviews (please respond to each point):</p></disp-quote><p>Reviewer #1:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[â¦] Overall, the data in Figure 1 represent an interesting finding that is not too distant from other similar findings in the exosome field, which have demonstrated that exosomes can be oncogenic in certain situations. However, the larger concern here is two fold. First, I am not convinced that the data and interpretation in Figures 2 and 3 are correct, and may be misleading for the field. Second, without a clear mechanism by which the exosomes do this, it is in the realm of phenomenology and therefore not immediately generalizable outside of this one system. This manuscript would need extensive reworking and many additional experiments to make it appropriate for eLife.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the authors isolate foci from either MCA/TPA or ExC/TpA and then show that these grow in mice. However, they then compare this to parental 3T3 cells. This is not as useful a control since it is possible that the 3T3 culture contains cells capable of giving rise to tumors, and that what the exosomes did was select for that population. Thus, since the 3T3 cells do form foci (albeit at a smaller rate, as shown in Figure 1C) those should be the proper control, and would allow us to determine if exosome treatment is absolutely essential for tumor formation. In this model, the exosomes are not really initiators in the classic sense of the word, but instead just acting as a selection force.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we performed in vivo experiments using background foci from untreated NIH/3T3 cells. Three independent background foci from different wells were isolated, expanded, and injected into NSG (NOD scid Î³) mice (n=5).</p><p>Subsection âIn vivo studies confirm the fully transformed state of cancer cell exosome-initiated cellsâ:</p><p>âAfter injection of untreated background foci, we observed that six out of 15 total mice formed tumors. Notably, each of the six tumors (5 from the same injected foci) grew later in the time course and at a significantly slower rate compared to initiator-promoter treated transformed foci cells (Figure 3B, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) It is unclear whether exosomes from normal pancreatic cells also have tumorigenic potential. In Figure 1C, you show that they give rise to foci at a similar rate to the DMSO control but these are never tested in the mice. This is important for the reasons related above, in that it is not clear whether the cancer cell exosome, per se, is required for tumor initiation rather than selecting for a pre-existing cell in the population.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification of all cell transformation assays shown in Figure 2 and Figure 2âfigure supplement 1 consistently show that a uniform level of background foci are formed in all control experiments. This is likely due to the nature of NIH/3T3 cells, as it has been shown that when NIH/3T3 cells are maintained as confluent, non-growing cultures without passage, or injected into mice in high concentrations, they may undergo spontaneous cell transformation (1). Therefore, when stringent focus scoring is carried out according to established criteria (Materials and methods), a constant level of background foci are observed in each experiment. Only in experiments where cells were treated with a functional initiator and promoter, did we observe a significant increase in transformation, resulting in formation of an additional 3 to 4 foci per well. This is why background foci from untreated cells were injected into mice as a control to assess the tumor forming potential of these background foci, as described above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The use of the 3T3 assay, while interesting and informative, does not tell us much about how general this phenomenon is. It is essential that the authors utilize other cells to tell us how unique this situation is to the 3T3. For example, they could use normal pancreas cells as well as other normal cell lines such as additional fibroblasts, mesenchymal stem cells, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>Explanation and reasoning behind our use of the classic 2-stage cell transformation assay was added to the Introduction section:</p><p>âMalignant transformation of a normal cell occurs in a stepwise fashion. Point mutations in the genome can result in the reprogramming of a normal cell to a less differentiated state that is receptive to additional genetic alterations resulting in uncontrolled growth and ultimately cancer. The classic 2-stage in vitro cell transformation assay (CTA) is a tiered system for transformation that was created for screening potential carcinogenic factors (21-23). In this system, cells are first treated with a suspected carcinogen, called an initiator, such as the genotoxic carcinogen 3-MCA (3-methylcholanthrene). 3-MCA introduces random genetic changes in a pool of normal cells. Subsequently, these initiated cells are exposed to a promoter, such as TPA (12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol 13-acetate), which enhances proliferation in the initiated cells selectively, thus driving malignant transformation of the cells. The resulting transformed cells are observed as foci on a cell culture plate (23, 24). This reductionist approach provides sensitivity in detecting a wider range of initiating agents that may not show obvious transforming activity without a promoter (23). Using this assay as a model system for malignant cell transformation, we assessed whether or not cancer cell-derived exosomes could affect and/or potentially drive the transformation of a normal cell. The results presented herein provide a detailed analysis of a previously unidentified molecular function of cancer cell exosomes for malignant cell transformation.â</p><p>It will be very interesting to test this function in other cell types, and will be done in future studies. As the optimization for another assay (2-3 months/assay condition) to be equally reliable as the CTA with 3T3-cells will require over a year, we think this experiment is beyond the scope of this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The proteomic analysis of the foci is not especially informative. The authors state that the wide variation across the samples is due to &quot;random molecular changes across the population of treated NIH/3T3 cells&quot;. However, there is no evidence that this is really the case, since widespread variation across the samples could be due to technical artifacts from the proteomic analysis itself. How do you control for this possibility in this analysis? Moreover, the authors state &quot;As expected the NIH/3T3 cells left untreated show no marked global changes in protein contentâ¦&quot; yet then state that there were significant changes in the foci analysis. But how do you define what &quot;marked&quot; is in one context and not another in a way that is statistically rigorous? In its current form, I am not convinced this analysis is correct.</p></disp-quote><p>Specific details pertaining to how the proteomic analysis (Figure 4 and Figure 4âfigure supplement 1) are discussed in detail in Materials and methods. Samples were analyzed using a common LC-MS/MS method and appropriate steps were taken to ensure accuracy of results and avoid potential âtechnical artifacts,â including proper sample prep, instrument calibration, n=3 replicates, PSM filtering &lt;0.01, protein filtering &lt;0.01, etc. The assessment that âno marked global changes in protein content were observed for [initiated] cells treated with MCA or Capan-2 exosomes when compared to proteins found in untreated NIH/3T3 cellsâ is based on analysis showing that 80% of the total proteins found (2287/2859) were identified in all three conditions, while only 9.7% of the total proteins found (276/2859) were identified in only a single condition (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1). However, proteins found in transformed cells shown in Figure 4 exhibit more divergence from control cells. We have altered the presentation of data in Figure 4 to highlight that the differences in protein content between foci result primarily from the contributions of âunique proteinsâ that are not found in the control cells. To probe these differences further, we performed Gene Ontology enrichment analysis on the proteins found exclusively in transformed foci (Figure 4D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, an important control experiment would be to perform the proteomic analysis on the tumors that emerged from the mice instead, since conceivably these might have more of a convergent profile that allows them to grow in the animal. In either case, it is difficult to understand how you can definitively state this is due to random effects of the exosomes without much larger numbers of samples and/or additional proteomic controls to eliminate technical artifacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that performing proteomic analysis of the tumors that emerged from mice would be an interesting experiment, however we believe it is beyond the scope of this paper. We were primarily interested in determining if any changes could be detected at the protein level as a direct result of either treatment with an initiator for three days or formation of foci from cell transformation. Since we were working in the context of NIH/3T3 cells, each treatment condition could then be compared to background proteins present in untreated NIH/3T3 cells as a control. Additionally, we have changed the language in the text to clarify that we cannot directly attribute changes observed in protein content of transformed foci to random effects of the exosome treatment. We can only compare the protein profiles of NIH/3T3 cells directly after initiation treatment to those of cells after they have transformed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 3B, the number of identified variants (more than 12,000) in each of those samples seems extraordinarily high. Were this rate of genomic alteration seen in the rest of the genome, assuming it is random mutation as the authors postulate, that would indicate that genome wide there would be nearly 600,000 mutations (i.e. if 12,000 mutations are seen in the 2% of the genome that is exonic, then one would expect 50X this number genome wide). This would be extraordinary even for highly mutated cancer such as melanoma. My expectation is that with proper stringency measures and false discovery correction, along with greater number of samples, this number of mutations would be markedly reduced.</p><p>Moreover, the authors provide no details about their use of the PLINK algorithm to cluster mutation profiles, calling into question how robust this segregation really is. This is especially concerning given the extremely high mutation burden they are seeing, which can make the interpretation of that data very problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>First, we expanded the Materials and methods section 2.6 on exome sequencing analysis to provide more detailed description about our strategy to analyze data obtained during exome sequencing and how all bioinformatics was performed by collaborators and bioinformatic experts, Min S. Kim and Venkat Malladi. We do acknowledge that more stringent criteria (read depth of DP higher than 10) and use of additional programs together with Strelka2 and combining results to obtain consensus from different variant callers could reduce the number of identified variants, but we feel confident that the method we used is sufficient to obtain reliable results.</p><p>Second, we do agree with the reviewerâs math, when it pertains to cells not carrying any mutations in genes that would lead to genetic instability at the nucleotide level. In this situation, each round of cell division would not result in an extreme number of new mutations. Based on COSMIC signatures we know that mismatch repair dysfunction is contributing to mutational burden of transformed cells from MCA/TPA and Capan-2/TPA foci leading to possibility where every cell division can amplify the number of mutations exponentially. When analyzing mismatch repair genes in more details, missense mutations were found to be encoded in each of the transformed foci supporting the finding of dysfunctional MMR system. We also see this signature in background foci, although not the top signature which in these cases was COSMIC Signature 3. This signature is associated with failure of DNA double-strand break-repair and would also contribute to a high mutation rate supporting the high number of variants found in all samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The interpretation that the exonic changes they are seeing is due to mismatch repair, as outlined in Figure 3 and Table 1, is not convincing. With a mutation rate this high, as outlined before, by random chance the likelihood of seeing a mutation in a mismatch repair gene is extremely high. In no way does this suggest that the mutation profile they are seeing is due to mismatch repair â the correlation is just not strong enough. The authors would absolutely have to restore mismatch repair proteins (i.e. overexpress it in the exosome treated cells) and demonstrate that this eliminates: 1) the foci formation, 2) mouse tumorigenicity, and 3) sequencing results.

Exosomes from cancer cells irrespective of the Kras mutation status can act as initiators that prime the promotors to transform cells and enable tumor formation by the NIH3T3 cells. This is an interesting paper but it is unclear as to its novelty and innovation as presented. The study has potential. Some comments are provided below.</p><p>1) While the use of MCA and TPA has been around for a while, it is not clear what the in vivo relevance is at this point. It would more relevant to use nonchemical promoters not generally found in human tissue. This should be attempted. Would the exosomes initiate NIH3T3 cells if they are injected into mice with their pancreas primed using relevant genetic promoters, and induce tumor formation? Such experiments would move the field forward. The basic discovery that exosomes can induce transformation of cells without such promoting agents (TPA) has been published and should be cited. Some studies actually use serum exosomes from cancer patients to illustrate their ability to induce tumor formation by cells.</p></disp-quote><p>http://www.pnas.org/content/108/12/4852 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446899/</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28854931/</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27179759/</p></disp-quote><p>Explanation and reasoning behind our use of the classic 2-stage cell transformation assay was added to the Introduction section:</p><p>âMalignant transformation of a normal cell occurs in a stepwise fashion.

Important questions remain such as are exosomes initiating the purported events, and why is the identification of the mediators important. Why is the DNA damage and mismatched events induced, and why are these similar to MCA need a more experimental explanation. Gain of function and loss of function experiments are important.</p></disp-quote><p>First, as mentioned in the title, summation and manuscript, we have identified, for the first time, that cancer cell exosomes can act as classic initiators in the cell transformation.

Our studies provide mechanistic insight by demonstrating that cancer cell exosomes, like other classic chemical initiators, induce random mutations into cells. Cells from this pool of randomly mutated cells can then be driven to transformation by a classic promoter.</p><p>Second, we also were surprised that MCA/TPA and Capan-2 exosome/TPA transformed foci have similar mutational signatures. To understand this better, we performed additional exome sequencing studies for three untreated background foci and three TPA- only treated background foci to learn whether the same mutational signature is seen in foci without any treatment or treatment with the TPA, as these were the two common factors (NIH-3T3 cells and TPA) with our previous samples. Our exosome analysis revealed that all of the sequenced background foci (6) had a similar mutagenic profile whereas none of the transformed foci encoded a similar mutagenic profile. These additional results show that mismatch repair is a main driver for mutations found in transformed cells and that the COSMIC signature associated with defective DNA mismatch repair is not the top signature found in the background foci. We discuss these findings in the Discussion:</p><p>âMoreover, even though all six transformed foci were derived from treatment with a common promoter (TPA), foci from TPA-only treated cells do not show the same mutational signatures as the initiator/promoter transformed foci. This supports a proposal that when TPA is used as a promoter, the molecular path towards tumorigenesis is not random, but rather TPA will drive a path using randomly mutated cells that accommodates a course towards a Cosmic 20 or 15 profile. Furthermore, future studies might reveal that another promoter acting on initiator treated cells might lead towards another common endpoint with regards to the 30 different mutagenic profiles.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The fact that the tumors did not identify any changes is interesting and needs to be further addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated in subsection âIn vivo studies confirm the fully transformed state of cancer cell exosome-initiated cellsâ:</p><p>âHistological analysis confirmed that the tumors are fibrosarcomas, as was expected because cells used in the CTA are NIH/3T3 cells from a mesenchymal origin (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D).â</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a potentially interesting study that clearly shows that (1) Cancer-derived exosomes effectively initiate malignant transformation in mouse NIH3T3 cells in vitro; (2) The transformed NIH3T3 cells (capable of foci formation) form subQ fibrosarcomas; and (3) not unexpectedly, exosome-induced tumor initiation is related to defective DNA repair, however, the repair defects are random (not caused by one specific exosome-associated oncogene).</p></disp-quote><p>The manuscript is well executed, and provides multiple controls, such as additional promoters, transposition of initiator and promoter in two-step carcinogenesis assay, etcetera.

As far as I can tell this consists of one data point with a peak fraction of buoyant membranes assayed at one concentration. This would not pass muster by any standard biochemical analysis. I recommend assays across the peak fraction of exosomal marker proteins and a quantitative titration of activity vs. protein concentration in the peak fraction in comparison to the crude starting material. The expectation is that if this activity tracks with exosomes, the specific activity in their biological assay should have been enriched by the buoyant density separation. Without this it is premature to conclude that the activity is associated with exosomes.â</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments previously requested by this editor in initial reviews were to perform âfurther fractionation of the relevant sedimentable speciesâ in order to ensure that exosomes were properly isolated and purified from contaminating material. To address this concern, exosomes were further purified on a sucrose density gradient and resulting fractions were blotted for common exosomal markers CD63 and Alix, using the protocol recommended by this editor. Exosome marker proteins were only found in fractions 3 and 4, consistent with previous results. Additionally, nanoparticle tracking analysis of âfraction 3â isolated exosomes clearly show enrichment in particles sized &lt;100nm compared to analysis of âcrudeâ exosomes. After protein concentration of the fractions was determined, Fraction 3 was tested in the cell transformation assay at a concentration of 80 ng/mL (or 7x10<sup>7</sup> particles/mL) to stay consistent with crude exosome assays. This concentration of exosomes was determined based on dose response studies already performed and described in the paper. When Fraction 3 exosomes were used as an âinitiator,â results in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B show that the average foci/well formed is comparable to results from crude exosomes.

This in vitro cell transformation assay (CTA) is proposed as an alternative to in vivo carcinogenicity testing. This assay is reported in the list of accepted methods for REACH (Reg. EC 440/2008). (<italic>1</italic>) Balb/c and NIH/3T3 cells are commonly used cell lines in the Cell Transformation Assay (CTA) and Focus Formation Assay (FFA) (<italic>2</italic>) which are assays that provide a straightforward method to assess the transforming potential of an oncogene or biological component. These assays represent the most well-known CTAs and are regarded as a reliable tool to screen biological components, single chemicals or mixtures for carcinogenicity prediction. In our experiments we used the two-stage cell transformation system which according to Sakai âis utilized for measuring tumor promoting activities and also for enhancing the sensitivity of cells to the weak initiators the standard assay is unable to detectâ (<italic>3, 4</italic>). Accordingly, by using this assay the end result produces a reproducible phenotype of foci formation. Rigorous standards for foci scoring have been previously established and were used for our studies (<italic>5</italic>). In this paper, we have used this assay with relevant positive and negative controls and established in a statistically significant and scientific manner that cancer cell exosomes can function as an initiator within the context of the assay.</p><p>Unfortunately, the same assay does not result in the same phenotype when using human normal epithelial cell lines. Human cells are known to be more resistant to cell transformation than rodent cells (<italic>6, 7</italic>). This known limitation should not preclude use of the rodent CTA. Currently, there is no other reliable system for the analysis of an <italic>initiation</italic> and <italic>promotion</italic> of cell transformation and it will take significant time to develop a new and reliable 8-week assay. We are in the process of designing a new assay with human cell lines to study the <italic>initiator</italic> and <italic>promoter</italic> activity of known compounds and exosomes, but this new assay is beyond the scope of this study.</p><p>As the 3T3 assay is well accepted and rigorous âto screen biological components, single chemicals or mixtures for carcinogenicity predictionâ, we think this assay is sufficient for this discovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why this is important is related to the new data in Figure 3B, Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, they show that the background foci actually do form tumors, albeit at a slower rate and with lower efficiency than the exosome treated 3T3 foci. But the fact that the background foci do indeed form tumors actually argues against a pure initiator activity â it seems to accelerate what is already happening in the background foci anyway. Thus, a central argument that these exosomes are true initiators does not seem fully accurate. In the absence of other cell types other than 3T3s, it is hard to state this definitively outside of this one context.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers initially asked us to test whether background control foci would form tumors when injected into mice. We did these experiments and results showed that background foci from untreated cells could form tumors when injected into mice, albeit these tumors were observed to grow at a less aggressive rate. These background foci are present in all experiments, due to the fact that NIH/3T3 cells are susceptible to transformation. It has been shown that when NIH/3T3 cells are maintained as confluent, non-growing cultures without passage, or injected into mice in high concentrations, they may undergo spontaneous cell transformation (<italic>8</italic>). It is therefore not unexpected that we observed tumor growth after injection of transformed background foci into mice. The probability to spontaneously transform is also increased if cells have been passaged several times (n&gt;4) (<italic>9</italic>). Maintaining the same passaged cells throughout the experiment is an important factor for obtaining reliable results (<italic>9</italic>). Each of our experiments were performed with the sub-confluent cells passaged less than four times.</p><p>The presence of these background foci also does not diminish the role of <italic>initiators</italic> and <italic>promoters</italic> in cell transformation. Using strict focus scoring based on previously established criteria, we established a constant level of background foci through all experiments; in each experiment a small number of cells transformed independent of any treatment, as has been observed in previous studies (<italic>10</italic>). This does not argue against the <italic>initiator</italic> activity of exosomes as the reviewer suggests, because only in experiments where cells were treated with a functional <italic>initiator</italic> and a functional <italic>promoter</italic>, did we observe a significant increase in transformation above background. This same increase above background is observed for the established chemical <italic>initiator</italic>, MCA. Finally, in keeping with the definition of an <italic>initiator,</italic> we demonstrate that <italic>initiators</italic> (cancer cell exosomes or MCA) can work with multiple <italic>promotors</italic> (TPA or CdCl<sub>2</sub>).</p><p>References:</p><p>1.

We have clarified the text in the Materials and methods to accurately reflect this in the last three paragraphs of the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In looking at their more detailed methods, it is now clear that they are comparing their exomes to the human reference genomes (GRCm38), so that the variants being called are actually just variants that differ from this reference genome, and not the parental 3T3 cells. How do you know that most of the called variants are not just called SNPs or baseline point mutations between 3T3 cells and the human reference genome? Why not compare the exome data to the parental 3T3 cells rather than the human reference genome?</p></disp-quote><p>The sequencing data is being compared to mutations found in the parental NIH/3T3 cells. As NIH/3T3 are mouse cells, we compare our data with both the mouse reference genome and then with the original NIH/3T3 cells. As described in Materials and methods, we first align the raw sequencing data to the mouse reference genome (GRCm38). We have clarified the text in the Materials and methods to accurately reflect this in the last three paragraphs of the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors now provide additional data, using the same pipelines, on bulk exome data on both untreated and TPA treated foci in Figures 5 and 6. In Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, they essentially show that the number of mutations in the untreated or TPA treated cells is similar to that in the MCA/TPA or ExC/TPA foci. But if the basic idea is that exosomes act as initiators through increases in mutation rate, then why are the number of mutations essentially the same.</p></disp-quote><p>The last statement is incorrect as it compares two unrelated events. The first part of this statement, âBut if the basic idea is that exosomes act as initiators through increases in mutation rateâ, is correct and we propose that cancer cell exosomes like other <italic>initiators</italic> (such as MCA) act by causing mutations in the <italic>initiator</italic> step of the transformation process. This provides an increase in the number of mutated cells that can be used by a <italic>promoter</italic> to produce more foci than are observed in control wells.</p><p>The second part of the statement âthen why are the number of mutations essentially the sameâ is unrelated to the first. The number of mutations in the cells from foci is due to the transformation process whereby a normal cell becomes a transformed cell that has accumulated many mutations of over time. For all the foci, COSMIC mutational profiles (20,15 or 3) involving some type of DNA damage were revealed by MutaGene analysis. As a result, the number of mutations is expected to be large. Additionally, the number of mutations depicted in the Venn diagrams reflects the full set of variants found in each sample, prior to filtering for loss of function or missense mutations. Further filtering of the mutations for loss of function and missense mutations was used when analyzing the specific mutations found in the MMR associated genes (Figure 6âfigure supplement 1 and 2) and the 190 oncogenes (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1-source data 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, in the data in Figure 6, you show that the signature 20 is higher in the MCA/TPA or ExC/TPA samples compared to untreated/TPA, but this just looks like a modest increase, and there is no statistical analysis to say whether these are really different.</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 6 represents the relative contribution of the pan-cancer derived COSMIC signatures to the mutational profiles of each foci. Contribution of signatures was calculated using MutaGene, the query profile is decomposed into the precomputed sets for COSMIC to determine the exposure of a given sample to different mutation processes (Figure 6âsource data 1). Discussion of these profiles is found in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How do you confirm that you are really enriching for this signature in this dataset other than a heatmap which looks to be so.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, this is a correct assessment as we cannot definitively confirm or prove the hypothesis that TPA when acting on <italic>initiated</italic> cells will cause mutations in mismatch repair genes. We therefore have changed the text to read:</p><p>âThese observations support the proposal that when TPA is used as a promoter (to drive proliferation) in combination with a functional initiator (an entity that creates a population of randomly mutated cells), the molecular path of cells towards tumorigenesis may not be random. Rather, TPA may drive a path in a subset of randomly mutated cells that accommodates a course towards COSMIC signatures 20 or 15. Furthermore, future studies might reveal that another promoter acting on initiator treated cells might lead cells towards another common endpoint with regards to the 30 different signature profiles.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, it is not clear that bulk sequencing of this population of highly mutated cells is appropriate. If we consider that each cell could have many different mutations, the more appropriate experiment is to create single cell clones out of the transformed foci, let that grow up, and then perform the exome analysis on these isolated clones. While this is an expensive and ultimately very time consuming method, it would ultimately be much more informative in understanding how the mutations occur in each cell, rather than a population of cells which may or may not have defects is mismatch repair.</p></disp-quote><p>One cannot expect to have a clonal population when a genome encodes a mutation in a mismatch repair gene.
