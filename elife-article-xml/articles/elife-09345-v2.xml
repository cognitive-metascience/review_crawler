they are formed is not fully understood. MMP14 is a potent pericellular collagenase that can cleave type I collagen in vitro. In this study, we show that tendon development is arrested in <italic>Scleraxis-Cre::Mmp14</italic> lox/lox mice that are unable to release collagen fibrils from plasma membrane fibripositors. In contrast to its role in collagen turnover in adult tissue, MMP14 promotes embryonic tissue formation by releasing collagen fibrils from the cell surface. Notably, the tendons grow to normal size and collagen fibril release from fibripositors occurs in <italic>Col-r/r</italic> mice that have a mutated collagen-I that is uncleavable by MMPs. Furthermore, fibronectin (not collagen-I) accumulates in the tendons of <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null mice. We propose a model for cell-regulated collagen fibril assembly during tendon development in which MMP14 cleaves a molecular bridge tethering collagen fibrils to the plasma membrane of fibripositors.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09345.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09345.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09345.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A scaffold of proteins called the extracellular matrix surrounds each of the cells that make up our organs and tissues. This matrix, which contains fibres made of proteins called collagens, provides the physical support needed to hold organs and tissues together. This support is especially important in the tendons—a tough tissue that connects the muscle to bone—and other ‘connective’ tissues.</p><p>An enzyme called MMP14 is able to cut through chains of collagen proteins. It belongs to a family of proteins that are involved in breaking down the extracellular matrix to enable cells to divide and for other important processes in cells. Some cancer cells exploit MMP14 to enable them to leave their tissue of origin and spread around the body. Therefore, when researchers bred mutant mice that lacked MMP14, they expected to see excessive growth of collagen fibres in the connective tissues of the mice. However, these mice actually have extremely thin, fragile connective tissue and die soon after birth.</p><p>Earlier in 2015, a group of researchers demonstrated that the first stage of tendon development in mice involves the formation of collagen fibres, which are attached to structures that project from tendon cells called fibripositors. Then, soon after the mice are born, the fibripositors disappear and the collagen fibres are released into the extracellular matrix where they grow longer and become thicker. Now, Taylor, Yeung, Kalson et al.—including some of the researchers from the earlier work—have used electron microscopy to investigate how a lack of MMP14 leads to fragile tendons in young mice.</p><p>The experiments show that MMP14 plays a crucial role in the first stage of tendon development by detaching the collagen fibres from the fibripositors. MMP14 also promotes the formation of new collagen fibres; the tendons of mutant mice that lack MMP14 have fewer collagen fibres than normal mice. Further experiments revealed that the release of collagen fibres from fibripositors does not require MMP14 to cleave the chains of collagen proteins themselves. Instead, it appears that MMP14 cleaves another protein that is associated with the fibres, called fibronectin.</p><p>Taylor, Yeung, Kalson et al.'s findings show that MMP14 plays an important role in the development of tendons by releasing collagen fibres from fibripositors and promoting the formation of new fibres. The next challenge is to find out how MMP14 regulates the number of collagen fibres in mature tendons and other tissues, and how defects in this enzyme can lead to cancer and other diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09345.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09345.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>MT1-MMP</kwd><kwd>fibronectin</kwd><kwd>fibripositor</kwd><kwd>electron microscope</kwd><kwd>periostin</kwd><kwd>collagen</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>091840/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kadler</surname><given-names>Karl E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>B4, CRC829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mauch</surname><given-names>Cornelia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The membrane type I-matrix metalloproteinase is essential for the release of collagen fibrils from plasma membrane fibripositors, which is required for the transition from embryonic to postnatal tendon development.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Matrix metalloproteinase 14 (MMP14, also known as membrane type I-MMP) is a member of the family of MMPs and contains a transmembrane domain for insertion into the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sato et al., 1994</xref>).

We were curious why absence of MMP14, which is an efficient collagenase in vitro, leads to connective tissue frailty rather than collagen accumulation.</p><p>Collagens are a large family of triple helical proteins that are widespread throughout the vertebrate body and are critical for tissue scaffolding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huxley-Jones et al., 2007</xref>). More than 28 collagen and collagen-related proteins occur in vertebrate tissues of which type I collagen is the archetypal member of the subfamily of fibril-forming collagens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kadler et al., 2007</xref>). The fibrils formed from type I collagen are the largest (with a mass per unit length up to ∼0.3 TDa/µm) and most size pleomorphic (from ∼1 µm to &gt;1 mm) protein polymers in vertebrates and are essential for fibrous tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schnieke et al., 1983</xref>). Collagen fibril assembly has best been studied in embryonic tendon, which contains narrow diameter (∼50 nm) fibrils in which one end of the fibril is located within actin-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canty et al., 2006</xref>) invaginations of the plasma membrane called fibripositors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canty et al., 2004</xref>). Fibripositors are points of fibril assembly and sites of attachment of the cell to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>) and exhibit a range of morphologies depending on the presence or absence of a slender finger-like projection of the plasma membrane. Protruding fibripositors exhibit the invagination and the finger-like projection whereas recessed fibripositors only exhibit the invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>). The transport of collagen fibrils into fibripositors is powered by non-muscle myosin II and is not part of a fibril degradation process in embryonic tendon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>). Short collagen fibrils can be found within membrane-sealed compartments termed fibricarriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Canty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The transition from a unimodal distribution of narrow (∼50 nm) diameter collagen fibrils in embryonic tendon to a bimodal distribution in adult tissues with means of ∼50 nm and ∼200 nm diameter fibrils is a fascinating phenomenon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Parry et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Derwin and Soslowsky, 1999</xref>). The presence of narrow-diameter collagen fibrils in fibripositors during E14.5 to birth (in mice) signifies stage 1 of tendon development during which fibril number is determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalson et al., 2015</xref>). Stage 2 occurs soon after birth (in mice) and is characterized by the disappearance of fibripositors, the release of fibrils to the ECM and the growth of fibrils in length and diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalson et al., 2015</xref>). We show here that in the absence of MMP14, progression from stage 1–2 does not occur, fibrils are retained by fibripositors, fibril diameters keep to ∼50 nm, and tendon development stops at stage 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient mouse tendons are thinner and mechanically weak</title><p>Wild type (WT) and <italic>Mmp14</italic> knockout (KO) littermates had similar birth weights but the KO mice were growth retarded at 3 days after birth (P3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holmbeck et al., 1999</xref>]).

Immunofluorescence analysis at E15.5 showed accumulation of FN in <italic>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</italic> tendons compared to WT tendons and the levels of FN appeared to progressively accumulate in KO tendons at P0 and P10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).

Thus, we formed tendon-like constructs in the presence of 200 µg/ml exogenous human plasma FN. The constructs formed within ∼10 days as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kapacee et al., 2008</xref>). TEM of the constructs showed pronounced fibripositors in cells incubated in exogenous FN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We show here that MMP14 is essential for the stage 1–stage 2 transition of tendon development (which occurs around birth in the mouse) by catalyzing the release of collagen fibrils from fibripositors. In WT mouse tendons, fibripositors disappear and collagen fibrils are released to the ECM soon after birth (marking the end of stage 1), and the fibrils grow in diameter and length (marking the start of stage 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalson et al., 2015</xref>). In the absence of MMP14, the fibrils are retained within fibripositors and the number of collagen fibrils formed during stage 1 is reduced. As a result, tendons in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient mice are thinner compared to WT. Although MMP14 is capable of cleaving type I collagen at the ¾-¼ helical site, we show that cleavage at this site is not required for tendon development. Interestingly, FN accumulates in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient tendons. Thus, we propose that the ability of MMP14 to cleave macromolecules other than type I collagen is essential for releasing collagen fibrils from fibripositors.</p><p>Collagen fibrils are assembled on the surface of embryonic tenocytes and pulled into fibripositors by a mechanism powered by non-muscle myosin II (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kalson et al., 2013</xref>). The absence of fibripositors in stage 2 shows that fibrils are ‘released’ from the plasma membrane for delivery to the ECM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalson et al., 2015</xref>). We propose that collagen fibrillogenesis in embryonic tendon occurs via an ‘APR’ mechanism of collagen ‘<italic><underline>a</underline>ttachment</italic>’ to the cell surface, non-muscle myosin II-powered ‘<italic><underline>p</underline>ulling</italic>’ on fibrils into fibripositors, and MMP14-mediated ‘<italic><underline>r</underline>elease</italic>’ of the fibrils to the ECM.</p><p><italic>Mmp14</italic>-null mice had thinner tendons than WT mice. SBF-SEM analyses showed similar cell numbers in embryonic WT and null mouse tendons; therefore, we excluded the possibility that delayed development was the cause. However, <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null tendons had fewer collagen fibrils. As shown previously, the lateral size of the tendon is established during embryonic development when embryonic tenocytes assemble a finite number of collagen fibrils at fibripositors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kalson et al., 2015</xref>). The fibrils are released after birth and subsequently grow in length and diameter in a process of matrix expansion. Therefore, the fewer fibrils in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient tendons appear to be a direct result of the inability of the cells to release collagen fibrils to the ECM before a new cycle of fibril assembly can begin. In the presence of continued collagen synthesis (albeit at a reduced rate [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>]), the existing fibrils continue to grow in length and diameter at the expense of nucleation of new fibrils. At P0 and soon after birth, the fibrils in WT tendon grow in length to equal the length of fibrils in <italic>Mmp14</italic> KO tendons.</p><p>Tendon size was normal in <italic>Col-r/r</italic> embryos; therefore, the absence of type I collagen cleavage was not the cause of reduced fibril number in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient tendons. However, tenocytes in embryonic <italic>Col-r/r</italic> tendons contained electron-dense vacuoles, which were morphologically similar to those previously observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beertsen et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Everts et al., 1996</xref>). Therefore, although type I collagen is cleaved at the ¾-¼ site during embryonic development, cleavage is not essential for tendon development. While the <italic>Col-r/r</italic> mutation renders the triple helix resistant to cleavage by MMPs, rodent MMP13 recognizes an additional cleavage site C-terminal to the N-telopeptide crosslink (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krane et al., 1996</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al. (1995)</xref> reported that the MMP13 cleavage site in type I collagen permits normal remodeling during development and early postnatal life, but that cleavage at the ¾-¼ site is needed for subsequent remodeling and accounts for the observed progressive marked skin fibrosis in the <italic>Col-r/r</italic>. Our data agree with these conclusions and show that MMP13 (and MMP2) is not essential for tendon development. The fact that degradative vacuoles are rare in embryonic <italic>Mmp14</italic> KO tenocytes and that fibril numbers were reduced and fibril lengths are greater in <italic>Mmp14</italic> KO cells, suggests that the vacuoles might be part of a mechanism to regulate fibril number and/or length.</p><p>Two proteins, FN and periostin, stood out in the LC-MS/MS comparison of WT and <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null tendons as proteins that could help to explain the <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null tendon phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref> shows number of peptides from periostin and FN were over-represented in <italic>Mmp14</italic> KO tendon). Periostin is a member of the matricellular family of secreted proteins that modulate cell–ECM interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sage and Bornstein, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Murphy-Ullrich and Sage, 2014</xref>). Periostin is highly expressed by epithelial cells, is bound by αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins, is upregulated in epithelial tumors to support adhesion and migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gillan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yuyama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu and Du, 2015</xref>), and is a prognostic marker for TH2-driven asthma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Parulekar et al., 2014</xref>) and lung fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amara et al., 2015</xref>). Additional studies have shown that periostin supports tendon formation in an ectopic mouse model of the development of tenogenic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noack et al., 2014</xref>). Evidence also suggests that periostin interacts with type I collagen to regulate collagen fibrillogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Noack et al., 2014</xref>). It has also been reported that periostin deficiency might cause collagen fibril disorganization and affect the distribution of FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tabata et al., 2014</xref>). We showed that periostin was increased in the tendon epithelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taylor et al., 2011</xref>) that surrounds the body of the tendon, in P10 <italic>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</italic> mice compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Periostin can be cleaved by MMP14 in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stegemann et al., 2013</xref>) and therefore its accumulation in the epithelium could be a direct result of substrate accumulation. It is also possible that the elevated levels seen in the epithelium are an indirect result of MMP14 deficiency in the fibrous core of the tendon.</p><p>We observed elevated levels of FN in <italic>Mmp14</italic> KO tendon, as shown by LC-MS/MS and by immunofluorescence. MMP14 has been shown to cleave several macromolecules in vitro including FN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">d'Ortho et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ohuchi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tam et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Butler and Overall, 2007</xref>); therefore, the accumulation of FN in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient tendon might be a direct result of the absence of MMP14. We observed a potential cleavage site between Ala(1078) and Thr(1079) in FN that occurred in WT but not in <italic>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</italic> tendon. FN is a core component of extracellular matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mao and Schwarzbauer, 2005</xref>) and has an important role in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">George et al., 1993</xref>) and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sakai et al., 2001</xref>). Mice lacking FN are embryonic lethal with defects in mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">George et al., 1993</xref>). Furthermore, FN co-distributes with type I and III collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fleischmajer and Timpl, 1984</xref>). To understand if the presence of elevated levels of FN could explain the fibripositor phenotype, we incubated tendon-like constructs with exogenous FN. This resulted in a profound increase in appearance of fibripositors. Taking the EM, LC-MS/MS, and tendon-construct data together, we propose that FN forms a ‘molecular bridge’ between the cell and the collagen fibril. Thus, cleavage of the bridge and removal of fibripositors triggers the onset of stage 2 of tendon development and subsequent expansion of the matrix.</p><p>An unexpected observation was the effect on skeletal size of deleting MMP14 from tendon. The shortened long bones in <italic>Scx-Cre::Mmp14 lox/lox</italic> mice suggests important consequences of tendon development on skeletal growth. LC-MS/MS analyses showed under-representation of decorin, COMP, PCOLCE, and TNXB in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null tendons. These proteins are directly involved in regulating collagen fibril size and shape; mice lacking decorin have fibrils with irregular outlines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Danielson et al., 1997</xref>), COMP can act as a catalyst for collagen fibril formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halasz et al., 2007</xref>), PCOLCE enhances the cleavage of procollagen to collagen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahara et al., 1994</xref>) and mice lacking TNXB have reduced numbers of collagen fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mao et al., 2002</xref>). In contrast, several proteins were over-represented in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-deficient tendons. These included filamin A, which has functions in cell–ECM adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nakamura et al., 2011</xref>) and mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jahed et al., 2014</xref>). As tendons are predominately ECM, changes in ECM composition and cell–ECM interactions are likely to have profound effects on cell signaling (e.g., ECM growth factor presentation) as well as the growth and mechanical properties of tendon leading to changes in musculoskeletal development. Finally, the tendons, cartilage, muscle, and bone are peripheral circadian clocks, each with their unique circadian transcriptome (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yeung et al., 2014a</xref>] and reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dudek and Meng (2014)</xref>).

All animals were sacrificed by a Schedule 1 procedure by trained personnel. MMP14 KO mice were as described previously (Zhou et al., 2000). To generate mice in which MMP14 is ablated in tendon-lineage cells, we crossed mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of Scleraxis (ScxCre; C57BL/6) (Blitz et al., 2013) with mice carrying the floxed exons (exons 2 to 4) of the MMP14 gene (MMP14-floxed; C57BL/6) (Zigrino et al., 2012). MMP13 KO embryos were a generous gift from Zena Werb (Stickens et al., 2004). MMP2 heterozygous mice were imported from RIKEN BioResource Center (GelAKO/RBRC00398; C57) (Itoh et al., 1997) and bred to homozygosity. Col-r/r mice were imported from Jackson Laboratory (B6;129S4-Col1a1tm1Jae/J) (Liu et al., 1995). X-ray analyses were performed as described previously (Yeung et al., 2014).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="SD1-data"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09345.024</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><p>LC-MS/MS peptide identity and counts.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor), a Reviewing Editor (Robb Krumlauf), and three reviewers.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and Robb Krumlauf, as the Reviewing editor, has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The consensus opinion of the reviewers is that this is an important new study analyzing the role of MMP14 during tendon development, which represents a significant contribution to our understanding of collagen fibril synthesis, release and growth. The manuscript provides a detailed analysis of the MMP14 (MT1-MMP) knockout phenotype in the tendon. They show that <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null mice have reduced tendon cross sectional area and fewer fibrils at birth. They also observed an increase in fibril diameter and fibripositor number. This is specific to MMP14 as other MMP knockouts do not phenocopy these characteristics. The phenotype does not appear to be due to MMP cleavage of collagen as examination of a cleavage insensitive collagen knockout does not phenocopy the MMP14 results. Fibronectin amounts were increased in MMP14 deficient tendons and in vitro assays demonstrated that incubation with fibronectin caused more pronounced fibripositors. This leads to the novel conclusion that MMP14 is necessary for tendon growth by mediating the release of collagen into the ECM.</p><p>An interesting model is presented with a plausible explanation for their findings. In the model MMP14 functions in collagen release from the fibripositors. As this presents a fascinating mechanism for how a fibrous matrix is assembled, it would be of general interest to the field of tendon biology. However, there are several key discrepancies and issues of clarity relating to the data that need to be addressed. Hence, the work requires major revision as multiple findings presented in the paper appear disjointed or lack sufficient data to fully support the main conclusions. These major issues are: 1) The authors outline two stages of tendon development: in the first stage (from E14.5-) collagen fibril number is increased, and the second stage, at early postnatal stages, the fibrils are released to the ECM where they grow in length and diameter, and fibripositors disappear. They conclude that MMP14 is required for the progression from stage 1 to stage 2, affecting tissue expansion. However, their data suggest that MMP14 may act at multiple stages of tendon development. There is a lack of clarity on the phenotype and stages analyzed for the <italic>Scx-Cre-Mmp14</italic> tissue specific knockout compared with the null. Much of their data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1 fig2 fig3">Figures 1-3</xref>) are on the phenotype of the <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null mice at embryonic and early postnatal stages (due to the early lethality limiting later analysis), yet the tendon phenotype of the CKO at corresponding stages is unclear. The stages are not specified and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> legend is missing. The data shown for the CKO appears to be a much later stage. The authors need to include earlier embryonic and postnatal analysis to demonstrate that stage 1 is normal in these mice and that stage 2 at early postnatal stages is disrupted. It would be valuable to include an analysis of fibronectin at these earlier stages. If over-accumulation of fibronectin is involved in their phenotype, there should be increased fibronectin levels preceding or coincident with the matrix changes. The complete null appears to have disruption in both stages. The authors detect fewer collagen fibrils that are looped and longer in length from embryonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, and some of the supplemental figures to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and P0 analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Postnatal data is given for the <italic>Scx-Cre-Mmp14</italic> conditional knockout, but their tendons appear more significantly affected (comparing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). The authors should clarify the function of MMP14 at both embryonic and early postnatal stages, and if their data support a direct or indirect role for MMP14 in these processes.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, in the evaluation of the effects of <italic>MMp14</italic> KO on tendon size – is there an effect on the number of cells per tendon?</p><p>3) The authors present several mechanisms to account for their phenotype. They mainly propose a model whereby collagen release is mediated by MMP14 possibly through cleavage of a molecular bridge possibly composed of fibronectin or periostin. The authors also show decreased amounts of phospho-Smad2, and comment in the Discussion that MMP14 may function to promote TGF-beta signaling, which then serves to induce tendon fates. Although these are plausible hypotheses, more data are required to support them. A focus on one of the potential mechanisms would help with the clarity of the paper. Both TGF-beta (by phosphor-Smad2 staining) and fibronectin are investigated at 7 weeks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), a much later stage than any of the other findings. These differences at later stages make it difficult to distinguish between indirect vs. direct role in causing the phenotype. The authors could investigate fibronectin levels at earlier stages to strengthen their data. Similar analysis of periostin or TGF-beta/phospho-smad2 levels at embryonic and postnatal time points, could be performed in the MMP14 loss of function animals.</p><p>4) The tendon phenotype of <italic>Scx-Cre; Mmp14 fl/fl</italic> appears more affected than MMP14 nulls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) although the general health of the animal is improved. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, the null has larger diameter fibrils than wild type, yet in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> they are unimodal and smaller. It is unclear if the stages are different as it only states postnatal in the text and the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> legend is missing.</p><p>5) The skeletal phenotype shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is distracting and does not add to the main focus of the paper. The CKO animals appear smaller than the controls, and the reported skeletal changes could occur in proportion to the decreased animal size. In addition, it is unclear whether the skeletal phenotype is directly related to MMP14 loss in the tendons or due to its loss in other tissues where the <italic>Scx-Cre</italic> transgene may be active. Although this transgene's activity has not been reported, the <italic>Scx-GFP</italic> transgene has been described to be active in the lungs, adrenal glands, and kidneys.</p><p>6) The relative weakness of the experiment aimed at identifying collagenous peptides released naturally by MMP-14 by LC-MS/MS is a problem. The authors state that the cleavage may occur at levels that are too low to detect. Mass spectrometry on extracts of connective tissues is difficult; it is possible, that the extraction buffer used (0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.5) was inappropriate. So the failure to identify the expected peptides does not justify the paragraph title “Cleavage of collagen-I is not required to release collagen fibrils from fibripositors”. In this respect, the data with the <italic>Col-r/r</italic> are much more convincing. As no conclusions can be drawn from the authors' description of the data, this section should be removed from the Results and Discussion.</p><p>7) The authors propose that FN cleavage may be key to understanding the phenotype and they have already performed LC-MS/MS to analyze collagen cleavage. It may be useful to determine if in the same analysis they identify FN fragments.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09345.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The authors outline two stages of tendon development: in the first stage (from E14.5-) collagen fibril number is increased, and the second stage, at early postnatal stages, the fibrils are released to the ECM where they grow in length and diameter, and fibripositors disappear.

To address this point we have performed new transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on P0 tail tendons from <italic>ScxCre;Mmp14</italic>-floxed and wild type tendon (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>) and confirmed a similar phenotype with increased fibripositors in <italic>ScxCre;Mmp14</italic>-floxed and global <italic>MMp14</italic> KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>To address the question regarding fibronectin and periostin accumulation in <italic>ScxCre;Mmp14</italic>-floxed tendons, we have performed new immunofluorescence analyses on <italic>ScxCre;Mmp14</italic>-floxed and wild type littermates from E15.5, P0 and P10 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6–figure supplement 1A</xref>). We could not perform western blot analyses at all of these stages because it is technically difficult to isolate tendons cleanly from embryos.

The TGF-beta signalling data have now been removed. We agree that this aspect of the paper was not well supported. However, we have included a short sentence near the end of the Discussion alluding to potential additional factors that might contribute to the tendon phenotype in <italic>Mmp14</italic>-null mice.</p><p>The reviewers requested additional data on periostin.

Although this transgene's activity has not been reported, the</italic> Scx-GFP <italic>transgene has been described to be active in the lungs, adrenal glands, and kidneys.</italic></p><p>Although the skeletal data do not form the main focus of the paper, we feel that it is important to report this phenotype. We have now moved these data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref> and added sentences to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>6) The relative weakness of the experiment aimed at identifying collagenous peptides released naturally by MMP-14 by LC-MS/MS is a problem. The authors state that the cleavage may occur at levels that are too low to detect. Mass spectrometry on extracts of connective tissues is difficult; it is possible, that the extraction buffer used (0.1 M Tris buffer pH 7.5) was inappropriate. So the failure to identify the expected peptides does not justify the paragraph title “Cleavage of collagen-I is not required to release collagen fibrils from fibripositors”. In this respect, the data with the</italic> Col-r/r <italic>are much more convincing. As no conclusions can be drawn from the authors' description of the data, this section should be removed from the Results and Discussion.</italic></p><p>We agree that the section “Cleavage of collagen-I is not required to release collagen fibrils from fibripositors” was verbose and weak. We have removed the section. The reviewer(s) did not consider this section contributed to the paper, and we can see their point of view. We agree with their conclusion that the <italic>Col-r/r</italic> data are more convincing.</p><p><italic>7) The authors propose that FN cleavage may be key to understanding the phenotype and they have already performed LC-MS/MS to analyze collagen cleavage. It may be useful to determine if in the same analysis they identify FN fragments.</italic></p><p>With regards to the mass spectrometry studies on fibronectin, we have now further analysed the data and identified a unique semi-tryptic peptide of fibronectin only present in wild type and not MMP-deficient tendons. We confirmed this finding by analysing fibronectin cleaved by recombinant MMP14 in vitro and have included these data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
