Until recently, lncRNAs were often dismissed as lacking functional relevance. However, lncRNAs are emerging as critical regulators of diverse biological processes and have been increasingly associated with a wide range of diseases, based primarily on dysregulated expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wapinski and Chang, 2011</xref>). LncRNAs represent a new layer of complexity in the molecular architecture of the genome, and strategies to validate disease relevant lncRNAs are much needed. High-throughput analyses have shown that lncRNAs are widely expressed in the brain and may contribute to complex neurodevelopmental processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wapinski and Chang, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fertuzinhos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Valadkhan and Nilsen, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lv et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aprea et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ramos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ng et al., 2013</xref>). However, few studies have examined the role of lncRNAs in brain development mostly due to technical difficulties. Direct lineage conversion by the transcription factors <underline>B</underline>rn2, <underline>A</underline>scl1 and <underline>M</underline>yt1l (termed BAM factors in combination) into induced neuronal (iN) cells, recapitulates significant events controlling neurogenesis programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ang and Wernig, 2014</xref>), and therefore, it is a facile and informative system to study the role of lncRNAs in the establishment of neuronal identity.</p><p>The noncoding genome has emerged as a major source for human diversity and disease origins. Given that less than 2% of the genome encodes protein-coding genes, the majority of the genomic landscape is largely encompassed by non-coding elements. Efforts to identify genetic variation linked to human disease through genome-wide association studies revealed a significant majority affecting the non-coding landscape. Based on their expression and diversity in the mammalian brain, we postulate neuronal lncRNAs may be recurrently affected by mutations that disrupt normal brain function. Neurodevelopmental disorders manifest as a spectrum of phenotypes particularly early in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Voineagu et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies suggest that this diversity is the result of different combinations of mutations in multiple genes, often impacting key pathways such as synapse function and chromatin regulation. Nonetheless, despite recent findings that have greatly increased the number of protein coding genes implicated in human intellectual disability and autism, a majority of patients lack well-understood genetic lesions which include a large number of inherited variants occur in noncoding regions that could not be interpreted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Iossifov et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ronemus et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gilman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iossifov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">O'Roak et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">O'Roak et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hormozdiari et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we used an integrative approach to identify lncRNA genes important for human disease by incorporating high throughput cell fate reprogramming, human genetics, and lncRNA functional analysis. In addition, we developed a pipeline to enrich for lncRNAs with neuronal function and are associated with disease through focal mutations in patients with autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability (ASD/ID). Furthermore, we show that one of these lncRNAs, <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> participates in neuronal maturation programs in vitro by regulating the expression of a network of genes previously linked to human autism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>LncRNA candidate loci are recurrently mutated in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders</title><p>LncRNAs have been associated with human diseases primarily through alterations in expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheetham et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gupta et al., 2010</xref>). However, little is known about mutations affecting the genomic loci that encode lncRNAs. We previously profiled mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) expressing doxycycline-induced BAM factors after 48 hr, 13 and 22 days of expression (GSE43916). Surprisingly, annotation of the iN cell reprogramming transcriptome revealed that the majority of regulated transcripts were in fact non-coding elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Specifically, 58% of the changed transcripts corresponded to non-coding genes while only 42% of them corresponded to coding genes. About two thirds of these non-coding transcripts were composed of novel lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To study the vast non-coding iN cell reprogramming transcriptome, we developed a rigorous pipeline to select lncRNAs with strong neuronal association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We considered expression pattern during MEF-to-iN cell reprogramming and across mouse brain development, protein coding potential, chromatin enrichment, and ‘guilt-by-association’ with neuronal Gene Ontology (GO) terms. We observed 287 non-coding transcripts significantly changed expression during this time course (RPKM &gt;1, fold change &gt;2, p-value&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Notably, lncRNAs that increased expression during early stages of iN cell reprogramming are more highly expressed in embryonic mouse brain, specifically in ventricular and subventricular zones where neurogenesis occurs; whereas lncRNAs that increased expression during intermediate to late stages of iN cell reprogramming were more highly expressed in adult mouse brain, including in mature cortical layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Furthermore, robust expression of iN cell lncRNAs in the mouse brain confirmed that these transcripts are indeed bona fide neuronal transcripts.</p><p>We next assessed lncRNA association with chromatin, reasoning that such RNAs are more likely to exert gene regulatory function as non-coding RNAs. We performed histone H3 immunoprecipitation, followed by deep sequencing of associated RNAs (histone H3 RIP-seq), and discovered some of these 287 iN lncRNAs are chromatin-associated compared to IgG control and input in neural precursor cells (NPCs) or adult mouse brain tissue, suggesting that some of them may have more direct roles in gene expression control at the chromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These 287 lncRNAs were then selected for further investigation. To further prioritize candidate lncRNAs, we determined regulatory modules based on patterns of co-expression between mRNAs and lncRNAs, inferring co-regulation from co-expression.

Among these seven focal CNVs, five events corresponded to small deletions in human lncRNA candidates E, H, Z, D and O. Two lncRNA loci corresponding to lncRNAs H and Z were affected by two independent and different focal CNVs. We verified that all five human lncRNAs are expressed during human brain development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). We then designed a custom tilling array with dense coverage of the affected loci for comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) to validate the focal CNVs in the genomic DNA from affected individuals. 5 of 7 focal CNVs affecting the lncRNA loci were tested and validated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

The NR_033883 locus neighbors the coding genes <italic>ZFP238</italic> (also known as ZBTB18, ZNF238, and RP58) and <italic>AKT3</italic>. Because the human NR_033883 locus is most proximal but does not overlap <italic>ZFP238</italic>, we propose to refer to this lncRNA as <italic>lnc-ZFP238</italic>. Intriguingly, we previously identified ZFP238 as a key downstream target of the Ascl1 network during MEF to iN cell reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, ZFP238 has an important role in neuronal differentiation during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xiang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ohtaka-Maruyama et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baubet et al., 2012</xref>), and thus, <italic>lnc-ZFP238</italic> could have a promising neurogenic role given its high expression pattern during the early stages of direct neuronal reprogramming, as well as in postnatal mouse and human brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Another focally deleted lncRNA was the locus harboring human FLJ42709 (or NR2F1-AS1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) which is adjacent to the protein-coding gene <italic>NR2F1</italic> (also known as <italic>COUP-TF1</italic>), encoding a transcription factor involved in neurogenesis and patterning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Armentano et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borello et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faedo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Harrison-Uy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Job and Tan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsai and Tsai, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">O'Leary et al., 2007</xref>). This lncRNA was previously annotated as ‘NR2F1-antisense 1’ (NR2F1-AS1). However, our RNA-seq analysis showed that at least one isoform of the mouse lncRNA and all detected isoform of the human lncRNA are transcribed divergently from <italic>NR2F1</italic> without antisense overlap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramos et al., 2013</xref>). For scientific accuracy, we therefore propose the name <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic>. We first asked whether the coding gene <italic>NR2F1</italic> could also be affected by the focal CNVs in ASD/ID patients. Detailed statistical analysis of the primary data taking into account the relative probe density suggested that inclusion of <italic>NR2F1</italic> is not statistically significant compared to the control group. Moreover, we precisely mapped the independent focal deletion found in patient 9900850 by CGH analysis and found only the <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> locus to be disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results implicated the genetic disruption of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> as likely contributor to complex neurodevelopmental disorders.</p><p>Chromosomal aberrations encompassing the <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> locus and additional genes on chromosome 5q14 have been previously reported in several patients with neurodevelopmental deficits and congenital abnormalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Kateb et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brown et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardoso et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malan et al., 2006</xref>). However, given that several genes are affected by the deletions, the particular contribution of each gene was difficult to resolve. Three patients (5-year-old girl, 5 and 7 year old boys) with a de novo deletion of chromosome 5q14.3–15 were diagnosed with epileptic episodes, intellectual disability, bilateral periventricular heterotopia in the temporal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles, minor dysmorphic facial features, developmental delay, and impaired to negligible language skills (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The shared minimal deleted region between the patients spans 5.8 Mb and encompasses several annotated genes, amongst them lnc<italic>-NR2F1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cardoso et al., 2009</xref>). Clinical examination of one of the patients that harbors a finer 6.3 Mb interstitial deletion, showed macrocephaly (&gt;98<sup>th</sup> centile) and brain MRI revealed polymicrogyria. No cortical abnormalities were detected on the brain MRI for the other two patients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). More recently, an 8 year-old and 3 month-old boy with a de novo 582 kb deletion was diagnosed with global developmental delay, dysmorphic features, visual motor integration deficit, visual perception disorder, mild conductive hearing loss, and severe fine motor skills abnormalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Kateb et al., 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Head circumference was 8<sup>th</sup> centile. Brain MRI revealed bilateral optic nerve atrophy. The 582 kb deletion affects the genes <italic>NR2F1</italic>, lnc<italic>-NR2F1</italic>, <italic>FAM172A</italic>, <italic>POU5F2</italic>, and <italic>MIR2277</italic>. A four year-old girl with a balanced de novo paracentric chromosome five inversion, inv(5) (q15q33.2), and microdeletions near the rearrangement breaking points completely removed <italic>NR2F1</italic> and lnc<italic>-NR2F1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Additional genes on different chromosomes are affected by microdeletions and could potentially contribute to the phenotype. The patient was diagnosed with syndromic deafness, feeding difficulties, dysmorphism, strabism, and developmental delay.</p><p>Across those patients with structural variation encompassing the <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> locus in the literature, the minimal deleted region is approximately 230 kb, a small area encompassing the genes <italic>NR2F1</italic> and <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Patient CMS12200 was diagnosed with developmental delay, speech delay, significant expressive language delay, and congenital infantile left eye esotropia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Physical examination revealed small head size (head circumference 48.5 cm; fifth-tenth centile), and mild fifth finger clinodactyly bilaterally. Other physical features were normal. The patient’s father was diagnosed with dyslexia and stutters, and carried the identical t(5;12) translocation. The patient’s mother had a normal 46, XX karyotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Fluorescence in situ hybridization and whole genome sequencing defined the chromosomal breakpoints with high precision and revealed that only the <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> gene is disrupted in this patient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). In humans, three predominant isoforms of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> have been detected in neuronal tissue. The long isoforms (1 and 2) are affected by the chromosomal break, while the gene structure of the short isoform (3) could remain unaffected based on the location of the break (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Further studies by Sanger sequencing of the 5q15 and 12q15 breakpoint-specific junction fragments showed the identical breakpoints in the patient’s father and revealed a loss of 9 nucleotides at the 5q15 chromosome and a loss of 12 nucleotides at the 12q15 chromosome in the patient and his father (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The breakpoint at 12q15 occurred in a coding gene desert and did not disrupt any coding genes, and is predicted to destabilize the affected transcript due to loss of 3’ splice or polyadenylation signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4D–E</xref>). Importantly, whole genome sequencing data indicated the absence of other deleterious mutations known to be associated with autism or intellectual disability, to our knowledge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Also, the genes adjacent to the break point (<italic>FAM172A, ARRDC3, KIAA0625, USP15</italic>) are not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4E</xref>). Given that <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> is the only disrupted gene in this patient family, it is possible that haploinsufficiency is the primary cause for this syndrome and contribute to the phenotypes manifested across patients mentioned above. Further studies including a larger sample size and independent cases are required to conclusively link lnc-<italic>NR2F1</italic> mutations to multiple clinical symptoms described above.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Molecular and functional characterization of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic></title><p>Given its potential involvement in neurodevelopmental disease, we next sought to investigate the function of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic>.

To test this idea, we mapped the genome-wide localization of different RNA domains in <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> using domain-specific Chromatin Isolation by RNA precipitation followed by sequencing (domain ChIRP-seq) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McLean et al., 2010</xref>).

We performed ChIRP-seq separately with two orthogonal probe sets (termed odd and even sets) against two different domains of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> (long isoform-specific exon 11 and the short isoform-specific exon 7) and only accepted concordant results between the odd and even probe sets. There are approximately 10-fold more genomic occupancy for the long vs. short isoform of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic>: 4404 ChIRP-seq peaks for exon 11 (n = 4) vs. 415 ChIRP-seq peaks for exon 7 (n = 4), respectively. It is unlikely that low expression or inefficient pulldown of the short isoform are the cause of the difference given that we detected comparable level of long and short isoform in hNPC and obtained similar recovery of the long and short RNA isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis of domain specific chromatin localization, genomic occupancy sites of different <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> exons showed limited overlap of peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that the long- and short- specific exon might be each binding to different genomic loci and regulating different subsets of downstream genes. For example, only the long isoform-specific exon has a distinct binding site surrounding <italic>POLR1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>We then assessed the transcriptional response which the three isoforms of human <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> varied quantitatively: The shortest isoform, human <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> isoform 3, had the lowest number of differentially regulated genes (5 downregulated and four upregulated) compared to isoform 1 (1147 downregulated and 414 upregulated) and isoform 2 (141 downregulated and 45 upregulated) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref>). This is consistent with our hypothesis that the long isoform is the functional one in neurogenesis and in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders including ASD.</p><p>After further filtering the peaks for high confidence peaks, we obtained 913 high confidence peaks for long-isoform domain ChIRP and no peaks for short-isoform domain ChIRP (see Materials and methods for filtering criteria).

Relative to the human genome, the long isoform-specific peaks are more enriched in the exonic, intronic, enhancer and promoter regions and depleted in the intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Furthermore, ChIRP peaks are characterized by chromatin state model, which defines human genome with 25 chromatin states using 12 biochemical features (histone modifications, DNA accessibility, DNA methylation, RNA-seq and other epigenetic signals) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matsui et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>Lnc-NR2F1</italic> ChIRP peaks are enriched in promoter, enhancer, and transcribed regions, compared to the whole genome which majority is in the quiescent state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The 1361 high confidence peak associated genes by the long isoform-specific domain ChIRP are all enriched for neuronal specific biological terms such <italic>central nervous system development, cell-cell adhesion</italic> and <italic>regulation of nervous system development</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). There is also a significant overlap between the genes adjacent to peaks from the long isoform-specific domain ChIRP and the genes adjacent to the mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> ChIRP, indicating a possible conserved functions of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> between mouse and human (207 genes overlapped, Chi-square test, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We also observed a significant overlap between the genes adjacent to the peaks from the long isoform-specific domain ChIRP and the autism risk genes (114 genes, Chi-square test, p&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Notably, peaks of long isoform-specific exon 11 ChIRP are enriched for multiple basic-helix-loop-helix motifs (Ascl1, NeuroD1, Olig2 and Atoh1) which all share the CANNTG motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2011</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Mouse ES-iN cell ChIRP peaks are also enriched for similar motifs suggesting possibly conserved mechanisms of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> in human and mouse. Given the pervasive roles of bHLH proteins in neuronal development and in induced neuronal reprogramming, the binding preference of <italic>lnc-</italic>NR2F1 suggests a biochemical basis for the functional cooperativity with proneural bHLH factors (Ngn2 and Ascl1). In summary, we conclude that the <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> isoforms have different genomic occupancy and transcriptional effects. The long isoform showed most biological activity and chromatin binding and is also solely affected in patient CMS12200.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Given the stringency required to rewire a cellular state from an unrelated lineage, factors expressed during direct reprogramming likely have an active role in the establishment of the new cell identity. Direct neuronal lineage induction represents a synchronized and streamlined conversion of cell fate, and should be a powerful system to enrich for lineage-specific regulatory factors. In this study, direct conversion of fibroblasts to induced neuronal cells enabled the identification of lncRNAs with unique properties in establishing neuronal fate via neurogenesis or maturation programs. The pipeline described in this study may be extrapolated to identify potential lncRNA regulators of other specific cellular states.</p><p>Because the brain is the organ with the greatest number of unique cell-type specific lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qureshi et al., 2010</xref>), our approach may be useful to identify lncRNAs with roles in neural lineage specification. Indeed, we identified <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> as functional player in neuronal maturation and pathfinding. Remarkably its sequence is remarkably conserved between the first few exons of mouse and human <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> which is an atypical pattern for lncRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ulitsky and Bartel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ulitsky et al., 2011</xref>). Consequently, we found that there is high synteny, sequence and microdomain conservation between mouse and human <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic>. These observations suggest that some lncRNAs may have been functionally conserved throughout evolution.</p><p>In this study, we focus on the functional characterization of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> locus because it is recurrently mutated in human patients with ASD/ID. We identified a patient, whose genome harbors a balanced translocation disrupting the <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> locus without any other detectable pathogenic genetic variations and shows abnormal neurodevelopmental symptoms; therefore, implicating this lncRNA as a critical regulator of brain development and function. The father of the proband carries the same translocation and suffers from dyslexia and stuttering, suggesting that the phenotype may be transmitted in a Mendelian manner. However, the much milder phenotype of the father implies that additional genes, environmental factors, or compensatory neuronal circuitry acquired during adulthood may influence the severity of the outcome.</p><p>Given the close genomic proximity of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> and <italic>NR2F1</italic> increased attention must be devoted to consider the possibility of a contribution of the coding gene. Since unknown regulatory elements for the coding gene could be affected the human genetics data are not decisive. However, several functional experiments point to a contribution of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> rather than the coding gene. First, gain and loss of function studies as well as chromatin localization clearly show that <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> acts in trans to affect gene expression. Second, we can rescue the phenotype of the <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> KO by overexpression of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> mRNA. Third, <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> overexpression in <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> KO cells does not affect <italic>Nr2f1</italic> expression. Fourth, ChIRP-sequencing of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> in induced neurons derived from mES cells does not show binding of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> in the <italic>Nr2f1</italic> promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The only definitive answer may be obtained from human postmortem tissue analysis of affected patients.</p><p>Neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders are complex diseases manifesting in a spectrum of phenotypes. We integrated lncRNA expression pattern, in vitro functional screen, and human genetic data to pinpoint potentially causal lncRNAs. We concentrated on genomic lesions affecting lncRNAs, which have been largely understudied regulatory factors in these diseases, and connected them to specific phenotypes. We found several of the lncRNA candidates were disrupted by focal chromosomal aberrations in patients diagnosed with ASD/ID, establishing a link between human disease and lncRNA function. The advent of next generation sequencing has greatly improved the ability to pinpoint causal disease mutations in protein coding genes including the discovery of novel autism genes. Most of the other functional regions of the genome, however, have largely been ignored as part of exome sequencing approaches. While full genome sequencing of patients is beginning, functional interpretation remains a daunting challenge. We present a strategy to begin to characterize the functionally important non-coding regions as it relates to disease. Our work highlights lncRNA mutations as an understudied and important potential next frontier in human genetics related to neurodevelopmental disease.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="bottom">Designation</th><th valign="bottom">Source</th><th valign="top">Identifier</th><th valign="bottom">Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-H3</td><td>Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab1791 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_302613">AB_302613</ext-link>)</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Goat polyclonal <break/>anti-Sox1</td><td>R and D</td><td valign="top">AF3369 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2239879">AB_2239879</ext-link>)</td><td valign="bottom">IHC (1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Rabbit polyclonal <break/>anti-β-III-tubulin</td><td>Covance</td><td valign="top">Discontinued</td><td valign="bottom">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Mouse monoclonal <break/>anti-Nestin</td><td>R and D</td><td valign="top">MAB1259 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2251304">AB_2251304</ext-link>)</td><td valign="bottom">IHC (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal <break/>anti-HSP90</td><td>Cell Signalling</td><td valign="top">4877 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2233307">AB_2233307</ext-link>)</td><td valign="bottom">WB (1:2500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td>Rabbit monoclonal <break/>anti-Nr2f1</td><td>Cell Signalling</td><td valign="top">6364 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11220432">AB_11220432</ext-link>)</td><td valign="bottom">WB (1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>SB431542</td><td>Tocris</td><td valign="top">1614</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>LDN198189</td><td>MiliporeSigma</td><td valign="top">5.09882.0001</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>CHIR99021</td><td>StemGent</td><td valign="top">04–0004</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>PD0325901</td><td>Axon</td><td valign="top">1408</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Leukemia <break/>Inhibitory Factor</td><td>Generated in the lab</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Cell line (H.

The following antibodies were used for RIP: Rabbit anti-H3 (Abcam ab1791) and rabbit IgG (Abcam ab37415). For the H3 RIP-seq analysis we used a similar pipeline to bulk RNAseq assays. We first remove duplicate reads, clip adaptor sequences, discard short reads. Reads were then aligned to mm9 using Tophat2. Using samtools we convert the files from sam file to bam format. Filtered reads are normalized to sequence depth, and subsequently we calculate RPKM. The RIP-seq experiment was conducted with H3 and IgG antibodies.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The novel lncRNA <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> is pro-neurogenic and mutated in human neurodevelopmental disorders&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study characterizes the gene regulatory functions of <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> in neuronal cell maturation and its potential implication in ASD/ID. Previously the lncRNAs have been shown to have gene regulatory functions in various contexts and even implicated in diseases through genome-wide correlation studies. Nonetheless, scant information has been available for demonstrating a causal role of lncRNAs in the pathogenesis of a disease.</p><p>This study opens with a differential screen for regulated lncRNA expression in induced neurons reprogrammed from MEFs by BAM factor expression. This allows the authors to focus in on the set of lncRNAs that are most likely to be relevant in neural differentiation. They then map these lncRNAs to human homologs and look for cases in which they fall within regions that have neural disease associated CNVs. Validation of a small number of these lncRNAs confirms their altered expression in ASD/ID patient-derived cells. One of these, <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic>, is within a larger region associated with developmental disability, but the authors map at least one lncNR2F1-restricted deletion in a child and father. To test the function of this lncRNA in neural development they generated matched sets of mouse ES cells with overexpression or loss-of-function and demonstrate cellular effects which, though somewhat subtle, seem consistent. Finally, the authors provide a series of experiments in which they use the lncRNA as a substrate for DNA IP to find the bound targets, then compare against gene expression data for the validation of target regulation. These data tell a compelling story about <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> as a contributor to the gene expression program that controls neuronal differentiation.</p><p>The manuscript has two significant strengths – one is the overall strategy, which as the authors suggest could be used as a broader platform for identification of additional neural development-associated lncRNAs. The second is the biochemical study of lncNR2F1, which offers a novel characterization of this lncRNA. The study does not go very far towards establishing the specific biological functions of this lncRNA, though the cellular assays combined with the genetics are certainly strongly suggestive that it plays an important role, and further functional studies were viewed by the reviewers as beyond the scope of the current study. However, we did have several questions/comments mainly related to the studies about the evolutionarily conserved features of the lncRNA and the isoform-specific differences in the functionality, as well as some clarifications/controls that we considered essential to address, some of which may require additional experimentation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers had several questions/concerns about the experiments regarding the distinct isoforms of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> that need to be addressed either through experimentation or clarification. These include the following:</p><p>The authors emphasized the strong conservation in exon sequences among different species and isoform-specific functionality in gene regulation and disease-relevance. Indeed, evidence was presented to show that the short isoform of the human <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is nonfunctional in the neuronal maturation process and disease manifestation. But all isoforms contain the three conserved exons, and it appears that the functional mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is structurally most similar to the human short isoform. It would be more compelling if a structure-function analysis of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> could be performed to determine the critical functional domain of the lncRNA in gene regulation. It could be that a specific domain structure or sequence in within the <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> commonly mediates the interactions with bHLH factors and others.</p><p>There are two isoforms of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> present in the mouse. Please describe which isoform was used or targeted in the experiments or whether either isoform was equally effective or not. Only the shorter isoform contains all three conserved exons, thus the isoform-specific analysis could provide functional evidence for the importance of the conserved sequences.</p><p>The presence of all human/mouse isoforms with expected size should be experimentally validated (e.g., Northern).</p><p>In Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, it should be shown that the levels of overexpressed isoforms are comparable to each other to ensure that the functional differences are not caused by the expression level difference. Figure 5B does not look convincing in that the quantitative differences between the isoforms 2 and 3 are very small, which could be due to the quantitative differences in the expression levels of individual isoforms. In Figure 5B, the two presumably functional isoforms 1 and 2 results in the opposite phenotypes in the maturation assay, which is a bit hard to interpret.</p><p>2) The following point needs to be resolved: Figure 2D and E do not seem to match. RNA FISH analysis shows a predominant localization in the nucleus whereas cellular fractionation shows a slightly more enrichment in the cytoplasm. Was the RNA FISH probe designed from the exonal regions only, which will detect only mature form? It would be important to experimentally validate whether <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is indeed spliced and resides in the nucleus, and also to quantify the relative abundance of the mature and precursor forms present in the developing neurons. It might be that the mature form will leave the nucleus and localized in the cytoplasm.</p><p>3) We suggest strengthening the data to address the following concern: Given the strong sequence conservations in exons among different species, it would be advised to analyze the potential protein-coding capacity of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic>. The protein-coding capacity analysis could be done without much work and even computationally, but it is important to make sure that the lncRNA acts as RNA.</p><p>4) Finally, two points were raised that if addressed would help to strengthen the story, though we did not see them as essential for acceptance of the manuscript. We include these concerns here for the authors in case they have data or clarifications that they may wish to add in order to resolve these points:</p><p>The first group of questions related to the cellular phenotype of the lncRNA KO: Is the <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> KO phenotype consistent with a reduction in the number and neurite length of neurons? It would be of interest to know whether there is a direct effect of the knockout of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> on the Ascl1-mediated neuronal reprogramming of MEFs. The rescue experiment in ES cells nicely demonstrates the specificity of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> LOF analysis, and further implies that <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> might work in trans. But the authors did not examine the neuronal maturation phenotypes of the <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> LOF. For comparison, <italic>Nr2f1</italic> KO did not result in any change in the neurite length or number in mES-iN cells which led the authors to conclude that <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> might function independently of the neighboring gene. It would be more complete evidence if a phenotypic consequence from <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> LOF is observed. The loss-of-function study in ES cells should be accompanied by an experimental validation of the mutagenesis cassette-dependent loss of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic>.</p><p>The second set of questions relates to the transcriptional mechanism of the lncRNA action: An unresolved question is how <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> promotes neurogenic genes. The ChIRP analysis suggested a model shown in Figure 4F that <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> binds to the bHLH motif-enriched sites to regulate the downstream neuronal genes. One possible scenario is that it could cooperate with bHLH neurogenenic factors to facilitate their functions in gene expression. Assuming that <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> itself is not sufficient for promoting neuronal reprogramming (or is it?), the <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> might require to work with overexpressed Ngn2 in ES cells in the model system. If then, shouldn't its ChIRP peak sites be significantly overlapped with Ngn2 motifs? Alternatively, ChIP-seq of overexpressed Ngn2 could be performed to examine the binding site overlap between Ngn2 and <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic>.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41770.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers had several questions/concerns about the experiments regarding the distinct isoforms of lnc-Nr2f1 that need to be addressed either through experimentation or clarification.

However, the last exon of both short or long mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> vs. human is not conserved. It is thus difficult to draw a parallel between the mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> and the short isoform of human <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic>. The other pertinent point is all three isoforms we used in the paper are about the same length: 3620, 2697, 2814bp for isoform I, II and III respectively. We used long and short to imply if it spans a long or short genomic loci. To address the reviewer question, we would like to point the data we showed in the original figures.</p><p>We performed domain ChIRP using probes targeting the short and long isoform-specific exons (Figure 5A). Comparing to the long isoform of human <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic>, the short isoform of human <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> binds to significantly fewer genomic loci (Figure 5C) and the genes in cis are not enriched for any neuronal gene ontology terms. In contrast, the genomic targets of the long isoform of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is enriched for neuronal GO term) (Figure 5F).</p><p>We overexpressed each of the three isoforms of human <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> in neuroblastoma cell lines, and only the first and second long isoform gave significant up/downregulation of a set of genes. The third and shorter isoform did not change the gene expression (Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). These results suggest that the sequences present in the long isoform are most relevant to <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> function described in this work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are two isoforms of lnc-Nr2f1 present in the mouse.

During iN reprogramming, we only detected the expression of this isoform (see red boxes in UCSC browser tracks <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). The first exon of the other mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> isoforms (named AK044036 and AK051417, see green box in UCSC browser track) has no detected read in both the BAM 22d sample and cortical neurons.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41770.027</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41770-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The presence of all human/mouse isoforms with expected size should be experimentally validated (e.g., Northern).</p></disp-quote><p>We attempted Northern analysis twice but was not successful. We observed a smear in the Northern and saw no difference in the hybridization signal for WT and <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> KO cells. Hence, we believe that the Northern signal was nonspecific, and thus far is not informative of RNA isoforms. We therefore turned to a different strategy to validate the RNA isoform annotations that was used. We interrogated the published long RNA-sequencing data of brain cells from Tilgner and coworkers (Tilgner, 2013), we found that all isoforms that we reported in the paper were detected in vivo.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41770.028</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41770-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 5B and Figure 5—figure supplement 1F, it should be shown that the levels of overexpressed isoforms are comparable to each other to ensure that the functional differences are not caused by the expression level difference.

Figure 5B shows that overexpression of the three isoforms of human <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> improve the maturation of mouse induced neuronal cells, while Figure 5—figure supplement 1F shows the transcriptional effects of overexpressing the three isoforms of human <italic>lnc-NR2F1</italic> in human neuroblastoma cells. One can reasonably conclude that overexpression of isoform 2 leads to better iN maturation compared to isoform 3 (Figure 5B) and this is likely due to the differences in transcriptional responses (note the number of differentially expressed genes in Figure 5—figure supplement 1F). We agree that it was unexpected to find isoform 1, while giving the highest transcriptional responses, hampers iN reprogramming. We know that cell fate reprogramming is a process involving sequential dynamic waves of chromatin changes and gene expression. There might be a precarious balance where too much gene expression or expression ahead of schedule reduces productive neuronal maturation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The following point needs to be resolved: Figure 2D and E do not seem to match.

RNA FISH showed predominant enrichment in the nucleus, but there were also detectable signals in the cytoplasm. We have replaced Figure 2D with a longer exposure of the RNA FISH to show the cytoplasmic signal. Thus, the cellular fractionation and the RNA FISH agrees with each other.</p><p>The probes in the RNA FISH target only the exons; therefore, the strong nuclear signal of <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is not due to intronic signal from nascent RNAs. To determine whether mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is indeed spliced, we performed fractionation followed by RT-PCR on day 4 mouse embryonic stem cells derived induced neurons. As one can see from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig3">Author response image 3</xref>, spliced mouse <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> resides both in the nucleus (especially in the chromatin) and in the cytoplasm as indicated by two independent primer pairs that span exon-exon junction. These multiple lines of evidence suggest that the predominant pool (if not all) of mature <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> is nuclear and associated with chromatin.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41770.029</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>(<bold>A</bold>) Gel showing the different RNA species in different cellular fractions.</title><p>The protocol reported by Conrad et al., 2017 was used.

The down regulation of axon pathfinding genes in <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> KO was rescued when we expressed lnc-Nr2f1 in trans. The axon pathfinding genes raise the possibility that axonal pathfinding or neuronal circuit connection may be affected. These additional studies are best addressed using in vivo model and might be beyond the scope of the present study but will be of interest to explore in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second set of questions relates to the transcriptional mechanism of the lncRNA action: An unresolved question is how lnc-Nr2f1 promotes neurogenic genes.

We performed and analyzed ChIP-seq data of bHLH neurogenic factors Ngn2 and Ascl1 as suggested. We then compared the lncNr2f1 ChIRP-seq data with the ChIP-seq data at the level of individual peaks and peak associated genes (nominated by the algorithm GREAT). We found that direct overlap between lncNr2f1 ChIRP-seq peaks and ChIP-seq peaks are low but statistically significant. 3.2% and 13.2% lncNr2f1 ChIRP-seq peaks overlapped with or binding within 5kb to Ngn2 and Ascl1 ChIP peaks, respectively (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,G). Despite that, lncNr2f1 target genes overlap very significantly with Ngn2 (37.9%) or Ascl1 (67.3%) target genes (Figure 4—figure supplement 1F,G) at the level of peak-associated genes. These results suggest that lncNr2f1 and bHLH transcription factors such as Ascl1 and Ngn2 may coordinately regulate the same set of neuronal genes, and the majority of instances occur with <italic>lnc-Nr2f1</italic> and the bHLH factors binding nearby but non-overlapping sites. We have added a sentence in the Results section to report this finding.</p></body></sub-article></article>
