These synapses are defined by electron-dense presynaptic structures called ribbons, composed primarily of the structural protein Ribeye. Previous work has shown that voltage-gated influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels is critical for hair-cell synapse function and can impede ribbon formation. We show that in mature zebrafish hair cells, evoked presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels initiates mitochondrial-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup>) uptake adjacent to ribbons. Block of mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in mature cells depresses presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and impacts synapse integrity. In developing zebrafish hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake coincides with spontaneous rises in presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Spontaneous mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading lowers cellular NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox and downregulates ribbon size. Direct application of NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH increases or decreases ribbon size respectively, possibly acting through the NAD(H)-binding domain on Ribeye. Our results present a mechanism where presynaptic- and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> couple to confer proper presynaptic function and formation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Hearing depends upon specialized cells deep within the ear called hair cells. These cells take their name from the bundles of hair-like fibers found on their surface, which move when sound waves enter the ear. This movement activates the hair cells, which send signals to nearby neurons at contact points called synapses. Hair cells must send messages to their synaptic partners rapidly and continuously in order for humans to follow complex streams of sound, such as speech. This requires large amounts of energy, which are produced by compartments inside the hair cells called mitochondria.</p><p>Wong et al. show that mitochondria, which are often described as the ‘power plants’ of cells, are critical for hair cell synapses to form and work correctly. But rather than studying hair cells in the human ear, Wong et al. took advantage of the fact that another species – the zebrafish – has hair cells on its body surface. These cells detect movements in water rather than sound waves, but they work in much the same way as hair cells in the ear, and are easier to access and study.</p><p>Wong et al. report that in zebrafish larvae, developing hair cells send spontaneous signals to their contact neurons even before they start receiving any sensory input. But if mitochondria in the hair cells fail to detect these signals, the synapses fail to form correctly. In older zebrafish, mature hair cells send signals to their synaptic partners whenever they detect sensory input. But if mitochondria fail to detect these signals, the synapses stop working and ultimately break down.</p><p>These findings help explain why damage to mitochondria in the inner ear can lead to hearing loss. Moreover, because mitochondria are present in almost all cells, their disruption causes a wide range of diseases. Many of these involve the brain, which requires large amounts of energy and so is particularly vulnerable to mitochondrial damage. These results may provide insights into such disorders.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mitochondrial calcium</kwd><kwd>ribbon synapse</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>sensory cell</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1ZIADC000085-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wong</surname><given-names>Hiu-tung C</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Qiuxiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Beirl</surname><given-names>Alisha J</given-names></name><name><surname>Kindt</surname><given-names>Katie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ZICDC000081</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Petralia</surname><given-names>Ronald S</given-names></name><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Ya-Xian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial calcium influx plays distinct roles in presynapse formation, function and stability in sensory hair cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmission is an energy demanding process that relies heavily on mitochondria. In neurons, mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in synaptopathies that impact neurodevelopment, learning and memory, and can contribute to neurodegeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flippo and Strack, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lepeta et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Todorova and Blokland, 2016</xref>). In hair cells, sensory neurotransmission relies on specialized ribbon synapses to facilitate rapid and sustained vesicle release that is particularly energy demanding (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Johnson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lagnado and Schmitz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Safieddine et al., 2012</xref>). Although mitochondrial dysfunction has been implicated in hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böttger and Schacht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischel-Ghodsian et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kokotas et al., 2007</xref>), the precise role mitochondria play at hair-cell synapses remains unclear.</p><p>Ribbon synapses are characterized by a unique presynaptic structure called a ‘ribbon’ that tethers and stabilizes synaptic vesicles at the active zone (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>). In hair cells, neurotransmission at ribbon synapses requires the presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brandt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kollmar et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Sidi et al., 2004</xref>). Hair-cell depolarization opens Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels, resulting in a spatially restricted increase of Ca<sup>2+</sup> at presynaptic ribbons that triggers vesicle fusion. Tight spatial regulation of presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> is important for ribbon-synapse function and requires efficient Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance through a combination of Ca<sup>2+</sup> pumps, Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffers and intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carafoli, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Mulkey and Malenka, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tucker and Fettiplace, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Yamoah et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zenisek and Matthews, 2000</xref>). While ER-Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores have been implicated in hair-cell neurotransmission, whether mitochondrial-Ca<sup>2+</sup> (mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup>) stores play a role in this process remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Castellano-Muñoz and Ricci, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kennedy, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Lioudyno et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tucker and Fettiplace, 1995</xref>).</p><p>In addition to a role in hair-cell neurotransmission, presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels also play an important role during inner-ear development. In mammals, prior to hearing onset, auditory hair cells fire spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eckrich et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Marcotti et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tritsch et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Tritsch et al., 2010</xref>). In mammalian hair cells, these Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials are Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-dependent and are thought to be important for synapse and circuit formation. In support of this idea, in vivo work in zebrafish hair cells found that increasing or decreasing voltage-gated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels during development led to the formation of smaller or larger ribbons respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>). Furthermore, in mouse knockouts of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3, auditory outer hair cells have reduced afferent innervation and synapse number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ceriani et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanistically, how Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel activity regulates ribbon size and innervation, and whether hair-cell Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores play a role in this process is not known.</p><p>Cumulative work has shown that ribbon size varies between species and sensory epithelia (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moser et al., 2006</xref>); these variations are thought to reflect important encoding requirements of a given sensory cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Matthews and Fuchs, 2010</xref>). In auditory hair cells, excitotoxic noise damage can also alter ribbon size and lead to hearing deficits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liberman et al., 2015</xref>). Excitotoxic damage is thought to be initiated by mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> overload and subsequent ROS production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Böttger and Schacht, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Mechanistically, precisely how ribbon size is established during development or altered under pathological conditions is not fully understood.</p><p>One known way to regulate ribbon size is through its main structural component Ribeye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). Perhaps unsurprisingly, previous work has shown that overexpression or depletion of Ribeye in hair cells can increase or decrease ribbon size respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Becker et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jean et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lv et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sheets, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>). Ribeye is a splice variant of the transcriptional co-repressor Carboxyl-terminal binding protein 2 (CtBP2) – a splice variant that is unique to vertebrate evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). Ribeye contains a unique A-domain and a B-domain that is nearly identical to full-length CtBP2. The B-domain contains a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADH or NAD(H)) binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Magupalli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). NAD(H) redox is linked to mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Srivastava, 2016</xref>). Because CtBPs are able to bind and detect NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH levels, they are thought to function as metabolic biosensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Stankiewicz et al., 2014</xref>). For example, previous work has demonstrated that changes in NAD(H) redox can impact CtBP oligomerization and its transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fjeld et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Thio et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, in vitro work has shown that both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH can also promote interactions between Ribeye domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Magupalli et al., 2008</xref>). Whether NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH can impact Ribeye interactions and ribbon formation or stability has not been confirmed in vivo.</p><p>In neurons, it is well established that during presynaptic activity, mitochondria clear and store Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the presynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devine and Kittler, 2018</xref>). Additionally, presynaptic activity and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> can couple together to influence cellular bioenergetics, including NAD(H) redox homeostasis (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kann and Kovács, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Llorente-Folch et al., 2015</xref>). Based on these studies, we hypothesized that Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels may regulate mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup>, which in turn could regulate NAD(H) redox. Changes to cellular bioenergetics and NAD(H) redox could function to control Ribeye interactions and ribbon formation or impact ribbon-synapse function and stability.</p><p>To study the impact of mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) redox on ribbon synapses, we examined hair cells in the lateral-line system of larval zebrafish. This system is advantageous because it contains hair cells with easy access for in vivo pharmacology, mechanical stimulation and imaging cellular morphology and function. Within the lateral-line, hair cells are arranged in clusters called neuromasts. The hair cells and ribbon synapses in each cluster form rapidly between 2 to 3 days post-fertilization (dpf) but by 5–6 dpf, the majority of hair cells are mature, and the system is functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">McHenry et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Metcalfe, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Murakami et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Santos et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, these two ages (2–3 dpf and 5–6 dpf) can be used to study mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) redox in developing and mature hair cells respectively.</p><p>Using this sensory system, we find that presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx drives mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. In mature hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake occurs during evoked stimulation and is required to sustain presynaptic function and ultimately synapse integrity. In developing hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake coincides with spontaneous rises in presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Blocking these spontaneous changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> leads to the formation of larger ribbons. Using a redox biosensor, we demonstrate that specifically in developing hair cells, decreasing mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increases the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox ratio. Furthermore, we show that application of NAD<sup>+</sup> or NADH can promote the formation of larger or smaller ribbons respectively. Overall, our results suggest that in hair cells presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake couple in hair cells to impact ribbon formation and function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mitochondria are located near presynaptic ribbons</title><p>In neurons, synaptic mitochondria have been shown to influence synapse size, plasticity and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Flippo and Strack, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Todorova and Blokland, 2016</xref>). Based on this work, we hypothesized that mitochondria may impact synapses in hair cells. Therefore, we examined the proximity of mitochondria relative to presynaptic ribbons in zebrafish lateral-line hair cells. We visualized mitochondria and ribbons using transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and in vivo using Airyscan confocal microscopy.</p><p>Using TEM, we examined sections that clearly captured ribbons (Example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Near the majority of ribbons (81%) we observed a mitochondrion in close proximity (&lt;1 µm) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, median ribbon-to-mitochondria distance = 174 nm, n = 17 out of 21 ribbons). To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the 3D morphology and location of mitochondria relative to ribbons in live cells, we used Airyscan confocal microscopy. To visualize these structures in living cells, we used transgenic zebrafish expressing MitoGCaMP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>) and Ribeye a-tagRFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sheets et al., 2014</xref>) in hair cells to visualize mitochondria and ribbons respectively. Using this approach, we observed tubular networks of mitochondria extending from apex to base (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B,E–E’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). At the base of the hair cell, we observed ribbons nestled between branches of mitochondria. Overall our TEM and Airyscan imaging suggests that in lateral-line hair cells, mitochondria are present near ribbons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake initiates adjacent to ribbons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon illustration of a lateral-line hair cell containing: an apical mechanosensory bundle (blue), mitochondria (green), presynaptic ribbons (magenta), Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels (orange) and postsynaptic densities (purple).

Due to the proximity of the mitochondria to the ribbon, we predicted that rises in mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels during mechanical stimulation could be related to presynapse-associated rises in Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>To test this prediction, we used a fluid-jet to mechanically stimulate hair cells and evoke presynaptic activity. During stimulation, we used MitoGCaMP3 to monitor mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> in lateral-line hair cells. As previously reported, we observed robust mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake during stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We examined the subcellular distribution of MitoGCaMP3 signals over time and observed an increase in MitoGCaMP3 (∆F) signals that initiated near ribbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, ∆F). During the latter part of the stimulus, and even after the stimulus terminated, the MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically, away from the ribbons (Example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E’–E’’</xref>, regions 1–3, ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>). We characterized the time-course of MitoGCaMP3 signals with regards to onset kinetics and return to baseline. During a 2 s stimulus, we detected a significant rise in MitoGCaMP3 signals 0.6 s after stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>). Interestingly, after the stimulus terminated, MitoGCaMP3 levels took approximately 5 min to return to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–C’</xref>, ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>). Despite this long time-course of recovery to baseline, we were still able to evoke additional rises in MitoGCaMP3 signal 10 s after stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>). As previously reported, the kinetics of MitoGCaMP3 signals in hair-cell mitochondria were quite different from signals observed using cytosolic GCaMP3 (CytoGCaMP3) in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to MitoGCaMP3 signals, CytoGCaMP3 signals had faster onset kinetics and a faster return to baseline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>, time to rise: 0.06 s, post-stimulus return to baseline: 12 s). These differences in kinetics indicate that mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading operates over slower timescales compared to the cytosolic compartment. It also confirms that hair-cell stimulation can initiate long lasting increases in mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>To verify that MitoGCaMP3 signals reflect Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria, we applied Ru360, an antagonist of the mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uniporter (MCU). The MCU is the main pathway for rapid Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into the mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Matlib et al., 1998</xref>). We found that stimulus-evoked MitoGCaMP3 signals were blocked in a dose-dependent manner after a 30 min treatment with Ru360 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>; IC<sub>50</sub> = 1.37 µM). We confirmed these results by applying TRO 19622, an antagonist of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). VDAC enables transport of ions including Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the outer mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schein et al., 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Shoshan-Barmatz and Gincel, 2003</xref>). We observed that similar to the MCU antagonist Ru360, a 30 min treatment with the VDAC antagonist TRO 19622 also impaired stimulus-evoked MitoGCaMP3 signals (10 µM TRO 19622, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Due to the initiation of mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> near ribbons, we examined whether presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels was the main source of Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering the mitochondria. To examine Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel contribution to mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake, we applied isradipine, a Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel antagonist. Similar to blocking the MCU and VDAC, blocking Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels eliminated all stimulus-evoked MitoGCaMP3 signals at the base of the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><p>Previous work in zebrafish-hair cells demonstrated that isradipine specifically blocks Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels without impairing mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). For our current study we confirmed whether Ru360 and TRO 19622 specifically block synaptic mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake without impairing mechanotransduction. We measured apical, mechanically evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in hair bundles before and after a 30 min treatment with 10 µM Ru360 or TRO 19622. Neither compound blocked mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>).

But why regulate ribbon size?</p><p>Previous work has reported variations in ribbon size and shape among hair-cell types and species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Moser et al., 2006</xref>). In many instances ribbon size is correlated with functional properties of the synapse. For example, in the mammalian vestibular system, the ribbons of type II dimorphic hair cells in the striolar region are larger than those in the extrastriolar region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lysakowski and Goldberg, 1997</xref>). Functionally, afferents that innervate hair cells with larger ribbons in the striolar region have lower rates of spontaneous activity compared to afferents that innervate hair cells in the extrastriolar region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eatock et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Goldberg et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Risner and Holt, 2006</xref>). Similarly, in the mammalian auditory system, ribbon size is correlated with differences in afferent activity. Inner hair cells are populated by ribbons with a range of sizes, each of which is innervated by a unique afferent fiber. Compared to smaller ribbons, larger ribbons within inner hair cells are innervated by afferent fibers with higher thresholds of activation and lower rates of spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kalluri and Monges-Hernandez, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Liberman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liberman et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Liberman et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Merchan-Perez and Liberman, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Yin et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, in mice differences in ribbon size can be distinguished just after the onset of hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Liberman and Liberman, 2016</xref>). This timing suggests that similar to our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), activity during development may help determine ribbon size.</p><p>Previous work in the zebrafish-lateral line has also examined how ribbon enlargement impacts synapse function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheets et al., 2017</xref>). This work overexpressed Ribeye in zebrafish hair cells to dramatically enlarge ribbons. Functionally, compared to controls, hair cells with enlarged ribbons were associated with afferent neurons with lower spontaneous activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheets et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, the onset encoding, or the timing of the first afferent spike upon stimulation, was significantly delayed in hair cells with enlarged ribbons. Together, both studies in zebrafish and mammals indicate that ribbon size can impact the functional properties of the synapse. Based on these studies, we predict that the alterations to ribbon size we observed in our current study would impact functional properties of the synapse in a similar manner. For example, pharmacological treatments that enlarge ribbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: MCU channel block; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>: exogenous NAD<sup>+</sup>) would also lower spontaneous spiking in afferents and delay onset encoding.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ribeye and CtBP localization at synapses</title><p>In this study, we found that NAD(H) redox state had a dramatic effect on ribbon formation. NAD<sup>+</sup> promotes while NADH reduces ribbon size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The main component of ribbons is Ribeye. Ribeye has two domains, a unique A domain and a B domain that contains an NAD(H) binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). In vitro work on isolated A and B domains has shown that both NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH can affect interactions between A and B domains as well as interactions between B domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Magupalli et al., 2008</xref>). In the context of ribbons, the B domain has been shown to concentrate at the interface between the ribbon and the membrane opposing the postsynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Sheets et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, promoting B domain homodimerization may act to seed larger ribbons at the presynapse. In this scenario, NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH could increase and decrease B domain homodimerization to impact ribbon size. We also observed an increase in cytoplasmic Ribeye aggregates after MCU block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). Therefore, it is alternatively possible that NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH could impact interactions between A and B domains more broadly. NAD(H) redox could alter Ribeye interactions and alter the overall accumulation or separation of Ribeye within aggregates or at the presynapse.</p><p>Work in zebrafish has characterized lateral-line hair cells largely depleted of full-length Ribeye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). When viewed using TEM, ribbons in Ribeye-depleted hair cells are strikingly transparent, suggesting that full-length Ribeye is required for the characteristic electron-dense structure of ribbons. Although these ribbons are smaller compared to controls, they are still able to tether vesicles near the active zone. Ribeye-depleted hair cells could be used to test whether mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) redox regulate ribbons size by impacting Ribeye interactions. If full-length Ribeye and its NAD(H) binding domain are the site of regulation, Ribeye-depleted hair cells would be unaffected by perturbations in mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H).</p><p>Regardless of the exact mechanism, the effect of presynaptic activity, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and related changes in NAD(H) redox homeostasis may extend beyond the sensory ribbon synapse. Ribeye is a splice variant of the transcriptional co-repressor CtBP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schmitz et al., 2000</xref>). While the A domain is unique to Ribeye, the B domain is nearly identical to CtBP2 minus the nuclear localization sequence (NLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hübler et al., 2012</xref>). In vertebrates, the CtBP family also includes CtBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chinnadurai, 2007</xref>). CtBP proteins are expressed in both hair cells and the nervous system, and there is evidence that both CtBP1 and CtBP2 may act as scaffolds at neuronal synapses. Interestingly, in cultured neurons, it has been shown that both synaptic activity and increased levels of NADH were associated with increased CtBP1 localization at the presynapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ivanova et al., 2015</xref>). In our in vivo study, we also found that the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio was lower (more NADH) in developing hair cells with intact presynaptic- and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). But in contrast to the in vitro work on CtBP1 in cultured neurons, we found that Ribeye localization to the presynapse and ribbon size were reduced when NADH levels were increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>). It is unclear why presynaptic activity regulates Ribeye localization differently from that of CtBP1. Ribeye and CtBP1 behavior may differ due to the divergent function of their N-terminal domains. Synaptic localization may also be influenced by external factors, such as the cell type in which the synapse operates, whether the study is performed in vitro or in vivo, as well as the maturity of the synapse. Overall, both studies demonstrate that the presynaptic localization of CtBP family members CtBP1 and Ribeye can be influenced by synaptic activity and NAD(H) redox state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in mature hair cells</title><p>Sensory hair cells are metabolically demanding cells – both apical mechanotransduction and basal neurotransmission are energy demanding processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Shin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Spinelli et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that hair-cell mitochondria play important roles in both of these functional domains. In mammalian auditory hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has been observed to buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup> beneath mechanosensory hair bundles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beurg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fettiplace and Nam, 2019</xref>). Blocking this uptake prolonged evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> rises in hair bundles. This work suggested that apical mitochondria, along with the plasma membrane Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase (PMCA) contribute to cyto-Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance to maintain optimal mechanotransduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beurg et al., 2010</xref>). Although the focus of our present study was on the synapse, we also found that blocking mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake using Ru360 (MCU antagonist) or TRO 19622 (VDAC antagonist) increased mechanosensitive-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in zebrafish lateral-line hair bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>). In the future it will be extremely interesting to explore the role apical mitochondria play in mechanotransduction.</p><p>In the presynaptic region of hair cells, the link between mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and neurotransmission is less clear. Studies of synapses in various neuronal subtypes have demonstrated that mitochondria play multiple roles to maintain neurotransmission including: ATP production, Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering and signaling, and neurotransmitter synthesis (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kann and Kovács, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Vos et al., 2010</xref>). A study on synaptic mitochondria at ribbon synapses in retinal-bipolar cells found that mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was sporadic and did not significantly contribute to Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance or the time course of evoked presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zenisek and Matthews, 2000</xref>). This work concluded that mitochondria may contribute indirectly to Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from the synaptic terminal by providing ATP to fuel the PMCA. Our current work indicates that there is robust and reproducible mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at the hair-cell presynapse during stimulation. But similar to work on retinal-bipolar cell ribbons, blocking mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake did not raise cyto-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, indicating it may not be critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Instead, cyto-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may be maintained by the PMCA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beurg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bortolozzi et al., 2010</xref>). Alternatively, cyto-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may be maintained by the numerous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering proteins such as parvalbumin, calretinin, oncomodulin, calbindin and calmodulin that have been identified in hair cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dechesne et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eybalin and Ripoll, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hackney, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Pack and Slepecky, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Pangršič et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rabié et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Simmons et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In our current study on basal, synaptic mitochondria, we found that in mature zebrafish-hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was critical for presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Even partial block of evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was sufficient to impair presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, especially during sustained stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E’</xref>). Instead of buffering Ca<sup>2+</sup>, our work indicates that mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake may impact Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>). In mature hair cells, after MCU block, impaired presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses coincided with an increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density at the presynapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–H</xref>). Unfortunately, the majority of studies on Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in hair cells focus on activity changes after a decrease or loss of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel clustering. For example in Ribeye-depleted zebrafish hair cells Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels failed to cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lv et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, when ribbons were enlarged in zebrafish-hair cells, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density was reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheets et al., 2017</xref>). In these studies, after a loss or reduction of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel clustering, presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were increased. Therefore, it is possible that an increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density could incur the opposite effect and decrease presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. But how could an increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density decrease presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses? An increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density could enhance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent inactivation among tightly clustered Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels. In hair cells, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels exhibit reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependent inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Koschak et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Platzer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Song et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Xu and Lipscombe, 2001</xref>). This reduction is thought to be important to transmit sustained sensory stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kollmar et al., 1997</xref>). Alternatively, an increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density could be a compensatory strategy to boost presynaptic activity after MCU block and impaired presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. If channel density is not responsible for impaired presynaptic function, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake could be critical to produce energy for other cellular tasks to maintain neurotransmission. Additional work is necessary to fully understand how evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake functions to sustain presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx in mature zebrafish hair cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Role of mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> in metabolism versus pathology</title><p>In addition to a role in synapse function, mitochondria have been studied in the context of cellular metabolism and cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Devine and Kittler, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Tait and Green, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Vakifahmetoglu-Norberg et al., 2017</xref>). Our work suggests that mitochondria may play distinct roles in these processes in developing and mature hair cells. We found that mitochondria spontaneously take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> at the presynapse during hair-cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). Blocking presynaptic- and mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities rapidly decreased the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratio and altered ribbon size in developing hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). However, in mature hair cells, blocking these activities was pathological and did not influence NAD(H) redox (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).</p><p>Some insight into these differences can be inferred from cardiac myocytes where the relationship between mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) redox has been extensively studied. Similar to our results in developing hair cells, in cardiac myocytes, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> drives cellular metabolism, which reduces NAD<sup>+</sup> to NADH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertero and Maack, 2018</xref>). In cardiac myocytes NADH is oxidized to NAD<sup>+</sup> when the MCU is blocked. These results are consistent with the changes in NAD(H) redox we observed in developing, but not mature hair cells. Instead, after complete MCU block in mature hair cells, we observed a loss of hair cells and synapses, and an increase in ribbon size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). This outcome may be more similar to what occurs in heart failure or after extended MCU block – in cardiac myocytes, the production of oxidized NAD<sup>+</sup> quickly leads to energetic deficits, oxidative stress and ultimately the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertero and Maack, 2018</xref>). This is consistent with work in many cell types where mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> loading is associated with pathological processes such as ROS production, cell death and synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai and Tammineni, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Court and Coleman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">DiMauro and Schon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esterberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sheng and Cai, 2012</xref>). Therefore, in mature hair cells, it is possible that after MCU block, changes in NAD(H) redox quickly become pathological. Recent work has suggested that younger hair cells may be more resilient to ototoxins, perhaps because they have not yet accumulated an excess of mitochondrial oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Pickett et al., 2018</xref>). This could explain why complete MCU block alters NAD(H) redox without any observable pathological consequence in developing hair cells.</p><p>How could synapses be changing in mature hair cells during this pathology? It is possible that individual ribbons in mature hair cells are not enlarging, but instead ribbons are merging together as synapses are lost. Alternatively, remaining ribbons could be enlarging in order to compensate for loss of presynaptic function or synapses. In our current work, ribbon size was measured in fixed samples; therefore, it is difficult to distinguish between these possibilities. There is considerable work that suggests that synaptic structures, including ribbons are indeed dynamic structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hull et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mehta et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Sultemeier et al., 2017</xref>). In the future, live imaging studies will help resolve whether there are different mechanisms underlying ribbon enlargement in mature and developing hair cells.</p><p>Overall the pathology observed in mature hair cells has parallels in recent work on noise-induced hearing that found measurable changes in ribbon morphology and synapse number following noise insult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kujawa and Liberman, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liberman et al., 2015</xref>). Work studying this type of hearing loss has shown that auditory inner hair cells in the high frequency region of the mouse cochlea have enlarged ribbons immediately after noise, followed later by synapse loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Liberman et al., 2015</xref>). This pathology is reminiscent of our 1 hr pharmacological treatments that completely block the MCU in mature zebrafish-hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>). After this treatment, we observed a reduction in the number of hair cells and synapses, and an increase in ribbon size. Overall, these studies and our own data in mature hair cells support the association between mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and the MCU with pathological processes associated with ototoxins and noise-exposure.</p><p>In further support of this idea, recent work in mice has investigated the role of the MCU in noise-related hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). This work demonstrated that pharmacological block or a loss of function mutation in MCU protected against synapse loss in auditory inner hair cells after noise exposure. Although this result is counter to our observed results where complete MCU block reduced synapse number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), it highlights an association between mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup>, noise exposure and synapse integrity. It is possible that these differences can be explained by transitory versus chronic alterations in mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis. These differences may be resolved by studying hair cells in a zebrafish MCU knock out. In the future it will be interesting to examine both mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and ribbon morphology during other pathological conditions that enlarge ribbons such as noise exposure, ototoxicity and aging.</p><p>Overall, our study has demonstrated the zebrafish-lateral line is a valuable system to study the interplay between the mitochondria, and synapse function, development and integrity. In the future it will be exciting to expand this research to explore how evoked and spontaneous mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are impacted by pathological treatments such as age, noise and ototoxins.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>Tübingen</td><td>ZIRC</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZIRC_ZL57">ZIRC_ZL57</ext-link>; ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-990623–3</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td>TL</td><td>ZIRC</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZIRC_ZL86">ZIRC_ZL86</ext-link>; ZFIN ID: ZDB-GENO-990623–2</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(myo6b:GCaMP6s-CAAX)<sup>idc1</sup>;</italic> <break/>GCaMP6sCAAX; 6sCAAX; GCaMP6s</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jiang et al., 2017</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-170113-3">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-170113-3</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-170113-3">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-170113-3</ext-link></td><td>Membrane-localized calcium biosensor</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(myo6b:RGECO1)<sup>vo10Tg</sup></italic>; CytoRGECO1</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Maeda et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-150114-2">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-150114-2</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-150114-2">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-150114-2</ext-link></td><td>Cell-fill calcium biosensor</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(myo6b:GCaMP3)<sup>w78Tg</sup></italic>; CytoGCaMP3</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Esterberg et al., 2013</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-130514-1">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-130514-1</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-130514-1">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-130514-1</ext-link></td><td>Cell-fill calcium biosensor</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(myo6b:mitoGCaMP3)<sup>w119Tg</sup></italic>; MitoGCaMP3; Mito</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Esterberg et al., 2014</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB">ZFIN_ZDB</ext-link>- ALT-141008–1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-141008-1">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-141008-1</ext-link></td><td>Mitochondria-localized calcium biosensor</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(myo6b:ribeye a-tagRFP)<sup>idc11Tg</sup></italic>; Rib a-RFP; Rib a-tagRFP; Rib a</td><td>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sheets, 2017</xref>)</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB">ZFIN_ZDB</ext-link>- ALT-190102–4; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-190102-4">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-190102-4</ext-link></td><td>Ribbon-localized fluorescent protein</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td><italic>Tg(myo6b:mitoRGECO1)<sup>idc12Tg</sup></italic>; MitoRGECO1</td><td>This paper</td><td>RRID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-190102-5">ZFIN_ZDB-ALT-190102-5</ext-link>; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-190102-5">https://zfin.org/ZDB-ALT-190102-5</ext-link></td><td>Mitochondria-localized calcium biosensor.

E3 with 0.1% DMSO or Tris-HCl were used as control solutions. In solution at pH 7.0–7.3, NADH oxidizes into NAD<sup>+</sup> by exposure to dissolved oxygen. To mitigate this, NADH was dissolved immediately before use and was exchanged with a freshly dissolved NADH solution every half hour. Dosages of isradipine, Ru360, Bay K8644, TRO 19622, NAD<sup>+</sup> and NADH did not confer excessive hair-cell death or synapse loss unless stated. After exposure to the compounds, larvae were quickly sedated on ice and transferred to fixative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>In vivo imaging of baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) redox</title><p>To prepare larvae for imaging, larvae were immobilized as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kindt et al., 2012</xref>). Briefly, larvae were anesthetized with tricaine (0.03%) in E3 and pinned to a chamber lined with Sylgard 184 Silicone Elastomer (Dow Corning, Midland, MI). Larvae were injected with 125 µM α-bungarotoxin (Tocris, Bristol, UK) into the pericardial cavity to induce paralysis. Tricaine was rinsed off the larvae and replaced with fresh E3.</p><p>For baseline measurements of Rex-YFP and CytoRGECO1 fluorescence, larvae were imaged using an upright Nikon ECLIPSE Ni-E motorized microscope (Nikon Inc, Tokyo, Japan) in widefield mode with a Nikon 60 × 1.0 NA water-immersion objective, an 480/30 nm excitation and 535/40 nm emission filter set or 520/35 nm excitation and 593/40 emission filter set, and an ORCA-D2 camera (Hamamatsu Photonics K.K., Hamamatsu City, Japan). Acquisitions were taken at 5 Hz, in 15 plane Z-stacks every 2 μm. For baseline measurements of MitoGCaMP3, larvae were imaged using a Bruker Swept-field confocal microscope (Bruker Inc, Billerica, MA), with a Nikon CFI Fluor 60 × 1.0 NA water-immersion objective. A Rolera EM-C2 CCD camera (QImaging, Surrey, Canada) was used to detect signals. Acquisitions were taken using a 70 µm slit at a frame rate of 10 Hz, in 26 plane Z-stacks every 1 μm. MitoGCaMP3 baseline intensity varied dramatically in controls between timepoints. To offset this variability, we acquired and averaged the intensity of 4 Z-stacks per time point. For all baseline measurements transgenic larvae were first imaged in E3 with 0.1% DMSO or 0.1% Tris-HCl as appropriate. Then larvae were exposed to pharmacological agents for 30 min and a second acquisition was taken. Any neuromasts with cell death after pharmacological or mock treatment were excluded from our analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo imaging of evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title><p>To measure evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in hair cells, larvae were immobilized in a similar manner as described for baseline measurements. After α-bungarotoxin paralysis, larvae were immersed in neuronal buffer solution (in mM: 140 NaCl, 2 KCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 HEPES, pH 7.3). Evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements were acquired using the Bruker Swept-field confocal system described above.

Ribbons were located relative to GCaMP6s signals by acquiring a 2-color Z-stack of 5 planes every 1 μm at the base of the hair cells. To correlate presynaptic GCaMP6sCAAX signals with MitoRGECO1 signals in hair cells, 2-color imaging was performed. Images were acquired in a single plane with 2 × 2 binning at 10 Hz with a 70 µM slit. MitoGCaMP3 signals were acquired at 10 Hz in Z-stacks of 5 planes 1 μm apart with 2 × 2 binning and a 70 µM slit. High speed imaging along the Z-axis was accomplished by using a piezoelectric motor (PICMA P-882.11–888.11 series, Physik Instrumente GmbH, Karlsruhe, Germany) attached to the objective to allow rapid imaging at a 50 Hz frame rate yielding a 10 Hz volume rate. Due to the slow mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> return to baseline after stimulation (~5 min), we waited a minimum of 5 min before initiating a new evoked GCaMP6sCAAX or MitoGCaMP3 acquisition. To examine mechanotransduction, GCaMP6sCAAX signals were measured in apical hair bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Apical GCaMP6sCAAX signals were acquired in a single plane at 1 × 1 binning with a 35 µM slit at 20 Hz. For pharmacological treatment, acquisitions were made prior to drug treatment and after a 30 min incubation in the pharmacological agent. Any neuromasts with cell death after pharmacological treatment were excluded from our analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>In vivo imaging of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals</title><p>To measure spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in hair cells, larvae were prepared in a similar manner as described for evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements.

To measure spontaneous presynaptic GCaMP6sCAAX signals, images were acquired with 2 × 2 binning with a 70 µm slit at 0.33 Hz in a single plane for 900 s. For acquisition of two-color spontaneous presynaptic GCaMP6sCAAX and MitoRGECO1 signals images were acquired with 2 × 2 binning with a 70 µm slit at 0.2 Hz in a single plane for 900 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Larvae were prepared for electron microscopy as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Sheets et al., 2017</xref>). Transverse serial sections (~60 nm thin sections) were used to section through neuromasts. Samples were imaged on a JEOL JEM-2100 electron microscope (JEOL Inc, Tokyo, Japan). The distance from the edge of a ribbon density to the edge of the nearest mitochondrion was measured (n = 17 ribbons). A subset of measurements was taken from more than one ribbon within a hair cell. At 81% of ribbons, a mitochondrion could be clearly identified within 1 µm of a ribbon (17 out of 21 ribbons).

Fixative was washed out with 0.01% Tween in PBS (PBST) in four washes, 5 min each. Larvae were then washed for 5 min with H<sub>2</sub>O. The H<sub>2</sub>O was thoroughly removed and replaced with ice-cold acetone and placed at −20°C for 3 min for 3 dpf and 5 min for 5 dpf larvae, followed by a 5 min H<sub>2</sub>O wash. The larvae were then washed for 4 × 5 min in PBST, then incubated in block overnight at 4°C in blocking solution (2% goat serum, 1% bovine serum albumin, 2% fish skin gelatin in PBST). Primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in blocking solution. Primary antibodies and their respective dilutions are: Ribbon label: Mouse anti-Ribeye b IgG2a, 1:10,000 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Sheets et al., 2011</xref>); PSD label: Mouse anti-pan-MAGUK IgG1, 1:500 (MABN72, MilliporeSigma, Burlington, MA); Hair-cell label: Rabbit anti-Myosin VIIa, 1:1000 (#25–6790, Proteus BioSciences Inc, Ramona, CA); Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel label: Rabbit anti-Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3a, 1:500 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>). Larvae were incubated in primary antibody solution for 2 hr at room temperature. After 4 × 5 min washes in PBST to remove the primary antibodies, diluted secondary antibodies were added and samples were incubated for 2 hr at room temperature. Secondary antibodies and their respective dilution are as follows: goat anti-mouse IgG2a, Alexa Fluor 488, 1:1000; goat anti-rabbit IgG (H+L) Alexa Fluor 546, 1:1000; goat anti-mouse IgG1 Alexa Fluor 647, 1:1000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Secondary antibodies were washed out with PBST for 3 × 5 min, followed by a 5 min wash with H<sub>2</sub>O. Larvae were mounted on glass slides with Prolong Gold Antifade Reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using No. 1.5 coverslips.</p><p>Prior to Airyscan imaging, live samples were immobilized in 2% low-melt agarose in tricaine (0.03%) in cover-glass bottomed dishes. Live and fixed samples were imaged on an inverted Zeiss LSM 780 laser-scanning confocal microscope with an Airyscan attachment (Carl Zeiss AG, Oberkochen, Germany) using an 63 × 1.4 NA oil objective lens. The median (±median absolute deviation) lateral and axial resolution of the system was measured at 198 ± 7.5 nm and 913 ± 50 nm (full-width at half-maximum), respectively. The acquisition parameters were adjusted using the control sample such that pixels for each channel reach at least 1/10 of the dynamic range. The Airyscan Z-stacks were processed with Zeiss Zen Black software v2.1 using 3D filter setting of 7.0. Experiments were imaged with the same acquisition settings to maintain consistency between comparisons.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup>and NAD(H) signals, processing, and quantification</title><p>To quantify changes in baseline Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) homeostasis, images were processed in FIJI. For our measurements we quantified the fluorescence in the basal-most 8 μm (four planes) to avoid overlap between cells. The basal planes were max Z-projected, and a 24.0 μm (Rex-YFP and RGECO1) or 26.8 μm (MitoGCaMP3) circular region of interest (ROI) was drawn over the neuromast to make intensity measurements. To correct for photobleaching, a set of mock-treated control neuromasts were imaged during every trial. These mock treatments were used to normalize the post-treatment intensity values.</p><p>To quantify the magnitude of evoked changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, images were processed in FIJI. Images in each time series were aligned using Stackreg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Thévenaz et al., 1998</xref>). For evoked MitoRGECO1, MitoGCaMP3, CytoGCaMP3 and two-color GCaMP6sCAAX and MitoRGECO1 signals, Z-stacks were max z-projected, and a 5 μm diameter circular ROI was drawn over each hair cell to make intensity measurements. For ribbon-localized measurements, GCaMP6sCAAX signals were measured within 1.34 μm round ROIs at individual ribbons, and intensity change at multiple ribbons per cell were averaged. For measurements of mechanotransduction, GCaMP6sCAAX signals were measured within 1.34 μm round ROIs at individual hair bundles, and intensity change in multiple bundles per neuromast were averaged.</p><p>To plot evoked changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup>, we subtracted the baseline (F<sub>0</sub>, signal during the pre-stimulus period) was subtracted from each timepoint acquired. Then each timepoint was divided by F<sub>0</sub> to generate the relative change in fluorescent signal from baseline or ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>. Quantification of evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals were made on max ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> measurements. Cells with presynaptic-Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity are defined by max ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> of &gt;0.05 for MitoRGECO1 and MitoGCaMP3, and max ΔF/F<sub>0</sub> &gt;0.25 for GCaMP6sCAAX for a 2 s stimulation. The method to obtain and overlay the spatial signal distribution of evoked signals as heat maps has been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lukasz and Kindt, 2018</xref>). We first computed the baseline image (F<sub>0</sub> or reference image) by averaging the images over the pre-stimulus period. Then the baseline image (F<sub>0</sub>) was subtracted from each image acquired, to represent the relative change in fluorescent signal from baseline or ∆F. The ∆F signal images during the stimulus period were binned, scaled and encoded by color maps with red indicating an increase in signal intensity.</p><p>To quantify the average magnitude and frequency of spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> changes in GCaMP6sCAAX signals, images were processed in Matlab R2014b (Mathworks, Natick, MA) and ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD). First, images in each time series were aligned in ImageJ using Stackreg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Thévenaz et al., 1998</xref>). To measure the average magnitude during the 900 s GCaMP6sCAAX image acquisition, a 5 μm diameter circular ROI was drawn over each hair cell and a raw intensity value was obtained from each time point. Then, in Matlab, the raw traces were bleach corrected. Next, the corrected intensity values were normalized as ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>. For spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals F<sub>0</sub> is defined as the bottom 15<sup>th</sup> percentile of fluorescence values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Babola et al., 2018</xref>). Then, values of ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> of less than 10% were removed. These values were considered to be noise and our threshold value for a true signal. A 10% threshold was determined by imaging spontaneous GCaMP6CAAX signals in the presence of isradipine where no signals were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The averaged magnitude of spontaneous activity per cell was obtained by dividing the integral/sum of GCaMP6sCAAX signals (∆F/F<sub>0</sub> &gt;10%) during the whole recording period by 300 (300 frames in 900 s). The frequency of GCaMP6sCAAX signals was defined as the average number of peaks per second during the whole recording period.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Image processing and quantification of synapse morphology</title><p>To quantify synapse morphology and pairing, images were first processed in ImageJ, and then synapses were paired using Python (Python Software Foundation, Wilmington, DE) in the Spyder Scientific Environment (MIT, Cambridge, MA). In ImageJ, each Airyscan Z-stack was background subtracted using rolling-ball subtraction. Z-stacks containing the MAGUK channel were further bandpass filtered to remove details smaller than six px and larger than 20 px. A duplicate of each Z-stack was normalized for intensity. This duplicated Z-stack was used to identify individual ribbon and MAGUK using the Simple 3D Segmentation of ImageJ 3D Suite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Ollion et al., 2013</xref>). Local intensity maxima, identified with 3D Fast Filter, and 3D watershed were used to separate close-by structures. The centroids for each identified ribbon and MAGUK puncta were obtained using 3D Manager and these coordinates were used to identify complete synapses. The max Z-projection of the segmented Z-stack was used to generate a list of 2D objects as individual ROIs corresponding to each punctum. This step also included a minimum size filter: Ribeye: 0.08 μm<sup>2</sup>, MAGUK: 0.04 μm<sup>2</sup>. For quantification of extrasynaptic Ribeye b puncta, the minimum size filter was not applied. The 2D puncta ROI were applied over the max Z-projection of the original Z-stack processed only with background subtraction. This step measures the intensity of the antibody label. Centroid and intensity information were exported as a CSV spreadsheet (macro is available on <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/wonghc/ImageJ-ribbon-synapse-quantification">https://github.com/wonghc/ImageJ-ribbon-synapse-quantification</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Wong, 2019</xref>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ImageJ-ribbon-synapse-quantification">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/ImageJ-ribbon-synapse-quantification</ext-link>).</p><p>In Python, the 3D centroid coordinates for each ribbon punctum were measured against the coordinates of every post-synaptic MAGUK punctum to find the MAGUK punctum within a threshold distance. This threshold was calculated by taking the 2D area of the Ribeye and MAGUK punctum measured in the max Z-projection to calculate an approximate radius by dividing by π and taking the square root. The two radii were then summed to get the threshold. Puncta that were not paired were excluded from later statistical analyses of synaptic ribbon and postsynaptic MAGUK puncta. To quantify the amount of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 immunolabel at ribbons, 2D ROIs generated from the Ribeye label to generate ribbon areas were applied to a max Z-projection of the Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 immunolabel. The integrated intensity of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 immunolabel was measured within each ROI. The number of hair cells, synapses per cell, and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters per PSD were counted manually. Hair-cell counts were assayed with Myosin VIIa antibody label in treatments when synapse or cell numbers were reduced. Due to slight variability between clutches and immunostains we only compared experimental data taken from the same clutch, immunostain and imaging session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses and data plots were performed with Prism 8 (Graphpad, San Diego, CA). Values of data with error bars on graphs and in text are expressed as mean ± SEM unless indicated otherwise. All experiments were performed on a minimum of 2 animals, 6 neuromasts (posterior lateral-line neuromasts L1-L4 or anterior lateral-line neuromasts O1 and O2 [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>]), on two independent days. For 3 and 5 dpf larvae each neuromast represents analysis from 8 to 12 hair cells; 24–36 synapses and 14–18 hair cells; 42–54 synapses respectively. All replicates are biological. Based on the variance and effect sizes reported previously and measured in this study, these numbers were adequate to provide statistical power to avoid both Type I and Type II error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sheets et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). No animals or samples were excluded from our analyses unless control experiments failed–in these cases all samples were excluded. No randomization or blinding was used for our animal studies. Where appropriate, data was confirmed for normality using a D’Agostino-Pearson normality test and for equal variances using a F test to compare variances. Statistical significance between two conditions was determined by either an unpaired <italic>t</italic> -test, an unpaired Welch’s unequal variance <italic>t</italic>-test, a Mann-Whitney U test or a Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed-rank test as appropriate. For comparison of multiple conditions, a Brown-Forsythe with Dunnett’s T3 post hoc or a Brown-Forsythe and Welch ANOVA with Holm-Sidak’s post hoc were used as appropriate. To calculate the IC<sub>50</sub> for Ru360 block of evoked MitoGCaMP3 signals a dose response curve was plotted using 0, 0.5, 2, 5 and 10 µM Ru360. A non-linear fit with four parameters and a variable slope was performed to calculate an IC<sub>50</sub> of 1.37 µM.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders Intramural Research Program Grant 1ZIADC000085-01 to KSK and ZICDC000081 to RSP and Y-XW.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Andrew King as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Hernán López-Schier (Reviewer #1); Anna Lysakowski (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wong and colleagues present an interesting study of the effects of mitochondrial calcium handling on ribbon synapse structure in zebrafish lateral line hair cells. Using a combination of techniques, the authors provide evidence that mechanotransduction-driven calcium influx results in increased mitochondrial calcium uptake, in turn altering ribbon size. The authors also provide evidence for ribbon regulation by changes in NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH driven by mitochondrial calcium changes. The work is clearly presented and has important implications for regulation of synaptic function in normal and damaged hair cells.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that use of an alternative inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake will strengthen the results (see comments from reviewer 2).</p><p>2) There was some confusion over the inclusion of immature cells in Figure 2 (see comments from reviewer 2). Please clarify.</p><p>3) Tone down conclusions or interpretation where requested (see reviews for details), or provide further clarification or explanation.</p><p>The full reviews are appended below for your information.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Wong and colleagues analyse the role of mitochondria in hair-cell synaptogenesis in zebrafish. They show that presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx drives Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake by mitochondria. In mature hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake occurs during evoked stimulation and is required to sustain presynaptic function. In developing hair cells, decreasing mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels increases the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH redox ratio, which modify ribbon formation.</p><p>Subsection “Mitochondria are located near presynaptic ribbons”, last paragraph: The authors find a mitochondrion in proximity to ribbons in 17 out of 21 sections. Are some of these sections of the same hair cells, or do they come from 21 independent hair cells?</p><p>Next they claim that in lateral-line hair cells, mitochondria are present near ribbons. However, the images shown clearly reveal that mitochondria are everywhere in hair cells, which unsurprisingly will include the areas near ribbons. Therefore, the claim that mitochondria are poised to impact ribbon synapses is overreaching.</p><p>The data shown cannot be used to claim that &quot;MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically within the mitochondria&quot;. Instead, MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically. The use of Ru360 does not directly support the claim either, because the authors would be blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria generally from any source including cytoplasm or the ER, and not a spread of within the mitochondria.</p><p>I am surprised with what appears to be zero MitoGCaMP3 signal outside the active-zone area at the start of the 2-s mechanical stimulation of neuromasts, given the long perdurance of the signal after stimulation (5 min to return to baseline). Hair cells must have been stimulated constantly during the experiment. Otherwise, the authors may want to explain this observation and how the prevented hair-cell activity before the 2-s evoked stimulation.</p><p>Figure 3F: Are Ru360 2 μM for 1hr and DMSO for Ru360 10 μM for 1hr significantly different?</p><p>The authors measure and compare Ribeye b area assuming that the 3D shape of the ribbons is identical under every treatment. Have they confirmed the case?</p><p>I am not sure what the authors refer to with &quot;spontaneous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and MCU Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities&quot;.</p><p>I am surprised that the authors do not discuss their findings in relation to the findings of Zenisek and Matthews, 2000.</p><p>In subsection “Functional significance of ribbon size”, the authors state: &quot;Functionally, compared to smaller ribbons, larger ribbons are associated with afferent fibers with less spontaneous activity and higher thresholds of activation&quot;. What fibers are the authors referring to? Afferent fibers of the lateral line do not show intrinsic spontaneous activity. Their spontaneous activity is given by spontaneous release of glutamate from the hair cells.</p><p>Is there any indication that altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria alters the localization of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels?</p><p>The authors must discuss their findings in relation to Lv et al., 2016.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Beurg et al., 2010, provide evidence for mitochondrial responses to apical calcium entry in cultured mammalian hair cells. These results contrast to the findings of the current work, where calcium spreads from basal mitochondria and are blocked by the calcium channel blocker isradipine. Is this due to differences in the kinetics of stimulation or differences in the type of hair cells?</p><p>Results displayed in Figure 2 are described as in mature hair cells but it appears some of the data were from 3 dpf. It is not clear why immature cells are included given the later results showing age-dependent differences.</p><p>It is somewhat surprising that blocking calcium uptake into mitochondria reduces presynaptic calcium signals. It is potentially possible that Ru360 may have non-specific effects such as blocking mechanotransduction. This could be tested by examining apical calcium signals, which the Kindt lab has found occur in all hair cells in response to mechanotransduction. An alternative inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake such as VDAC inhibitors might also strengthen this result.</p><p>Throughout the authors use the term &quot;formation&quot; to describe effects on synapses. It might be slightly pedantic, but it appears that the effects they observe do not affect formation (no changes in the number of synapses; Figure 5D, 7D) but rather size and shape (Figure 5E, 7E). Formation implies the localization of new synapses rather than alteration of synapses already formed by other mechanisms.</p><p>It is puzzling that blocking mitochondrial calcium accumulation results in an increase in NAD<sup>+</sup>. Mitochondrial oxidation of NADH to promote NAD<sup>+</sup> production is usually thought to be stimulated by calcium, which is the opposite effect of the one observed here. Given the puzzling nature of the link between calcium and NAD<sup>+</sup>, could additional experiments be performed to strengthen the results? Could uncoupling of mitochondria have an effect on ribbon size? Could pyruvate accumulation be the result? Could similar effects be seen with the MPC inhibitor UK5099?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an extremely interesting and well-written paper, with excellent, beautiful data. The authors make a compelling case for the effects of mitochondrial Ca<sup>2+</sup> regulating synapse size and number in hair cells during development. I congratulate them on this excellent study. That said, I do have several comments that I hope will improve this beautiful paper.</p><p>Subsection “Mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at ribbons is MCU and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dependent”, last paragraph: The authors claim that the effect of Ru360 is dose-dependent. Were other doses used? If so, what was the cut-off dose for the effect, i.e., what was the IC<sub>50</sub> or EC<sub>50</sub>?</p><p>Subsection “Mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake occurs in cells with presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx”, first paragraph: It has been described that approximately 10-40% of PSDs in mammalian hair cells do not have ribbons and about a third of boutons do not have ribbons (Sadeghi et al., 2014; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 1997). This is roughly equal to the 40% of cells in the present paper in which mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was present and the 30% of cells in the Zhang et al., 2018, paper that are synaptically active. I wonder if this is a &quot;snapshot in time&quot; of ribbon turnover, which has been documented in pinealocytes, but has not so far been described in hair cells. There were, in fact, a couple of papers on circadian rhythms affecting ribbon numbers in cochlear hair cells (Swetlitschkin and Vollrath, 1988; Molina Mira and Martinez-Soriano, 1991) cited in this review (Wagner, Cell Tissue Res. 1997, PMID: 9027298), which will likely be interesting to the authors, as the review also discusses developmental changes in ribbon synapse production due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects.</p><p>Subsection “Evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is important for mature synapse integrity and cell health”, last paragraph: This study was done in posterior neuromasts. I wonder if it is known whether there are differences between anterior and posterior neuromasts in terms of sensitivity or ribbon size? I also wonder if the ribbons are becoming bigger to compensate for the loss of synapses. In the microgravity of spaceflight, ribbons can become more numerous, perhaps compensating for the loss of gravity (Ross, Acta Otolaryngol, 2000) or less numerous (Sultemeier et al., 2017).</p><p>Subsections “Spontaneous mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake regulates ribbon formation”, second paragraph and “Role of spontaneous mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in developing hair cells”: The authors state that in developing hair cells, after application of Ru360, there is an increase in ribbon size. There is also, apparently, an increase in the number of cytoplasmic Ribeye-positive inclusions. How do we know that the size increase is not just that the ribbon clusters are not separating? Normally, ribbons are produced and &quot;float&quot; within the cytoplasm in clusters, presumably being transported through the cytoplasm by microtubules (this is supported by the observable Ribeye-positive cytoplasmic inclusions), then they separate into individual ribbons near and at the plasma membrane. Again, this may only be discriminable by TEM.</p><p>Subsection “MCU and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel activities regulate subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis”, last paragraph: Another possibility that doesn't seem to be considered in the paper or in the Discussion is that there are cytoplasmic calcium binding proteins that also buffer the Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p><p>Subsection “Functional significance of ribbon size”, second paragraph: The synaptic ribbons in central/striolar type II hair cells feeding into irregular, dimorphic vestibular afferents are larger than those feeding into peripheral regular, dimorphic afferents (Lysakowski and Goldberg, 1997). Similarly, irregular afferents have lower spontaneous background activity than regular afferents (Table 2, Goldberg, Smith and Fernández, 1984). So, there is some similarity to cochlear afferents.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.48914.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agreed that use of an alternative inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake will strengthen the results (see comments from reviewer 2).</p></disp-quote><p>We have used a second inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake to support our pharmacological results in mature hair cells.

We have changed our N to reflect ribbons rather than sections in the Results, Materials and methods and Figure 1 legend.</p><p>Results – “Using TEM, we examined sections that clearly captured ribbons (example, Figure 1C).

However, the images shown clearly reveal that mitochondria are everywhere in hair cells, which unsurprisingly will include the areas near ribbons. Therefore, the claim that mitochondria are poised to impact ribbon synapses is overreaching.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down our statement.</p><p>Results – “Overall our TEM and Airyscan imaging suggests that in lateral-line hair cells, mitochondria are present near ribbons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data shown cannot be used to claim that &quot;MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically within the mitochondria&quot;. Instead, MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically. The use of Ru360 does not directly support the claim either, because the authors would be blocking Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria generally from any source including cytoplasm or the ER, and not a spread of within the mitochondria.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the data on mitochondrial calcium uptake and pharmacological block of calcium channels cannot distinguish between propagation of calcium within mitochondria versus a gradient increase in calcium level at the cytosol that drives the correspondingly synapse-to-apex direction of mitochondrial calcium uptake. Results, &quot;MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically within the mitochondria&quot; is corrected to &quot;MitoGCaMP3 signals propagated apically”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am surprised with what appears to be zero MitoGCaMP3 signal outside the active-zone area at the start of the 2-s mechanical stimulation of neuromasts, given the long perdurance of the signal after stimulation (5 min to return to baseline). Hair cells must have been stimulated constantly during the experiment. Otherwise, the authors may want to explain this observation and how the prevented hair-cell activity before the 2-s evoked stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that after stimulation the MitoGCaMP3 signal took nearly 5 min to return to baseline. Because of this slow return, we did wait 5 min between each evoked trial for consistency. This is now reflected in the Materials and methods – “Due to the slow mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> return to baseline after stimulation (~5 min), we waited a minimum of 5 min before initiating a new evoked GCaMP6sCAAX or MitoGCaMP3 acquisition.”</p><p>In addition, we added a piece of data to indicate that the mitochondria can still take up Ca<sup>2+</sup> even if the MitoGCaMP3 has not returned to “pre-stimulus baseline”. This data is a 2-s stimulus repeated every 10s (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D). Although smaller, additional mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is possible with subsequent stimuli. Results – “Despite this long time-course of recovery to baseline, we were still able to evoke additional rises in MitoGCaMP3 signal 10 s after stimulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, ∆F/F<sub>0</sub>).”</p><p>With regards to the MitoGCaMP3 baseline at zero prior to stimulation – there is definitely some amount of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in mitochondria at rest. Otherwise it would be not be possible to see the structures prior to stimulation. The heat maps in Figure 1E are just helpful way visualize the relative change (∆F) in MitoGCaMP3 from ‘rest’ in on a pixel-by-pixel basis. The graphs in E’-E’’ are normalized to start at MitoGCaMP3 measurements at zero in all ROIs (∆F/F<sub>0</sub>). We have added ∆F and ∆F/F<sub>0</sub> to the text to help clarity what changes in MitoGCaMP3 we are referring to. We have also added additional information regarding what our plots and heatmaps represent in the Materials and methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3F: Are Ru360 2 μM for 1hr and DMSO for Ru360 10 μM for 1hr significantly different?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, these measurements are significantly different. Although our overall results are consistent over time, there are slight differences between immunostains, clutches, as well as modifications to our imaging system over years that are challenging to control. Because of this we only compare our experimental data to control samples from the same clutch and immunostain. We have added a statement to our Materials and methods emphasizing this – “Due to slight variability between clutches and immunostains we only compared experimental data taken from the same clutch, immunostain and imaging session.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors measure and compare Ribeye b area assuming that the 3D shape of the ribbons is identical under every treatment. Have they confirmed the case?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great point. We have done circularity measurements on the areas we measure for each treatment. The lower concentration of Ru360 (2 µM) does not impact ribbon circularity, but longer, 1 hr application of 10 µM Ru360 does change ribbon circularity. We have considered making 3D-volume measurements, but our microscope does not have sufficient Z-axis resolution to reliably predict these relatively small volumes. Even the X-Y dimensions we are measuring near the limit of our imaging system. The 3-D volumes would be relative estimations skewed in Z.</p><p>Within our ribbon dataset we do reliably capture ribbons from both the side and the top. Because we are viewing ribbons from multiple angles, we feel that our max-projected area measurements are the best approximation of ribbon size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am not sure what the authors refer to with &quot;spontaneous Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 and MCU Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the text to show that we are referring to Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in developing hair cells.

This work concluded that mitochondria may contribute indirectly to Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance from the synaptic terminal by providing ATP to fuel the PMCA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subsection “Functional significance of ribbon size”, the authors state: &quot;Functionally, compared to smaller ribbons, larger ribbons are associated with afferent fibers with less spontaneous activity and higher thresholds of activation&quot;. What fibers are the authors referring to? Afferent fibers of the lateral line do not show intrinsic spontaneous activity. Their spontaneous activity is given by spontaneous release of glutamate from the hair cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to be clear that we are referring to auditory inner hair cells for this comparison. Discussion – “Similarly, in the mammalian auditory system, ribbon size is correlated with differences in afferent activity. […] Compared to larger ribbons, smaller ribbons within inner hair cells are innervated by afferent fibers with higher thresholds of activation and lower rates of spontaneous activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there any indication that altered Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry into mitochondria alters the localization of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added data to quantify the localization of Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels in mature hair cells after blocking mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. We find that while blocking calcium entry into mitochondria with 2 μm Ru360 depresses presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses, Ca<sub>v</sub>1.3 channels are still present at synapse (Figure 2E-G).We also see a significant increase in Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3-channel density at synapses after MCU block (Figure 2H). Results – “After the 1-hr 2 µM Ru360 treatment, Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters were still present at synapses, but the channels were at a significantly higher density compared to controls (Figure 2E-H). These findings indicate that in mature hair cells, partial MCU block may impair presynaptic function by altering Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel density.”</p><p>This result is also included in our Discussion – subsection “Role of evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in mature hair cells”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors must discuss their findings in relation to Lv et al., 2016.</p></disp-quote><p>Good point, we have now added the findings of Lv et al., 2016 to our Discussion – “Work in zebrafish has characterized lateral-line hair cells largely depleted of full-length Ribeye (Lv et al., 2016). […] If full-length Ribeye and its NAD(H) binding domain is the site of regulation, we predict that Ribeye-depleted hair cells will be unaffected by perturbations in mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Beurg et al., 2010, provide evidence for mitochondrial responses to apical calcium entry in cultured mammalian hair cells. These results contrast to the findings of the current work, where calcium spreads from basal mitochondria and are blocked by the calcium channel blocker isradipine. Is this due to differences in the kinetics of stimulation or differences in the type of hair cells?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an important comparison to make. We do occasionally observe apical mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake that is distinct from the mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at the base of the hair cell. We have not fully characterized these responses for reproducibility or their pharmacological properties. In our revision we have found that blocking mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (via MCU or VDAC block) actually increases mechanotransduction (see below and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B’). This supports the work of Beurg et al., 2010, that suggest apical mitochondria may be acting as a buffer to reduce responses in the apical part of the hair cell. We feel this result definitely warrants future exploration, but is outside the current scope and focus of this manuscript. But, in the Discussion we now state that blocking mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake increases mechanotransduction and compare this result to Beurg et al., 2010.</p><p>Discussion – “In mammalian auditory hair cells, mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake has been observed to buffer Ca<sup>2+</sup> beneath mechanosensory hair bundles (Beurg et al., 2010). […] In the future it will be extremely interesting to explore the role apical mitochondria play in mechanotransduction.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results displayed in Figure 2 are described as in mature hair cells but it appears some of the data were from 3 dpf. It is not clear why immature cells are included given the later results showing age-dependent differences.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that including an overall immature cell population in Figure 2 when that focus is on mature hair cells is confusing. Although there are a subset of synaptically active mature hair cells at 3 dpf, for clarity, we now only include mature hair cells at 5 dpf in this figure. Figure 2 has been modified to show MitoRGECO1 and GCaMP6sCAAX in mature hair cells at 5 dpf.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is somewhat surprising that blocking calcium uptake into mitochondria reduces presynaptic calcium signals. It is potentially possible that Ru360 may have non-specific effects such as blocking mechanotransduction. This could be tested by examining apical calcium signals, which the Kindt lab has found occur in all hair cells in response to mechanotransduction. An alternative inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake such as VDAC inhibitors might also strengthen this result.</p></disp-quote><p>We have used an alternative inhibitor of mitochondrial calcium uptake. In addition to using the MCU blocker Ru360, we have added data using the VDAC inhibitor TRO 19622. Similar to Ru360, TRO 19622 blocks mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake. Results – “We confirmed these results by applying TRO 19622, an antagonist of the voltage-dependent anion channel (VDAC). VDAC enables transport of ions including Ca<sup>2+</sup> across the outer mitochondrial membrane (Schein et al., 1976; Shoshan-Barmatz and Gincel, 2003). We observed that similar to the MCU antagonist Ru360, a 20-min treatment with the VDAC antagonist TRO 19622 also impaired stimulus-evoked MitoGCaMP3 signals (10 µM TRO 19622, Figure 1—figure supplement 1E).”</p><p>Similar to Ru360,TRO 19622 also blocks presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in mature hair cells. Results – “A similar reduction in GCaMP6sCAAX signals were observed after a 20-min application of the VDAC inhibitor TRO 19622 (Figure 2—figure supplement 1D-E’, 10 µM TRO 19622).”</p><p>Ru360 is an analog of Ruthenium Red, a known mechanotransduction channel blocker. Therefore, as suggested, we have tested the apical calcium signals after MCU block (Ru360) and VDAC block (TRO 19622). We found that neither drug blocks mechanotransduction.Results – “Previous work in zebrafish-hair cells demonstrated that isradipine specifically blocks Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channels without impairing mechanotransduction (Zhang et al., 2018). […] Neither compound blocked mechanotransduction (Figure 2—figure supplement 1A-B’).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout the authors use the term &quot;formation&quot; to describe effects on synapses. It might be slightly pedantic, but it appears that the effects they observe do not affect formation (no changes in the number of synapses; Figure 5D, 7D) but rather size and shape (Figure 5E, 7E). Formation implies the localization of new synapses rather than alteration of synapses already formed by other mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that it is a bit misleading to use the term formation, because none of our treatments prevent synapses from forming. Rather we are studying an aspect of formation. Where we were able, we have changed “formation” to “size” in the Abstract and text body.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is puzzling that blocking mitochondrial calcium accumulation results in an increase in NAD<sup>+</sup>. Mitochondrial oxidation of NADH to promote NAD<sup>+</sup> production is usually thought to be stimulated by calcium, which is the opposite effect of the one observed here. Given the puzzling nature of the link between calcium and NAD<sup>+</sup>, could additional experiments be performed to strengthen the results? Could uncoupling of mitochondria have an effect on ribbon size? Could pyruvate accumulation be the result? Could similar effects be seen with the MPC inhibitor UK5099?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, the relationship between NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH and mitochondria calcium in neurons or hair cells is not straightforward. In our Discussion we have tried to draw comparisons between our observed results and studies in cardiac myocytes where this relationship has been most widely studied. Discussion – “Some insight into these differences can be inferred from cardiac myocytes where the relationship between mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> and NAD(H) redox has been extensively studied. […]These results are consistent with the changes in NAD(H) redox we observe in developing, but not mature hair cells.”</p><p>We also agree that additional pharmacology could be used to understand more precisely how cellular metabolism and mitochondria calcium impact ribbon size. Unfortunately, many of the mitochondrial uncouplers and metabolic inhibitors are likely to be quite toxic to larval zebrafish. And careful pharmacology is considerably time consuming. In the past 2 months we have used much of this time to confirm many of our Ru360 results with the VDAC inhibitor TRO 19622. Additional pharmacology will be extremely interesting, but may be beyond the scope of this present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…]</p><p>Subsection “Mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at ribbons is MCU and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dependent”, last paragraph: The authors claim that the effect of Ru360 is dose-dependent.

We have added other doses to more accurately estimate the IC<sub>50</sub>. The IC<sub>50</sub> is included in the Results – subsection “Mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake at ribbons is MCU and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 dependent”, third paragraph, and the dose response curve is plotted in Figure 1—figure supplement 1F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake occurs in cells with presynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx”, first paragraph: It has been described that approximately 10-40% of PSDs in mammalian hair cells do not have ribbons and about a third of boutons do not have ribbons (Sadeghi et al., 2014; Lysakowski and Goldberg, 1997). This is roughly equal to the 40% of cells in the present paper in which mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake was present and the 30% of cells in the Zhang et al., 2018, paper that are synaptically active. I wonder if this is a &quot;snapshot in time&quot; of ribbon turnover, which has been documented in pinealocytes, but has not so far been described in hair cells. There were, in fact, a couple of papers on circadian rhythms affecting ribbon numbers in cochlear hair cells (Swetlitschkin and Vollrath, 1988; Molina Mira and Martinez-Soriano, 1991) cited in this review (Wagner, Cell Tissue Res., 1997, PMID: 9027298), which will likely be interesting to the authors, as the review also discusses developmental changes in ribbon synapse production due to Ca<sup>2+</sup> effects.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that pre- and post-synapses were present in active and inactive cells in Zhang et al., 2018. In this study we also added quantifications showing Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 clusters at all synapses after MCU block in mature hair cells (Figure 2E-H). And yes – these images are merely a snapshot in time. Synaptic structures are likely dynamic, although currently how dynamic is unclear. We are presently trying to study synaptic structures, in hair cells, in vivo! Therefore, we now make reference to this in our Discussion – “How could synapses be changing in mature hair cells during this pathology? […] In the future, live imaging studies will help resolve whether there are different mechanisms underlying ribbon enlargement in mature and developing hair cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake is important for mature synapse integrity and cell health”, last paragraph: This study was done in posterior neuromasts. I wonder if it is known whether there are differences between anterior and posterior neuromasts in terms of sensitivity or ribbon size?</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, there are not many studies that make direct comparisons between anterior and posterior neuromasts. To be more comprehensive, we have reexamined our slides and quantified synapses in anterior lateral-line neuromasts. We find that the ribbons and PSDs are similar in size between anterior and posterior lateral-line neuromasts (Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1A-B). In addition, Ru360 enlarges ribbons in developing hair cells within the anterior-lateral line (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C). We also found that anterior lateral-line neuromasts have robust evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake (Figure 1—figure supplement 2). Overall these results suggest that anterior and posterior neuromasts have synapses of similar sizes, evoked mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake and that mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> plays a role in regulating ribbon size in both populations of developing hair cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also wonder if the ribbons are becoming bigger to compensate for the loss of synapses. In the microgravity of spaceflight, ribbons can become more numerous, perhaps compensating for the loss of gravity (Ross, Acta Otolaryngol., 2000) or less numerous (Sultemeier et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the above alterative to our discussion of how ribbons in mature hair cells can get larger. See above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsections “Spontaneous mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake regulates ribbon formation”, second paragraph and “Role of spontaneous mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake in developing hair cells”: The authors state that in developing hair cells, after application of Ru360, there is an increase in ribbon size. There is also, apparently, an increase in the number of cytoplasmic Ribeye-positive inclusions. How do we know that the size increase is not just that the ribbon clusters are not separating? Normally, ribbons are produced and &quot;float&quot; within the cytoplasm in clusters, presumably being transported through the cytoplasm by microtubules (this is supported by the observable Ribeye-positive cytoplasmic inclusions), then they separate into individual ribbons near and at the plasma membrane. Again, this may only be discriminable by TEM.</p></disp-quote><p>It is true that we cannot tell why ribbons or Ribeye aggregates are becoming larger in developing hair cells. But we would like to know! We have added a statement about these aggregates to our Discussion – “We also observed an increase in cytoplasmic Ribeye aggregates after MCU block (Figure 5F-G). […] NADH(H) redox could alter Ribeye interactions and alter the overall accumulation or separation of Ribeye within aggregates or at the presynapse.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “MCU and Ca<sub>V</sub>1.3 channel activities regulate subcellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> homeostasis”, last paragraph: Another possibility that doesn't seem to be considered in the paper or in the Discussion is that there are cytoplasmic calcium binding proteins that also buffer the Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention calcium buffering proteins in our discussion of buffering the hair-cell cytosol – Discussion – “But similar to work on retinal-bipolar cell ribbons, blocking mito-Ca<sup>2+</sup> uptake did not raise cyto-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels, indicating it may not be critical for Ca<sup>2+</sup> clearance (Figure 6A-C). Instead, cyto-Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels may be maintained by the PMCA, along with the numerous Ca<sup>2+</sup> buffering proteins that have been identified in hair cells (Hackney et al., 2005; Haeseleer et al., 2000; Steyger et al., 1997).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Subsection “Functional significance of ribbon size”, second paragraph: The synaptic ribbons in central/striolar type II hair cells feeding into irregular, dimorphic vestibular afferents are larger than those feeding into peripheral regular, dimorphic afferents (Lysakowski and Goldberg, 1997). Similarly, irregular afferents have lower spontaneous background activity than regular afferents (Table 2, Goldberg, Smith and Fernández, 1984). So, there is some similarity to cochlear afferents.</p></disp-quote><p>Great suggestion! The vestibular hair-cell synapse and afferent have been added to our Discussion – “In many instances ribbon size is correlated with functional properties of the synapse. […] Functionally, afferents that innervate hair cells with larger ribbons in the extrastriolar region have higher activation thresholds and lower rates of spontaneous activity compared to afferents that innervate the striola region (Eatock et al., 2008; Goldberg et al., 1984; Risner and Holt, 2006).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
