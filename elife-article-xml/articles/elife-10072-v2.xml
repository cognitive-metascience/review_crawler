for use in cancer remains a tremendous challenge. New insights into the regulation of this pathway could reveal new therapeutic point of intervention, therefore are greatly needed. Here we report a novel FAK/PYK2/GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup>/β-catenin regulation axis: FAK and PYK2, elevated in adenomas in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice and in human colorectal cancer tissues, functioned redundantly to promote the Wnt/β-catenin pathway by phosphorylating GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> to reinforce pathway output—β-catenin accumulation and intestinal tumorigenesis. We previously showed that Wnt-induced β-catenin accumulation requires Wnt-induced GSK3β/β-TrCP interaction; the current study revealed that phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> was a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP. Pharmacological inhibition of FAK/PYK2 suppressed adenoma formation in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice accompanied with reduced intestinal levels of phospho-GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> and β-catenin, indicating that FAK/PYK2/GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> axis is critical for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in APC driven intestinal tumorigenesis.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10072.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10072.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10072.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The cells in our body communicate with each other to coordinate many essential processes, including cell division and the formation of tissues and organs. The Wnt signaling pathway is crucial for cell communication across all animal species, but activating this pathway at the wrong time can cause cancer to develop. As part of the investigation into treatments for colon and other intestinal cancers, researchers have tried to identify drugs that inhibit Wnt signaling. This search would be easier if we understood more about how the Wnt signaling pathway is controlled.</p><p>When the protein GSK3 is active, it can switch the Wnt signaling pathway ‘off’, and inactivating GSK3 can turn the Wnt signaling pathway ‘on’. Enzymes known as kinases can inactivate GKS3 by adding a phosphate group to it, in a process known as phosphorylation. It was unknown which kinases phosphorylate GSK3, and whether this affects how cancerous tumors develop in the colon.</p><p>Gao, Chen et al. analyzed cells taken from human and mice and observed that two kinases called PYK2 and FAK phosphorylate one form of GSK3, known as GSK3β. Furthermore, both kinases are required to inactivate GSK3β completely, and so turn on the Wnt signaling pathway.</p><p>During the early stages of colon cancer, cells first develop into polyps, which subsequently become cancerous. Gao, Chen et al. treated mice that had genetic mutations that made them susceptible to colon cancer with a chemical compound that inhibits both FAK and PYK2. These mice grew fewer polyps than untreated mice, and the polyps that did grow tended to be smaller.</p><p>Tissue samples taken from humans in the early stages of colon cancer—as the polyps progress towards becoming cancerous—had high levels of FAK, PYK2 and phosphorylated GSK3β. Overall, this suggests that drugs that simultaneously inhibit FAK and PYK2 may be an effective treatment for colon cancer, although further studies will be needed to confirm this.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.10072.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.10072.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>Wnt/b-catenin pathway</kwd><kwd>FAK</kwd><kwd>PYK2</kwd><kwd>GSK3</kwd><kwd>intestinal tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>phosphorylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA166197; CA175202</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CA102310</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlaepfer</surname><given-names>David D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Dual FAK/PYK2 kinase inhibition disrupts GSK3β phosphorylation and may present a new treatment for colorectal cancer in patients carrying APC mutations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aberrant activation of the canonical Wnt (Wnt/β-catenin) pathway is crucial for many cancer types, especially those of the gastrointestinal tract: genetic alterations in Wnt signaling occur in 93% of human CRCs, among which inactivation of tumor suppressor <italic>adenomatous polyposis coli</italic> (<italic>APC</italic>) (85%) and activating mutations of proto-oncogene <italic>β-catenin</italic> (5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1a">Cancer Genome Atlas Network, 2012</xref>) are mutually exclusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sparks et al., 1998</xref>). The loss of functional APC results in less efficient GSK3 (two isoforms in mammals, GSK3α and GSK3β)-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin, leading to reduced degradation of β-catenin, thus mimicking Wnt stimulation. Although <italic>APC</italic> mutation is believed to activate Wnt signaling constitutively, histopathological studies show that only about 50% colon carcinoma cells display homogeneous nuclear β-catenin staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung et al., 2001</xref>), a surrogate for Wnt signaling activity, indicating that <italic>APC</italic> mutation alone is not sufficient to cause persistent or full activation of the Wnt pathway in CRC cells, therefore Wnt signaling is regulatable in <italic>APC</italic>-mutated CRCs. But how Wnt signaling is regulated in intestinal tumorigenesis remains largely undefined.</p><p>A key feature of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway is the tight control of the abundance of transcription co-activator β-catenin by the β-catenin destruction complex, consisting of GSK3, casein kinase 1 (CK1), APC, scaffold protein Axin and β-catenin. In Wnt-off state, the cytosolic level of β-catenin is kept low by its continuous degradation: β-catenin is phosphorylated by GSK3 on serine 33 and 37 and threonine 41, phosphorylation then triggers β-catenin recruitment of ubiquitin E3 β-TrCP (β-transducin repeats-containing proteins), causing its ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu and Pan, 2010</xref>). In Wnt-on state, Wnt ligand forms a complex with the cell-surface receptor Frizzled and low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP) 5/6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu and Pan, 2010</xref>), and initiates a series of molecular events ultimately causing stabilization of β-catenin by suppressing phosphorylation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hernandez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kim et al., 2013</xref>) as well as β-TrCP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>). Newly synthesized β-catenin then accumulates and enters the nucleus to interact with transcription factors TCF (T-cell factor)/LEF (lymphoid enhancing factor) to activate transcription of the Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>How GSK3 is modulated and fine-tuned by Wnt to achieve β-catenin stabilization remains a fundamental question in the field of Wnt signaling, with many puzzles and contradictions. We previously found that Wnt simulation induces monoubiquitination of GSK3β by β-TrCP, which is required for Wnt-induced inhibition of β-catenin recruitment of β-TrCP and subsequent stabilization of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). This study addressed important questions left unanswered: What are the molecular determinants of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP? β-TrCP is the substrate recruitment module of the SCF<sup>β-TrCP</sup> ubiquitin ligase supercomplex, recruitment of β-TrCP to its substrate, for example β-catenin, generally requires substrate phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</xref>). If this is also true in GSK3β's case, what is the involved phosphorylation site(s)? What are the kinases responsible for catalyzing the phosphorylation? Is this phosphorylation involved in intestinal tumorigenesis? Our results indicate that phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> by FAK and PYK2 is a molecular determinant of GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP, and is required for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway and crucial for Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GSK3β phosphorylation at Y216 is required for GSK3β interaction with β-TrCP and subsequent ubiquitination</title><p>β-TrCP binds to its substrates through phosphorylated residues in conserved degradation motifs (DpSGxxpS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cardozo and Pagano, 2004</xref>), but tyrosine phosphorylation of substrate is also a recruiter for β-TrCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2a">Sahasrabuddhe et al., 2015</xref>). GSK3β is known to be phosphorylated at serine 9, threonine 43, tyrosine 216 and threonine 390 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). To determine which of these sites is involved in GSK3β recruitment of β-TrCP, we generated single point mutations at these residues and compared the interactions between the mutants and β-TrCP. We found that mutation of S9 to alanine (A) moderately inhibited GSK3β/β-TrCP interaction, whereas mutation of T43 and T390 to alanine had no impact on GSK3β affinity for β-TrCP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, mutation of Y216 to phenylalanine (F) almost completely abrogated GSK3β binding to β-TrCP. Mimicking GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation by mutation Y216 to glutamic acid (E) restored the interaction, suggesting that it was phosphorylation that determines the recruitment of β-TrCP to GSK3β.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10072.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>β-TrCP-mediated GSK3β ubiquitination requires GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The whole cells lysates from HEK293T cells transfected with empty vector or constructs expressing HA-tagged GSK3β or its phosphorylation mutants were used for immunoprecipitation (IP) and immunoblotting (IB) analysis with indicated antibodies.

In the presence of SCF<sup>β-TrCP1</sup> ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, WT GSK3β and its phosphorylation mimicking mutant Y216E, but not Y216F mutant, were ubiquitinated. Of note, in vitro synthesized GSK3β through Rabbit Reticulocyte Lysate Translation Systems were weakly phosphorylated at Y216 and incubation with ATP further enhances GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation through GSK3β autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cole et al., 2004</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, right panel), which explains why in vitro ubiquitination of WT GSK3β was possible if GSK3β monoubiquitination requires Y216 phosphorylation. Although Wnt3a treatment did not alter p-GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> level in HEK293T cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (GSK3α<sup>Y279</sup> corresponds to GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup>, the antibody recognizing p-GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> also recognizes p-GSK3α<sup>Y279</sup>), the loss of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation greatly impaired both basal and Wnt3a-induced GSK3β monoubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Prior studies indicate that phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> may or may not affect GSK3β kinase activity and GSK3β/Axin interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hughes et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dajani et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buescher and Phiel, 2010</xref>). The current study showed that GSK3β<sup>Y216F</sup> mutant protein interacted with Axin1 as strongly as WT GSK3β in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Same as GSK3β ubiquitination mutant GSK3β<sup>KKKK15/27/32/36RRRR</sup> (lysines 15/27/32/36 to arginines mutant, labeled as S4 in the figure), GSK3β<sup>Y216F</sup> and GSK3β<sup>Y216E</sup> phosphorylated β-catenin as efficiently as WT GSK3β in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, upper panel) and in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, lower panel). Together, these results imply that phosphorylation status on Y216 neither affects GSK3β binding affinity for Axin1 nor changes GSK3β kinase activity towards β-catenin phosphorylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> is required for the activation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling</title><p>We next validated the role of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> in Wnt/β-catenin signaling in GSK3β knockout (KO) MEFs (mouse embryonic fibroblasts). GSK3α and GSK3β are functionally redundant in Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doble et al., 2007</xref>), to avoid compensation from GSK3α, we generated GSK3β KO/GSK3α KD MEF cell line. Loss of both GSK3α/β increased the basal level of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, comparing lanes 1 and 5), presumably due to the lack of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin<sup>S33/S37/T41</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doble et al., 2007</xref>). Reconstitution of the GSK3β KO/GSK3α KD MEFs with WT HA-GSK3β reduced the basal level of β-catenin to the level comparable to WT MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, comparing lanes 1, 5 and 7), likely due to the restoration of GSK3-mediated phosphorylation of β-catenin. Reconstitution these MEFs with WT HA-GSK3β and its phosphorylation mimetic mutant (HA-GSK3β<sup>Y216E</sup>), but not GSK3β<sup>Y216F</sup> mutant, also restored Wnt-induced accumulation of β-catenin, thus validating the positive role of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation in Wnt signaling. The fact that GSK3β<sup>KKKK15/27/32/36RRRR/Y216E</sup> mutant failed to restore Wnt-induced β-catenin stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, lanes 13 and 14) functionally confirmed that Y216 phosphorylation occurs prior to ubiquitination. We have found that Wnt-induced long-term β-catenin stabilization is mediated by GSK3β monoubiquitination through suppressing β-catenin recruitment of β-TrCP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, the co-IP results showed that upon Wnt3a stimulation, β-TrCP recruitment to β-catenin and ubiquitination of the phosphorylated β-catenin<sup>S33/S37/T41</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel) were substantially increased in GSK3β KO/GSK3α KD MEFs reconstituted with HA-GSK3β<sup>Y216F</sup>, whereas reconstitution with Y216 phosphorylation mimetic mutant (HA-GSK3β<sup>Y216E</sup>) exerted the opposite effect. The results from the reciprocal IP assay confirmed more β-TrCP-bound p-β-catenin<sup>S33/S37/T41</sup> in HA-GSK3β<sup>Y216F</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). Together, these data suggested that phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> is required for the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signaling by suppressing phosphorylated β-catenin<sup>S33/S37/T41</sup> recruitment of β-TrCP.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10072.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Activation of Wnt/β-Catenin signaling requires GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> phosphorylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) IB analysis using whole cell lysates from indicated MEFs treated with control-CM or Wnt3a-CM for 6 hr.

In CRC cells predominantly expressing either FAK (HT-29 cells) or PYK2 (SW480 cells), KD of FAK or PYK2 alone was sufficient to reduce the levels of phosphorylated GSK3α<sup>Y279</sup> and GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> and total β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D,E</xref>).

The reason for the discrepancy is not clear, but it might be explained by the fact that different substrates were used in these studies. The current study indicates that phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> per se does not affect GSK3β activity towards β-catenin, thus ruling out the possibility that GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> regulates the Wnt/β-catenin pathway through modulating GSK3β kinase activity.</p><p>GSK3 is emerging as a prominent drug target for the treatment of various disorders including cancer and currently more than 50 GSK3 kinase inhibitors have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McCubrey et al., 2014</xref>). The kinase activity per se of GSK3 plays a dual role in Wnt signaling: GSK3 phosphorylation of Wnt coreceptor LRP6 on its PPPSP motifs is required for the activation of the pathway (positive role), whereas phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3 triggers its degradation (negative role) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu and Pan, 2010</xref>). The kinase-mediated double role feature makes targeting GSK3 catalytic activity potentially problematic since it suppresses GSK3-mediated degradation of β-catenin, thus activating Wnt signaling therefore being potentially oncogenic. Indeed, 60 days of lithium treatment resulted in overall modest but significant increase in the tumor size in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gould et al., 2003</xref>), implying that GSK3 kinase inhibitor does pose an oncogenic risk, at least in the context of Wnt-driven carcinogenesis. The current study suggests a novel way of GSK3 inhibition: targeting GSK3α/β<sup>Y279/Y216</sup> phosphorylation, which opens a new avenue for the design and development of GSK3 inhibitors.</p><p>FAK plays a pivotal role in angiogenesis, tumor cell invasion and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sulzmaier et al., 2014</xref>). FAK is also required for tumor initiation: organ-specific deletion of FAK suppresses mammary tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pylayeva et al., 2009</xref>), intestinal tumorigenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 2010</xref>), skin tumor formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McLean et al., 2004</xref>) and hepatocarcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3a">Shang et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that inhibition of FAK may present a promising strategy for treating these diseases. FAK has kinase-dependent and kinase-independent scaffolding functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cance et al., 2013</xref>); whether and how these two activities contribute to FAK's role in a particular type of cancer remains largely unexplored. In c-Met/β-catenin-driven hepatocarcinogenesis, FAK kinase activity was not required for β-catenin-induced Cyclin D1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3a">Shang et al., 2014</xref>). However, pharmacologic inhibition of FAK kinase activity suppressed KRAS-driven lung adenocarcinomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konstantinidou et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting an involvement of FAK kinase activity in KRAS-driven lung cancer. This study indicates that FAK contributes APC-driven intestinal tumorigenesis through its kinase activity. Currently several FAK inhibitors are undergoing clinical trials and the first phase I trial has been very promising. A clinical challenge that lies ahead is to identify tumor types and patient subgroups that are most responsive to FAK inhibitors. To this end, the current study has identified a potentially responsive tumor type—colorectal cancer—and potentially responsive patient subpopulations—CRC patients with APC mutations.</p><p>FAK is known to regulate β-catenin dynamics by directly phosphorylating β-catenin<sup>Y142</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Phosphorylation of β-catenin<sup>Y142</sup> acts as a switch from the adhesive to the transcriptional role of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piedra et al., 2003</xref>); as a result, FAK facilitates vascular endothelial cadherin-β-catenin dissociation and endothelial cells junctional breakdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). This study has revealed a new role of FAK in the regulation of β-catenin: stabilizing β-catenin by phosphorylating GSK3α/β<sup>Y279/Y216</sup>. FAK regulates mammary stem cell and intestinal tissue regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Luo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sulzmaier et al., 2014</xref>); given the importance of Wnt/β-catenin pathway in stem cell, our study could provide a potential mechanistic explanation how FAK is involved in stem cell and tissue regeneration.</p><p>PYK2 is closely related to FAK in sequence and structure with 48% amino acid identity, and they function redundantly and non-redundantly in a function and context-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Schaller, 2010</xref>). Despite its low expression in normal human intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avraham et al., 1995</xref>), we and others find that intestinal PYK2 is elevated in adenomas in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice and in CRC patient tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carothers et al., 2006</xref>). The current study clearly show that by phosphorylating GSK3α/β<sup>Y279/Y216</sup>, FAK and PYK2 function redundantly in the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in CRC cells, raising the possibility that FAK and PYK2 could also function redundantly in Wnt-driven intestinal tumorigenesis. However, if so, why was intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone sufficient to cause complete abrogation of adenoma formation in APC-mutant mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 2010</xref>)? Why did PYK2 not compensate for the loss of FAK in intestinal tumorigenesis? A prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carothers et al., 2006</xref>) and our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel) showed that drastic PYK2 elevation occurred in tumors in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice, indicating that PYK2 is upregulated during the process of intestinal tumorigenesis. FAK induction, although further enhanced in tumors, however, is triggered by APC mutation—the initiating event for tumorigenesis in the APC-mutant mice, through activated Wnt pathway target c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 2010</xref>); therefore FAK induction by APC mutation should occur earlier than PYK2 elevation. If so, it explains why inhibition of FAK by intestinal deletion of FAK was sufficient to suppress tumor development, it also explains why PF562271 treatment inhibited PYK2 elevation in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). Nevertheless, regardless of the exact mechanisms mediating in vivo PYK2 regulation during intestinal tumorigenesis, elevated PYK2 in tumors further enhances Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis through phosphorylating GSK3 to promote the Wnt pathway—a positive feedback loop that reinforces the tumor development process.</p><p>Tumors undergoing targeted therapy often relapse due to the utilization of autonomous parallel-redundant signaling. The current study indicates that both FAK and PYK2 are elevated in already established colon tumors in CRC patients and that effective inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells expressing FAK and PYK2 will only be achieved by simultaneously targeting both kinases; we believe these results provide a solid mechanistic justification for clinical use of FAK/PYK2 dual inhibitor instead of FAK-specific inhibitor for better clinical outcomes in CRC patients.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data are presented as mean ±SD.

Your full submission has been evaluated by Tony Hunter (Senior Editor) and two reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers.</p><p>One reviewer had detailed comments that would be difficult to address in a timely way, and without which the significance of the work is unclear. The other reviewer had a general comment that the work is preliminary without more in vivo experiments. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This paper provides a potential molecular mechanism for the observation that colorectal cancers (CRCs) frequently have high levels of FAK/PYK2 and increased nuclear β-catenin, and that FAK deletion suppresses adenomas in a mutant <italic>APC</italic> mouse model. This is potentially a second mechanism for FAK to promote β-catenin accumulation (in addition to the phosphorylation of β-catenin by FAK).</p><p>In a previous paper, the authors showed that Wnt stimulates monoubiquitination of GSK3 and this monoubiquitination reduces phospho-β-catenin presentation to β-TrCP, thereby stabilizing β-catenin. Here they find that phosphorylation of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> stimulates monoubiquitination and binding of β-TrCP. The 216F mutant shows that lack of pY216 and/or lack of ubiquitin increases β-catenin turnover in presence or absence of Wnt, causing low β-catenin levels. The 216E mutant is constitutive. They show that FAK and PYK2 can phosphorylate Y216 (normally thought of as an autophosphorylation site), and knockdown of FAK reduces β-catenin level. FAK inhibitor (PF) inhibits tumor formation when GSK3 is wildtype, but only partly inhibits GSK3β<sup>Y216E</sup> mutant tumors. However, the authors do not distinguish effects of pY216 from effects of ubiquitin by use of their KKKK mutant used in their JBC paper. Therefore, the observations could be due to reduced GSK3 auto or trans phosphorylation rather than ubiquitin. It is also remarkable that the low stoichiometry of ubiquitination has a measurable effect, because the non-ubiquitinated molecules should remain active. However, the results would be understandable if the subset of GSK3 that is ubiquitinated is in the destruction complex. Another surprising finding is that GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> is not needed to stimulate β-catenin degradation by β-TrCP, which is presumably requires phosphorylation of β-catenin by GSK3 – but they didn't measure phospho-β-catenin with the 216F mutant.</p><p>From the significance point of view, the authors introduce the paper by saying that 85% of CRCs have mutant <italic>APC</italic> yet only 50% have increased nuclear β-catenin, implying that <italic>APC</italic> mutation is not sufficient to up-regulate nuclear β-catenin. Their paper provides data in support of a mechanism in which increased FAK/PYK2 activity in CRCs leads to increased GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup>, increases GSK3 ubiquitination, inhibits β-catenin turnover by bTrCP, and raises nuclear β-catenin levels. This predicts that nuclear β-catenin would be detected in CRCs that lack <italic>APC</italic> mutations, rather than the converse. It isn't clear how many human CRCs have increased nuclear β-catenin but lack <italic>APC</italic> mutations. Putting that aside, the tumor growth studies with 216F mutant GSK3 support the importance of this site, and the cancer studies with the PF inhibitor and the pathology supports the importance of FAK/PYK2 in CRC. However, the inhibition of tumors by PF does not exclude GSK3-independent effects of FAK.</p><p>1) The KKKK mutant should be used to confirm that nuclear β-catenin is increased regardless of FAK and PYK2 activity.</p><p>2) KKKK mutation of Y216E mutant should suppress activation.</p><p>3) Phospho-β-catenin<sup>S33/37</sup> should be measured with GSK3 YF, YE and KKKK mutants to confirm the inference that pY216 is not needed for phosphorylation of β-catenin.</p><p>4) The mechanism would be much better supported if the authors could show an effect of GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> or ubiquitination on the ability of β-TrCP to interact with phospho-β-catenin.</p><p>5) Does the PF inhibitor inhibit tumors in which the primary FAK phosphorylation site in β-catenin is mutated?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors report a FAK/PYK2/GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup>/β-catenin signaling axis, through which FAK and PYK2 converge on GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> and GSK3α<sup>Y279</sup>, with phosphorylated GSK3β<sup>Y216</sup> recruiting β-TrCP, which monoubituitinates GSK3β, blocking Wnt-induced degradation of β-catenin. All experiments were done in cell lines only, and a single FAK/PYK dual inhibitor was tested (although experiments were done in genetic and knockdown systems to verify signaling).</p><p>While experiments shown were convincing, the authors raise two issues not further addressed experimentally. First was that the dual FAK/PYK2 inhibitor also blocked GSK3α<sup>Y279</sup>, suggesting functional redundancy that was not further elucidated experimentally.</p><p>Second, the authors suggest but do not test, that FAK was upstream of PYK2 in vivo but not in vitro. Although the authors claim that use of a dual PYK2/FAK inhibitor might be superior to monospecific inhibitors to block emergent resistance in patients, the relevance of their in vitro experiments to an in vivo setting remain an open question not addressed in experiments presented. In the absence of in vivo validation, the conclusions drawn remain fairly preliminary.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.10072.010</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the previous round of peer review follow.]</p><p>We have made every effort to address the critiques thoroughly in this revision; the results of our additional experiments lend further support for our conclusion.

While this result further proved the importance of FAK/PYK2-mediated GSK3 phosphorylation, it also suggested that phosphorylation of β-catenin<sup>Y142E</sup> plays a role in FAK-targeted therapy for CRC.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>[…] While experiments shown were convincing, the authors raise two issues not further addressed experimentally.

The fact that PYK2 activity towards GSK3 phosphorylation was intact in FAK<sup>R454/R454</sup> knockin MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) indeed excluded FAK as direct upstream of PYK2 activity in vitro. We also recognized that it was not an accurate statement that “PYK2 and FAK function redundantly in intestinal tumorigenesis.” In the revised manuscript, we propose a new scenario to explain why intestine-specific deletion of FAK alone was sufficient to block tumor development in <italic>APC</italic> mutated mice.</p><p>A prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carothers et al., 2006</xref>) and our new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, right panel) showed that drastic elevation of PYK2 occurred in tumors in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice, indicating that PYK2 is upregulated during the process of intestinal tumorigenesis. FAK induction, although further enhanced in tumors, however, is triggered by <italic>APC</italic> mutation – the initiating event for tumorigenesis in the <italic>APC</italic>-mutant mice, through activated Wnt pathway target c-Myc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ashton et al., 2010</xref>). Therefore FAK induction by <italic>APC</italic> mutation should occur earlier than PYK2 elevation. If so, it explains why inhibition of FAK by intestinal deletion of FAK was sufficient to suppress tumor development. It also explains why PF562271 treatment inhibited PYK2 elevation in <italic>APC</italic><sup>min/+</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>, left panel). By phosphorylating GSK3 to promote the Wnt pathway, elevated PYK2 in tumors further enhances Wnt-dependent tumorigenesis – a positive feedback loop that reinforces the tumor development process (as suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carothers et al., 2006</xref>). In the revised manuscript, corresponding changes have been made to the Discussion.</p><p>Regardless of the exact mechanisms mediating in vivo PYK2 regulation during intestinal tumorigenesis, both FAK and PYK2 are elevated in already established colon tumors in CRC patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The current study indicates that effective inhibition of the Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC cells expressing FAK and PYK2 will only be achieved by simultaneously targeting both kinases, which provides a solid mechanistic justification for clinical use of FAK/PYK2 dual inhibitor instead of FAK-specific inhibitor for better clinical outcomes in CRC patients.</p></body></sub-article></article>
