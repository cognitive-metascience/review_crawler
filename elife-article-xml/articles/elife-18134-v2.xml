homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules (ISGs) and processing of prehormones to yield active peptides. The molecular mechanisms governing secretory granule maturation are largely unknown. Here, we investigate a highly conserved protein named HID-1 in a mouse model. A conditional knockout of HID-1 in pancreatic β cells leads to glucose intolerance and a remarkable increase in the serum proinsulin/insulin ratio caused by defective proinsulin processing. Large volume three-dimensional electron microscopy and immunofluorescence imaging reveal that ISGs are much more abundant in the absence of HID-1. We further demonstrate that HID-1 deficiency prevented secretory granule maturation by blocking homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules. Our data identify a novel player during the early maturation of immature secretory granules.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18134.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18134.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>HID-1</kwd><kwd>homotypic fusion</kwd><kwd>secretory granules maturation</kwd><kwd>FIB/SEM</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2016YFA0500200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2013CB910103</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Pingyong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31130065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31127901</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31127002</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Tao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31400658</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31300700</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cheng</surname><given-names>Dongwan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>HID-1 is a novel player mediating homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The trans-Golgi network (TGN) acts as the central transport and sorting station within cells, and is responsible for proper segregation and sorting of newly synthesized membrane and soluble cargo proteins to their appropriate subcellular destinations. Secretory granules (SGs, also known as dense core vesicles, DCVs) are specialized organelles of the regulated secretory pathway and play crucial roles in a wide variety of biological processes, including organism development, synaptic plasticity, immunity and metabolism. After passing through the TGN, peptide hormones and neuropeptides are first packaged and stored in immature secretory granules (ISGs). ISGs then undergo multiple maturation steps to become mature secretory granules (MSGs). These maturation steps include 'sorting-by-entry' of SG-specific cargoes, homotypic fusion of ISGs, acidification of granular lumen, condensation and processing of peptide hormones by prohormone convertases PC1/3 and PC2, and 'sorting-by-retention' (or 'sorting-by-exit') to remove cargoes not destined for SGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arvan and Castle, 1998</xref>). Homotypic fusion of ISGs has been observed in several neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahras et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendler et al., 2001</xref>), pituitary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farquhar and Palade, 1981</xref>) and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammel and Meilijson, 2015</xref>), and in the formation of large dense core vesicles in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Asensio et al., 2013</xref>), but it has not been observed in pancreatic β cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arvan and Halban, 2004</xref>). Hence, it remains unclear whether homotypic fusion is universally required for SG maturation.</p><p>Besides the significance of homotypic fusion of ISGs, the molecular mechanisms underlying ISG fusion and maturation remain elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kogel and Gerdes, 2010</xref>). SNARE proteins (soluble N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive fusion protein (NSF) attachment protein (SNAP) receptors) are essential components of the highly conserved machinery involved in membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jahn and Scheller, 2006</xref>). An in vitro fusion assay has revealed that ISG homotypic fusion is dependent on NSF and α-SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urbe et al., 1998</xref>) and on the SNARE protein syntaxin 6 (STX6), but not on syntaxin 1 or SNAP-25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendler et al., 2001</xref>). It has been suggested that Syt-IV, a synaptotagmin protein that interacts with SNAREs, localizes to ISGs and is involved in SG maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahras et al., 2006</xref>). While SNAREs are essential components of membrane fusion, they often require other accessory proteins to facilitate the assembly of SNARE complexes and to coordinate the tethering/docking and priming of vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pfeffer, 1999</xref>). The molecular players involved in tethering/docking and priming of ISGs are not known.</p><p>A gene designated as <italic>hid-1</italic> was identified during a search for mutants with a high-temperature-induced dauer formation (Hid) phenotype in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ailion and Thomas, 2003</xref>). Subsequently, <italic>hid-1</italic> has been isolated by a genetic screen for mutants mislocalizing rabphilin (RBF-1 in <italic>C. elegans</italic>), an effector of RAB-27 that is involved in SG exocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mesa et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>Hid1</italic> gene encodes a highly conserved protein (HID-1) that has homologs in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, mouse, and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, but not in budding yeast. HID-1 shares no homology domains with other proteins but is suggested to be a membrane-attached protein that shuttles between membrane and cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> have suggested an essential role for HID-1 in neuropeptide signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mesa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu et al., 2011</xref>), but the exact site(s) of action and the molecular mechanism by which HID-1 acts remain unknown.</p><p>In this study, we generated a conditional knockout (KO) mouse model in which the mouse <italic>Hid1</italic> gene is disrupted specifically in pancreatic β cells. This model allowed us to define a previously unidentified cellular function of the HID-1 protein. We demonstrate that HID-1 is a novel factor required for homotypic fusion of ISGs. Loss of function of HID-1 in mice leads to diabetes-like symptoms characterized by glucose intolerance, insufficient insulin release, and elevated proinsulin secretion.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Knockout of HID-1 in pancreatic β cells causes glucose intolerance</title><p>To avoid embryonic lethality and complications in interpreting the data from global KO mice, we employed a conditional gene-targeting approach to derive mice that selectively lack HID-1 expression in pancreatic β cells. We first generated <italic>Hid1</italic>-floxed mice by introducing two LoxP sites into the intronic region flanking exons 2–6 of the mouse <italic>Hid1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Then, <italic>Hid1</italic>-floxed mice were mated with mice overexpressing Cre recombinase under the control of the rat insulin 2 gene promoter (RIP-Cre mice) to produce cell-specific HID-1 KO mice (Hid1-betaKO, homozygous for <italic>Hid1<sup>flox/flox </sup></italic>and heterozygous for RIP-Cre). As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, HID-1 protein was greatly reduced in islets isolated from Hid1-betaKOmice compared to that in age-matched RIP-Cre mice, which were used thereafter as wild-type (WT) controls. The remaining expression of HID-1 in KO islets was only 20% of that from WT islets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By positive immunofluorescence staining, we verified that HID-1 was highly expressed in pancreatic β cells, but only weakly expressed in α cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Histogram analysis of HID-1 levels in individual β cells confirmed the largely reduced expression of HID-1 in KO β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Hid1-betaKOmice are viable and fertile, and the mice showed no obvious phenotype with respect to body weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), feeding, mating performance and overall behavior. To determine whether the disruption of HID-1 in β cells corresponds to abnormalities in the temporal control of glucose metabolism, we analyzed glucose profiles upon intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of glucose or insulin. At 10–12 weeks of age, Hid1-betaKOmice exhibited higher basal glucose levels and glucose intolerance than RIP-Cre mice during glucose-tolerance testing (GTT, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). However, Hid1-betaKO mice performed normally in insulin-tolerance testing (ITT) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These results indicate that impaired glucose tolerance may be caused by insufficient insulin release.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18134.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Hid1-betaKO mice exhibit glucose intolerance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram showing the endogenous mouse <italic>Hid-1</italic> gene and the targeting floxed construct.

Interestingly, the serum proinsulin level was markedly elevated from 5 pM in WT mice to 78 pM in Hid1-betaKOmice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), whereas the basal insulin level was only slightly increased (150 ± 29 pM for WT and 198 ± 39 pM for KO mice). The ratio between proinsulin and insulin was determined to be 3.3%, consistent with previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wijesekara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>). This value increased to 39.4% in KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The increase of proinsulin may be partially caused by the prolonged plasma half-life of proinsulin, as compared with insulin, in the circulation. To address this possibility, we directly measured glucose-stimulated insulin secretion (GSIS) from isolated islets. We found that isolated size-matched islets from Hid1-betaKO mice released much less insulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), but more proinsulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), in response to glucose stimulation.

Conversion of proinsulin to insulin involves cleavage at two sites to remove the C-peptide that links the B and A chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Steiner et al., 2016</xref>). In pancreatic β cells, PC2 and PC1/3 are present in the SGs, and these enzymes are believed to cooperate in the processing of proinsulin. It has been suggested that PC1/3 first acts at the B–C junction to produce the intermediate des-31,32 proinsulin, whereas PC2 preferentially cleaves at the A–C junction to produce the intermediate des-64,65 proinsulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Halban and Irminger, 1994</xref>). To further confirm the involvement of HID-1 in proinsulin processing and to understand which cleavage steps are affected in the absence of HID-1, we knocked out HID-1 in the insulin-secreting cell line (INS-1) using TALEN technology. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, western blotting confirmed the complete absence of HID-1 protein, increased proinsulin and reduced insulin in HID-1 KO INS-1 cells.</p><p>Rodent insulins are produced from two independent genes called <italic>Ins1</italic> and <italic>Ins2</italic>. As western blotting and autoradiography of proteins labeled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-cysteine could not detect the intermediates (des-31,32 and des-64,65) or distinguish Insulin1 from Insulin2, we employed liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect stable isotope-labeled proinsulin and its intermediates. Insulin1 was analyzed because products from the <italic>Ins1</italic> gene are predominant in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gishizky and Grodsky, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Michael et al., 1987</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>).

The insulin/proinsulin ratio was significantly lower in the KO cells than in WT controls during the chase period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These results were in accordance with the phenomenon observed in Hid1-betaKO mice. The retarded appearance of both des-31,32 and des-64,65 Proinsulin1 during the chase period indicated the concurrent impairment of PC1/3 and PC2 function in the KO INS-1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D,E</xref>).</p><p>Next we analyzed PC1/3, PC2 and carboxypeptidase E (CPE) expression in WT and KO islets. CPE is an enzyme that catalyzes the release of C-terminal arginine or lysine residues from polypeptides. A typical result from three independent experiments is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>. Quantification showed that HID-1 KO caused a slight decrease in PC1/3 and PC2 levels, but not in CPE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). We further quantified immunofluorescence-labeled PC1/3 and PC2 levels in single β cells using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Consistent with the above results, PC1/3 and PC2 levels were slightly lower in HID-1 KO β cells than in WT β cells. A previous study demonstrated that the 50% reduction in PC1/3 only elevated serum proinsulin/insulin ratio to 0.12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhu et al., 2002</xref>), hence, the slight decrease in PC1/3 and PC2 levels that we observed is not sufficient to explain the drastic defect in proinsulin processing (proinsulin/insulin ratio of 0.39).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>HID-1 deficiency increases the number of ISGs</title><p>Our results demonstrated that HID-1 deficiency caused defective proinsulin processing and proinsulin accumulation in β cells. Consequently, we employed immunofluorescence imaging to reveal the subcellular localization of proinsulin. Interestingly, we observed a dispersed distribution of proinsulin throughout the HID-1 KO cells, which was unlike the perinuclear localization seen in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The density of proinsulin vesicles was significantly increased from 0.58 ± 0.10/µm<sup>3</sup> in WT cells to 0.99 ± 0.07/µm<sup>3</sup> in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Since proinsulin is a specific ISG marker, the increase in proinsulin signals may reflect an increase in the number of ISGs. To test this hypothesis, we further checked other ISG markers, VAMP4 and Syt-IV. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>, both VAMP4 and Syt-IV localized to the peri-nuclear region, and co-localized with proinsulin puncta to a similar extent (similar Pearson coefficient). In HID-1 KO β cells, proinsulin and Syt-IV were similarly dispersed throughout the cytosol and displayed a similar extent of co-localization as in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> A and C, bottom, B and D). By contrast, VAMP4 remained in the peri-nuclear region and did not co-localize with proinsulin in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> A and B). Thus, proinsulin-positive ISGs in HID-1 KO cells seem to retain Syt-IV but not VAMP4, suggesting that VAMP4 recruitment to r retention in ISG depends on HID-1.

Previous ultra-structural studies of insulin-containing granules mainly employed transmission electron microscopy (TEM) on ultrathin sections (&lt;100 nm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orci, 1976</xref>). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>, ultrathin sectioning of granules of this size gives rise to various sub-maximum cross-sections, depending on where the section is on the z-axis, which leads to under-estimation of the granule size and makes it difficult to analyze the density and detailed morphology of the granules. The recent development of combining scanning EM (SEM) with focused ion beam (FIB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) has provided a powerful new method to study the morphology and distribution of SGs in whole cells at nanometer resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="other" rid="media2">2</xref>). Typical SGs exhibit a dark (electron dense) central core and a delimiting membrane, separated by a clear region (halo) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The grey levels of the dense core indicate the extent of packaging and condensation of insulin. It has been suggested that ISGs exhibit lighter dense cores than MSGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Furuta et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wijesekara et al., 2010</xref>). Since the grey levels of dense cores are not directly comparable between different SEM experiments, we compared the grey level distribution between the Golgi region and the peripheral region (&lt;1 μm from the PM) from the same SEM volume (13.7 x 11.8 x 5 μm<sup>3</sup>) in both WT and KO β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–E</xref>). Our results showed that in WT β cells, the grey levels of dense cores are mostly distributed in a zone with higher values (grey level &gt; 190, designated as denser cores in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) and only a small proportion are in a zone with lower values (grey level &lt; 190, designated as lighter cores in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The lighter core SGs were mostly from the Golgi region (84.0%), while the peripheral SGs are almost denser cores (99.2%). This result confirms the existence of at least two populations of SGs, ISGs and MSGs in resting WT β cells, and suggests that only a small fraction of ISGs are in the Golgi region. However, in KO cells, the clear distinction between the two populations was replaced by continuous distribution of grey levels from light to dense values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Adopting the same separation of grey level as for WT cells, we found that there were many more granules with a lighter dense core (&lt;190) in KO cells than in WT cells for both peripheral (47.6% vs 0.8%) and Golgi (87.8% vs 11.7%) regions, suggesting the appearance of more ISGs in both regions in the absence of HID-1. We further compared SG size and found that the SGs in peripheral regions were significantly larger than those in the Golgi region in WT β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D,E</xref>). The presence of larger SGs in the peripheral regions is consistent with the maturation of SGs on their way from the Golgi to the periphery because it has been reported that ISGs can fuse with each other and become larger in size during maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urbe et al., 1998</xref>). However, HID-1 deficiency significantly decreased the size of SGs in the peripheral region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F,G</xref>), suggesting abnormal maturation of SGs.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18134-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18134.014</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>The morphology of SGs in WT mouse β cells.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18134.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18134.014</ext-link></p></caption></media><media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media2" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-18134-media2.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.18134.015</object-id><label>Video 2.</label><caption><title>The morphology of SGs in HID-1 KO mouse β cells.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.18134.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.18134.015</ext-link></p></caption></media></p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HID-1 deficiency blocks homotypic fusion of ISGs</title><p>The above immunofluorescence and EM data clearly demonstrated the accumulation of smaller, less dense ISGs in the absence of HID-1, which could be caused by a blockage in the homotypic fusion of ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noske et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wijesekara et al., 2010</xref>).

Later, this concept of homotypic fusion of ISGs was validated using in vitro reconstitution assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tooze and Huttner, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urbe et al., 1998</xref>). It is believed that homotypic ISG fusion is important for the condensation and refinement of the contents and for remodeling of the membrane. However, homotypic ISG fusion has been reported in neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahras et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendler et al., 2001</xref>), mammotroph pituitary cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farquhar and Palade, 1981</xref>) and mast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hammel and Meilijson, 2015</xref>), and in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Asensio et al., 2013</xref>), but not in endocrine cells such as pancreatic β cells. Evidence for an absence of homotypic fusion in β cells mainly rests on the analysis of granule size. First, a dominant-negative construct against STX6 caused a delay in proinsulin processing but failed to affect the size of insulin granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kuliawat et al., 2004</xref>). Second, EM data in β cells did not reveal an increase in diameter of MSGs, but rather some shrinkage of granules as they age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutton, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noske et al., 2008</xref>). Determination of the granule size on thin sections can be tricky because planar sectioning at random depths through spherical granules tends to underestimate the diameter of granules and largely increase the variation. Besides, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Noske et al. (2008</xref>) did not compare the size of ISG and MSG, but rather reported a size change of older granules between two cells. Hence, large-volume 3D EM analysis of intact granules from multiple cells is needed for unbiased estimation of granule size and for comparison between ISGs and MSGs. In this study, we employed automatic FIB-SEM to visualize a large volume (13.7 x 11.8 x 3~8 μm<sup>3</sup>) at nanometer resolution and analyzed thousands of intact granules from 15 cells. We analyzed not only the diameter, but also the grey level of the cores and the subcellular localization of granules. This comprehensive analysis enables us to separate ISGs from MSGs clearly and to conclude that MSGs have larger size in β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, we have directly visualized homotypic fusion events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) despite their rareness. Together with data from in vitro ISG fusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), these lines of evidence clearly demonstrate the existence of homotypic ISG fusion in endocrine β cells. Please note that maturation of SGs may not always come with an increase in diameter, MSGs can either become smaller or larger than ISGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tooze et al., 2001</xref>). Maturation involves membrane remodeling steps of both homotypic fusion and budding events. Homotypic fusion would result in an increase in the size of ISGs, whereas budding of clathrin-coated vesicles from ISG would allow removal of excessive membrane and reduction in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arvan and Castle, 1998</xref>). Hence, the size of MSGs is determined by the coordinated action of fusion and budding events and is likely to be a cell-specific property.</p><p>The search for molecules that are involved in homotypic ISG fusion has led to the identification of NSF and α-SNAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Urbe et al., 1998</xref>), which promote membrane fusion by disassembling cis-SNAREs to form fusogenic trans-SNARE complexes between donor and target membranes. Later, the SNARE protein STX6, which localizes to ISGs but not MSGs, was found to be required for homotypic ISG fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wendler et al., 2001</xref>). SM proteins are essential partners for SNARE proteins in fusion – without one or the other, no fusion occurs physiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sudhof and Rothman, 2009</xref>). The interaction between Munc18-1, a neuronal SM protein, and syntaxin 1 is critical for the docking and priming of synaptic vesicles, which also requires Munc13 proteins. Munc13s, and related neuronal proteins called CAPS (calcium-dependent activator protein for secretion), are essential players during priming, and contain a large module called the MUN domain. It has been proposed that the MUN domain dramatically accelerates the transition from the closed syntaxin 1–Munc18-1 complex to the SNARE complex, probably by extracting the SNARE motif of syntaxin 1 from the closed conformation and providing a template for SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ma et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). Structural analyses have shown that the MUN domain has a similar architecture to domains found in vesicle tethering factors such as Sec6, Tip20, and Exo70 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2015</xref>). As such, Munc13s and CAPS belong to a family named CATHCR (complex associated with tethering containing helical rods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rizo and Sudhof, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>). CATCHR proteins have general function(s) in vesicle fusion by providing a physical link between donor and target membranes (sometimes called docking and sometimes called tethering) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yu and Hughson, 2010</xref>). Moreover, as described above for Munc13-1 and for the HOPS complex, tethering factors bind to SNARE proteins and can accelerate SNARE complex assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ren et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wickner, 2010</xref>). These ﬁndings suggest that the docking and assembly of the SNARE complex may be mediated by similar but not identical mechanisms in different systems. As HID-1 localizes to ISGs, it will be intriguing to test whether HID-1 can serve as a tethering factor to bridge disparate ISG membrane or as a priming factor for SNARE complex assembly. The large volume SEM and in vitro fusion assays we developed here provide the first evidence of ISG homotypic fusion during the maturation of insulin granules.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Insulin processing and granule acidification</title><p>Nascent ISGs generated from the TGN contain proinsulin, which does not efficiently pack into the higher-order granule matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steiner, 1973</xref>).

It is not clear how homotypic fusion affects proinsulin processing. One possibility is that the processing enzymes, PC1/3 and PC2, are mis-sorted to lysosomes for degradation, as suggested for Rab-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>). However, PC1/3 and PC2 levels in the HID-1 KO β cells were only slightly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and this small change is not sufficient to explain the drastic blockade of proinsulin processing. Another possibility is that the endopeptidase activities of PCs are affected in the absence of HID-1. It has been demonstrated that acidification is one of the most important steps in proinsulin processing and granule maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orci et al., 1986</xref>). Specifically, PC1/3 and PC2, which process proinsulin, are strictly pH-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lamango et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Orci et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seidah et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smeekens et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steiner, 1998</xref>). Indeed, we have provided the first evidence that granule acidification is blocked in the absence of HID-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Hence, it is plausible that HID-1 KO inhibits ISG homotypic fusion and thereby blocks granule acidification, which impairs the pH-dependent activity of PCs and retards proinsulin processing.</p><p>Progressive granule acidification is driven by the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which transports protons into the lumen and causes a decrease of the intragranular pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jefferies et al., 2008</xref>). We verified that vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase was present on ISGs as well as on MSGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although it is not clear how homotypic ISG fusion causes granule acidification, it has been proposed that ISG–ISG fusion could increase the density of the vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, as well as decreasing the H<sup>+</sup> permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wu et al., 2001</xref>). We propose that homotypic ISG fusion plays a pivotal role during SG maturation by condensing not only prohormones but also membrane machinery components, such as vacuolar H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase, which are required for the acidification of prohormones and their processing to form active peptides. Blockade of homotypic ISG fusion arrests SGs in an immature state and impairs subsequent maturation steps such as acidification, processing and sorting.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Physiological and pathophysiological implications</title><p>As early as 1972, Duckworth and Kitabchi reported that obese type 2 diabetic patients exhibited a greater rise in the proinsulin to insulin ratio than non-diabetic controls after an oral glucose challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Duckworth and Kitabchi, 1972</xref>). This result was subsequently confirmed in several stages of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Csorba, 1991</xref>). In recent years, an increasing amount of experimental and clinical evidence indicates that proinsulin and proinsulin-like compounds (mainly des-31,32 proinsulin) in serum have a close relationship with T2DM, whereas hyperinsulinemia in the early and intermediate disease stages is due to cross-reactivity between insulin and its precursors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pfutzner et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms of hyper-proinsulinemia associated with T2DM are still poorly understood.

In the current study, we have identified HID-1 as a novel player in homotypic ISG fusion, ablation of which impairs proinsulin processing. Apparently, many factors are required to orchestrate multiple steps of SG maturation from biogenesis at the TGN, through homotypic fusion and granule acidification, to cargo refinement. These players include, but are not limited to, Rab2, Rab2 effectors and SNARE accessory proteins. Rab2 localizes to the Golgi and is likely to be involved as a master regulator in multiple steps of vesicular trafficking, including budding from TGN, transportation, homotypic fusion, and sorting of cargoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Edwards et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stenmark, 2009</xref>).

In light of this and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatanaka et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Katsuta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stoy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), <italic>Hid1</italic> and other genes involved in SG maturation should be considered as previously unappreciated candidates for susceptibility for T2DM, IBD and many other diseases involving peptide hormones and neuropeptides.</p><p>In summary, we have identified a novel player that is essential for homotypic fusion of ISGs. We provide evidence that homotypic ISG fusion is essential for granule acidification and cargo processing. Further biochemical and structural studies will be needed to reveal how HID-1 cooperates with SNARE proteins to mediate homotypic ISG fusion.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Generation of the HID-1 KO mice</title><p>We first generated <italic>Hid1</italic>-floxed mice (<italic>Hid1<sup>flox/flox</sup></italic>) by homologous recombination of a targeting vector that replaced exons 2–6 of the coding sequence with the neomycin resistance gene.

The serum proinsulin and insulin concentration was detected using mouse proinsulin and insulin ELISA kits (ALPCO, Salem, NH, 80-PINMS-E01 and Shibayagi, Shibukawa, Japan, AKRIN-011S), respectively. For the in vitro insulin release assay, isolated islets were cultured in RPMI medium 1640 (with 7 mM glucose, GIBCO) for about 24 hr. After three washes with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 20 islets from each WT and KO group, were pre-incubated for 60 min in 4 mM glucose Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate HEPES buffer (KRBH) containing: 114 mM NaCl, 4.7 mM KCl, 1.2 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.16 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 20 mM HEPES with 0.2% BSA, pH 7.4.

Cell volume calculation and vesicles detection were performed though Imaris software (version 8.1.3, Bitplane, Concord, MA). The Spot function in Imaris automatically located proinsulin and insulin vesicles based on size and intensity thresholds. Each vesicle was represented by a sphere of arbitrary size determined by the user. The density of proinsulin vesicle was defined as the number of proinsulin puncta per cell volume (number/µm<sup>3</sup>).

After 60 min of pre-incubation at 9~11°C, islet incubations were continued at 37°C in a water bath for 1 hr (pulse). Islets were then washed, divided into four batches and incubated for 1, 2, and 3 hr in medium containing 3 mM glucose and 65 mg/L of unlabeled cysteine. After the pulse and chase incubations, the islets were washed, re-suspended in immunoprecipitation buffer (0.05 M Tris-HCl, 0.15 M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 1% sodium deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, pH 7.4) containing a mixture of protease inhibitors, and lysed for 1 hr at 4°C.

When the background and noise were removed, we applied auto local-maxima detection to identify the center of the vesicle dense core, and normalized the threshold for vesicle core segmentation. Finally, after applying filters to reject falsely detected results, the identification and segmentation of the dense core were completed.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Edwin R Chapman (Reviewer #1) and Jens Rettig (Reviewer #2), and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript by Du et al. investigates the role of the HID-1 protein in the biogenesis of large dense-core granules (LDCVs) in pancreatic β cells. The authors and the Nonet lab have shown previously that HID-1 localizes to the intracellular membranes like Golgi apparatus and dense-core vesicles through myristoylation at its N-terminus (Mesa et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2011; Yu et al., 2011). It was proposed that HID-1 is involved in some step of LDCV biogenesis, maturation or trafficking, however, which step is affected remained unclear. In this manuscript Du et al. generate a conditional knockout of HID-1 and show in a very elegant series of experiments that HID-1 is required for homotypic fusion of immature LDCV precursors. As a result, HID-1 KO mice show an increase in serum proinsulin levels and glucose intolerance.</p><p>Overall, the experiments are well performed and of high quality, particularly the beautiful 3D-EM reconstructions. The conclusions are mostly supported by the data. The reviewers have specific suggestions to improve the manuscript before publications can be recommended.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) While the STX6 data provides an interesting idea about a potential SNARE interaction, much work needs to be done before the HID1-STX6 link can be strengthened. For example, Further evidence for a role for STX6 in homotypic fusion of immature secretory vesicles would be interesting, and evidence that HID1 plays a role would be entirely novel. Similarly, the authors could strengthen their conjecture by demonstrating that an open form of STX6 bypasses a requirement for HID1, or that STX fails to be recruited to immature secretory vesicles in <italic>hid1</italic> mutants or some other functional interaction. Considering the time it will take to do these experiments, the reviewers recommend the authors save the STX6 data for the next paper and eliminate them from the current manuscript.</p><p>2) ISGs in <italic>hid1</italic> mutants. The authors argue that in <italic>hid1</italic> KO cells, SGs persist in an immature form and mis-localize throughout the cell. However, the maturation status of the vesicles is monitored only by the presence of pro-insulin cargo and indirectly by size and electron-density in electron micrographs. It is possible that secretory granules in HID1 mutants partially mature. The authors should assess:</p><p>Do the secretory granules in <italic>hid1</italic> KO cells retain known immature granule markers including synaptotagmin-IV and VAMP4 (Ahras et al., JCB 2006)?</p><p>Do the secretory granules in <italic>hid1</italic> KO cells acquire known markers of maturity, such as synaptobrevin-2 (Walter et al., EMBO 2014)?</p><p>3) The Introduction needs to be rewritten with the following points in mind. The specific emphasis on SNAREs in the current Introduction, without the discussion of accessory proteins, is unintentionally misleading. Clarity about HID-1 could be provided by briefly discussing its domain structure and what is known about its ability to associate with membranes. A brief discussion of the granule proteases, ISG acidification, and/or other maturation factors would also be more relevant to the authors findings. Furthermore, HID-1 was also identified in a screen mislocalizing RBF-1 rabphilin, a RAB-27 effector and both of these proteins have important roles in DCV maturation and exocytosis. I think this literature might serve as better introduction to HID-1, and other maturation factors, as opposed to its significance to high-temperature-induced dauer formation and the suppression of HID-1 by the daf-16 transcription factor.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;HID-1 is required for homotypic fusion of immature secretory granules during maturation&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

Nice paper on a difficult subject – we applaud the authors.</p><p>However, there is one small concern that must be addressed: the revision of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> is confusing because the 3 micron scale bar did not increase in size with the higher magnification. Clearly, there is a minor error here that can be readily corrected.</p><p>On a second, also minor note:</p><p>As requested by the authors, we do not think the new Figure on syt-4, vamp4, and vamp2 localization should be included in this manuscript. The significance of these experiments seems less clear in light of other reviewers' criticisms of the STX6 data (which has now been removed). A finer resolution of <italic>hid1</italic>'s effects on granule maturation, beyond homotypic fusion, seem beyond the scope of this paper. Additionally, while interesting, these experiments were not conducted as rigorously as other experiments in the paper and are difficult to interpret. For example, these experiments may have been more informative if the analysis was restricted to the perinuclear region (as it was in other experiments) and if they were not maximum projections. It might also be helpful to know more about the deconvolution and see some examples of the raw data to properly evaluate the colocalizaiton data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This is a revised version of a manuscript describing the role of the HID-1 protein in the biogenesis of large dense-core granules (LDCVs) in pancreatic β cells.

I like these data and would suggest to include them as supplementary material.</p><p>3) The Introduction has been rewritten modestly. Reviewer 1 should decide whether the changes are sufficient.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The revised manuscript addresses my concerns from the first review. There are three remaining concerns that warrant textual changes.</p><p>1) Homotypic fusion in endocrine cell. The authors argue that HID1 promotes homotypic fusion in β islet endocrine cells. However, the dogma is that homotypic fusion does not occur in endocrine cells, but rather only in neuroendocrine cells. On the other hand, the data against homotypic fusion in endocrine cells are not particularly strong, and that is in part why this manuscript is interesting. The potential conflict with the dogma should be mentioned in the Introduction and expanded upon in the Discussion. Evidence for homotypic fusion is observed in cells that form large dense-core granules such as neuroendocrine cells, including PC12 cells (1,2,3), mammotroph pituitary cells (4), mast cells (5), and in the formation of LDCVs in yeast (6). Evidence for an absence of homotypic fusion in endocrine cells rests on two observations: First, disrupting syntaxin-6 using a dominant negative construct did not exhibit a defect in insulin granule formation in INS-1 β-cells, but rather a delay in pro-insulin processing (7). Second, electron microscopy data in β cells (8, 9) does not reveal an increase in diameter in mature secretory granules. The strengths and weaknesses of these previous data should be mentioned in the Discussion.</p><p>2) Granule diameter. The authors claim that previous researchers have noted that mature granules are larger in diameter (and are light density) and cite Furuta 1998, Noske 2008, and Wijesekara 2010 (subsection “HID-1 deficiency increases the number of ISGs”, second paragraph and subsection “HID-1 deficiency blocks homotypic fusion of ISGs”, first paragraph). Furuta 1998 and Wijesekara 2010 both note that immature granules are lighter, but did not report diameters. Noske et al. suggest that old granules are smaller, not larger. In fact, Noske et al. were not studying immature granules, they report a size change in older cells. Orci 1986 also states that maturation involves condensation of the matrix, and reduction in granule diameter. The authors observed the opposite – they see larger mature vesicles suggesting homotypic fusion. The authors may be the first to study granule maturation in any comprehensive way; block in the prohormone convertase or the zinc transporter are unlikely to affect membrane trafficking events.</p><p>3) Molecular nature of immature granules. The argument that granules are immature in the <italic>hid1</italic> KO is solid. First, the matrix is lighter. Second, proinsulin is still present in the granules. Third, the presence of immature granule membrane proteins reinforces this conclusion, in particular synaptotagmin 4. Thus, the synaptotagmin 4 data should be included. It is unfortunate that the authors did not include syntaxin 6 staining, to demonstrate that proteins required for homotypic fusion were both still on the pro-insulin granules, which would provide evidence that granule maturation is blocked at a step before homotypic fusion. But that is a quibble; the manuscript should be published. VAMP4 was not mislocalized in the <italic>hid1</italic> KO. This result does not challenge the author's conclusion about a role for HID1 in homotypic fusion. VAMP4 has not been shown to be required for fusion of immature secretory granules, whereas syntaxin-6 is required. The authors conclude that HID1 is required for VAMP4 inclusion in immature secretory granules. Alternatively, VAMP4 may be removed by an intact 'sorting-by-exit' mechanism in the <italic>hid1</italic> KO. These data are an interesting facet of the KO phenotype and should be included. The mature granule marker VAMP2 is not observed on immature granules in <italic>hid1</italic> KO cells. These data are consistent with their model that granules are not mature in <italic>hid1</italic> KO cells. However, the authors did not validate that the VAMP2 antibody was associated with mature insulin granules in the wild type. Thus the negative result is not clearly interpretable and these data unfortunately should not be included.</p><p>References</p><p>1) Wendler et al. MBC 2001</p><p>2) Ahras et al.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A and C</xref>, VAMP4 and synaptotagmin IV both localized to the peri-nuclear compartment, similar as the distribution of proinsulin in WT β cells. VAMP4 and synaptotagmin IV partially co-localized with proinsulin puncta to a similar extent (similar Pearson coefficient). In HID-1 KO β cells, proinsulin and synaptotagmin IV staining dispersed throughout the cytosol and co-localized to a similar extent as in WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A and C</xref>, bottom, B and D). In contrast, the localization of VAMP4 was unchanged and remained in the peri-nuclear region. As a consequence, the co-localization of proinsulin and VAMP4 was significantly reduced in KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1A and B</xref>). Thus, proinsulin-positive secretory granules in HID-1 KO cells seem to retain synaptotagmin IV but not VAMP4, suggesting VAMP4 recruitment or retaining to ISG depends on HID-1. Besides, previous study has shown that VAMP4 antibody did not inhibit homotypic fusion of PC12-derived ISGs, which indicates that VAMP4 is not an essential component for ISG-ISG fusion process (Wendler et al., 2001). As for MSG marker VAMP2, its dispersed localization was not altered by HID-1 KO and there was few co-localization between proinsulin and VAMP2 in WT and KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1E and F</xref>), suggesting VAMP2 is not recruited to proinsulin granules in either WT or KO cells.

Second, electron microscopy data in β cells (8, 9) does not reveal an increase in diameter in mature secretory granules. The strengths and weaknesses of these previous data should be mentioned in the Discussion.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this important dogma and for providing detailed review of the references. As suggested, we have briefly introduced the dogma in the Introduction (first paragraph) and expanded in the Discussion section (subsection “Homotypic fusion in the SG maturation process”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>2) Granule diameter. The authors claim that previous researchers have noted that mature granules are larger in diameter (and are light density) and cite Furuta 1998, Noske 2008, and Wijesekara 2010 (subsection “HID-1 deficiency increases the number of ISGs”, second paragraph and subsection “HID-1 deficiency blocks homotypic fusion of ISGs”, first paragraph).

The authors may be the first to study granule maturation in any comprehensive way; block in the prohormone convertase or the zinc transporter are unlikely to affect membrane trafficking events.</italic> </p><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up this important point. The reviewer is correct that there is controversy whether mature granules are larger in size or not. The papers we cited (Furuta et al., 1998; Wijesekara et al., 2010) noted the lighter ISG but did not report diameter. So we have changed the sentence to “It has been suggested that ISGs exhibit lighter dense cores than MSGs.” (subsection “HID-1 deficiency increases the number of ISGs”). Tooze et al. (Tooze et al., 1991) have reported the smaller size of ISG in PC12 cells as copied below, so we added this reference in the first paragraph of the subsection “Homotypic fusion in the SG maturation process”.</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, the diameter of granules after maturation may not be always larger. As wrote by Tooze et al. (Tooze et al., 2001), “Maturation of secretory granules also involves a change in size, and MSGs can either become smaller or larger than ISGs. A decrease in size should be proportional to the number of vesicles budded from each ISG, although this has not been confirmed experimentally. MSGs become larger than ISGs through homotypic fusion of ISGs that probably precedes CCV formation”. We have added this possibility in the Discussion section (subsection “Homotypic fusion in the SG maturation process”, first paragraph).</p><p>We thank the reviewer for stating that we studied granule size in a comprehensive way. Previous analysis of granule size largely relies on EM of thin sections, which is problematic because planar sectioning at random depths through spherical granules tends to underestimate the diameter of granules and largely increase the variation. As we explained in the text:</p><p>“In this study we employed automatic FIB-SEM to visualize large volume (13.7x11.8x3~8 μm<sup>3</sup>) at nanometer resolution and analyze thousands of intact granules from 15 cells. We analyzed not only the diameter, but also the grey level of the cores and the subcellular localization of the granules. This comprehensive analysis enables us to clearly separate ISGs from MSGs and conclude that MSGs have larger size in β cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).”</p><p><italic>3) Molecular nature of immature granules. The argument that granules are immature in the hid1 KO is solid. First, the matrix is lighter. Second, proinsulin is still present in the granules. Third, the presence of immature granule membrane proteins reinforces this conclusion, in particular synaptotagmin 4. Thus, the synaptotagmin 4 data should be included. It is unfortunate that the authors did not include syntaxin 6 staining, to demonstrate that proteins required for homotypic fusion were both still on the pro-insulin granules, which would provide evidence that granule maturation is blocked at a step before homotypic fusion. But that is a quibble; the manuscript should be published. VAMP4 was not mislocalized in the hid1 KO. This result does not challenge the author's conclusion about a role for HID1 in homotypic fusion.

However, the authors did not validate that the VAMP2 antibody was associated with mature insulin granules in the wild type. Thus the negative result is not clearly interpretable and these data unfortunately should not be included.</italic> </p><p>Reviewer 1 didn’t think the new data should be included, whereas Reviewer 2 suggested including them as supplementary material. Reviewer 3 suggested including Syt-IV and VAMP4, but not VAMP2. We are not sure how we should respond and would like to hear the decision of the editor. For the time being, we included the data of Syt-IV and VAMP4 in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>, described in the first paragraph of the subsection “HID-1 deficiency increases the number of ISGs”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
