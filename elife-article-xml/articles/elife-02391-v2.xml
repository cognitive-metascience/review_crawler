The complexin accessory helix inhibits release and was proposed to insert into SNARE complexes to prevent their full assembly. This model was supported by ‘superclamp’ and ‘poor-clamp’ mutations that enhanced or decreased the complexin-I inhibitory activity in cell–cell fusion assays, and by the crystal structure of a superclamp mutant bound to a synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complex. NMR studies now show that the complexin-I accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution, and electrophysiological data reveal that superclamp mutants have slightly stimulatory or no effects on neurotransmitter release, whereas a poor-clamp mutant inhibits release. Importantly, increasing or decreasing the negative charge of the complexin-I accessory helix inhibits or stimulates release, respectively. These results suggest a new model whereby the complexin accessory helix inhibits release through electrostatic (and perhaps steric) repulsion enabled by its location between the vesicle and plasma membranes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02391.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02391.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02391.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The instructions sent to, from and within the brain are rapidly transmitted along neurons in the form of electrical signals. These signals cannot pass across the small gaps—called synapses—that separate neighboring neurons. Instead, neurons release chemicals called neurotransmitters into the synapses, and these relay the signal to the next neuron.</p><p>The neurotransmitters are stored inside neurons in small bubbles called vesicles. To release these neurotransmitters into the synapse, the membrane that encloses the vesicle fuses with the membrane that surrounds the neuron. To fuse the membranes, proteins embedded in the vesicle membrane interact with similar proteins in the neuron membrane to form a structure called a SNARE complex. Additional proteins control membrane fusion to ensure that the signal is passed to the other neuron at the right time and with the appropriate efficiency.</p><p>Among these proteins are the complexins, which are often found attached to SNARE complexes. Although different parts of complexins can both help and hinder membrane fusion, a part known as an accessory helix is thought to have only one role—to stop the membranes from fusing together. Several models have been suggested for how the accessory helix interferes with fusion. However, after performing a range of analyses by diverse biophysical techniques, Trimbuch, Xu et al. suggest these models are unlikely to describe the process accurately.</p><p>Instead, Trimbuch, Xu et al. propose a new model based on the electrostatic properties of two molecules that are both negatively charged. An accessory helix taken from a fruit fly complexin was more negatively charged than a mammalian version, and experiments showed it was also better at preventing the release of neurotransmitters. It is thought that the negative charges on the helix hold the membranes apart because the helix is located between the membranes, which are also negatively charged. Consistent with this model, Trimbuch, Xu et al. showed that the membranes fused more easily when some of the negative charges on the accessory helix were replaced with positive charges. The next challenges are to test the model further with additional studies, and to explain how other proteins work with complexins to control neurotransmitter release.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02391.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02391.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>synaptic vesicle exocytosis</kwd><kwd>protein interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB665, 958</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trimbuch</surname><given-names>Thorsten</given-names></name><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SynVglut</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Excellence Cluster Neurocure</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Exc257</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenmund</surname><given-names>Christian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000928</institution-id><institution>Welch Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>I-1304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NS37200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rizo</surname><given-names>Josep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Challenging a widespread model, biophysical and electrophysiological experiments suggest a new mechanism whereby complexins inhibit neurotransmitter release through electrostatic repulsion between their accessory helix and the membranes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Neurotransmitter release is crucial for interneuronal communication and is exquisitely regulated by a sophisticated protein machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sudhof, 2013</xref>).

The activating function has been proposed to arise from stabilization of the SNARE complex by complexin binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>), from interactions of the complexin N-terminus with the C-terminus of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2010</xref>), and from binding of the complexin C-terminal region to phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Seiler et al., 2009</xref>), but these models remain to be validated. The inhibitory activity of complexins attracted much attention because several studies suggested that complexins prevent exocytosis before Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and synaptotagmin-1 releases the inhibition upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding by displacing complexins from the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaub et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roggero et al., 2007</xref>). Later analyses showed that CpxI is not fully displaced but there is competition between synaptotagmin-1 and part of CpxI for binding to the SNARE complex on membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). Genetic interaction studies in hippocampal neurons showed that complexins regulate release similarly in the absence or presence of synaptotagmin-1, indicating that complexins function independently of synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xue et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">2010</xref>), but this finding does not exclude the notion that complexins and synaptotagmin-1 may cooperate in regulating release. For example, the dramatic increase of spontaneous release observed in complexin nulls in <italic>Drosophila</italic> requires synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jorquera et al., 2012</xref>), and absence of complexins in hippocampal neurons sensitizes release to loss of 50% of synaptotagmin-1 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>While it is clear that the complexin accessory helix inhibits release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Maximov et al., 2009</xref>), a satisfactory model for this activity has not emerged yet. We initially proposed that part of this helix might replace part of the synaptobrevin SNARE motif in trans partially assembled SNARE complexes, hindering C-terminal assembly of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xue et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A similar insertion model, but envisioning that the entire accessory helix replaces part of synaptobrevin, was proposed later and was supported by the enhanced inhibition in cell–cell fusion assays caused by replacing charged with hydrophobic residues in the accessory helix of CpxI ('superclamp mutants') and by the design of a ‘poor-clamp’ mutation (K26A) that impairs the inhibitory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>). The crystal structure of a fragment of a CpxI superclamp mutant (D27L, E34F, R37A) bound to a SNARE complex with C-terminally truncated synaptobrevin suggested an alternative model whereby the central helix of one CpxI molecule binds to a SNARE complex and the accessory helix inserts into another SNARE complex, resulting in a zigzag array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, formation of such a complex with wild type (WT) CpxI would be highly unfavorable thermodynamically because three charged residues would be placed into hydrophobic environments.</p><p>The study described here was designed to investigate how the complexin accessory helix inhibits neurotransmitter release, testing the insertion and zigzag models as well as additional models that emerged subsequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). Using NMR spectroscopy and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC), we show that the accessory helix of CpxI does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution. Furthermore, in stark contrast with the cell–cell fusion data, rescue experiments in complexin I-III triple knockout (KO) neurons reveal that superclamp mutations in CpxI lead to slightly stimulatory or no effects on neurotransmitter release, while the poor-clamp K26A mutation impairs release. We also find that the accessory helix of complexin from <italic>drosophila melanogaster</italic> inhibits spontaneous release more strongly than the accessory helix of mammalian CpxI, which may arise from the more negatively charged nature of the former. Indeed, a mutation that increases the negative charge of the CpxI accessory helix inhibits release and a mutation that decreases the negative charge enhances release. These results suggest a model whereby the location of the negatively charged accessory helix between the synaptic vesicle and plasma membranes causes electrostatic and perhaps steric repulsion with the membranes, thus hindering membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes: NMR analysis with <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled CpxI fragments</title><p>To analyze interactions between CpxI and soluble truncated SNARE complexes that might mimic trans SNARE complexes partially assembled between two membranes (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, insertion model), we used <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N two-dimensional transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) spectra, which provide a powerful tool to study protein–protein interactions.

Cross-peaks from the accessory helix, which does not contact the SNARE complex, are also perturbed by binding because the stabilization of the central helix propagates toward the accessory helix, but the perturbations are progressively smaller toward the N-terminus due to fraying of the helix and retention of the intrinsic flexibility characteristic of the isolated CpxI(26-83) fragment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02391.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>NMR analysis of interactions between <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled CpxI fragments and synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Expansions of <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI(26-83) free (black contours), or bound to non-truncated SNARE complex (red contours), to SCΔ68 (blue contours) or SCΔ62 (green contours).

Comparison with the spectrum obtained in the presence of non-truncated SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) showed that the well-resolved cross-peaks from several residues of the central helix (e.g., those of E58, E60, M62, R63 and Q64) moved gradually to the center of the spectrum, toward their positions in free CpxI(26-83), as the truncation was more severe. Moreover, some of these cross-peaks exhibited broadening that most likely arises from chemical exchange. In contrast, cross-peaks from more C-terminal residues of the central helix (e.g., those of I66, D68 and K69) were less affected by the truncations. This behavior is illustrated by the chemical shift changes observed in the CpxI(26-83) central helix when comparing SC-bound vs SCΔ68-bound spectra [ΔδCpx(SCΔ68-SC)], normalized by the changes observed between free and SC-bound Cpx(26-83) [ΔδCpx(SC-free)] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These ratios provide a measure of the destabilization of the central helix caused by the synaptobrevin C-terminal truncation. A plot of ΔδCpx(SCΔ68-SC) vs ΔδCpx(SC-free) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) also shows that cross-peaks from the C-terminus of the central helix were less affected by the C-terminal truncation.</p><p>The differential effects of the truncations show that the movements toward the center of the spectrum do not result simply from incomplete binding of the CpxI(26-83) fragment to the truncated SNARE complexes, which should be almost quantitatively bound based on affinities measured by ITC (see below). Instead, these data indicate that there is exchange between the normal bound state with a stable central helix and one or more states where the C-terminus of the central helix is stably packed against the SNAREs but the N-terminus of the central helix is flexible. These states become more populated for the Δ62 truncation than for Δ68. The effect of the Δ68 truncation can be attributed to an overall destabilization of the synaptobrevin helix beyond R56, the residue in the central polar layer of the SNARE complex that provides an approximate point of separation for two folding units corresponding to the N- and C-terminal halves of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sorensen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). This destabilization is manifested in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of the truncated SNARE complex described below and is transferred to the CpxI central helix, which is not surprising because the central helix makes extensive contacts with synaptobrevin residues spanning from R47 to A69 in the non-truncated complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The stronger effects on the cross-peaks of the CpxI central helix caused by the Δ62 truncation, compared to Δ68, arise naturally from the removal of key synaptobrevin residues that interact with CpxI, including D64, D65 and D68.</p><p>Changes in the cross-peaks corresponding to the CpxI accessory helix caused by the Δ62 and Δ68 synaptobrevin truncations were more difficult to monitor because the cross-peaks are mostly located in the crowded center of the spectrum. The truncations did cause some changes in the center of the spectrum, but the number of cross-peaks and their overall distribution remained similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Cross-peaks from the accessory helix that could be identified in all the spectra exhibited some shifts in the different complexes, but in all cases they remained close to the position of the cross-peak corresponding to free CpxI(26-83) (illustrated by the A30 and Q38 cross-peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Note that these shifts can be induced by changes in the stability of the helix in the different complexes and that insertion of the accessory helix into the truncated SNARE complexes is expected to induce much more dramatic shifts. Moreover, such insertion should cause strong broadening in the cross-peaks from the accessory helix, but the intensities of these cross-peaks actually increased in the spectrum of Cpx(26-83) bound to SCΔ68 with respect to the SC-bound state, and increased somewhat more in the SCΔ62-bound spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1C,D</xref>). These data show that the synaptobrevin C-terminal truncations increase the flexibility of the accessory helix, in correlation with the destabilization of N-terminal part of the central helix, and provide very strong evidence against the notion that the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83) inserts into the grove generated by the truncations.</p><p>Since the crystal structure of the CpxI(26-83) D27L, E34F, R37A superclamp mutant bound to a SNARE complex with C-terminally synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was obtained with a complex containing synaptobrevin truncated at residue 60 (SCΔ60), we also acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI(26-83) in the presence of SCΔ60. The spectra was similar to that obtained with SCΔ62, but most cross-peaks from the central helix were broadened beyond detection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). This behavior can be attributed to stronger chemical exchange broadening, which is particularly well manifested for the cross-peaks of K73 and K75 (which are adjacent to the central helix). The well-resolved cross-peaks from the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83) bound to SCΔ60 (e.g., those of A30 and Q38) had similar intensities as those observed upon binding to SCΔ62, showing that the accessory helix does not insert into the groove left by the Δ60 truncation. Because the zigzag array observed in the crystal structure of the CpxI(26-83) superclamp/SCΔ60 complex suggested that the accessory helix should be able to bind by itself to SCΔ60, without the central helix, we also acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of a WT <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI fragment spanning the accessory helix [CpxI(26-48)]. SCΔ60 did not cause substantial changes in the spectra of CpxI(26-48) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Because of the very high sensitivity of these spectra to binding to protein complexes such as SCΔ60, particularly for flexible peptides such as CpxI(26-48), even a small percentage of binding should be reflected in some cross-peak broadening. Hence, these results clearly show that CpxI(26-48) does not bind to the synaptobrevin Δ60 truncated SNARE complex in solution under the conditions of our experiments.</p><p>We also acquired parallel <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled fragments of the CpxI(26-83) D27L, E34F, R37A superclamp mutant (supcl) in the presence and absence of SCΔ60. The data acquired with <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI(26-48)supcl showed no binding to SCΔ60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), as observed for WT CpxI(26-48). The spectrum obtained for <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI(26-83)supcl bound to SCΔ60 was similar to that obtained for WT CpxI(26-83), with a few differences that arise from the mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and are also observed in the spectra obtained for the free CpxI fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Moreover, the overall effects of SCΔ60 binding to CpxI(26-83)suplc are similar to those observed for WT CpxI(26-83) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,D,E</xref>) and, as observed for the WT protein, the cross-peaks from the accessory helix do not exhibit dramatic shifts and/or broadening as would be expected for insertion into the groove left by the synaptobrevin truncation. Therefore, we were unable to detect an interaction between the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83)supcl and SCΔ60 under the conditions of our NMR experiments, although we cannot rule out the possibility that there is a weak interaction in solution that becomes stabilized by crystallization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes: NMR analysis with <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled SNARE complexes</title><p>To further test the insertion model, we also acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of truncated SNARE complexes that were <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled at the C-terminal SNARE motif of SNAP-25 (SNC) or at the syntaxin-1 SNARE motif (Syx), since these SNARE motifs were prediced to contact the CpxI accessory helix in synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes.

Since the crystal structure leading to the zig-zag model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was obtained with synaptobrevin truncated at residue 60, we acquired additional <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra with <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNCΔ60, but similar data were obtained again on addition of WT CpxI(26-83) or Cpx(26-83)supcl mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). All these results suggest that the accessory helix of WT CpxI(26-83), Cpx(26-83)supcl and dmCpx(28-88) do not insert into the SNARE complexes containing C-terminally truncated synaptobrevin. Finally, addition of a CpxI fragment spanning only the accessory helix [CpxI(26-48)] caused practically no changes on the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N HSQC spectrum of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNC-SCΔ62 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), confirming that the accessory helix does not bind by itself to the truncated SNARE complex or binds with extremely weak affinity.</p><p>We also performed parallel experiments with truncated SNARE complex <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-labeled at the syntaxin-1 SNARE motif (<sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syx-SCΔ62). Comparison of the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY HSQC spectra of this complex and the non-truncated complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) revealed that the Δ62 truncation led to disappearance of most of the well-resolved cross-peaks from residues beyond the residue in the polar layer (Q226 for Syx) and an increase in sharp cross-peaks in the center of the spectrum. These results correlated with those obtained with <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNC-SCΔ62 and indicate that the C-terminal half of the syntaxin-1 SNARE motif becomes flexible due to the Δ62 synaptobrevin truncation, although the smaller number of cross-peaks in the middle suggests that there may be broadening due to exchange between structured and flexible conformations. CpxI(26-83) caused multiple changes in the <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY HSQC spectrum of the <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syx-SCΔ62 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) that correlate with those observed for the non-truncated SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Only limited changes were observed for the sharp cross-peaks in the middle of the spectrum, which can arise from partial stabilization of the syntaxin-1 helix. Although these data are less conclusive than those obtained with the <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-SNC-SCΔ62 complex, it is clear that CpxI(26-83) binding did not yield new well-dispersed cross-peaks that might correspond to structured syntaxin-1 C-terminal residues interacting with the CpxI(26-83) accessory helix. Hence, these data further support the conclusion that the accessory helix does not interact with C-terminally synaptobrevin truncated SNARE complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The accessory helix does not insert into synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes: analysis by ITC</title><p>The primary evidence reported to support the notion that the accessory helix of WT CpxI(26-83) inserts into the synaptobrevin Δ60 truncated SNARE complex, as observed by crystallography for the CpxI(26-83) D27L, E34F, R37A superclamp mutant, was obtained in competition assays monitored by ITC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>). In these assays, 1.5 equivalents of CpxI lacking the accessory helix [CpxI(47-134)] were used to block the central helix binding site of SCΔ60, and the heat observed on addition of CpxI(26-83) was attributed to binding of the accessory helix of CpxI(26-83) to SCΔ60. This interpretation assumed that 1.5 equivalents for CpxI(47-134) were sufficient to quantitatively saturate SCΔ60, but the validity of this assumption is unclear because removal of multiple synaptobrevin residues that interact with CpxI in the non-truncated SNARE complex is expected to considerably decrease the affinity of SCΔ60 for CpxI.</p><p>To address this issue, we measured the affinity of CpxI(47-134) for SCΔ60 and the non-truncated SNARE by ITC. For the latter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), we measured a K<sub>d</sub> of 339 ± 9 nM (ΔH = −32.6 kcal/mol; N = 0.95), which is higher than that we obtained for CpxI(26-83) [K<sub>d</sub> = 25.3 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2013</xref>] and may arise because of favorable long-range electrostatic interactions between the accessory helix and the SNARE complex. Importantly, binding of Cpx(47-134) to SCΔ60 was even weaker, with a K<sub>d</sub> of 2.39 ± 0.19 μM (ΔH = −19.5 kcal/mol; N = 0.92) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This decreased affinity implies that binding of CpxI(47-134) to SCΔ60 is not saturated upon addition of 1.5 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) (arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Hence, the heat observed upon addition of CpxI(26-83) to SCΔ60 blocked with CpxI(27-134) arises from completion of the titration of the central helix binding site, rather than from interactions involving the accessory helix. We confirmed this conclusion by titrating CpxI(47-134) itself on a sample containing SCΔ60 and 1.5 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), which logically yielded data similar to those observed in the direct titration experiment of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> beyond 1.5 equivalents. Moreover, adding CpxI(26-83) to SCΔ60 prebound to 1.5 equivalents of CpxI(47-134) yielded very similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which in turn were also comparable to the data described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al.

As expected, addition of Cpx(26-83) yielded only a small amount of heat that again is the natural extension of the direct titration of the central helix binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

It is likely that such disappearance arises from chemical exchange between the flexible conformations of the synaptobrevin C-terminal half in free <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-Syb-SCΔ236 and formation of a defined helical structure that does not contact CpxI(26-83) but is nucleated by stabilization of the middle of synaptobrevin upon binding of the CpxI(26-83) central helix. Regardless of the validity of this explanation, it is clear from the behavior of the cross-peaks of the accessory helix that this helix does not interact with the synaptobrevin SNARE motif of the syntaxin-1 truncated SNARE complexes, arguing against the model of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Complexin I superclamp mutations do not inhibit neurotransmitter release</title><p>In parallel with our structural studies, we tested the complexin insertion and zigzag models emerging from cell–cell fusion assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>) and X-ray crystallography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>) by examining the effects on neurotransmitter release of some of the mutations that were reported to alter the inhibitory activity of CpxI in cell–cell fusion.

As the size of the readily releasable pool (RRP) measured by hypertonic solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rosenmund and Stevens, 1996</xref>) was unchanged, the calculated Pvr was also slightly increased in the rescue with the superclamp CpxI mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C,D</xref>). The facilitatory synaptic short-term plasticity behavior in complexin I-III triple KO neurons, measured through five EPSCs at 50 Hz and also reflected by calculation of the PPR (EPSC2/EPSC1), could be reversed to a more depressing phenotype in CpxI D27L, E34F, R37A expressing KO neurons compared to the rescue with WT CpxI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>).

To verify this conclusion, we generated a chimeric complexin with most of the sequence corresponding to murine CpxI but with the accessory helix of dmCpx (dmAcc-CpxI; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>), and analyzed its influence on neurotransmitter release in complexin triple KO neurons.

These observations and the crystal structure of the CpxI(26-83)/SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) lead naturally to a simple model whereby the complexin accessory helix inhibits release because it is oriented toward the area where the two membranes need to be brought together for fusion and this action is hindered by electrostatic repulsion between the accessory helix and the two membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>To test this model, we made two mutants of mammalian CpxI where we changed the charge of the accessory helix, one where we added five negative charges (CpxI-5E) and another where we replaced three negatively charged with positive charges (CpxI-3R) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Lenti-viral expression of the positively charged CpxI-3R and WT CpxI in complexin I-III triple KO neurons did not reveal significant differences in EPSC amplitudes, but rescue with the negatively charged CpxI-5E mutant yielded slightly reduced EPSC amplitudes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>).

Consistent with the Pvr results, trains of five EPSCs at 50 Hz showed that the facilitatory synaptic short-term plasticity characteristic of the complexin I-III triple KO could be rescued in the CpxI-3R expressing neurons to the same level as the WT CpxI expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>).

In the study presented here, we were unable to detect any interaction between C-terminally-truncated SNARE complexes and the accessory helix of WT CpxI or the CpxI superclamp mutant using highly sensitive biophysical methods in solution. Moreover, we find that the effects of superclamp and poor-clamp CpxI mutations on neurotransmitter release do not correlate with their effects on cell–cell fusion assays, actually pointing in opposite directions. We also show that mutations that increase the negative charge of the accessory helix inhibit neurotransmitter release while mutations that increase its positive charge enhance release. These results strongly argue against the insertion and zigzag models for the inhibitory activity of the complexin accessory helix and suggest a simple, alternative model whereby the negative charges of the accessory helix and perhaps steric hindrance repel both membranes, thus hindering membrane fusion and neurotransmitter release.</p><p>A major question that arises from our study is: Can the insertion and zigzag models be now completely ruled out?

However, the model envisioned that the three charged side chains replaced in the superclamp mutant (D27, E34, and R37) insert into the hydrophobic groove left in the SNARE complex, which is very unlikely from a thermodynamic point of view. Moreover, our data show that the effects of these mutations on cell–cell fusion do not correlate with their effects on neurotransmitter release: the superclamp D27L, E34F, R37A mutation that enhanced inhibition of cell–cell fusion had little effect on release, with a slight tendency to stimulate release, while the K26A mutation that diminishes the inhibitory acitivity of CpxI in cell–cell fusion actually impairs release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p>It has been argued (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>) that the D27L, E34F, R37A superclamp mutation inhibits neurotransmitter release in vivo based on rescue experiments on complexin knockdown neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2010</xref>). However, these rescue experiments revealed no effect of the D27L, E34F, R37A mutation on evoked release, and it was unclear whether a modest inhibitory effect on spontaneous release was significant. Our rescue data with this mutant using complexin I-III triple KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) are consistent with the results of the knockdown rescues considering the small nature of the effects observed, and the experimental differences between the two approaches.

However, the binding mode observed for the mutant accessory helix is highly unlikely thermodynamically for WT CpxI for the above mentioned reason that three mutated side chains are charged and hence are unlikely to insert into a hydrophobic groove. Correspondingly, our extensive NMR analyses did not detect any interaction between the WT CpxI accessory helix and synaptobrevin-truncated SNARE complexes in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2, 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

A plausible explanation for these findings is that the interaction between the superclamp accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex observed in the crystals is very weak in solution, and hence could not be observed in our assays, but is stabilized by crystallization.

We can reproduce these data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) but it is clear that the underlying assumption that 1.5 equivalentes of CpxI(47-134) saturate SCΔ60 is incorrect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>) and that these ITC assays do not detect an interaction of the accessory helix with SCΔ60.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Experiments with a surface force apparatus (SFA) were proposed to support the zigzag model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2011a</xref>). However, the effects caused by WT complexin II in these experiments could be subject to more than one interpretation; for instance, they are compatible with both the zigzag model and the electrostatic hindrance model that we propose here.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The zigzag model was also proposed to be supported by FRET measurements showing that the distances between probes placed on CpxI and SNARE complexes increase on truncation of the synaptobrevin C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Krishnakumar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>), consistent with the fact that the accessory helix remains close to the SNAREs in the CpxI(26-83)-SNARE complex structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) but points away from the SNAREs in the structure of the CpxI superclamp mutant bound to SCΔ60 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We believe that the interpretation of the FRET measurements in terms of static structures constitutes an oversimplification because multiple evidence suggests that there is some flexibility in the accessory helix even in the non-truncated complex, including the poor dispersion of the NH cross-peaks of the accessory helix, their sharper line widths compared to cross-peaks of the central helix, the fact that the NH and Cα chemical shifts of the accessory helix change much less than those of the central helix upon SNARE complex binding and the high B factors observed in the crystal structure of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>). Indeed, such flexibility is also consistent with the distance of 20 Å measured by FRET with probes placed at residue 38 of CpxI and residue 193 of SNAP-25 of the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>), since the probes would be expected to be much closer according to the structure of the complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>) (the closest distance between the side chains of these residues is 10 Å). Moreover, our NMR data indicate that the truncations in the SNARE complex further increase the flexibility of the accessory helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>) and produce flexibility in the N-terminus of the CpxI central helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as well as in the C-terminus of SNAP-25 where the FRET donor probe was placed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The loss in FRET efficiency observed by Kummel et al. upon truncation of the SNARE complex can be readily explained by all these increases in flexibility and the fact that SCΔ60 lacks key residues of synaptobrevin that contact CpxI without the truncation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></list-item><list-item><p><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al. (2011)</xref> concluded that flexibility could not explain the FRET efficiency observed between probes placed at residue 38 of CpxI and residue 193 of SNAP-25 in SCΔ60 because there was no detectable FRET in experiments performed with a CpxI mutant containing a flexible GPGP sequence between the accessory and central helices. However, a small decrease in donor fluorescence was actually observed for this mutant (Figure 4D of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al., 2011</xref>) and, based on other measurements shown in Figure 4C and Supplementary Table 3 in Kummel et al., 2011, such decrease would correspond to a distance of ca. 42 Å, just 8 Å longer than the distance measured without the GPGP insertion. Considering that a flexible sequence of four residues can readily span 8 Å, that the insertion of these residues is expected to push away the fluorescence probes, and that the error in such long distances is expected to be rather large because of the low associated FRET efficiencies, the results obtained with the GPGP mutant are not inconsistent with the conclusion that increased flexbility underlies the decreased FRET caused by the synaptobrevin truncation.</p></list-item></list></p><p>We believe that, although the arguments presented above and the overall available data argue strongly against the validity of the insertion and zigzag models, it might be premature to completely rule out these models given the complexity of this system. Note for instance that our NMR and ITC data were obtained with truncated SNARE complexes in solution and hence do not rule out the possibility that the CpxI accessory helix interacts with trans-SNARE complexes partially assembled between membranes. Moreover, while cell–cell fusion assays do not correlate with our electrophysiological data or with the stimulatory function of complexins in release, these assays were crucial to establish the functional interplay between complexins and synaptotagmin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Giraudo et al., 2006</xref>) and did provide support for the insertion model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Giraudo et al., 2009</xref>). Hence, we believe that it is advisable to keep an open mind about the insertion or zigzag models, but views considering either of these models proven need to be revised, and alternative models need to be considered.</p><p>The model proposed here is attractive because of its simplicity and because it emerges naturally from the realization that the accessory helix of complexins is negatively charged (see Supplementary figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huntwork and Littleton (2007)</xref>), together with examination of the crystal structure of the WT CpxI(26-83)/SNARE complex. Thus, binding of the central helix to the SNARE complex places the accessory helix right between the membranes at the space where they need to be brought together for fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), and such action is very likely to be hindered at least to some extent by steric and electrostatic repulsion between the negatively charged membranes and the accessory helix. Note also that the stronger inhibitory activity of the accessory helix of dmCpx, compared to the mammalian CpxI accessory helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), cannot arise from increased hydrophobicity, but can be explained by our electrostatic hindrance model. The model is also supported by the inhibition of release caused by the 5E mutation, as well as by the increase in release caused by the 3R mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, the impairment in release that we observed for the K26A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; charge change = −1), and the increase in spontaneous release caused in rescue experiments on complexin knockdown neurons by a K26E, L41K, E47K mutation (charge change = +1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al., 2010</xref>) also correlate in general terms with this model. However, these results need to be interpreted with caution, since it is plausible that the 5E and 3R mutations may alter the helical character of the accessary helix, and the considerable magnitude of the effects caused by the K26A and K26E, L41K, E47K mutations suggest that they do not arise only from changes in overall electrostatic potential. Thus, K26 might be involved in some additional, as yet unidentified interaction. Note that K26 does not really form part of the accessory helix in the CpxI(26-83)/SNARE complex and may be involved in releasing the inhibition caused by the accessory helix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>It is also important to note that the accessory helix does not act on its own and its function depends on the neighboring N-terminus. Our previous studies demonstrate an overall facilitatory effect of complexin for evoked and spontaneous release that requires binding of the complexin N-terminus back onto the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). This proposed loop may serve two functions, namely to further stabilize the trans-SNARE complex and to properly position the accessory helix near the putative fusion area to reduce spontaneous release through its electrostatic repulsion effect. Alternatively, it is plausible that the function of the accessory helix may involve interactions with other components of the release machinery. Clearly, more research will be required to further test the validity of our model, ideally using diverse approaches. Such approaches should include challenging biophysical studies involving trans-SNARE complexes formed between two membranes, reconstitution experiments that have already yielded a wealth of information on complexins (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schaub et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yoon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Malsam et al., 2009</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diao et al., 2012</xref>), and correlations with additional studies of neurotransmitter release in neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Recombinant proteins</title><p>Expression vectors and protocols for expression and purification of the following protein fragments in <italic>E. coli</italic> were described previously: rat syntaxin 1A residues 191-253, rat synaptobrevin 2 residues 29-93, human SNAP-25 residues 11-82 and 141-203, full-length rat CpxI and rat CpxI residues 26-83 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pabst et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2002</xref>).

Your article has been generally favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, although there were some concerns.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Axel Brunger (Reviewing editor); William Wickner and Ad Bax (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work questions the interaction between the accessory helix and a truncated ternary SNARE complex. In 2011, multiple experiments by the Rothman, Reinisch, and Tareste groups published: ITC binding experiments, crystal structures with a mutant of complexin in complex with a truncated SNARE complex, solution (bulk) FRET data, and surface force measurements. However, among these four different experiments, the only direct demonstrations of an interaction between the accessory helix of complexin and the SNARE complex were the crystal structures, and the ITC experiment.</p><p>In this work, it is shown that the interpretation of ITC experiment may have suffered from an incorrect assumption of the affinity between the complexin and SNARE fragments used, and that the data can be explained in an alternative fashion that does not involve an interaction between the accessory helix of complexin and the truncated SNARE complex. Rizo, Rosenmund and co-workers then present a large body of solution NMR data that does not show any evidence for an interaction between the accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex, even for the so-called superclamp mutant, suggesting the interaction represents an extremely weak, lowly occupied state. In addition, the authors argue that the bulk FRET data by Kummel et al. can be interpreted in an alternative fashion (but this re-interpretation is questionable, see below).</p><p>These in vitro studies are augmented by experiments with cultured neurons that show that mutation of the accessory helix modulates release based on the charge distribution on the accessory helix. The more negative, the more fusion is inhibited. It is suggested that the inhibitory function of complexin is caused by an interaction between the membrane and the accessory helix. Moreover, they show that 'super'-clamp (D27L,E34F,R37A) and a 'no'-clamp (K26A) mutants of complexin do not have the expected effects when introduced into actual neurons.</p><p>That being said, support for the newly introduced electrostatic repulsion idea is rather thin and is contradicted by other data (see below). It is even is unlikely that the accessory helix would adopt a helical conformation in the presence of the rather severe mutations of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>. Considering the significant impact of the CpxI K26A mutation, it's more likely that the CpxI role is more subtle, along the lines suggested at the end of the Discussion section.</p><p>Regardless if the electrostatic repulsion model is correct (it will certainly require a lot of discussion, or perhaps be removed, in a revised version of this paper), the main point of this paper is that it entirely re-opens the question how complexin really works.</p><p>Issues to address:</p><p>1) Although the overlaid TROSY-HSQC spectra are reasonably compelling for the general argument the authors are trying to make, it would be helpful if more specific interpretation were supported by an SI figure showing the (composite 1H/15N) amide shift changes as a function of residue number for the delta62 and delta68 truncations. Similarly, a correlation graph of CpxI shift changes (vs. full length minus random coil) for the shift changes in the N-terminus of the central helix would provide stronger support for the “increasingly flexible toward the N-terminus” statement. Alternatively, 15N relaxation measurements would make this more quantitative, but not necessary from my perspective if indeed the shift change is in the random coil direction.</p><p>2) The negative charge repulsion model is contradicted by the following experiments: the non-clamping mutants by Kummel et al. (L41E, A44E, A30E, A31E) and (A30E and A31E) are both negatively charged, but yet, they have no effect on spontaneous fusion in their cell-based fusion assay. The poor-clamp mutant (K26E, K41K, E47K, also somewhat negatively charged) by Yang et al. (Neuron, 2010) actually increases spontaneous release in neuronal cultures. These contradictions need to be addressed by additional experiments, or the negative charge model needs to be modified.</p><p>3) As mentioned in the Discussion, point 4, Reinish et al. determined a second crystal form (with an additional mutation in complexin, F34M, in addition to the “superclamp” mutations in the accessory helix) where the accessory helix interacts in two different registers. This indicates promiscuity of the interaction between the accessory helix and the 2nd SNARE complex in the crystal structures. This point needs some clarification in the Discussion: first these two alternative forms only occur upon the additional F34M mutation. Second, it is not necessarily that crystallization has induced this interaction. It is possible that this weak interaction is a lowly state that is too infrequent to be observed by NMR, but has been stabilized in the context of the crystal structure.</p><p>4) The interaction between the accessory helix and a neighboring partially folded full SNARE complex is not ruled out by the presented experiments since they do not involve partially folded full SNARE complex. This should be noted in the paper.</p><p>5) The alternative explanation of the original Kummel et al., ITC data and the additional ITC experiments are convincing. However, these data do not rule out an interaction between the accessory helix and SNARE complex per se, but it may be much weaker than estimated by the original Kummel et al. experiment. It would be prudent to add this caveat to the discussion of the ITC experiments. Did the authors attempt to conduct the competition experiment under actually saturating conditions of CpxI(47-134)?</p><p>6) Kummel et al. used bulk fret and measured the FRET between S25 Cterm (residue 193) and CX Nterm (residue 38). They showed that the more VAMP is truncated at the C-terminus, truncation of VAMP up to residue 60, the weaker the FRET efficiency. In this work, the NMR results and the weaker affinity observed by ITC suggests that the VAMP truncations make SNAP-25 and also syntaxin more flexible and unstructured, thus destabilizing the interaction with complexin as well, resulting in lower FRET. Thus, an interpretation of the NMR result is that the lower FRET efficiency is a result of motional averaging of multiple conformations that produces the appearance of a lower FRET “state”. However, Kummel et al. did an experiment to rule out this possibility: They used a 'flexible' CPX construct (CPX-GPGP), in which a helix-breaking GPGP linker was inserted between the central and accessory helices of CPX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c,d</xref>, Supplemental Table 3 in Kummel et al.). To quote Kummel et al. “these experiments indicate that when CPX is bound to a half-zippered form of the SNARE complex, CPXacc has the intrinsic property of extending away from the complex. Because this conformation is maintained in solution, it determines how the complex crystallizes and not vice versa.”</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “An Electrostatic-Steric Hindrance Model for Accessory Helix Mediated Inhibition of Neurotransmitter Release by Complexin” for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is certainly possible that this happens, but the data presented here do not provide direct (e.g., NMR) evidence for this notion. Moreover, the proposed model of electrostatic-steric hindrance by the accessory helix remains speculative. It is of course fine to provide such a speculative model in the Discussion section of the paper. However, the title is misleading since it suggests that the model has been definitely proven in this work. Rather, the main focus of this paper is a re-examination of the interaction between the accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex that was previously studied by Kummel et al. Thus, we request a change of title to properly reflect the main focus of this work.</p><p>2) The statement in the Results section: “these cross-peaks actually increased in the spectrum of Cpx(26-83) bound to SCdelta68 with respect to the SC-bound state, and increased somewhat more in the SCdelta62-bound spectrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplements 1C,D</xref>) These data show that the synaptobrevin C-terminal truncations increase the flexibility of the accessory helix, in correlation with the destabilization of N terminal part of the central helix,”. The best resolved accessory helix resonances (A30 and Q38) actually do not seem to increase from SCdelta68 to SCdelta62. Thus, the statements about the increase in flexibility of the accessory helix need to be qualified.</p><p>3) The discussion of the Kummel at al. crystal structure (point 4 in the Discussion) remains a concern. Firstly, the area of the interface between the accessory helix and the truncated SNARE complex is actually quite reasonable (715 A^2) and this in itself does not suggest that this contact is induced by “crystal packing”. Secondly, the last statement “that the interactions leading to the zigzag array are not specific and are induced by crystallization” implies that crystal packing may induce non-specific interactions. To the contrary, the observation of such an interaction in different crystal forms and for different mutations of residue 34 (albeit with a register shift observed in the second crystal form for some of the non-crystallographic related molecules) actually speaks against an entirely non-specific interaction. Moreover, the crystallization conditions seem not unusual, and the pH is comparable for the crystallization and NMR experiments. There is one clear difference: in the crystal structure, two complexin molecules are interacting with the truncated SNARE complex. It is theoretically possible that binding of the central complexin helix to the SNARE complex is required in order to enable binding of the accessory helix of the second complexin molecule. Thus, we remain concerned about this difference between the crystal structures and the solution NMR studies on the same system, and the discussion must be modified to properly describe this discrepancy, and provide possible alternative explanations.</p><p>4) The authors may wish to explicitly leave wiggle room for future discovery of some such an interaction, e.g., with a sub-complex of SNAREs. For example, one could write “While current data do not support the proposed zigzag SNARE:complexin interaction, it remains possible that such an interaction might occur under some biological condition, or with some sub-complex of SNAREs.”</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02391.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Thank you for the nice summary of our work and its significance. We agree that the main point of the paper is that it entirely opens the question of how complexin inhibits release, and that the new model we propose is speculative. However, we still would like to propose the model because it provides a testable hypothesis, because it led to the design of the experiments with the 5E and 3R mutants (otherwise we have no rationale for this design), and because it is supported by the electrophysiological data obtained with these mutants (see also response to point 2). Nevertheless, we present the model as a suggestion and make it clear in the discussion that the model will need to be tested with further research. Moreover, we included the term ‘steric’ in the model (in the title, abstract, etc.) because the hindrance caused by the accessory helix could arise from both electrostatic and steric effects, and because this gives further flexibility to the model for testing in the future.</p><p>With respect to the comment ‘<italic>It is even is unlikely that the accessory helix would adopt a helical conformation in the presence of the rather severe mutations of</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref>’, glutamate and arginine are generally compatible with helical conformation, and secondary structure predictions with Jpred still predict helical conformation for the accessory helix of the 3R and 5E mutants (see below). In addition, consecutive residues with the same charge occur to some extent in the native accessory helices of mammalian and dm CpxI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Importantly, the 3R and 5E mutants are largely rescuing the phenotype of the complexin I-III triple KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, although it is plausible that the large number of consecutive positive or negative charges in the mutants might destabilize the helix, the mutations do not cause a major impairment of the overall function of complexins.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02391-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p><italic>Issues to</italic> <italic>address:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Although the overlaid TROSY-HSQC spectra are reasonably compelling for the general argument the authors are trying to make, it would be helpful if more specific interpretation were supported by an SI figure showing the (composite 1H/15N) amide shift changes as a function of residue number for the delta62 and delta68 truncations. Similarly, a correlation graph of CpxI shift changes (vs. full length minus random coil) for the shift changes in the N-terminus of the central helix would provide stronger support for the “increasingly flexible toward the N-terminus” statement. Alternatively, 15N relaxation measurements would make this more quantitative, but not necessary from my perspective if indeed the shift change is in the random coil direction</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that it is desirable to provide a more detailed analysis of these data, with some quantification that supports our conclusions. Such detailed analysis is hindered by the fact that multiple cross-peaks of the Cpx(26-83) central helix cannot be unambiguously identified upon truncation of the SNARE complex, but the data for the cross-peaks that can be identified are still informative. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, we now present plots of chemical shift changes caused by truncation of synaptobrevin to residue 68 compared to the changes observed when comparing free and SNARE complex-bound Cpx(26-83).</p><p>In one plot we use the latter changes for normalization to provide a measure of how much the central helix is destabilized, while in the second plot we correlate the first changes with the latter. Based on these plots, we have changed slightly the interpretation, suggesting that ‘the N-terminal half of the accessory helix becomes flexible’ rather than ‘becomes increasingly flexible toward the N-terminus’ Note that we prefer to use the chemical shifts of free Cpx(26-83) rather than random coil chemical shifts because we believe that they provide a better measure of the shifts expected when the central helix is detached from the SNARE complex. Using random coil chemical shifts for the plot presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1B</xref>, would yield the plot shown below and lead to analogous conclusions. We would be glad to use this plot instead if the reviewer believes that this is a better choice.<fig id="fig12" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-02391-resp-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>We have not performed relaxation experiments, but the cross-peak intensities do provide some information on relaxation properties and we now show plots of cross-peak intensities for Cpx(26-83) bound to SC 68 and SC 62, normalized with those of Cpx(26-83) bound to the SNARE complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). These plots show that the intensities of the cross-peaks that can be identified from the accessory helix become stronger upon truncation of the synaptobrevin C- terminus, which provides very strong evidence against insertion of the accessory helix into the truncated complex.</p><p><italic>2) The negative charge repulsion model is contradicted by the following experiments: the non-clamping mutants by Kummel et al. (L41E, A44E, A30E, A31E) and (A30E and A31E) are both negatively charged, but yet, they have no effect on spontaneous fusion in their cell-based fusion assay. The poor-clamp mutant (K26E, K41K, E47K, also somewhat negatively charged) by Yang et al. (Neuron, 2010) actually increases spontaneous release in neuronal cultures. These contradictions need to be addressed by additional experiments, or the negative charge model needs to be modified</italic>.</p><p>At present, there is no clear correlation between the effects of mutations in the cell-cell fusion assay and any physiological data. On the contrary, our electrophysiological data with the superclamp and K26A mutants go in opposite directions from those observed in cell-cell fusion assays. We do not think that this lack of correlation completely rules out the significance of the results obtained with these assays, since at the moment we do not understand the source for the lack of correlation. At the same time, we do not believe that the model emerging from our electrophysiological data and reasonable structural-biophysical arguments should be discarded because of the results obtained with the non-clamping mutants in the cell -cell fusion assays of Kummel et al.</p><p>With regard to the K26E, L41K, E47K studied in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al. 2010</xref> (please note that residue 41 of WT CpxI is L), the mutation increases the positive charge by 1 unit and increases spontaneous release. This result in principle correlates with our model, although the increase in spontaneous release is rather large. Overall, we feel that the available electrophysiological data with this mutant described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yang et al. 2010</xref>, our 3R and 5E mutants, and our mutant containing the dmCpxI accessory helix provide support for the electrostatic model, even though we agree that the model is not proven (and this is how we present it in the paper).</p><p><italic>3) As mentioned in the Discussion, point 4, Reinish et al. determined a second crystal form (with an additional mutation in complexin, F34M, in addition to the “superclamp” mutations in the accessory helix) where the accessory helix interacts in two different registers.

In the discussion we have tried to explain better what is observed in the crystals of the D27L,E34M,R37A mutant, i.e. two types of interactions in crystallographically distinct complexes, one that is analogous to that observed for the D27L,E34F,R37A mutant and another that has a shift of two helical turns between the accessory helix and the groove of SC 60. We also point out in several parts of the manuscript that the interaction is not observed by NMR but could exist and is not detected because it is very weak.</p><p><italic>4) The interaction between the accessory helix and a neighboring partially folded full SNARE complex is not ruled out by the presented experiments since they do not involve partially folded full SNARE complex.

As expected, only a very small amount of heat was observed in these titrations and this heat corresponds to a natural extension of a direct titration that had reached a molar ratio of 3.0 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). Note that, given the sensitivity that we observe in these experiments, more full saturation that would completely eliminate any detectable heat would require a large excess of Cpx(47-134) that could promote aggregation. We believe that the overall data clearly show that no interaction of the Cpx(26-83) accessory helix with SC 60 can be detected in these ITC experiments, and this is how we now present our Conclusion.</p><p><italic>6) Kummel et al. used bulk fret and measured the FRET between S25 Cterm (residue 193) and CX Nterm (residue 38). They showed that the more VAMP is truncated at the C-terminus, truncation of VAMP up to residue 60, the weaker the FRET efficiency. In this work, the NMR results and the weaker affinity observed by ITC suggests that the VAMP truncations make SNAP-25 and also syntaxin more flexible and unstructured, thus destabilizing the interaction with complexin as well, resulting in lower FRET. Thus, an interpretation of the NMR result is that the lower FRET efficiency is a result of motional averaging of multiple conformations that produces the appearance of a lower FRET “state”. However, Kummel et al. did an experiment to rule out this possibility: They used a 'flexible' CPX construct (CPX-GPGP), in which a helix-breaking GPGP linker was inserted between the central and accessory helices of CPX (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4b,c,d</italic></xref><italic>, Supplemental Table 3 in Kummel et al.).

Because this conformation is maintained in solution, it determines how the complex crystallizes</italic> <italic>and not vice versa.”</italic></p><p>We believe that the FRET data of Kummel et al. need to be reinterpreted for the following reasons:</p><p>A. As we explain in points 7 and 8 of the discussion, our NMR data indicate that the synaptobrevin truncation causes increased flexibility in the CpxI accessory helix and also induces flexibility in the CpxI central helix and SNAP-25 C-terminus, which are well structured without the truncation. Such increases in flexibility can indeed explain the decreased FRET observed upon synaptobrevin truncation in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kummel et al. 2011</xref>.</p><p>B. The R0 for the FRET pair used in Kummel et al. was calculated to be 27.5 Å. Hence, they observed good FRET efficiency for distances measured between CpxI and the non-truncated SNARE complex, which were on the order of 20-27 Å. However, the FRET efficiency decreases considerably for the longer distances measured using the truncated SNARE complex (34-42 Å) (values taken from Supplementary Table 3 of Kummel et al.). Hence, it is much more difficult to obtain reliable distances and strong conclusions for these data.</p><p>C. Regardless of the issues mentioned in points A and B, the most important point arises from the interpretation of the data obtained with the flexible CPX-GPGP construct mentioned by the reviewer. Kummel et al. concluded that there was no detectable FRET signal for CPX-GPGP (labeled at residue 38) bound to either the truncated or non-truncated SNARE complex, referring to the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>. However, inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref> shows that there was actually a small decrease in the donor fluorescence in the experiments performed with CPX-GPGP, compared to the donor only control. While this decrease is small, it is comparable to that observed for CPX with the acceptor on residue 31 bound to the truncated SNARE complex (cyan curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), which was used in Supplementary Table 3 to calculate a distance of 42 Å. Note also that the FRET efficiency observed for Cpx labeled at residue 38 (without the flexible GPGP insertion) and bound to the truncated SNARE complex was rather low and yielded a distance of 34 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4b,c</xref> and Supplementary Table 3 of Kummel et al.). Hence, the difference in the distances that can be calculated from the FRET data presented for CPX and CPX-GPGP bound to the truncated SNARE complex is just 8 Å, a rather short distance considering the large errors expected for such low FRET efficiencies. Moreover, the insertion of the GPGP sequence between the central and accessory helices is expected to push the fluorescence probe placed in the Cpx accessory helix away from the probe on the truncated SNARE complex, and it is reasonable for a flexible sequence of four residues such as GPGP to span a distance of approximately 8 Å. Hence, the experiments performed with GPGP do not really rule out the flexibility argument.</p><p>In the revised paper we have expanded the discussion of the FRET data to explain these points, while trying to shorten the text in other parts to limit the length of the already long discussion.</p><p>[Editors' note: further clarifications were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>1) We are disappointed that the authors did not address the question if the charge-altering mutations of the accessory helix retain the helical character of the accessory helix (suggested by the strong alpha-helical chemical shifts of the accessory helix by</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38"><italic>Pabst et al., 2000</italic></xref> <italic>J.Biol.Chem).

To avoid this confusion in the new revised manuscript and still enable the reader to see the progressive shifts of cross - peaks in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref>, without overcrowding the center of the spectra, we have left the same contour levels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B, C</xref>, but we have adjusted the levels of the expansions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D,E</xref> to allow direct comparison of cross-peak intensities.

The expansions of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D, E</xref> now show that the cross-peaks of A30 and Q38 are considerably stronger for CpxI(26- 83) bound to SC 62 and SC 68 than for CpxI(26-83) bound to SC, as shown quantitatively in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–Figure supplements 1C,D</xref>.</p><p><italic>3) The discussion of the Kummel at al. crystal structure (point 4 in the Discussion) remains a concern.

To the contrary, the observation of such an interaction in different crystal forms and for different mutations of residue 34 (albeit with a register shift observed in the second crystal form for some of the non-crystallographic related molecules) actually speaks against an entirely non-specific interaction. Moreover, the crystallization conditions seem not unusual, and the pH is comparable for the crystallization and NMR experiments. There is one clear difference: in the crystal structure, two complexin molecules are interacting with the truncated SNARE complex. It is theoretically possible that binding of the central complexin helix to the SNARE complex is required in order to enable binding of the accessory helix of the second complexin molecule. Thus, we remain concerned about this difference between the crystal structures and the solution NMR studies on the same system, and the discussion must be modified to properly describe this discrepancy, and provide possible alternative explanations</italic>.</p><p>We agree that some of the arguments we used to suggest that the interaction mode observed in the crystals arises from non-specific interactions are not very compelling. Furthermore, it is unclear what can be considered a specific or non-specific interaction in the context of this discussion. Hence, we have removed any mention of non-specific interactions and have discussed the available experimental data on this issue trying to keep an objective perspective.</p><p>Among other issues, we now mention that ‘…although the interface area with the SNAREs is larger for the accessory helix (ca. 900 Ă<sup>2</sup> calculated with PISA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Krissinel and Henrick, 2007</xref>) than for the central helix (ca. 540 Ă<sup>2</sup> ), the atomic B-factors of the residues of the accessory helix in the interface with the SNAREs are much larger than those in the central helix interface, with little electronic density for the side chains of the accessory helix interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1–figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, it has been suggested that motion at a crystal packing interface is intermediate between that of a solvent accessible surface and that of a protein core, even for large interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carugo and Argos, 1997</xref>).’</p><p>Since our NMR analyses had focused much more on WT CpxI, but the crystal structure of Kummel et al. was obtained with the superclamp mutant, we have performed additional NMR experiments using the superclamp mutant (supcl). In particular, we have acquired <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N TROSY-HSQC spectra of <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-CpxI(26-83)supcl in the absence and presence of SC 60 (presented in the new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) . For comparison, we have also acquired parallel spectra with WT <sup>2</sup>H,<sup>15</sup> N-CpxI(26-83) (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). As we describe in the manuscript, we obtained very similar results for the WT and supcl proteins, and we were unable to detect an interaction of the accessory helix with SC 60. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that there is a weak interaction in solution that becomes stabilized by crystallization.</p><p><italic>4) The authors may wish to explicitly leave wiggle room for future discovery of some such an interaction, e.g., with a sub-complex of SNAREs.

We believe that such wiggle room is left in the following sentences included in the Discussion; it might be premature to completely rule out these models given the complexity of this system. Note for instance that our NMR and ITC data were obtained with truncated SNARE complexes in solution and hence do not rule out the possibility that the CpxI accessory helix interacts with trans-SNARE complexes partially assembled between membranes. We feel that adding the suggested sentence would be redundant, but would be glad to add it if this required for acceptance of the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
