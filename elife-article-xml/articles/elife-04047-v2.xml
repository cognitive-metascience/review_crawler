projections. How thalamocortical synapses are formed and maintained in this competitive environment is unknown. Here, we show that astrocyte-secreted protein hevin is required for normal thalamocortical synaptic connectivity in the mouse cortex. Absence of hevin results in a profound, long-lasting reduction in thalamocortical synapses accompanied by a transient increase in intracortical excitatory connections. Three-dimensional reconstructions of cortical neurons from serial section electron microscopy (ssEM) revealed that, during early postnatal development, dendritic spines often receive multiple excitatory inputs. Immuno-EM and confocal analyses revealed that majority of the spines with multiple excitatory contacts (SMECs) receive simultaneous thalamic and cortical inputs. Proportion of SMECs diminishes as the brain develops, but SMECs remain abundant in Hevin-null mice. These findings reveal that, through secretion of hevin, astrocytes control an important developmental synaptic refinement process at dendritic spines.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04047.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04047.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04047.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The central nervous systemâwhich is made up of the brain and spinal cordâprocesses information from all over the body. The information travels through cells called neurons, which connect to each other at junctions called synapses. A single neuron can receive information from many different places because it is covered with protrusions known as dendritic spines that enable it to form synapses with a variety of other neurons.</p><p>In recent years, it has become apparent that brain cells other than neurons can influence synapse formation. The most abundant cells in the central nervous system are star-shaped cells known as astrocytes, which secrete molecules that control the timing and extent of synapse formation. Many previous studies on synapses have used a type of neuron found in the eyeâcalled retinal ganglion cellsâbecause these cells can be purified and grown in the laboratory in the absence of astrocytes. Under these conditions, they form very few synapses. However, in the presence of astrocytes the retinal ganglion cells form many more synapses, which is thought to be due to a protein called hevin and several other proteins that are secreted by the astrocytes.</p><p>Risher et al. studied a region of the brain called the cerebral cortex in mice that were missing hevin. In the cortex of normal mice, the neurons generally form synapses with other neurons within the cortex, or with neurons from other parts of the brain that send long-distance projections into the cortex. The experiments revealed that fewer of these long-distance synapses formed in the cortex of the mice missing hevin compared to normal mice. When hevin was injected directly into the brains of the mice, more long-distance synapses were formed.</p><p>Using a technique called three-dimensional electron microscopy, Risher et al. examined the structure of the synapses. In mice missing hevin, the synapses were much smaller and the dendritic spines were thin and long, indicating that they were not fully grown. The images also show that in normal mice, the dendritic spines often have multiple synapses when the animal is young, but many are lost as the brain matures so that only a single synapse remains in each dendritic spine. However, multiple synapses persist in the dendritic spines of mice lacking hevin, which could lead to competition between short and long distance synapses and may contribute to neurological diseases.</p><p>These results indicate that astrocytes are crucial for controlling the formation of synapses in dendritic spines. In humans, defects in hevin have been implicated in autism, schizophrenia and other neurological conditions. Future studies will seek to determine the precise role of astrocytes in these conditions, which may help us to develop new therapies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04047.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04047.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>synaptogenesi</kwd><kwd>thalamocortical</kwd><kwd>dendritic spine</kwd><kwd>astrocyte</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000026</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Drug Abuse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DA031833</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eroglu</surname><given-names>Cagla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eroglu</surname><given-names>Cagla</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000879</institution-id><institution>Alfred P.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cerebral cortex receives synaptic inputs from various cortical and subcortical areas including the thalamus. In the mouse brain, innervation of the cortex by projecting neurites called axons begins during embryonic development and continues for the first several postnatal days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garel and Lopez-Bendito, 2014</xref>). Only after the axons project to their approximate target areas, hosting their suitable postsynaptic partners, does an intense period of synapse formation occur, corresponding roughly to the second and third postnatal weeks in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2010</xref>). Cortical excitatory synapses, which primarily use the neurotransmitter glutamate, are formed between dendritic protrusions called spines and axonal projections coming from two predominant inputs: intracortical and thalamic. Though the bulk of the cortical synapses from both of these inputs are made during the same early postnatal synaptogenic period (P5âP21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>), whether they form through similar or differential mechanisms is unclear.</p><p>Intracortical and thalamocortical connections can be distinguished as they primarily contain either vesicular glutamate transporter-1 (VGlut1) or VGlut2 in their presynaptic terminals, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko and Fujiyama, 2002</xref>). In most cortical areas, VGlut1-positive (VGlut1+) intracortical projections greatly outnumber the VGlut2+ thalamic projections. The cellular and molecular mechanisms through which thalamocortical connections are established and maintained, despite steep competition from the vastly more abundant intracortical axons, have yet to be elucidated.</p><p>Concurrently with the synaptogenic period, non-neuronal cells called astrocytes begin to populate the cortex, producing and secreting factors that promote synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eroglu and Barres, 2010</xref>). For example, hevin (a.k.a. synaptic cleft-1 or SPARC-like 1) is an astrocyte-secreted extracellular matrix protein that localizes to the clefts of excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Johnston et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lively et al., 2007</xref>) and promotes excitatory synaptogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>). Using a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches, here we show that in the cortex, hevin is specifically required for the formation of thalamocortical synapses. Moreover, using three-dimensional reconstructions of serial-section electron microscopy (ssEM)-imaged dendrites and axons, we show that P25 hevin KO dendritic spines often make multiple excitatory contacts with different axons.</p><p>Multiply-innervated spines were identified nearly a half-century ago by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Powell (1969)</xref>. The majority of these spines make two distinct types of synapses: one excitatory with an asymmetric postsynaptic density (PSD) opposed to an axon with round presynaptic vesicles, and one inhibitory synapse with a symmetrical PSD and flattened vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Powell, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Knott et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). A small percentage, however, make multiple excitatory contacts (termed SMECs, i.e., <underline>s</underline>pines with <underline>m</underline>ultiple <underline>e</underline>xcitatory <underline>c</underline>ontacts). We found that SMEC structures are frequent earlier in development at P14 in WT but essentially disappear by P25, indicating that they represent a transient stage in synaptic spine maturation. This developmental refinement is impaired in hevin KO mice. Moreover, using both confocal imaging as well as immunolabeling of electron micrographs with antibodies specific to VGlut1 and VGlut2, we found that these SMECs often contact thalamic and cortical axons simultaneously. These results suggest that, during cortical synaptic development, dendritic spines serve as sites of competition between thalamic and cortical axons. Through secretion of hevin, astrocytes help maintain thalamic inputs onto cortical neurons and facilitate resolution of SMECs into singly-innervated spines.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Loss of hevin results in deficient thalamocortical synaptic connectivity</title><p>The astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic protein hevin (a.k.a. SPARC-like 1/SPARCL-1 or Synaptic Cleft-1/SC1) increases the number of synapses made between retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) in vitro and is required for the correct formation and maturation of RGC synapses onto their postsynaptic target, the superior colliculus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>). Hevin expression is not restricted to the retinocollicular system. Hevin is expressed throughout the cortex in a developmentally regulated manner, peaking during P15âP25, a time period that coincides with intense synapse formation, maturation and elimination events in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>).

Layer I) of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1 region) in littermate age-matched hevin KO and wild-type (WT) mice using immunohistochemistry (IHC). Excitatory pyramidal neurons from upper cortical layers project extensive dendritic trees to this region and form a large number of the cortical synaptic connections. Cortical neurons receive two main classes of excitatory inputs: (1) the intracortical connections that are VGlut1 positive (VGlut1+), and (2) the sensory pathway inputs from the thalamus that are VGlut2+. The majority of the excitatory connections within the S/Z are of intracortical origin. On the other hand, the bulk of thalamocortical connections are made onto layer IV with a subset projecting to other layers including S/Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaneko and Fujiyama, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Khan et al., 2011</xref>). To determine the role of hevin in the formation of these different classes of cortical synapses, we quantified the number of synaptic puncta as the co-localization of the presynaptic VGlut1 or VGlut2 with postsynaptic PSD95 at P25 in littermate hevin-KO and WT mice. This synapse quantification assay takes advantage of the fact that pre- and post-synaptic markers are within separate compartments (axons and dendrites, respectively), but they appear to co-localize at synapses due to their close proximity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ippolito and Eroglu, 2010</xref>). Surprisingly, we found that the number of VGlut1+ intracortical synapses in the S/Z of hevin KOs were significantly higher when compared to littermate WTs at P25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, thalamocortical VGlut2+ synapses were profoundly reduced in hevin KOs compared to WTs at P25 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). It is important to note that the appearance of co-localized VGlut/PSD95 puncta is not merely due to chance, since the randomization of puncta by rotating the channels out of alignment by 90Â° nearly abolished occurrence of co-localized puncta in both the WT and KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04047.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Hevin is required for proper thalamocortical innervation of V1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of synaptic input to area V1.

To address this question we first utilized in vitro assays with purified cortical and thalamic neurons.

Cortical dendritic spines, including those in V1, follow a stereotypic maturation timeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Irwin et al., 2001</xref>). Long, highly motile filopodia-type protrusions abundant in early development give way to short, stable, wide-headed mushroom spines in the mature brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kaneko et al., 2012</xref>).

This observation prompted the following question: Does the deficient thalamocortical connectivity in hevin KO coincide with aberrant synaptic morphology? In order to address this question, we investigated whether hevin is involved in the structural development of spine synapses. To do so, we analyzed dendritic morphology in the secondary and tertiary dendrites of layer II/III pyramidal neurons, which receive the majority of the excitatory connections within the S/Z. Analyses of spines in V1 of littermate hevin KO and WT mice at P25 by Golgi-Cox staining showed a significant increase in immature filopodia-like protrusions in P25 hevin KOs concomitant with a decrease in mature mushroom spines compared to littermate WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).

These results indicated that the astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic protein hevin is important for spine maturation in the cortex.</p><p>To understand the role of hevin in dendritic spine maturation at ultra-high resolution, we next employed ssEM in littermate P25 WT and hevin KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuwajima et al., 2013</xref>). Three-dimensional (3D)-EM reconstructions, visualizing dendrites, spines and synapses, confirmed the structural immaturity of hevin KO dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Analysis of postsynaptic density (PSD) area revealed smaller, asymmetric (i.e., excitatory) synapse area in hevin KO V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>), indicative of synaptic immaturity. Despite the deficits in synapse morphology, overall asymmetric synapse density was not significantly affected in hevin KO V1 (WT, 2.16 Â± 0.16 synapses/Âµm; KO, 2.63 Â± 0.27 synapses/Âµm; <italic>n</italic> = 12 dendrites per condition; p = 0.15, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). Since hevin is primarily expressed and secreted by astrocytes, we postulated that hevin KOs may have altered astroglial contact at synapses, but no difference in astrocyte contact was found between WT and hevin KO synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, a fraction of excitatory synapses in the hevin KOs was made directly onto the dendritic shafts rather than on spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), a configuration that was rare in the WTs at P25. This observation reveals that hevin is required for the proper compartmentalization of excitatory synapses onto spines.

To investigate if SMECs occur in the context of normal synaptic development, we created ssEM-derived 3D reconstructions of dendrites in the synaptic zone of WT V1 at P14, an age when dendritic spine structures are not yet fully mature. Electron micrographs revealed the existence of SMECs in P14 V1 in which a single postsynaptic spine contained more than one asymmetric PSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). 3D reconstructions from ssEM confirmed that each PSD on a SMEC was contacted by a different presynaptic axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This ruled out SMECs as having either a single perforated PSD or multiple PSDs opposed to the same axon. Several configurations of SMECs were detected; some in which two axons synapsed on opposite sides of the same spine head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left), and others with one PSD on the head and a second PSD on either the neck or base of the spine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, right). SMECs were primarily of the thin spine type, though we also found numerous examples of filopodia and mushroom SMECs. Remarkably, 25% of all excitatory connections are formed onto SMECs at P14, a finding that may have gone unnoticed if not for the spatial resolution offered by 3D ssEM.

When multiple axons are contacting a single spine, they will have to share the postsynaptic machinery available within that spine. Such a configuration would potentially provide means to drive competition between neighboring inputs for postsynaptic resources, and the activity levels of the presynaptic axons contacting that spine could directly influence this competition. To determine whether specific axonal populations were contacting SMECs, we completed full 3D reconstructions of axons contacting SMECs in P25 hevin KOs and P14 and P25 WTs. We found that if an axon made a connection with a SMEC, it had nearly a 50% chance of contacting another SMEC nearby (42.5% in P14 WT, 45.4% in P25 WT, 41.6% in P25 hevin KO; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>), which is vastly higher than what would be expected by chance (6.4% in P14 WT, 0.5% in P25 WT, 3.1% in P25 hevin KO).

Therefore, we postulated that SMECs may be sites for simultaneous innervation by VGlut1+ cortical axons and the VGlut2+ thalamic projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To provide evidence for this possibility, we next performed immuno-EM analysis using VGlut1 and VGlut2-specific antibodies on conventional 2D-EM sections from P14 WT mice and observed that a SMEC can indeed receive simultaneous cortical (VGlut1+) and thalamic (VGlut2+) inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p>It was previously shown that, during early cortical development, VGlut2+ thalamic inputs establish numerous contacts within the S/Z; however, as the cortex develops, the majority of these connections are pruned and VGlut1+ inputs dominate this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miyazaki et al., 2003</xref>). During this period, confocal microscopy images of VGlut1+ and VGlut2+ terminals first appear to frequently overlap, but this overlap resolves over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). Based on our findings, we postulated that the close positioning of VGlut1+ and VGlut2+ terminals at the same SMEC might yield an apparent co-localization between these two presynaptic markers in conventional light microscopy. If that is the case we expected hevin to affect the segregation of VGlut1 and VGlut2 terminals during cortical development. To test this possibility, we used IHC to compare the apparent co-localization of the two VGluts in the S/Z of V1 in WTs and hevin KOs at P15 and P25. We found that, in agreement with earlier findings from other brain regions and layers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Herzog et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>), 10.97% of VGlut terminals appeared to co-localize in P15 WT, which was significantly reduced in P25 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). In hevin KOs, co-localization of VGlut1/VGlut2 was originally lower than WT at P15, perhaps due to the overall loss of VGlut2+ synapses. Interestingly, the frequency of overlap in the P25 hevin KO was essentially unchanged compared to P15 and was significantly higher than the P25 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). These results suggest that hevin is important for the resolution of the VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap (and, potentially, SMECs). Analysis of rotated images confirmed that the observed VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap by confocal microscopy is not due to random chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap has previously been attributed to temporary co-expression of these proteins in the same synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nakamura et al., 2007</xref>). To test if this co-localization is mainly due to the resolution limit of light microscopy rather than the expression of these two VGluts at the same terminal, we used high-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM) imaging of presynaptic puncta in the synaptic zones of P15 WT mice (since the VGlut1/2 overlap is highest at this age). SIM uses constructive and deconstructive interference of excitation light at the focal plane of the objective to illuminate a sample with a series of sinusoidal stripes; from the resulting moirÃ© fringes it is possible to generate super-resolution data and produce a minimum two-fold improvement in resolution over confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Schermelleh et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, SIM imaging of VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta in P15 WT showed virtually no co-localized presynaptic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). By increasing the maximum distance with which to detect co-localized puncta, SIM analysis eventually reached a point at which VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap approached the level observed in P15 WT by confocal imaging; this occurred near the practical resolution of confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1E</xref>). This provided strong evidence that the overlap of VGlut1/VGlut2 puncta we observed with confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>) was due to adjacent presynaptic puncta rather than co-expression in the same terminal.</p><p>Despite the knowledge that SMECs are increased in the hevin KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>) and can receive simultaneous VGlut1/VGlut2 synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), the vast majority of inputs to hevin KO cortex remain VGlut1-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, the possibility arises that most SMECs actually receive inputs from multiple intracortical axons, rather than existing as sites for simultaneous thalamic and cortical innervation. Taking advantage of the finding that co-localized VGlut1/VGlut2 puncta in light microscopy is predominantly due to close expression by different presynaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>), we next imaged presynaptic puncta in close proximity to dendritic spines with confocal microscopy in order to quantify the types of inputs made onto SMECs. Using an in utero electroporation (IUE) approach at embryonic day 15.5 (E15.5) we specifically labeled cortical layer II/III neurons with green fluorescent protein (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2A,B</xref>). We then harvested brains at specific developmental ages and co-stained for VGlut1 and VGlut2. S/Z dendrites and presynaptic puncta were imaged via confocal Z-stacks and reconstructed in 3D with the Imaris processing package (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Presynaptic puncta in close proximity to the dendrite were identified using a Matlab algorithm embedded in Imaris (see âMaterials and methodsâ). This analysis method was first confirmed in P15 WT, an age when SMECs are still prevalent. Unisynaptic spines (i.e., spines contacting only one presynaptic puncta; either VGlut1 or VGlut2) and SMECs in various configurations were successfully detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2D,E</xref>). In accordance with a role for SMECs in synaptic competition during development, the majority of SMECs were innervated by both VGlut1 and VGlut2 inputs at this age, with fewer examples of VGlut1/VGlut1 and VGlut2/VGlut2 SMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>Using the same parameters, we then quantified the difference in presynaptic innervation of SMECs between WT and hevin KO V1 at P21. In addition to confirming the overall increase in SMECs in the hevin KO, the 3D reconstructions revealed that the majority of these SMECs indeed received mixed VGlut1/VGlut2 inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A,B</xref>), rather than having multiple VGlut1 inputs as the overall presynaptic puncta density would suggest. Taken together, these findings reveal that SMECs are typically sites of contact by cortical and thalamic axons, potentially representing a novel paradigm for synaptic competition between these two main sources of presynaptic input onto cortical spines. Our results indicate that resolution of SMECs into single synapse spines is a developmental process that is regulated by astrocytes through secretion of hevin.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04047.017</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Hevin is critical for the resolution of VGlut1/VGlut2-innervated SMECs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative Imaris 3D reconstructions of GFP-labeled dendrites (blue) in the S/Z of P21 WT and hevin KO V1.

In the developing cortex, the process of refinement includes the resolution of synaptic competition between incoming thalamic projections and the resident intracortical axons. In the present study, we show that an astrocyte-secreted synaptogenic protein, hevin, is required for the connectivity of thalamocortical synapses. Furthermore, we found that thalamic and cortical axons simultaneously innervate dendritic spines, uncovering a potential role for spines as sites of synaptic competition. Based on our findings, we propose that, in the developing visual cortex, SMECs serve as sites at which cortical and thalamic inputs compete (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). This competition is normally resolved by P25 with the establishment of single synapse spines contacting either VGlut1+ or VGlut2+ terminals. This resolution is dependent on astrocyte-secreted hevin to stabilize VGlut2+ synapses. In the absence of hevin, the VGlut2+ connections cannot be stabilized thus cannot effectively compete with VGlut1+ terminals for postsynaptic spines, resulting in increased VGlut1+ synapses and the persistence of SMECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>Since hevin is a synaptogenic protein, our initial findings showing no overall reduction in excitatory synaptic density in area V1 of hevin KO mice were surprising. However, this observation was explained by a severe and specific reduction of in the number of thalamocortical connections in hevin KOs, whereas the abundance of intracortical synapses was increased. These results reveal that during development the formation and stabilization of VGlut1+ intracortical and VGlut2+ thalamocortical synapses are differentially regulated. Our findings also suggest that the reduction in VGlut2+ synapses in hevin KO V1 enable synaptic takeover by the more abundant VGlut1+ projections. In agreement with this possibility, previous observations of synaptic competition have shown that retraction of one axon is often succeeded by the expansion of another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Walsh and Lichtman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The specificity of hevin for VGlut2+ synaptic stabilization raises the question of why we observed global structural immaturity of dendrites in hevin KO V1. During development, spontaneous retinal activity relayed by thalamus facilitates proper patterning and connectivity within visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackman and Crair, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, it was previously shown that perturbations in synaptic competition for eye-specific territories in V1 can compromise dendritic spine refinement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mataga et al., 2004</xref>). Defective thalamocortical connectivity in hevin KO mice may therefore be responsible for driving generalized spine synapse immaturity in the cortex. In agreement with this possibility, we found that a hevin KOs had increased numbers of excitatory synapses made onto dendritic shafts. It is postulated that excitatory shaft synapses are among the first synapses to form along dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Reilly et al., 2011</xref>). These shaft synapses may be induced to become spines by presynaptic activity during the early stages of postnatal development (P8âP12) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kwon and Sabatini, 2011</xref>); our results suggest that thalamocortical connectivity in general and/or hevin in particular may be playing a role in the shaft to spine transition of some synapses.</p><p>Hevin has been known to modulate cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sullivan and Sage, 2004</xref>), and its positioning in the synaptic cleft (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lively et al., 2007</xref>) makes it a prime candidate for organizing and stabilizing pre- and postsynaptic cell adhesion molecules. Because hevin is preferentially inducing thalamocortical synapses, there may be specific hevin interactors present on these synapses that distinguish them from the intracortical ones. Hevin may also act as a âprotection signalâ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sanes and Lichtman, 1999</xref>) to prevent elimination of thalamocortical synapses. Alternatively, hevin is a generalized protective signal but VGlut1+ intracortical synapses may have redundant stabilization/protection mechanisms in place that can compensate for the lack of hevin, whereas with no such compensation available the VGlut2+ thalamocortical population is lost.</p><p>Our investigation of hevin KO cortex presents an interesting possibility that cortical and thalamic axons compete for postsynaptic targets at single dendritic spines. The presence of SMECs in the central nervous system was described a long time ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jones and Powell, 1969)</xref>. Perhaps due to the difficulty of observing these synaptic structures, because of their unique geometrical arrangement, this early finding of SMECs was largely ignored and their purpose remained unknown. Instead, a simple âone spine: one excitatory synapseâ view of connectivity prevailed. The one spine: one synapse configuration provides a context in which spines can compartmentalize calcium and filter membrane potentials in an input-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yuste, 2013</xref>). Though important, these features of spines may not represent the full extent of their functions in the developing CNS.</p><p>Our findings indicate that SMECs represent a stage in excitatory synaptic development. In agreement with this, multiply-innervated filopodia have been seen in the juvenile CA1 region of hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fiala et al., 1998</xref>); these protrusions were proposed to âsampleâ alternative axonal partners during a highly active period of synaptogenesis. In addition, live imaging of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-labeled dendrites in acute hippocampal slices from P10â12 mice showed that spines sample nearby synaptic resources even after making a stable contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Konur and Yuste, 2004</xref>). This sampling was proposed to trigger synaptic competition at individual spines. However, these experiments inferred the presence of axonal boutons from labeling of the presynaptic marker synaptophysin, raising the possibilities that this staining could have been the result of multiple presynaptic release sites (i.e., active zones) on the same synapse or even different boutons belonging to the same axon. By using ssEM-derived 3D reconstructions of synaptic structures, here we show that multiple independent axons compete for synaptic territory on single spines. Furthermore, our finding that SMECs are contacted by different axonal populations (i.e., VGlut1+ and VGlut2+) suggests that establishment of synaptic networks in the cortex depends on the outcome of synaptic competition at spines, demonstrating a dynamic new role for spines in synaptic development.</p><p>In conclusion, here we show that the astrocyte-secreted hevin is required for the proper establishment of thalamocortical synapses. Moreover, this process occurs on spines serving as simultaneous contact sites for thalamic and cortical inputs during development, a finding that expands the current view of spines as input filters or calcium buffers. These results may also have important clinical implications. Hevin is strongly upregulated in reactive astrocytes in disease conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">McKinnon and Margolskee, 1996</xref>) and has also been linked to neurological disorders, including autism, schizophrenia, suicide and depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Purcell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jacquemont et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kahler et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vialou et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhurov et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">De Rubeis et al., 2014</xref>).

Future studies may determine if impaired resolution of axonal competition by astrocytes drives the dendritic spine deficiencies observed in these conditions, providing a novel cellular target for therapeutic strategies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Immunohistochemistry and synaptic puncta analysis</title><p>For synaptic puncta analysis of mouse V1, hevin KO mice on a 129/Sve background and littermate age-matched WT controls were perfused intracardially with Tris-Buffered Saline (TBS, 25 mM Tris-base, 135 mM NaCl, 3 mM KCl, pH 7.6) supplemented with 7.5 ÂµM heparin followed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA; Electron Microscopy Sciences, PA) in TBS.

This quantification method is based on the fact that pre- and post-synaptic proteins (such as VGluts and PSD95) are not within the same cellular compartments and would appear co-localized only at synapses due to their close proximity. Previous studies showed that this quantification method yields an accurate estimation of the number of synapses in vitro and in vivo which were previously confirmed by other methods such as EM and electrophysiology by us and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Christopherson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Eroglu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kucukdereli et al., 2011</xref>).

The Puncta Analyzer plugin then uses an algorithm to detect the number of puncta that are in close alignment across the two channels, yielding quantified co-localized puncta.

Slices were washed 3 Ã 5 min in HBS-0.05% BSA, then four changes of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O for 2 hr, then incubated for 2 hr on a shaker in 0.5 ml of GoldEnhance EM (Nanoprobes) mixed according to manufacturer's directions. Slices were washed thoroughly in ice-cold H<sub>2</sub>O to stop the gold enhancement. After washing 2 Ã 5 min in HBS, slices were incubated in rat anti-VGlut2 1:250 (MabTechnologies, Inc., GA) in HBS plus 1% BSA and 0.00025% Triton X-100 at 4Â°C overnight on a shaker. After washing 3 Ã 5 min in HBS-0.05% BSA, slices were incubated in anti-rat Nanogold 1:250 (Nanoprobes) at 4Â°C overnight on a shaker. Slices were washed 3 Ã 5 min in HBS-0.05% BSA, then fixed at room temperature in perfusion fixative for 20 min. After four changes of distilled H<sub>2</sub>O for 2 hr, slices were incubated for 3 hr on a shaker in 0.5 ml of GoldEnhance EM solution. Slices were washed thoroughly in ice-cold H<sub>2</sub>O to stop the gold enhancement, washed 2 Ã 5 min in HBS, then washed 3 Ã 5 min in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer in preparation for processing and embedding. Slices were post-fixed in 1% OsO4 plus 1/5% potassium ferrocyanide in cacodylate buffer for 1 hr. Slices were washed 3 Ã 10 min in cacodylate buffer, post-fixed for 1 hr in 1% OsO<sub>4</sub> in cacodylate buffer, then washed 3 Ã 10 min in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O. Slices were stained in 2% aqueous uranyl acetate on a shaker at room temperature for 1 hr, then washed 3 Ã 5 min in distilled H<sub>2</sub>O. They were then dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series (50%, 70%, 90% and 100%) for 5â10 min each, with 100% repeated 3 Ã 10 min. Slices went through 2 Ã 10 min changes of propylene oxide, were placed in a 1:1 mixture of propylene oxide: Embed 812 resin mixture (EMS) for 1 hr, then put in 100% Embed 812 overnight on a rotator. Slices were flat embedded so that the plane of sectioning was perpendicular to the slice's surface, polymerized at 60Â°C for 24 hr.</p><p>Thin sections were cut with a diamond knife on a Leica EM UC6 ultramicrotome, collected on copper grids and stained with lead citrate. Sections were observed in a JEM 1230 transmission electron microscope (JEOL, Japan) at 110 kV. Areas positioned 50â100 Âµm below the pial surface corresponding to the synaptic zone (a.k.a. layer I), containing the dendrites of layer II/III neurons, were imaged with an UltraScan 4000 CCD camera and First Light Digital Camera Controller (Gatan Inc., PA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Structured illumination microscopy (SIM)</title><p>WT brains were harvested and cryoprotected at P15 following 4% PFA fixation. Sections (20 Âµm) were cut on a cryostat (Leica) and stained for IHC using primary antibodies against VGlut1 (1:500; guinea pig; Millipore) and VGlut2 (1:750; rabbit; Synaptic Systems) followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies. Sections were imaged using a Zeiss ELYRA PS1 microscope. 3D structured illumination images of the S/Z of V1 were captured and images subsequently processed using Zeiss SIM algorithms.</p><p>To quantify co-localized VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta, SIM-processed image files were opened in Imaris (Bitplane, Switzerland) and spot channels generated for the synaptic markers using dimensions determined empirically from averaged measurements. Matlab (Mathworks, MA) was subsequently used to only show those puncta within 100 nm, 200 nm, or 300 nm of one another.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>In utero electroporation (IUE) and 3D analysis of confocally-imaged synaptic structures</title><p>Timed pregnant wild type WT (CD1, Charles River, MA) and hevin KO (129/Sve) dams were utilized for IUE. All electroporations were performed at embryonic day (E) 15.5 in order to target neocortical layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons. Dams were sedated with continuously vaporized isofluorane and cesarean sectioned to expose both uterine horns. 1 Î¼g of DNA plasmid containing shControl-CAG-EGFP with loading dye was injected into one lateral ventricle of each embryo using a pulled glass pipette. Five 50 ms pulses of 50 V spaced 950 ms apart were applied with tweezertrodes (positive paddle against the skull over the injection site, the negative paddle across the body away from the placenta) using the BTX ECM 830 (Harvard Apparatus, MA). Warm PBS was applied to embryos and dam to prevent drying. Following the electroporation, the uterine horns were returned to the abdominal cavity and the peritoneum, anterior muscle, and skin were sutured separately. The dam was then placed on a heating pad to recover and monitored daily following the surgery. All procedures for animal surgery and maintenance were performed in accordance with Duke Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.</p><p>Electroporated brains were harvested and cryoprotected at P21 following 4% PFA fixation. Sections (40 Âµm) were cut on a cryostat (Leica) and stained for IHC using primary antibodies against GFP (1:750; chicken; Millipore), VGlut1 (1:500; guinea pig; Millipore), and VGlut2 (1:750; rabbit; Synaptic Systems) followed by Alexa-conjugated secondary antibodies. GFP- expressing secondary/tertiary dendrites in the S/Z, along with surrounding VGlut1/2 presynaptic puncta, were imaged on a Zeiss 780 inverted confocal microscope at 63Ã with 8Ã optical zoom at 0.13 Âµm optical section thickness. Z-stacks were deconvolved with Huygens image processing software (Scientific Volume Imaging, The Netherlands) and then imported into Imaris for analysis.</p><p>In Imaris, dendrites were reconstructed in 3D using either the Surfaces or FilamentTracer tool. Discrete VGlut puncta were resolved with the Spots tool. Presynaptic puncta within 0.2 Âµm of dendrites were then isolated using the Find Spots Close to Filament/Surface Matlab algorithm. Spines were then quantified by eye on the basis of their associated presynaptic partners, with the analyst blinded as to the genotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistica (StatSoft, OK) was used for all statistical analyses. Variability between different IHC synaptic staining pairs was controlled for by the use of nested design hierarchical ANOVAs (under Generalized Linear Models in Statistica) with experimental pair nested within condition.

This plugin allows for the quantification of co-localized synaptic puncta from immuno-stained cells or tissue. The plugin separates the original image file into red and green channels, subtracts background (rolling ball radius = 50), and asks the user to threshold each channel individually in order to detect discrete puncta without introducing noise. The Puncta Analyzer plugin then uses an algorithm to detect the number of puncta that are in close alignment across the two channels, yielding quantified co-localized puncta.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold>

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Eve Marder (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The reviewers are enthusiastic about your interesting findings that spines with multiple excitatory inputs (SMECs) derive from intracortical and thalamic inputs formed during development and resolved during maturation, and that astrocyte-secreted Hevin plays an important role in promoting thalamocortical synapses. The reviewers are also impressed by the intensive EM reconstruction you used to document these findings. On the other hand, the reviewers also feel that the evidence for competition is correlative and weak at this point, and the mechanisms by which Hevin bias thalamocortical vs. intracortical synapse formation is unclear. On balance, we invite you to submit a revised manuscript addressing the following specific critiques:</p><p>1) The immunoâEM studies constitute a key piece of evidence to support that SMECs contain both vGluT2+ thalamocortical and vGluT1+ intracortical synapses. However, the presentation is entirely anecdotal. More quantitative description is required.</p><p>2) Given the concern expressed in point #3 below and based on the evidence presented, one cannot rule out a scenario of delayed maturation in the Hevin KO. Perhaps growth and innervation are slower in general, but since intracortical synapse formation is earlier, at the P25 time point it has already 'caught up' but the thalamic axons are not all there yet, and synaptic competition is also delayed. You need to provide evidence against this synaptic delay alternative explanation.</p><p>3) The following critiques are related specifically to the conclusions regarding synaptic competition: while this is an interesting possibility, the reviewers feel that current data do not provide sufficient evidence to justify putting competition in the Title, Abstract, and as a major conclusion of the paper. While <italic>eLife</italic> has a policy to not require extensive new experiments, the following experiments, while not necessarily required for acceptance, would, in our opinion, greatly strengthen the paper. We hope that you can address as many of these issues as possible. We hope that you may have some relevant data in hand, and remind you that <italic>eLife</italic> has no restriction on the number of figures. Of course, brevity is always a virtue, but if you have data that was omitted because of length restrictions at most journals, we would rather have the full story. Otherwise the rhetoric of the paper needs to be significantly toned down, and it needs to focus more specifically on the findings for which you have strong data.</p><p>3a) The conclusions regarding synaptic competition between intra-cortical and thalamo-cortical inputs are based on several points of evidence, none of which are particularly strong. The main evidence is increased in cortical VGlut1 and decreased VGlut2 staining at P25. Although you show in Figure 1âfigure supplement 3 that the number of LGN neurons is normal in the Hevin KO, you do not show (despite the misleading title of this figure) that thalamic ingrowth into cortex and thalamic axonal arborization is intact. You need to show that thalamic axons needed for synapse formation in the cortex are intact in the Hevin KO, and that the fewer VGlut2 synapses are not due to deficiencies such as reduced thalamic ingrowth or arborization. The fact that immunohistochemistry from P7 mice already shows reduced VGlut2 staining at a time point where SMECs are expected to be similar between WT and KO mice, and Hevin levels are relatively low strengthens this concern. You could further bolster the claim of synaptic competition by demonstrating that cortical expression of Hevin KO rescues the VGlut2 staining loss in cortex.</p><p>3b) A second point of evidence that you present for reduced synaptic competition at SMECs between thalamo-cortical and intra-cortical synapses in the Hevin KO, is that, while the apparent overlap of VGlut1 and VGlut2 staining is reduced in WT mice from P15 to P25, in the Hevin KO overlap at P25 is equivalent to P15 WT. The caveat raised above applies here too. One would also like to see the P15 Hevin KO data in this comparison. Similar WT and KO overlap at P15 would support your hypothesis. It would not if there is already reduced overlap at P15 (which one might imagine if initial ingrowth or axon elaboration is deficient).</p><p>3c) The third and weakest point of evidence is the immunoâEM showing that some normal SMECs at P14 are dually innervated by VGlut1 and VGlut2 positive terminals. While interesting, these data are anecdotal (see major concern #1). There is no quantification of % SMECs innervated by both VGlut1 and VGlut2 at P14 vs P25 as opposed to only VGlut1 (or VGlut2) synapses. The reduction in SMECs with age has already been reported, so the fact that they represent sites of synaptic competition during development is not new. The main added value would have been to show that this competition is relevant to a significant % of thalamic vs intracortical inputs, and that it is this particular aspect of the competition that is deficient in the Hevin KO. In other words, since thalamic axons are fewer in general, one would expect that at P15, when the WT and KO have the same number of SMECs in both cases, most of these would represent multiple VGlut1 contacts. With maturation each WT spine would retain only a single synapse, VGlut1 OR VGlut2. In the case of the KO one should also see a reduction in SMECs, but they should be biased towards VGlut1 contacts. The fact that SMECs are still so abundant in the P25 KO suggests a general problem with maturation/competition rather than a thalamus specific problem.</p><p>3d) How does the dendritic vs spine targeting by incoming afferents fit with your general thalamic vs cortical competition scenario? It could also be an issue of maturation, or maybe just a targeting problem in the KO?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04047.022</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The immunoâEM studies constitute a key piece of evidence to support that SMECs contain both VGluT2+ thalamocortical and VGluT1+ intracortical synapses. However, the presentation is entirely anecdotal. More quantitative description is required</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers that the immunoâEM finding, as described in the original manuscript, was anecdotal. We had initially intended to provide quantification for this analysis, but we were faced with a major technical bottleneck. To visualize SMECs in 2D electron micrographs, even at P15 when they are abundant, is extremely difficult due to their unique geometry. Only 3D reconstructions obtained from serial sections can properly resolve SMECs at an appreciable rate in EM. After careful observation of over 200 two-dimensional electron micrographs of VGlut1/VGlut2 immuno-labeled tissue, we were only able to capture one single SMEC. This SMEC was innervated by VGlut1- and VGlut2-positive terminals (which is the image that appears in the manuscript).</p><p>Immuno-labeling in EM requires certain tissue permeation techniques, which are not compatible with serial sectioning. Therefore, the merger of these two techniques at EM-level represented a steep technical challenge that was not possible to complete within the time frame allotted for revisions. However, in the revised manuscript we devised a different method to address this important concern raised by the reviewers. To do so, we labeled dendrites from layer 2/3 cortical pyramidal neurons in WT and Hevin KO mice using in utero electroporation (IUE) at embryonic day 15.5 to sparsely transfect them with a plasmid that expresses GFP. These IUEs were performed in collaboration with our colleague Dr. Debra Silverâs lab. The brains were harvested postnatally and stained for VGlut1 and VGlut2 to mark presynaptic terminals. The secondary and tertiary dendrites of the sparsely GFP-labeled Layer 2/3 neurons were imaged with a confocal microscope. Confocal Z-stacks were then imported into Huygens image processing software for deconvolution. Dendrites, spines, and VGlut1/VGlut2 puncta were then reconstructed in Imaris in 3D. Using a âFind spots close to surfacesâ Matlab algorithm, we could isolate the presynaptic puncta that were in close proximity (0.2 Âµm) to the dendrite. This procedure allowed us to image potential SMECs in a quantitative fashion. We first verified this technique on P15 WT samples and found that this method yields SMEC counts that are similar to our results with 3D ssEM. Then we performed the same analyses on P21 Hevin KO and WT mice (blind to genotype) to study the effect of lack of hevin on the composition of the inputs onto SMECs. We found that the majority of the SMECs are doubly innervated by VGlut1/VGlut2 positive terminals. Interestingly, in line with our 3D EM data, we found that the abundance of SMECs and particularly SMECs with simultaneous VGlut1/2 partners was significantly increased in Hevin KO mice. Taken together, these results, which are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8âfigure supplement 2</xref> of the revised manuscript, strengthen our findings that SMECs are primarily sites for simultaneous contact for intracortical and thalamocortical axons. Our results also indicate that in Hevin KO mice, the VGlut2+ thalamic inputs cannot stabilize their individual spine contacts, thus they continue to be associated with VGlut1+ intracortical inputs at SMECs; this proposed model is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) Given the concern expressed in point #3 below and based on the evidence presented, one cannot rule out a scenario of delayed maturation in the Hevin KO. Perhaps growth and innervation are slower in general, but since intracortical synapse formation is earlier, at the P25 time point it has already 'caught up' but the thalamic axons are not all there yet, and synaptic competition is also delayed. You need to provide evidence against this synaptic delay alternative explanation</italic>.</p><p>In this revised manuscript we included four new experiments that address the concern raised regarding the possibility that thalamocortical synapses are reduced in Hevin KOs due to a developmental delay in thalamic axonal innervation and/or thalamocortical synapse formation. We believe our new findings provide strong evidence that hevin is specifically required for formation and maintenance of thalamocortical synapses.</p><p>We also would like to clarify that intracortical synapse formation, especially at the synaptic zone of the cortex, is not thought to be an earlier event then thalamocortical synaptogenesis. During cortical development, most of the intracortical and thalamocortical synapses form in parallel during the peak synaptogenic window (P5-P21) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nakamura et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2010</xref>); this occurs after thalamic axons reach their target regions in cortex, an event that is finalized within the first few days after birth (P1-P4) (Sur and Leamey, 2001; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Garel and Lopez-Bendito, 2014</xref>). In our revised manuscript, we now include a detailed Introduction that outlines the current knowledge on cortical synapse formation.</p><p>Experiment 1: We agree that the loss of thalamocortical synapses in Hevin KOs could be due to a problem with thalamic axons. To determine if, in Hevin KOs, the thalamocortical axons efficiently innervated the cortex, in particular the synaptic zone (S/Z, layer 1) of V1, we used a Flex-AAV-GFP viral delivery system in combination with rabies virus glycoprotein-coated Lenti-FuGB2-Cre. This way we were able to specifically trace the thalamic axons that originate from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of thalamus innervating the V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3B-D</xref>). These experiments were performed in collaboration with our colleague Dr. Scott Soderlingâs lab. This method allows us to observe long-distance projections whose source neurons and target regions are precisely known. Our results showed that thalamic axons in the Hevin KOs had no difficulty reaching the synaptic zone during the period of thalamocortical synapse formation and maturation. The number of labeled neurons varies from animal to animal due to the reliance on viral infection at two distinct sites, which precludes quantification in this type of analysis. Regardless, we found equal innervation of the S/Z by thalamic axons in Hevin KOs. These results strongly indicate that the defect in thalamocortical synapse numbers we observed in Hevin KOs was not due to a problem with path finding and cortical innervation of thalamic axons.</p><p>Experiment 2: The reviewers suggested that a delay in thalamocortical synaptogenesis might provide an alternative explanation for our observations in P25 Hevin KOs. If the decrease we observed in thalamocortical synapses in Hevin KOs at P25 is due to a delay in thalamocortical synaptogenesis, then this delay should later be corrected. To test this, we quantified the number of VGlut/PSD95 synapses in adult (12-week-old) mice. In contrast to the idea that reduced thalamocortical synapses we observed in P25 Hevin KOs is a developmental delay, we found a significant lack of VGlut2+ synapses in adult Hevin KOs compared to WTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This result indicates that loss of hevin impairs formation and maintenance of thalamocortical synapses. Interestingly, the number of VGlut1+ synapses in adult Hevin KOs was similar to that of the WT adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) indicating that the increase we see in the number of VGlut1+ excitatory synapses in Hevin KOs at P7 and P25 is a transient developmental phenomenon.</p><p>This transient increase in VGlut1+ cortical synapses may be due to a homeostatic mechanism that compensates for lost thalamic connections, driven by a transient competitive advantage for cortical axons over the thalamic inputs to establish synapses. In line with synaptic compensation, the electrophysiology experiments, that we performed in collaboration with our Duke University colleague Nicole Calakosâs lab on P25 Hevin KO and WT mice, revealed that, despite the severe loss of thalamocortical connections in Hevin KOs, the miniature excitatory postsynaptic currents are normalized to WT levels (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Taken together with our previous findings, these new experiments reveal that hevin is required for normal thalamocortical excitatory synapse formation. In addition, we performed two other experiments to test the sufficiency of hevin to induce thalamocortical synapse formation.</p><p>Experiment 3: To determine if hevin was sufficient to induce synapse formation between thalamic axons and cortical neurons, we used a purified neuron culture system. We have utilized neuronal surface antigen L1-CAM specific antibodies to purify cortical and thalamic neurons. In these pure neuronal cultures we tested the ability of hevin to induce formation of VGlut1+ intracortical or VGlut2+ thalamocortical synapses. We found that hevin can significantly induce VGlut2+ positive thalamocortical synapse formation, however hevin does not induce formation of VGlut1+ intracortical synapses. These results are now reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâE</xref>. These in vitro findings show that hevin is sufficient to induce thalamocortical synapse formation in purified neuronal cultures. It is important to note that addition of astrocyte-feeder layers to our purified cortical neurons dramatically stimulates formation of VGlut1+ intracortical synapses (Risher and Eroglu, unpublished results), indicating that there are other astrocyte-secreted factors that induce intracortical synapse formation.</p><p>Experiment 4: To determine whether hevin is sufficient to induce thalamocortical synapse formation in vivo, we injected purified hevin protein into the V1 cortices of Hevin KOs and determined whether hevin injection can induce VGlut2+ thalamocortical synapse formation. In our optimization experiments, we determined that injected hevin persists up to 3 days in the cortex. Therefore, we harvested the brains at 3 days post-hevin injection and determined the synapse composition close to the sites of injection. Vehicle-injected littermates served as controls. We found that hevin injection leads to a profound increase in VGlut2+ synapse formation in the cortex, whereas hevin injection does not alter VGlut1+ synapse numbers. These data are now presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4FâH</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>. Taken together, these in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that hevin is sufficient to induce thalamocortical synapse formation.</p><p><italic>3) The following critiques are related specifically to the conclusions regarding synaptic competition: while this is an interesting possibility, the reviewers feel that current data do not provide sufficient evidence to justify putting competition in the Title, Abstract, and as a major conclusion of the paper.

Otherwise the rhetoric of the paper needs to be significantly toned down, and it needs to focus more specifically on the findings for which you have strong data</italic>.</p><p>We trust that with the addition of above-mentioned experiments, we greatly strengthened our manuscript and addressed the majority, if not all the points, which were raised within the third concern. We believe our manuscript now makes a compelling case for the SMECs as potential sites for competition between thalamic and cortical axons. However, we agree that further experiments are required to decisively show the role of these structures in synaptic competition. Therefore, in line with the reviewersâ suggestions we removed competition from the Title and the Abstract as a major conclusion of the paper, but left it in as an interesting suggestion that can be drawn from our findings.</p><p><italic>3a) The conclusions regarding synaptic competition between intra-cortical and thalamo-cortical inputs are based on several points of evidence, none of which are particularly strong. The main evidence is increased in cortical VGlut1 and decreased VGlut2 staining at P25. Although you show in Figure 1âfigure supplement 3 that the number of LGN neurons is normal in the Hevin KO, you do not show (despite the misleading title of this figure) that thalamic ingrowth into cortex and thalamic axonal arborization is intact. You need to show that thalamic axons needed for synapse formation in the cortex are intact in the Hevin KO, and that the fewer VGlut2 synapses are not due to deficiencies such as reduced thalamic ingrowth or arborization. The fact that immunohistochemistry from P7 mice already shows reduced VGlut2 staining at a time point where SMECs are expected to be similar between WT and KO mice, and Hevin levels are relatively low strengthens this concern. You could further bolster the claim of synaptic competition by demonstrating that cortical expression of Hevin KO rescues the VGlut2 staining loss in cortex</italic>.</p><p>Our revised manuscript includes data that address these important points and shows that lack of VGlut2+ thalamic inputs in the Hevin KOs is not due to a problem with the innervation of thalamic axons. We kindly refer the reviewers to our response to major concern #2. In particular, refer to sections with Experiment 1 which demonstrates that thalamic axons needed for synapse formation in the cortex are intact in the Hevin KO and Experiment 4 showing that cortical injection of pure hevin into Hevin KOs stimulates a robust increase in thalamocortical synapses, indicating that cortical expression of hevin can rescue the VGlut2+ terminal loss in KO cortex.</p><p><italic>3b) A second point of evidence that you present for reduced synaptic competition at SMECs between thalamo-cortical and intra-cortical synapses in the Hevin KO, is that, while the apparent overlap of VGlut1 and VGlut2 staining is reduced in WT mice from P15 to P25, in the Hevin KO overlap at P25 is equivalent to P15 WT. The caveat raised above applies here too. One would also like to see the P15 Hevin KO data in this comparison. Similar WT and KO overlap at P15 would support your hypothesis. It would not if there is already reduced overlap at P15 (which one might imagine if initial ingrowth or axon elaboration is deficient)</italic>.</p><p>We would like to clarify that we do not claim there is reduced synaptic competition in the Hevin KOs. If that were the case, we would not expect to see SMECs in Hevin KOs. The fact that Hevin KOs still have SMECs at later ages indicates that the âtug-of-warâ between thalamic and cortical axons for spines cannot be resolved in these KOs. We propose in our model that, because hevin is required for formation/stabilization of thalamocortical synapses, hevin is also critical for the ability of thalamic axons to withstand the steep competition from the more abundant intracortical terminals at spines. Thus, in Hevin KOs, synaptic competition is rigged towards the stabilization of cortical connections. This model would predict that in Hevin KOs, competition still goes on at thalamocortical contacts at P25 and there are increased numbers of intracortical contacts.</p><p>In our original submission, we provided a proxy for the quantification of VGlut1/2-positive SMECs at the confocal microscopy level by reporting the apparent overlap between VGlut1/2 terminals. Our reasoning was that VGlut1/2-positive SMECs might appear as sites of overlap between these two presynaptic markers at the resolution of conventional confocal microscopy. In the revised manuscript, we have included new data investigating the nature of this VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap through the use of high-resolution structured illumination microscopy (SIM). These experiments were done in collaboration with Dr. Beth Stevensâ lab at Boston Childrenâs Hospital. The lateral resolution of SIM is at least 2-fold greater than confocal microscopy, which allowed us to show that the apparent overlap of VGlut1 and 2 in P15 WT cortex with confocal could essentially be resolved to discrete VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta with SIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D,E</xref>). This finding provides strong evidence for overlapping VGlut puncta being the result of closely positioned VGlut1 and VGlut2 puncta rather than the presence of these two markers at the same terminals. These closely associated puncta could potentially be SMECs. However, we now have a better analysis method for SMEC contacts (see major concern #1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), therefore we moved the VGlut1/2 overlap data to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1</xref>. In line with the reviewersâ suggestion in the revised manuscript, we also analyzed VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap in P15 Hevin KOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Interestingly, the P15 Hevin KOs have an intermediate VGlut1/VGlut2 overlap at P15, which is midway between the P15 WT and P25 WT overlap; this P15 Hevin KO overlap is essentially identical to the elevated overlap levels observed in P25 Hevin KOs. Taken together, these findings show that hevin is required for effective overlap and resolution of the closely associated VGlut1/2 terminals in the cortex. Provided that the overlap we see between VGlut1 and 2 are representative of SMECs, the fact that Hevin KOs have an intermediate phenotype both at P15 and P25 suggests that, in the absence of hevin, both the efficient formation and resolution of VGlut1- and 2-innervated SMECs is impaired. We also tested this point in the revised manuscript (we kindly refer the reviewers to responses #1 and #3c).</p><p><italic>3c) The third and weakest point of evidence is the immunoâEM showing that some normal SMECs at P14 are dually innervated by VGlut1 and VGlut2 positive terminals. While interesting, these data are anecdotal (see major concern #1). There is no quantification of % SMECs innervated by both VGlut1 and VGlut2 at P14 vs P25 as opposed to only VGlut1 (or VGlut2) synapses. The reduction in SMECs with age has already been reported, so the fact that they represent sites of synaptic competition during development is not new. The main added value would have been to show that this competition is relevant to a significant % of thalamic vs intracortical inputs, and that it is this particular aspect of the competition that is deficient in the Hevin KO. In other words, since thalamic axons are fewer in general, one would expect that at P15, when the WT and KO have the same number of SMECs in both cases, most of these would represent multiple VGlut1 contacts. With maturation each WT spine would retain only a single synapse, VGlut1 OR VGlut2. In the case of the KO one should also see a reduction in SMECs, but they should be biased towards VGlut1 contacts. The fact that SMECs are still so abundant in the P25 KO suggests a general problem with maturation/competition rather than a thalamus specific problem</italic>.</p><p>We refer the reviewers to major concern #1 with regards to the SMEC input quantification. We respectfully disagree with the reviewersâ comment: âthe reduction in SMECs with age has already been reported, so the fact that they represent sites of synaptic competition during development is not newâ. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that SMECs are developmentally regulated in the cortex, and that they can be innervated by different populations of axons simultaneously. In addition, the revised manuscript includes quantitative evidence to support the idea of SMECs as sites for simultaneous contact between thalamic and cortical axons. As pointed out by the reviewers, the overall loss of VGlut2+ terminals in the Hevin KOs would suggest that remaining SMECs in Hevin KOs would more likely be innervated by multiple VGlut1+ contacts. However, our Imaris-assisted 3D reconstructions of GFP-filled dendrites showed that the majority of SMECs were in fact of the mixed VGlut1/VGlut2 subtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A, B</xref>). This particular enrichment of VGlut1/2-positive SMECs indicates that these structures are sites of competition mainly between thalamic and cortical inputs. We propose a model for hevinâs regulation of thalamocortical connectivity at dendritic spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) in accordance with these findings. Future studies investigating the mechanism driving the close association of cortical and thalamic inputs on dendrites are needed to fully understand the purpose of these structures, but as the reviewers would agree this would be beyond the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>3d) How does the dendritic vs spine targeting by incoming afferents fit with your general thalamic vs cortical competition scenario? It could also be an issue of maturation, or maybe just a targeting problem in the KO?</italic></p><p>The enrichment of shaft synapses in Hevin KOs is indeed an interesting observation and may be a phenomenon that is distinct from the competition occurring at SMECs. Shaft synapses have been described in cortical dendrites, particularly during early stages of synaptic development, and they may be an intermediate stage before the formation of spine synapses. The persistence of shaft synapses in P25 Hevin KOs thus may be a part of the overall immaturity of Hevin KO dendrites, indicating that hevin and/or establishment of the proper thalamic input is necessary for the maturation of dendrites. We now include a part in the Discussion on our findings on shaft synapses.</p></body></sub-article></article>
