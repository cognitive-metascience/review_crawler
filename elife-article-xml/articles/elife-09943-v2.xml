necessarily occurring at growth-relevant quantities indicative of non-cell-autonomous metabolic function. Complementary auxotrophs of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> amino acid and nucleotide metabolism regularly fail to compensate for each other's deficiencies upon co-culturing, a situation which implied the absence of growth-relevant metabolite exchange interactions. Contrastingly, we find that yeast colonies maintain a rich exometabolome and that cells prefer the uptake of extracellular metabolites over self-synthesis, indicators of ongoing metabolite exchange. We conceived a system that circumvents co-culturing and begins with a self-supporting cell that grows autonomously into a heterogeneous community, only able to survive by exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine. Compensating for the progressive loss of prototrophy, self-establishing communities successfully obtained an auxotrophic composition in a nutrition-dependent manner, maintaining a wild-type like exometabolome, growth parameters, and cell viability. Yeast, as a eukaryotic model, thus possesses extensive capacity for growth-relevant metabolite exchange and readily cooperates in metabolism within progressively establishing communities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09943.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09943.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09943.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Life is sustained by an array of chemical reactions that is collectively referred to as metabolism. Some of these reactions break down complex substances to release energy and vital compounds, while others make new molecules from smaller building blocks.</p><p>Bacterial communities are regularly composed of heterogeneous species, several of which have lost one or more essential metabolic pathways. Nevertheless, these cells can still survive by making use of metabolic products released by their neighbouring cells.</p><p>Yeast are single-celled fungi that also form colonies and, as eukaryotes, they possess cells that are more similar to our own. However, in the laboratory, complementary metabolically deficient yeast cells do not survive when mixed together. It was presumed this is because yeast cells make only enough of each essential metabolite for themself, and so can’t replace those that are missing from their neighbouring cells. Campbell et al. now challenge this view by finding that yeast cells release a variety of metabolites, they use these released metabolites in preference to making their own, and possess the capacity to grow on the basis of a non-cell-autonomous metabolism.</p><p>This discovery came with the design of a new experimental test to study metabolite exchange interactions. This method uses yeast cells that have one or more of their own metabolic genes disabled, and instead have a copy of these genes on small circular DNA 'mini-chromosomes' (called plasmids). The gene on the plasmid can compensate for the yeast having its own gene missing, and allows the cell to still make the metabolic product it needs to survive. However, as a single cell divides to form a colony, cells randomly lose these plasmids, leaving some of the cells deficient for a particular metabolite. These cells can only survive if the other cells in the colony export the missing metabolite in the quantity needed for growth. Using this test, Campbell et al. found that yeast cells can export missing metabolites at levels needed to sustain these emerging metabolic mutants. Additionally, these yeast communities could grow at levels comparable to other yeast without metabolic deficiencies. The resulting colonies also feature one of several different genetic and metabolic profiles, which change in response to the metabolite that is missing.</p><p>These findings demonstrate that yeast cells can exchange high amounts of metabolites, sufficient to form cooperative colonies, and as metabolite concentrations are not altered compared to normal cells, it is likely that exchange of metabolites is ongoing between neighbours in yeast communities. The additional discovery that yeast stop making metabolites when they can obtain them from neighbouring cells has implications for research. This is because many yeast genetic studies use metabolically deficient strains that are supplemented in culture with metabolites. Future work could address whether such supplementation has kept certain functions of metabolism hidden.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.09943.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.09943.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>cooperativity</kwd><kwd>cellular heterogeneity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>S.cerevisae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG 093735/Z/10/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>StG 260809</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004815</institution-id><institution>Isaac Newton Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RG 68998</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ralser</surname><given-names>Markus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002428</institution-id><institution>Austrian Science Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>J3341</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Keller</surname><given-names>Markus A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Corresponding author for proofs</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>Copy editing requirement</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A eukaryotic cell model overcomes metabolic deficiencies within a complex, self-establishing community that enables the growth-relevant exchange of metabolic intermediates.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>fast-track</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>export-timing</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All living cells possess a system for biochemical reactions, the metabolic network, which supplies cells with their necessary molecular constituents. The reactions participating in this network are highly conserved, so much so that all life is made up of a markedly similar set of metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braakman and Smith, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Caetano-Anolles et al., 2009</xref>). The functionality of the metabolic system is bound to a series of transport reactions that facilitate the uptake of metabolites from the environment, as well as metabolite export. Metabolite export primarily occurs for the purpose of maintaining balance of the metabolic system ('overflow metabolism') and to maintain chemical and physical integrity of the metabolic network. This includes indiscriminate metabolite export through non-specific multi-drug transporters required in removal of toxic metabolites for cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paczia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Piedrafita et al., 2015</xref>). Co-growing cells can uptake the released metabolites and exploit their presence. Indeed, to a lower extent, metabolite export of metabolites can specifically occur for the purpose of establishing inter-cellular metabolic interactions in biosynthetic metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nigam, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paczia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yazaki, 2005</xref>) and can lead to mutualistic situations in which cells profit from coexistence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster and Bell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>). In between species, mutually positive interactions can readily establish when exchange concerns an overflow metabolite, exemplified by yeast–algae interactions that can form on the basis of a CO<sub>2</sub> and sugar exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hom and Murray, 2014</xref>), or between different cells of the same species or tissue, exemplified in tumours, when lactate produced in excess by one cell type is metabolised by another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bonuccelli et al., 2010</xref>), or between neurons and glial cells that exchange sugar metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bélanger et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Volkenhoff et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>It is more difficult to assess whether metabolite exchange is indicative of non-cell-autonomous metabolism, when exchange concerns metabolites that are needed by both exchange partners, amino acids, and nucleobases for instance. Exchange of costly intermediates is associated with a significant risk, as exported metabolites can be lost through diffusion, chemical damage, or cheating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobay et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wintermute and Silver, 2010</xref>). Despite these constraints, exchange of intermediates is frequently observed within bacterial microbial communities. Many bacterial species lose essential biosynthetic pathways, disabling them from living autonomously, which may explain why more than 90% of bacteria cannot be cultivated in the absence of a community environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Costerton et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>). The energetic benefit and selective advantage associated with non-autonomous cellular metabolism is often not clear but might involve, for example, the ability to reduce genome size which would in turn facilitate faster proliferation. This may explain why bacteria frequently appear to cooperate in the biosynthesis of more costly and biosynthetically complex metabolites, such as aromatics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mee et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While metagenomics has boosted the knowledge of metabolite exchange strategies in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Manor et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zelezniak et al., 2015</xref>), relatively little is known about eukaryotic species. This includes yeast, a popular single cellular eukaryotic model organism, whose metabolic capacities are regularly exploited in biotechnology. Yeast cells are known to participate in multi-species communities (e.g. on human skin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Findley et al., 2013</xref>)), but as wild yeast isolates usually maintain similar prototrophic genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liti et al., 2009</xref>), metagenomic data are not conclusive about yeast's metabolite exchange strategies. In laboratory experiments, yeast cultures were, however, not effective in supporting co-growth of auxotrophs that have complementary defects in amino acid and nucleotide metabolism, unless they were genetically modified to increase metabolite export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). This contrasts with analogous studies in bacterial species, in which such growth experiments regularly show that co-cultured cells can overcome complementary metabolic deficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster and Bell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vetsigian et al., 2011</xref>). In the absence of quantitative metabolite data, this observation has triggered the conclusion that co-growing prototrophic yeast cells produce amino acid and nucleotide metabolites predominantly for themselves and export them at insufficient quantities to support growth of co-growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Momeni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Conflicting with this interpretation, we here report that yeast colonies maintain a rich exometabolome and that cells exploit this metabolic pool preferentially over their own biosynthetic capacities, which implies that metabolite exchange establishes as a natural property of yeast growth. To test whether yeast indeed possesses the capacity for metabolite exchange at growth relevant quantities, we established an alternative method to co-culture experiments. We exploited the stochastic segregation of episomes to randomly and progressively introduce metabolic auxotrophies into a yeast population which self-establishes from an initially prototrophic cell. This strategy enabled co-growing auxotrophs to enter an efficient state of metabolic cooperation, named self-establishing metabolically cooperating communities (SeMeCos). Despite an auxotrophic cell composition of up to 97%, SeMeCos achieve metabolic efficiency, growth parameters, and cell viability similar to that of genetically prototrophic cells, revealing a natural capacity of yeast to exchange metabolites at growth relevant quantities. In a SeMeCo that possesses auxotrophies in histidine, leucine, uracil and methionine metabolism, we distinguish up to eight cell types, each of which is unable to survive on its own, or in co-culture studies, however, could adapt effectively and cooperatively to overcoming metabolic deficiencies, once self-established in a community structure. Communities have a stable population composition as well as distinct spatial heterogeneity, which was, however, not essential for metabolite exchange, as SeMeCos maintain growth in liquid suspension. Self-establishing, complex communities thus demonstrate that yeast is not only exchanging metabolites, but is also able to do so at growth relevant quantities, to facilitate growth on the basis of a non-cell-autonomous metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Yeast cells do not complement metabolic deficiencies in co-cultures but maintain the required exometabolome</title><p>Histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine biosynthetic pathways were chosen for our study as (i) they can be interrupted by deletion of a single, non-redundant gene, which has been reported not to cause compensatory mutations and (ii) because cells possess efficient uptake mechanisms for these nutrients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mülleder et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pronk, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Teng et al., 2013</xref>).

Feedback resistance renders cells metabolite over-exporters, leading to the conclusion that wild-type yeast cells produce intermediates primarily for themselves, at quantities that are not sufficient for growth relevant metabolite exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Momeni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). In a detailed analysis of the intra-colony exometabolome, using an ultra-sensitive mass spectrometry method, the intra-colony fluid showed however to contain a plethora of metabolites, with the amino acids glutamine, glutamate, and alanine being the most highly concentrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil all showed to be part of this exometabolome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).These measurements were obtained from cells in exponential growth phase, where apoptosis and necrosis are negligible. Comparing extracellular metabolite concentrations to intracellular levels (the endometabolome) we observed a general trend of correlation between the highest and lowest concentrated metabolites (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.517; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>), but overall extracellular metabolite concentrations do not replicate the corresponding endometabolome. Tryptophan, phenylalanine, proline, and valine, for instance, were over-proportionally more concentrated inside the cell, whereas uracil, serine, tyrosine, and glycine were relatively over-represented in the extracellular fluid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Di</xref>). Instead, highly similar exometabolome concentration values (r<sup>2</sup> = 0.971) were observed in the related yeast strain BY4741 upon complementing its auxotrophies with the centromere-containing single-copy vector (a minichromosome), 'pHLUM', which contains all four marker genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mülleder et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Dii</xref>). Metabolite concentrations in the exometabolome between these two related yeast strains are hence substantially more similar than the endo- versus exometabolome in the same strain, implying that the intra-colony exometabolome is a distinct metabolite pool.</p><p>A second requirement to establish metabolite exchange is that cells need to be able to sense extracellular metabolites and to exploit them as a nutrient source. Yeast is known to uptake amino acids when they are available extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stahl and James, 2014</xref>). We tested how extensive this uptake was by comparing the uptake rates between auxotrophs and prototrophs. Remarkably, prototrophic cells consumed histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil at a comparable rate to the genetic auxotrophs, who depend 100% on external metabolite pools (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This demonstrated that yeast cells completely shift from <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis to uptake in the presence of each of the four metabolites. Studying the <italic>URA3</italic> genotype in greater detail confirmed the preference of uptake over self-synthesis. Enzymes involved in uracil biosynthesis remained expressed in both the <italic>URA3</italic> and the <italic>ura3Δ</italic> strains under fully supplemented conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), but uracil biosynthesis-related intermediates shifted to similar concentrations both in the wild-type strain and in the <italic>ura3Δ</italic> strain once uracil was supplemented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The only exception was the direct substrate of the <italic>URA3</italic> enzyme (orotidine-5'-phosphate decarboxylase), orotidine-5'-phosphate (OMP), which accumulated upon uracil supplementation once its metabolising enzyme (<italic>URA3)</italic> was deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1Fi</xref>). In summary, yeast cells do not compensate for metabolic deficiencies in co-culture experiments consistently as others reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>), but they (i) export the relevant metabolites even when grown on minimal media and (ii) take up histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine at similar rates to auxotrophs if supplementation is available. At least for uracil, (iii) the biosynthetic enzymes and majority of biosynthetic intermediates in the supplemented wild-type cell resemble those of the corresponding auxotroph.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Yeast can enter a state of efficient metabolic cooperation within a self-establishing community</title><p>In light of these results, we speculated that the inability to cooperate could be found in the nature of the co-culturing experiment. To establish an alternative method, we made use of a, in other circumstances disadvantageous, property of yeast plasmids, their occasional, stochastic loss from cells (segregation). Segregation is observed for both popular replication types, centromeric 'cen' and 2µ, at a rate of 2–4% expressed per cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christianson et al., 1992</xref>). This property allowed us to randomly and progressively introduce auxotrophies into a developing yeast community starting from a single, initially prototrophic, cell: when a plasmid carries a gene that complements for an auxotrophy, a newly budded cell re-gains the metabolic deficiency according to the segregation of its plasmid. We transformed plasmids from the classic pRS and p400 series which express <italic>HIS3, LEU2, MET15</italic>, or <italic>URA3</italic> genes under the respective <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christianson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mumberg et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sikorski and Hieter, 1989</xref>) into the standard laboratory strain BY4741, deficient in these markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Brachmann et al., 1998</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Ai</xref>).

Transferred to minimal media, the lack of nutrient supplementation leads to three possible outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>): First, if the cooperative potential would not suffice to overcome the increasing content of metabolically deficient cells, colony growth would only be explained by cells maintaining all four plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> <italic>left</italic>). Alternatively, if the segregation is faster than the growth rate of cells carrying four plasmids, the colonies would not be able to grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> <italic>centre</italic>). Finally, the third outcome is that colony growth continues, despite an increasing auxotrophic composition, facilitated by cells exchanging histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine at growth relevant quantities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> <italic>right</italic>). First, we observed that upon approximately 33 biomass doublings, segregation for <italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>URA3</italic> had continued until less than 50% of cells were prototrophs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), even though a 1:1 co-culture of the same auxotrophs was not able to co-grow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Then, we assayed for the formation of a heterogeneous yeast community, starting from the four-plasmid (4P) strain, that can give rise to the emergence of 16 complementary auxotrophic genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In the 4P strain, individual plasmid segregation rates were similar but not identical to yeast carrying one plasmid at a time and were in linear correlation, indicating that no specific interaction between the plasmids occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Aii</xref>). With a total segregation rate of 11%, 4P cells regain auxotrophy rapidly so that only 21 cell divisions (doublings) would result in &gt;90% of cells losing prototrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The continuous loss of prototrophy from the 4P strain was experimentally confirmed on rich (YPD) media; In the presence of rich supplementation, only 45 biomass doublings resulted in 96% of cells losing prototrophy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>Testing whether cells can maintain growth by cooperating in the biosynthesis of histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine, colonies were grown over 7 days on minimal media agar through dilution and re-spotting once giant colonies had formed (every 48 hr), so that the continuous gain in biomass necessitates constant <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis of intermediate metabolites. The experiment yielded viable colonies and from the obtained biomass, we calculated that 57 doublings had occurred. Fifty-seven doublings would have been sufficient for &gt;99% of cells to segregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Replica plating revealed a predominantly auxotrophic composition of the obtained colonies. These were composed of 73.3 ± 3.7% auxotrophic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> <italic>left</italic>), of which 39.9% had lost one plasmid, 20.6% two, 6.6% three, and 6.1% had lost all four markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> <italic>centre</italic>). No auxotrophies were in a 1:1 ratio with each other (36.9% for uracil, 27.7% leucine, 23.7% histidine, and 11.7% methionine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> <italic>right</italic>), despite the segregation rates predicting a relatively equal distribution, implying that selection pressure for certain metabotypes affected colony composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> <italic>right</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We also confirmed that  <italic>S. pombe</italic> is capable of forming similar communities, indicating conservation in these evolutionary distant yeast species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). As additional controls, we (i) re-isolated the auxotrophs from the established colonies, and repeated the co-culture experiment, after having grown the cells for 48 hr in supplemented media, as with the original strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Even when isolated from a functional cooperating colony, complementary auxotrophic cells did not complement each other's deficiencies upon co-culturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), ruling out the possibility that new mutations altering metabolite exchange capacities could explain the formation of the cooperating community. We also mixed all four auxotrophs together, both in a 1:1 mixture, as well as in the ratio observed from the community and performed co-culturing both with and without co-cultivation before spotting; These attempts did not result in successful co-growth either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2–figure supplement 4</xref>). Hence, by exploiting plasmid segregation to overcome culturing and allowing the community to self-establish, heterogeneous yeast colonies were formed, which could sustain exponential growth under nutrient limitation, despite the majority of cells being auxotrophic for at least one metabolite. These co-growing cells could therefore overcome metabolic deficiencies through cooperative metabolism, demonstrating that yeast possesses metabolite exchange capacities at a growth relevant quantity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Self-established Metabolically Cooperating yeast populations (‘SeMeCo’) achieve wild-type-like metabolic efficiency</title><p>The obtained colonies were viable on minimal media and showed no apparent growth defects, despite containing a content of 73% auxotrophs, each of which were non-viable in co-culture studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3 fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 3,4</xref>).

For this, the community was re-established with alternative plasmids that express the fluorescent protein markers CFP (cyan fluorescent protein), Venus (yellow fluorescent protein), Sapphire (a UV-excitable green fluorescent protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sheff and Thorn, 2004</xref>]), and mCherry (red fluorescent protein) coupled to the auxotrophic markers <italic>HIS3, URA3, LEU2</italic>, and <italic>MET15</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilsland et al., 2013</xref>). Segregation of the  labelled plasmids were within the same range, although not identical to the original pRS and p400 plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Images were acquired with a SP5 on a DMI6000 inverted microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) and show the underside of a live two day micro-colony which had, prior to imaging, been growing on minimal media (SM). In our hands, the Sapphire-<italic>LEU2</italic> fluorescence was also visible under the imaging conditions used to visualise Venus-<italic>URA3</italic>. For this reason, the Venus-<italic>URA3</italic> channel was removed from the colony image. The spatial heterogeneity of fluorescent markers in the micro-colony revealed that cells in SeMeCo unequally distribute over the macroscopic structure, and form regions where the biosynthesis of a particular metabolite dominates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). A prediction in truly cooperating communities is, however, whether complementary cells maintain physical proximity to each other, to oppose diffusion of exchanged metabolites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller et al., 2014</xref>). Using computational image analyses of colony micrographs, we find that even when the most stringent cut-off was applied, complementary metabotypes across the community maintained an average distance (6.86 μm) of less than two cell diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Cells are hence most likely to exchange the majority of metabolites with those maintaining close proximity. Despite these results, SeMeCo could, however, continue growth after disruption of this spatial structure in liquid media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To verify this assumption, SeMeCo was replicated for 7 days in liquid minimal media, as previously, with re-dilution every 2 days. Indeed, the liquid culture maintained a similar content of auxotrophs as obtained with colony grown SeMeCos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The capacity of SeMeCos to overcome metabolic deficiencies through metabolic cooperation is hence not in essence bound to colonial growth.<fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09943.014</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Spatial organisation of SeMeCo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial organisation of metabolically cooperating yeast micro-colony on minimal agar media (SM).

These experiments revealed that within SeMeCo, 95.6% of cells belonged only to 8 of the 16 possible metabolic combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We questioned whether this composition was the result of a stochastic event, however, the dominance of the same metabotypes establish three times independently. Moreover, the eight successful metabotypes contributed to SeMeCo at comparable percentages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> inset). Using our segregation rate model as well as growth rate data, we could rule out this colony composition being a result of (i) varying plasmid segregation rate, (ii) the number or type of auxotrophy, or (iii) differences in growth rates. First, a community composition calculated on the basis of the experimentally determined plasmid segregation values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) showed zero correlation with the actual population composition (r² = 0.051) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Second, all histidine, leucine, uracil, or methionine auxotrophies, as well as all plasmid numbers (1 to 4) were found amongst both the frequent and rare metabotypes. For instance, while single uracil (<italic>HIS3, LEU2, MET15, ura3∆</italic>; 19.7%) or leucine (<italic>HIS3, URA3, MET15, leu2∆;</italic> 11.1%) auxotrophs were amongst the most frequent cells, their methionine-deficient counterparts (<italic>HIS3, URA3, LEU2, met15∆</italic>; 0.4%) were among the most rare (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Also, the high frequency of the dual auxotrophs <italic>LEU2, MET15, his3∆, ura3∆</italic> (8.1%) and <italic>HIS3, MET15, leu2∆, ura3∆</italic> (10.1%), contrasts with the rareness of the other dual auxotrophs (<italic>HIS3, URA3, leu2∆, met15∆ (</italic>1.1%), <italic>MET15, URA3, leu2∆, his3∆</italic> (0.2%), <italic>URA3, LEU2, his3∆, met15∆ </italic>(0.5%), and <italic>LEU2, HIS3, ura3∆, met15∆</italic> (0.6%)). Thus, the number of plasmids or type of auxotrophy a cell had did not indicate whether a cell-type would be rare or frequent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Finally, the growth rate of 16 strains, carrying the same marker and supplement combination that replicates the 16 metabotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mülleder et al., 2012</xref>) did not distinguish the depleted from the selected metabotypes either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09943.018</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The community composition is distinct and dynamic.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Frequency of the 16 metabotypes that result from combination of histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil auxotrophies as found within SeMeCo colonies.

If this interpretation is correct, it would imply that a different pressure to cooperate would result in a different SeMeCo composition. To test this hypothesis, we focussed on uracil, as mass spectrometry had detected an increase in uracil concentration in the SeMeCo colony exometabolome, indicating that uracil is the most limiting metabolite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref> <italic>right</italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3Bii</xref>). SeMeCos established on uracil adapted a different composition, resulting from a dramatic decline in cells needed to produce uracil. Importantly, this included the prototroph with its total content in the community decreasing from 26.7% in the original SeMeCo to solely 3.0%, so that 97.0% of cells were cooperating auxotrophs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Hence, SeMeCo colonies establish a population that is dynamic to changes in the external metabolite pool, and can persist in a state with virtually all cells being genetically auxotrophic for at least one essential metabolite.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Metabolic exchange interactions occur frequently among cells that grow in proximity to one another, as metabolites are constantly released from cells for different reasons, such as overflow metabolism, metabolite repair, as well as  export to facilitate metabolite exchange. In bacteria, a subset of such metabolite exchanges are of a cooperative nature in the sense that all exchange partners profit from this situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oliveira et al., 2014</xref>), whereas for the majority of eukaryotic organisms, metabolite exchange strategies remain unclear. Despite yeast auxotrophs being viable in supplemented and rich media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mülleder et al., 2012</xref>), in the absence of amino acid supplementation, they fail to complement metabolic deficiencies in several pairs or higher order co-culture experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>]), a clear difference to bacterial studies, where similar experiments were effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Foster and Bell, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Freilich et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Harcombe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pande et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramsey et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vetsigian et al., 2011</xref>). This led to speculations that yeast might, in contrast to many bacterial species, lack the required export capacities to enable growth relevant exchange of intermediary metabolites such as amino acids and nucleobases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). Analysing the intra-colony exometabolome we could, however, detect the required metabolites; in fact, we found that cells within a colony are surrounded by a rich exometabolome. We also found that yeast would efficiently exploit the nutrients when available, to the extent that they solely rely on these extracellular metabolites. This result implied that metabolite exchange among co-growing yeast cells is frequent by nature; the lack of complementation in the co-culture experiments could thus reflect a limit of the experiment itself, and not represent the metabolite exchange capacities of yeast cells.</p><p>To circumvent combining two or more cultures, we chose an approach of synthetic biology and exploited the stochastic loss of plasmids to progressively introduce the metabolic deficiencies in random combination from an initially single cell. The progressive loss of prototrophy allowed cells to maintain cell growth on the basis of metabolite exchange, resulting in a community with 73% auxotrophy, which increased to 97% upon supplementation with the most limiting metabolite, uracil. Despite its dominant auxotrophic composition, the SeMeCo community could maintain a wild-type like exometabolome, metabolic efficiency, as well as cell viability, implying that this type of cooperation is a robust physiological property. Hence yeast's natural metabolite export and import capacities are wholly sufficient to support co-growth on the basis of metabolite exchange.</p><p>The establishment of SeMeCos was not facilitated by mixing the auxotrophs in a higher order combination either. This is consistent with the notion that losing more metabolic genes reduces biochemical capabilities and does not add new ones. The key of the SeMeCo system is instead to allow the progressive self-establishment of the community starting from the single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Metabolic feedback regulatory systems therefore do not inhibit metabolite export in general but prevent cooperative co-growth when already pre-established co-cultures are mixed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Müller et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shou et al., 2007</xref>). A possible role of these mechanisms could perhaps prevent the spread of foreign, potentially cheating, cells that derive from a competing yeast colony. We could replicate behaviour which is in favour of such an assumption; By spiking into SeMeCo a cell culture possessing the same genotype as a frequent (<italic>HIS3 LEU2 ura3Δ MET15</italic>) and rare (<italic>his3Δ leu2Δ URA3 MET15</italic>) genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), we observed that both genotypes were rapidly depleted from the pre-established SeMeCo, irrespective of the frequency of the respective genotype in SeMeCo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Studying the genotypic composition of SeMeCo implied that there are a defined set of interactions underlying the properties of the cooperating community, which maintained a similar population composition involving eight reproducibly concentrated metabotypes when established independently. This indicates that this quantitatively defined community composition was most effective in metabolic cooperation. This finding may close an important gap in the understanding of the evolution of multicellularity; If a defined composition is most effective in cooperative growth, a selection advantage could be provided by any sort of physical bonding which can maintain cooperation partners in the defined equilibria, and would in addition, provide additional protection against the invasion of cheating cell types. Indeed, the exometabolome data implies that the number of metabolite exchange interactions among co-growing cells could be significant. The colony exometabolome contained a vast array of biomolecules, including the majority of amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castrillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Paczia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Silva and Northen, 2015</xref>). The finding that yeast cells prefer uptake over synthesis of amino acids and uracil, even when they are genetically prototrophic, shows that exchange interactions will readily establish once the cellular environment has acquired a critical concentration of metabolites. This has implications for the interpretation of metagenomic studies and cheating/benefactor experiments, as for this reason, it cannot be concluded from the genetic presence or absence of a single metabolic pathway, or from following the synthesis of a single metabolite, how many other metabolites are being exchanged as well.</p><p>Even without selective pressure, both wild-type yeasts  and SeMeCo established an amino-acid-rich exometabolome on minimal media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and engaged in metabolite uptake when nutrients were available (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). This implies that these features are a natural property of yeast and raises the question of why natural yeast communities are not composed of co-growing, genetic, auxotrophs. To answer this question, one needs to keep in mind that possessing metabolic genes in the genome is not equal to the pathway being constantly active; Indeed, prototrophs can flexibly switch from self-synthesis to amino acid uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Being genetically prototrophic hence gives a higher level of metabolic flexibility, as prototrophic cells can re-activate a synthetic pathway when required. Unlike in SeMeCo, the genotype of a cell in a natural community is not in essence reflecting its metabotype or its metabolic role in the community. Additionally, the natural life cycle of yeast involves the formation of endospores, which are important for enduring starvation, and to spread between habitats. Without a prototrophic genotype, a single spore can no longer establish a colony on its own as genetic auxotrophy would interrupt the yeast life cycle. Second, only a fraction of the natural yeast life cycle occurs under exponential growth that requires abundant carbohydrate and nitrogen supply. The maintenance of a prototrophic genotype both in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> wild isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jeffares et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liti et al., 2009</xref>) is hence fully compatible with the presence of elaborate amino acid and nucleotide exchange mechanisms.</p><p>The finding that these cells fully shift from self-synthesis to uptake for histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil, once these metabolites are provided, has direct implications on research using yeast, a primary eukaryotic model organism in genome-scale studies. A majority of yeast genetic experiments are conducted in auxotrophic strains, requiring amino-acid supplemented or rich media compositions. Important parts of biosynthetic metabolism (amino acid biosynthesis can account for up to 50% of metabolic flux towards biomass) may have thus stayed silent in a significant amount of functional genomics experiments. The effects of metabolic–genetic interactions on cellular physiology could thus substantially exceed our current knowledge and could be discovered upon switching to minimal nutrient supplementations. In this context, SeMeCos are simple to handle, establish rapidly and are easy to analyse, and therefore represent an effective and broadly applicable eukaryotic model system to study both cooperativity and effects of metabolism in the laboratory.</p><p>In summary, using histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil as model metabolic pathways for exchangeable metabolites, we found that <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells prefer these nutrients' uptake over their self-synthesis and maintain an amino-acid-rich exometabolome in the extracellular colony space, indicators of ongoing inter-cellular metabolite exchange. Although yeast is known to fail in compensating for auxotrophy in pairwise and higher order co-culture experiments, the cells did successfully enter a state of  metabolic cooperative growth upon exploiting stochastic plasmid segregation so that a single cell could progressively develop into a complex heterogeneous community. Composed of auxotrophic cell types that are non-viable on their own, SeMCo communities were able to overcome metabolic deficiencies and maintain metabolite concentrations and robustness similar to wild-type cells. Additionally, cooperation had imposed different metabolic roles on contributing cells. Progressive community formation thus reveals that yeast possesses full capacity to exchange anabolic metabolites at growth relevant quantities and readily establishes a non-cell-autonomous metabolism within complex but defined community structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Methods summary</title><p>Yeast cells were grown under standard conditions on synthetic minimal (SM or EMM), SC and rich (YPD or YES) media.

Your submission has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and four reviewers, one of whom, Mohan Balasubramanian, is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The reviewers have consulted with one another to come to some understanding of what revisions should be required to produce a revised manuscript suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewers raise a general concern about using your approach to delve into aspects of yeast cell biology and physiology and we are concerned that this could require more than the two months we normally allow for return of a revised manuscript.</p><p>The referees points are provided verbatim, however, please pay attention to and be sure to address the key points in this letter.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The referees liked the new approach using plasmid loss to generate a synthetic yeast community exchanging nutrients, but questioned how the work may provide information on yeast physiology. This could be achieved, for example, using the <italic>Sigma1278b</italic> strain strategy mentioned by Reviewer #2.</p><p>There were also concerns about the lack of cell biological analyses and I would encourage you to address these satisfactorily with experiments and discussion.</p><p>Please pay close attention to the point raised by Reviewer #3 on the exo versus endometabolome differences in the context of the colony and address it satisfactorily with experiments and discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is in interesting manuscript from Ralser and colleagues using a new approach to generating complex yeast community that exchange metabolites, and such exchange is essential for colony viability. The authors show that they can generate synthetic colonies that contain auxotrophs for 4 different amino acids/nucleobases. At one level this is exciting, but at another level, I am unclear what we have learned about yeast physiology from this work.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The plasmid loss based approach to generating the SeMeCo colony is a clever trick, but how does it generate the SeMeCo. Delving into the mechanism of how gradual loss of plasmids in a mixed population (as opposed to mixing various auxotrophs) leads to SeMeCo will be a great strength.</p><p>2) The paper lacks a cell biological analysis of the phenomenon. For example, Muller, Murray use a fluorescence based assay to look at the position of the two genotypes in the colony. Admittedly, the situation here is more complex with a larger number of genotypes, but is still not insurmountable and some cell biological insight into colony organization will help.</p><p>3) It is also not strictly correct to say that exchange of metabolites/cooperation does not happen in yeast, since the papers by Shou and Murray labs (cited in this paper as well) do generate a synthetic cross-feeding colony, except that these authors had to down-regulate feedback mechanisms involved in amino acid metabolism. What the current paper has done is to increase the complexity and this has been achieved using a different clever approach. This needs to be better articulated.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Campbell and coworkers report the establishment of a community of yeast cells with different auxotrophies that manages to grow through exchanges of metabolites. Specifically, they started from an auxotrophic mutant that was restored to prototrophy through transformation with plasmids that complemented the missing biosynthetic genes. As this prototroph divides, some of the plasmids are lost in some of the progeny, resulting in a complex but reproducible community of prototrophs and several auxotrophs; demonstrating that the cells must be exchanging nutrients that support growth of the different auxotrophs.</p><p>The main conclusion from this elegant work is that (eukaryotic) yeast cells are able to exchange metabolites. I am quite excited about this result, because it is getting at an underexplored, yet very interesting and possibly important aspect of cooperation, community formation and multicellularity in eukaryotes. As such, I support publication of this paper in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, I also have several important questions and remarks.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) I think that the main story of the paper is a bit underdeveloped still, and that the second part of the paper (where the authors measure stress resistance, etc.) is perhaps less essential and a bit unconnected from the main story. To me, the most important question is how important and realistic the findings are for natural conditions. This particular experiment and the establishment of SeMeCos represents a scenario that is not very realistic in nature, where all the genes are maintained more or less stably in the genome instead of residing on unstable plasmids. The authors find that auxotrophic mutants that are mixed together do not seem able to develop some sort of mutualistic community. Moreover, in natural conditions, exchange of metabolites between yeast cells may not be very relevant, since if it were, one would expect that feral yeast colonies or communities would contain a very high rate of (different) auxotrophs? This also makes me wonder whether SeMeCo's develop mostly because of the cost of maintaining the plasmids, rather than a benefit of losing specific metabolic pathways to specialize in others? Last but not least, I also wonder whether the lab yeast strain BY4741, a derivative of S288C, which is known to be impaired in several mechanisms related to community formation (biofilms, pseudohyphal growth, mats…), is a wise choice for these experiments.</p><p>Some additional experiments may tell us much more about the real-life importance of metabolite exchange in yeasts. Firstly, I would argue to repeat the key experiments in a strain that is capable of forming communities, like for example <italic>Sigma1278b</italic>. At first sight, this might seem like a prohibitive amount of work, but it is not since it simply entails using some of the available auxotrophs (or generating a few new ones through transformation) to see if they can support each other in liquid suspension, colonies or biofilms/mats. If so, this would mute a lot of doubts (including whether the cost of maintaining a plasmid is a player). Second, I would also suggest transforming Sigma with (at least two of) the plasmids to investigate if and how this strain realizes SeMeCo's similar to S288c. If the authors decide to follow this suggestion, I would also argue for the inclusion of constitutively expressed fluorescent markers, so that they can easily count the different lineages through cytometry and also follow their spatial distributions in colonies/biofilms (see second remark below).</p><p>Last but not least, I think that the authors need to state more clearly what they think is the relevance of their findings in natural conditions – they seem to avoid this question a bit instead of being very explicit about it and discussing it in great detail. One very interesting bit of information would be if and how many auxotrophs are recovered from nature? Is there any data available? Or can the authors explore this themselves?</p><p>2) One of the most intriguing questions is whether the different auxotropic mutants arrange into some kind of spatial pattern in the colonies, so that complimentary strains (that can compensate each other's auxotrophies) would be in close proximity. This should be relatively easy to study by integrating a fluorescent marker in each of the plasmids (e.g. three dyes with a very different spectrum, like CFP, YFP and RFP).</p><p>3) It is unclear to me whether it is sufficient to keep cells in exponential phase to exclude the influence of dying cells (which could contribute nutrients, rather than through exchange between living cells). The fact that the &quot;exometabolome&quot; differs in composition from that inside of living cells may not be the ultimate proof, as it seems possible that dead cells do not only contribute metabolites that were free molecules when the cell was still alive, but also through (active or passive) breakdown of biomolecules after the cells disintegrate. Perhaps one way to tackle this is to let cultures grow well into stationary phase and/or add a certain number of dead cells and monitor if and how this changes the dynamics. Another way would be to investigate colonies, as it is known that cells in the center of colonies experience starvation and cell death (see for example work by Palkova and colleagues).</p><p>4) The SeMeCo's seem to show convergence towards a stable state (with a defined and complex ratio of different auxotrophic mutants). Are we sure that this is indeed a stable state? And why do not all prototrophs disappear? Would it be worth letting some communities grow much longer to see what happens in the long term?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Cells within community may cooperate by exchanging metabolites, easing the metabolic burden on individuals. Budding yeast &quot;wild type&quot; auxotrophs do not complement metabolic deficiencies when grown in co-cultures, leading to speculations that yeast may be deficient in some aspect of metabolite export. The manuscript under review describes budding yeast communities capable of metabolic exchange and cooperation. The key trick is to allow those communities to self-establish from a single cell initially auxotrophic for synthesis of three amino acids and uracil in which auxotrophy is covered by complementing plasmids. Each of these plasmids can be lost stochastically during cell division, leading to a mixture of possible phenotypes. The authors show that such stochastic plasmid loss leads to the emergence of heterogeneous colonies where auxotrophic neighbors grow and exchange metabolites between each other. It is a clever approach leading to a neat observation and the manuscript describes a lot of experimental work. My biggest problem with this story is that there is no attempt to get at the underlying mechanism and to understand just how SeMeCos differ from cells in co-culture.</p><p>Major concerns:</p><p>Are individual SeMeCo cells sensitive to end-product feedback? Could they have accumulated mutations inactivating the feedback inhibition? Other mutations/genome rearrangements? Do cells maintain ploidy?</p><p>Somewhat related, is it possible to reproduce mutualistic growth from scratch, in co-cultures, using mixed populations of cells with metabotype composition similar to SeMeCos? Perhaps in conditioned SeMeCo media, since the authors suggest that &quot;exchange interactions will readily establish once the cellular environment has acquired a critical concentration of metabolites&quot;.</p><p>I do not quite understand why SeMeCos transferred to the liquid minimal medium – and at very low dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) – do not show longer lag phase as compared to their parent strain and grow normally. Do they overproduce and/or over-secrete metabolites under these conditions? Would it be expected that metabolite concentration is initially very low? Or are those initially proliferating cells prototrophs that may later start losing plasmids, re-establishing the community?</p><p>I do not get the logic behind experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>. The authors first show that many metabolites are found in extracellular space within yeast colonies. They then argue that these metabolites must be exported rather than released from lysing cells because endo- and exometabolomes of exponentially growing cells are different. I appreciate that growing cells may well export metabolites but why is this detour to exponentially growing cultures where cell lysis is negligible? How is it related to colonies where growth is restricted to a small outward layer and cell viability within a colony center is likely decreased?</p><p>Similarly, what is the reason for including an experiment shown in 2Av? The fact that cells lose plasmids in the absence of selection is not particularly surprising.</p><p>What is the degree of cell death during community establishment? Somewhat related, what is the efficiency of SeMeCo establishment? Do all cells eventually give rise to a mutualistic community?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting paper describing how it is possible to evolve yeast communities where certain members produce specific amino acids/nucleotides and other members consume these metabolites. The authors demonstrate that this community behaves similar to wild type prototrophic strains, both in terms of specific growth rate and in response to stress. The authors present an impressive number of controls and perform a detailed analysis of the established community. So overall this is a sound paper and I do not really have any specific comments to the Results and Discussion. However, I am a little puzzled about the rationale of this work. It is not clear what we are learning in terms of new biology from the study. It is an interesting observation that both phototrophs and auxotrophs take up metabolites at the same rate, but I think this has been observed before. The authors can probably easily revise their paper to take this point into account, as I am certain that they in fact could argue for the rationale of this study.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Self-establishing communities enable metabolic cooperation in a eukaryote&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor), Mohan Balasubramanian (Reviewing editor), and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you will see, the referees have asked you to consider and rewrite some points mentioned below and also discuss some caveats that they have noted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Overall, I think that this paper has matured significantly and should be published. I feel that the new experiments make the study much stronger, and I specifically appreciate the authors' efforts to re-write the Discussion section to better highlight the biological relevance of their findings, as well as the remaining questions.</p><p>That said, as I was re-reading the paper, I again started wondering why auxotrophic mutants, even when mixed at the same ratios as found in SeMeCos, fail to establish a growing population; whereas prototrophic cells that contain unstable plasmids are able to form a community with some fractions of the population showing plasmid loss that results in auxotrophy. I understand the authors' argument that feral yeasts often do not show auxotrophies because they may only rarely grow exponentially and because they may go through sexual cycles where they need to be able to survive and divide as single haploid cells. But why would mixing auxotrophs in rich medium not yield the same result as a population where the haploids are gradually formed through plasmid loss as the population grows?</p><p>One important potential artefact would be that after plasmid loss, the proteins encoded by the lost plasmids remain present and active in the cells for a few generations. It is well known that protein carry-over can persist for more than 5 doublings, so in principle, it could be possible that the population contains &quot;zombies&quot; – cells that are able to survive and even divide for a few rounds, but whose lineage is eventually bound to disappear when the limiting proteins become too diluted because of divisions and protein turnover… This could also explain why at least a fraction of the population remains prototrophic.</p><p>I am sure that the authors have also thought about this possibility and will be able to provide arguments against my speculation. It might be useful to also include these in the paper. One possibility would be to closely examine the fluorescence profiles in the SeMeCos – are there any signs of auxotrophs still showing (reduced) fluorescence, or is there a clear bimodal distribution?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 [abridged]:</italic></p><p>I am fine with the revision – it is a considerably improved and focused version of the manuscript. There are several instances where the text will benefit from further edits. I will point out a few:</p><p>The authors mention that they &quot;re-isolated individual prototrophs from the established colonies…&quot;. I am somewhat confused – is this a typo and it should be &quot;individual auxotrophs&quot;, since the authors attempt and fail to co-culture them later? Or do the authors mean that culturing prototrophs for 48 hour in supplemented medium (liquid? solid?) may induces plasmid loss? Either way, it could be worth clarifying this point.</p><p>In the subheading “SeMeCos reveal composition dynamics in response to nutritional changes”, the authors state that: &quot;These findings are hence consistent with the notion that metabolic cooperation prevents population intermixing, so that cooperation partners within the colony retain close proximity to prevent diffusion of the exchanged metabolite&quot;. Yet, the authors also show that metabolite exchange is not constrained by colonial growth and does continue in liquid cultures. I wonder if the authors could add a sentence or two to discuss this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>I have no further comments to this paper. I think the revised version provides a better rationale for the work, and I also think the authors have addressed all the other reviewers’ comments satisfactorily.</p></body></sub-article> <sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09943.026</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:The referees liked the new approach using plasmid loss to generate a synthetic yeast community exchanging nutrients, but questioned how the work may provide information on yeast physiology. This could be achieved, for example, using the</italic> Sigma1278b <italic>strain strategy mentioned by Reviewer #2.</italic></p><p>We agree with referee 2 that BY4741, as a S288c derivative strain, has a long laboratory history that possesses (like other lab strains do as well) some metabolic defects. We therefore agree it can be interpreted as a subject of concern that all results shown were obtained in this background. However, only a single gene mutation (<italic>FLO1</italic>) prevents the assembly of biofilm-like structures in S228c (flocculation), so metabolically, the strain is completely capable of forming these types of communities (Smukalla et al., 2008). Although <italic>Sigma1278b</italic> is capable of biofilm formation in a growth-media dependent manner, it remains a very close relative to S288c, with a largely identical genome, similar metabolic capacities, and a long lab history on its own (http://wiki.yeastgenome.org/index.php/History_of_Sigma). We therefore chose to replicate the key experiments in a totally different yeast species, as these experiments not only exclude that the findings are specific to BY4741, but also indicate evolutionary conservation. In addition, we studied a flocculating derivative of BY4741, to exclude that ability of physical attachment influences the experiments outcome.</p><p>We chose <italic>S. pombe</italic> as the ideal candidate, being ~400 Myr evolutionary apart from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and additionally, as <italic>S. pombe</italic> offers a comparable set of laboratory techniques. We performed co-culture experiments using representative <italic>S. pombe</italic> auxotrophs and find that they, like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells, are also not able to form a co-growing community upon co-culturing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Next, we also replicated a segregation experiment in the same <italic>S. pombe</italic> strain as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>. Also in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, segregation allowed the cells to establish a cooperating community, as in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>In addition, to addressing whether this phenotype is the impacted by the biofilm forming capacities referred by Reviewer #2, we performed the co-culture experiments also in <italic>FLO</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain. The ability of <italic>FLO</italic>+ cells to physical attach to one another did not influence the outcome of the experiments. Complementary co-cultures of <italic>FLO</italic>+ auxotrophs did not co-grow in the absence of supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>The most important implication for yeast physiology is that, our results being correct, cells within colonies continuously and extensively exchange anabolic metabolites among each other and do not, as the current assumption says, produce metabolites predominantly for themselves. We draw these conclusions from (i) finding metabolites to be highly concentrated between cells, (ii) demonstrating that cells take these up preferentially when they are available and (iii), showing that cells have a highly robust capacity for growing on the basis of this metabolite exchange.</p><p>We have extended the discussion about the following implications: that knowledge on ongoing metabolite exchange is essential for understanding the physiology of cells, as it shows that in a community, metabolic networks operate non-autonomously. For instance, this knowledge is essential to interpret the recent results by Shou et al and Murray et al, that mix yeast cells under the assumption that only feedback-modified cells exchange intermediate metabolites, whereas non-modified prototrophs do not (Momeni et al., 2013a, 2013b; Müller et al., 2014; Shou et al., 2007). These results are also essential for interpreting and improving results from metabolic modelling approaches such as flux balance analysis, that intuitively assume cell-autonomous functionality of intermediary metabolism and, at present, do not include transport reactions or assume regular metabolite exchange between cells. For biotechnology, the potential is huge as well, as SeMeCos offer a simple system for establishing cooperative communities; these could be very efficient for the production of cell-toxic substances, as the burden can be shared between cells.</p><p>Please also see the individual response to Reviewer #2 that is interested in the yeast ecological implications of the metabolite exchange.</p><p><italic>There were also concerns about the lack of cell biological analyses and I would encourage you to address these satisfactorily with experiments and discussion.</italic></p><p>We have replicated a series of experiments in this respect as requested by the reviewers. We have introduced plasmids containing fluorescent proteins coupled to auxotrophic markers and did reconstruct SeMeCo and visualise structural organisation of a micro-colony via confocal fluorescence microscopy. These experiments add appreciable visual evidence that metabolic heterogeneity in a SeMeCo colony is substantial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>).</p><p>We next performed advanced image analyses from these microscopy images and show that the distance a metabolite needs to cross to reach a consuming auxotroph from a supplying prototroph is minimal (less than two yeast cell diameters) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). This shows that the community establishes a structure due to cooperation.</p><p><italic>Please pay close attention to the point raised by Reviewer #3 on the exo versus endometabolome differences in the context of the colony and address it satisfactorily with experiments and discussion.</italic></p><p>We have conducted several experimental controls to address the comments of Reviewer #3. First, we have re-isolated different auxotrophic cells from an established SeMeCo to test whether they, after metabolic reset by growing in supplemented media, behave like the original strains and fail to establish cooperation upon co-culturing. As illustrated, they behave like the original strains and fail to grow together upon co-culturing. This excludes that feedback regulatory systems could have acquired mutations while SeMeCos established, or being affected by other genetic alterations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>As another requested control by the reviewer, we co-cultured the auxotrophic strains in the composition as quantified in SeMeCo, and in a 1:1:1:1 ratio. As expected, a similar result as in the pairwise co-cultures is obtained. The result is also robust when co-culturing overnight in rich media before spotting to minimal media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). We would like to note that these controls were, in another place, already part of the first submission, and apologize that they were not highlighted as such.</p><p>We also tested whether cell death in SeMeCo is different to that in wild-type cells. Both wild-type cells and SeMeCos did produce the same number of CFU's on complete media. Moreover, we counted the cell numbers with a CASY cell counter before spotting, and compared it with the number of colonies obtained. The numbers are close to a 1:1 ratio, confirming that cell death in exponentially growing wild-type and SeMeCo cells is marginal, and that virtually every cell can give rise to a new colony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). We would like to note that the Palková experiments that have been referred to (Váchová et al., 2012), are conducted in old, stationary colonies that establish over several days to a week, where cell death is expected to commence in the regions of the colony where there is no cell growth and the population ageing. In difference, all our experiments are conducted in continuously growing colonies and cultures, were old cells are constantly diluted and never reach a significant percentage of the community.</p><p>We also revised our point about the exo vs endometabolome and apologize that it created an unintentional confusion. It is not a problem that a low number of dying cells may contribute to the exometabolome – even in exponential cell growth a (very) low number of cell death might occur and this is a physiological situation in a yeast colony and cannot be prevented. There would also be no way to distinguish this by mass spectrometry or another analytical technique (physically it is the same metabolite, differential labelling is no option as it is not predictive which cell will die first), subsequently, we can only work indirectly, therefore we only use growth conditions where cell death is negligibly low.</p><p>Why is this point important at all? We have to exclude that nutrient leakage from dying cells is the main explanation for auxotrophic cell growth in our system. Nutrient recycling from dying cells can play a significant role in chronological ageing experiments, where cells are kept for days or weeks in stationary growth phase and cell death becomes substantial (i.e., studied by Palková and Longo labs). The phenotype, 'adaptive re-growth', can subsequently arise in these stationary ageing yeast cultures as a result of cell lysis. In stationary bacterial cultures, a similar phenotype also occurs, known as 'growth advantage in stationary phase' (GASP). In these stationary cultures, cell growth that is explained through recycling from dying cells, but the novo biomass is not formed. This is the clear difference between these scenarios and our experimental set-up: In our case we can say for certain that de novo synthesis explains cell growth, as we work under exponential growth conditions, where biomass and with it, the total amount of histidine, leucine, methionine, and uracil, doubles with every cell division. Recycling of nutrients from dying cells could – at best – maintain biomass, but never double it exponentially; so on minimal media, all new gained biomass is for certain explained by de novo synthesis. Together with detecting no relevant amount of cell death as expected for an exponential culture Figure 8, we conclude that nutrient release through cell death is overall not relevant for the growth of SeMeCos.</p><p>Reviewer #1:<italic>This is in interesting manuscript from Ralser and colleagues using a new approach to generating complex yeast community that exchange metabolites, and such exchange is essential for colony viability. The authors show that they can generate synthetic colonies that contain auxotrophs for 4 different amino acids/nucleobases. At one level this is exciting, but at another level, I am unclear what we have learned about yeast physiology from this work.Major concerns:1) The plasmid loss based approach to generating the SeMeCo colony is a clever trick, but how does it generate the SeMeCo. Delving into the mechanism of how gradual loss of plasmids in a mixed population (as opposed to mixing various auxotrophs) leads to SeMeCo will be a great strength.</italic></p><p>We agree with the line of thinking of the reviewer, but believe the main question the reviewer asks is what prevents the formation of co- growth in the co-culture experiments. The growth of SeMeCo instead, as addressed in this paper, is clearly enabled though metabolite exchange of histidine, leucine, uracil, and methionine, as these are the only limiting metabolites for the auxotrophs to grow. We suspect that feedback control mechanisms might be responsible; but we have no clear idea of what activates them specifically upon co-culturing. We find this problem as interesting as the reviewer, however, its answer will become a complicated study, and will have to be addressed on its own in the future. We are currently applying for funding to extend this work.</p><p><italic>2) The paper lacks a cell biological analysis of the phenomenon. For example, Muller, Murray use a fluorescence based assay to look at the position of the two genotypes in the colony. Admittedly, the situation here is more complex with a larger number of genotypes, but is still not insurmountable and some cell biological insight into colony organization will help</italic></p><p>We have addressed this experimentally, please see Essential Revision Point #2 above. These new experiments form a new figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We had originally restrained from the use of fluorescent markers as they might have introduced an additional cost though their synthesis in the establishment of a SeMeCo. However, what we can tell so far yeast seem to tolerate expression of the different GFP derivatives without changing the cell growth properties notably.</p><p><italic>3) It is also not strictly correct to say that exchange of metabolites/cooperation does not happen in yeast, since the papers by Shou and Murray labs (cited in this paper as well) do generate a synthetic cross-feeding colony, except that these authors had to down-regulate feedback mechanisms involved in amino acid metabolism. What the current paper has done is to increase the complexity and this has been achieved using a different clever approach. This needs to be better articulated.</italic></p><p>We apologize if our quoting of their work was misleading. We have carefully revised the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p><italic>Major concerns:</italic></p><p><italic>1) I think that the main story of the paper is a bit underdeveloped still, and that the second part of the paper (where the authors measure stress resistanc, etc.) is perhaps less essential and a bit unconnected from the main story. To me, the most important question is how important and realistic the findings are for natural conditions. This particular experiment and the establishment of SeMeCos represents a scenario that is not very realistic in nature, where all the genes are maintained more or less stably in the genome instead of residing on unstable plasmids. The authors find that auxotrophic mutants that are mixed together do not seem able to develop some sort of mutualistic community. Moreover, in natural conditions, exchange of metabolites between yeast cells may not be very relevant, since if it were, one would expect that feral yeast colonies or communities would contain a very high rate of (different) auxotrophs? This also makes me wonder whether SeMeCo's develop mostly because of the cost of maintaining the plasmids, rather than a benefit of losing specific metabolic pathways to specialize in others?</italic> </p><p>The reviewer addresses the ecological implications of our study. In response to the general comment, we would like to bring up that there are two points here, and we think both are important for the natural live of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. The questions a) is whether native yeast cells would exchange intermediary metabolites and possess the capacity to do that as described in our work, and b) whether this exchange would result in a situation, were losing biosynthetic genes provide an additional benefit to that, by forming communities were co-growth of different yeast genotypes becomes obligate.</p><p>To point a, our results give clear indication that the maintenance of an amino acid rich exometabolome establishes within yeast colonies as a normal property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and the cellular uptake of these metabolites to support growth is a native yeast property as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>): The experiments were conducted with prototrophic yeast, grown on minimal media, were no pressure was given to maintain the exometabolome or to uptake the metabolites. Also we see throughout the paper that SeMeCos maintain growth and many physiological parameters that mimic that of colonies composed of genetically prototrophic cells.</p><p>The experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> demonstrate that prototrophic yeast cells can flexibly switch between uptake and self-synthesis of histidine, leucine, uracil and methionine. The critical question for point B), is hence if cells would gain additional advantage by losing this flexibility, and enter a situation were co-growth of different genotypes becomes an obligate situation. One needs to see the answer to this question in the context of the natural life cycle of yeast. This involves a sexual cycle and the formation of endospora, important to endure long periods of starvation, and to spread between habitats. If a yeast cell would lose a prototrophic genotype, a single spora cannot any longer establish a colony on its own. Loss of genetic prototrophy would thus negatively affect the natural life cycle of yeast, with deleterious consequences to its survival, spreading between environments, and evolvability (interruption of genetic recombination, etc.). So even if exchanging metabolites is advantageous when cell grow in a community, there are good reasons for keeping the genes in the genome that allow metabolic flexibility when required and for completing the sexual cycle. The existence and activity of metabolite exchange strategies coupled with the ability to turn biosynthetic pathways on and off, is thus fully compatible with maintaining a prototrophic genome. Perhaps, higher organisms are a good example for that. As humans we obtain all amino acids through our food, yet we maintain biosynthetic pathways for eleven of them, so that we can flexibly activate these pathways when our diet or age requires that. For yeast, the majority (but not all) natural isolates keep genetic prototrophy, both in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Jeffares et al., 2015; Liti et al., 2009). We have expanded the discussion about this point.</p><p><italic>Last but not least, I also wonder whether the lab yeast strain BY4741, a derivative of S288C, which is known to be impaired in several mechanisms related to community formation (biofilms, pseudohyphal growth, mats…), is a wise choice for these experiments.</italic></p><p><italic>Some additional experiments may tell us much more about the real-life importance of metabolite exchange in yeasts. Firstly, I would argue to repeat the key experiments in a strain that is capable of forming communities, like for example</italic> Sigma1278b<italic>. At first sight, this might seem like a prohibitive amount of work, but it is not since it simply entails using some of the available auxotrophs (or generating a few new ones through transformation) to see if they can support each other in liquid suspension, colonies or biofilms/mats. If so, this would mute a lot of doubts (including whether the cost of maintaining a plasmid is a player). Second, I would also suggest transforming Sigma with (at least two of) the plasmids to investigate if and how this strain realizes SeMeCo's similar to S288c.</italic></p><p>We have followed the suggestion of the reviewer, and have replicated the key experiments in (a) <italic>S. pombe</italic>, that is evolutionary distant to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and (b) in a <italic>FLO</italic><sup>+</sup><italic>S228c S. cerevisiae</italic> strain, to exclude that the findings are only relevant for S288c. Please see Essential Revision Point #1 above.</p><p><italic>If the authors decide to follow this suggestion, I would also argue for the inclusion of constitutively expressed fluorescent markers, so that they can easily count the different lineages through cytometry and also follow their spatial distributions in colonies/biofilms (see second remark below).</italic></p><p>We have now included experiments with fluorescent markers. Please see Essential Revision Point #2.</p><p><italic>Last but not least, I think that the authors need to state more clearly what they think is the relevance of their findings in natural conditions – they seem to avoid this question a bit instead of being very explicit about it and discussing it in great detail. One very interesting bit of information would be if and how many auxotrophs are recovered from nature? Is there any data available? Or can the authors explore this themselves?</italic></p><p>The answer to this has been included with point #1 above about the ecology.<italic>2) One of the most intriguing questions is whether the different auxotropic mutants arrange into some kind of spatial pattern in the colonies, so that complimentary strains (that can compensate each other's auxotrophies) would be in close proximity. This should be relatively easy to study by integrating a fluorescent marker in each of the plasmids (e.g. three dyes with a very different spectrum, like CFP, YFP and RFP).</italic></p><p>See Essential Revision Point #2. These experiments have now been included. Complementary auxotrophs stay in close proximity. This does not, however, prevent macroscopic differences to establish.</p><p><italic>3) It is unclear to me whether it is sufficient to keep cells in exponential phase to exclude the influence of dying cells (which could contribute nutrients, rather than through exchange between living cells). The fact that the &quot;exometabolome&quot; differs in composition from that inside of living cells may not be the ultimate proof, as it seems possible that dead cells do not only contribute metabolites that were free molecules when the cell was still alive, but also through (active or passive) breakdown of biomolecules after the cells disintegrate. Perhaps one way to tackle this is to let cultures grow well into stationary phase and/or add a certain number of dead cells and monitor if and how this changes the dynamics. Another way would be to investigate colonies, as it is known that cells in the center of colonies experience starvation and cell death (see for example work by Palkova and colleagues).</italic></p><p>Please see Essential Revision Point #3, where these points have been addressed.<italic>4) The SeMeCo's seem to show convergence towards a stable state (with a defined and complex ratio of different auxotrophic mutants). Are we sure that this is indeed a stable state? And why do not all prototrophs disappear? Would it be worth letting some communities grow much longer to see what happens in the long term?</italic></p><p>We have conducted a stability experiment for a SeMeCo community over a period of ~100 generations. As expected for a living ecological system, it is not 100% identical over this long period, but the variation is in the range not larger ~ 10% and restabilizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Author response image 1</xref>).<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.09943.024</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title><bold/>Stability of SeMeCo colony over time.</title><p>Starting from a SeMeCo micro-colony on minimal media, a giant colony was established and composition was followed by replica plating for 90 generations.

Could they have accumulated mutations inactivating the feedback inhibition? Other mutations/genome rearrangements? Do cells maintain ploidy?</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion, it points indeed to an important control which was not included in our original version. We have tested whether the establishment of SeMeCo is explained by genetic alterations of its members. We isolated the different auxotrophs from an established SeMeCo, and then we repeated the co-culture experiments as done in the original strains. The different auxotrophs isolated from SeMeCo behave like the original strains, and do not co-grow upon co-culturing. This shows that the cooperation in SeMeCo did not establish due to mutations of genomic altercations which overcome feedback inhibition, as this would be then inherited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>Somewhat related, is it possible to reproduce mutualistic growth from scratch, in co-cultures, using mixed populations of cells with metabotype composition similar to SeMeCos? Perhaps in conditioned SeMeCo media, since the authors suggest that &quot;exchange interactions will readily establish once the cellular environment has acquired a critical concentration of metabolites&quot;.</italic></p><p>This control is included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>. Cooperative growth is not achieved when mixing auxotrophs at the same percentage as isolated from the self- established community. This outcome is not affected either by co-cultivating auxotrophs together in rich media prior to spotting.</p><p>To the second comment, the auxotrophs grow upon supplementation of histidine, leucine, uracil and methionine, which are the four metabolites that limit the growth of the auxotrophs, and are therefore the minimum set of intermediates that need to be exchanged. Uptake rates of these metabolites from complex media composition for both auxotrophs and prototrophs are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>.</p><p><italic>I do not quite understand why SeMeCos transferred to the liquid minimal medium – and at very low dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) – do not show longer lag phase as compared to their parent strain and grow normally. Do they overproduce and/or over-secrete metabolites under these conditions? Would it be expected that metabolite concentration is initially very low? Or are those initially proliferating cells prototrophs that may later start losing plasmids, re-establishing the community?</italic></p><p>The reviewer is fully correct, the lag phase is longer in SeMeCo and the segregating strain containing the four plasmids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We apologize that we did not discuss the lag phase in the first version of the paper, this has been included now. When starting the segregation experiments, initially all cells are prototrophs, and hence all metabolites are initially produced by prototrophs. Once SeMeCo is established, metabolites are produced by cells depending on their auxotrophic genotype. Please see the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, that shows the uracil-supplemented SeMeCo, where prototrophs are practically depleted.</p><p><italic>I do not get the logic behind experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>. The authors first show that many metabolites are found in extracellular space within yeast colonies. They then argue that these metabolites must be exported rather than released from lysing cells because endo- and exometabolomes of exponentially growing cells are different. I appreciate that growing cells may well export metabolites but why is this detour to exponentially growing cultures where cell lysis is negligible? How is it related to colonies where growth is restricted to a small outward layer and cell viability within a colony center is likely decreased?</italic></p><p>We have addressed this point in detail, it’s only a control to rule out adaptive re-growth. Please see Essential Revision Point #3.<italic>Similarly, what is the reason for including an experiment shown in 2Av? The fact that cells lose plasmids in the absence of selection is not particularly surprising.</italic></p><p>This is another control experiment confirming that the segregation over time follows the measured segregation rate. In fact we have been asked for this control upon presenting our results in at least three seminars, and hence would like to keep it in the paper. If this point would not have coming up repeatedly (which shows that several readers seem to expect this control), the authors fully agree with the reviewer, the additional information content of this control experiment is not very extensive.</p><p><italic>What is the degree of cell death during community establishment? Somewhat related, what is the efficiency of SeMeCo establishment? Do all cells eventually give rise to a mutualistic community?</italic></p><p>We have tested this in an experiment (please see Essential Revision Point 3). The number of colony forming units in an exponentially growing wild-type and SeMeCo population are the same, and correspond to the total number of cells in the SeMeCo (please see Essential Revision Point 3). This confirms a similar behaviour of SeMeCo to prototrophic yeast, that is known to have a very low number of cell death during exponential growth, in that almost every cell can give rise to a colony.</p><p>Reviewer #4:<italic>This is an interesting paper describing how it is possible to evolve yeast communities where certain members produce specific amino acids/nucleotides and other members consume these metabolites. The authors demonstrate that this community behaves similar to wild type prototrophic strains, both in terms of specific growth rate and in response to stress. The authors present an impressive number of controls and perform a detailed analysis of the established community. So overall this is a sound paper and I do not really have any specific comments to the Results and Discussion. However, I am a little puzzled about the rationale of this work. It is not clear what we are learning in terms of new biology from the study. It is an interesting observation that both phototrophs and auxotrophs take up metabolites at the same rate, but I think this has been observed before. The authors can probably easily revise their paper to take this point into account, as I am certain that they in fact could argue for the rationale of this study.</italic></p><p>We thank the reviewer for the overall assessment. As detailed in the general comments and in response to Reviewer #3, we have revised the manuscript to explain better the biological implications, which are of major importance for the metabolism field, as they show that in co-growing cells, intermediate metabolism is substantially operating in a non-cell-autonomous manner. We also appreciate the comment about comparison of production and uptake rates. We have done an intensive literature research, and also to our own surprise, did not find a manuscript that would have contained data allowing us to compare the uptake rates for histidine, leucine, uracil and methionine between a prototroph and corresponding auxotroph.</p><p>References:</p><p>Momeni, B., Waite, A.J., and Shou, W.

I understand the authors' argument that feral yeasts often do not show auxotrophies because they may only rarely grow exponentially and because they may go through sexual cycles where they need to be able to survive and divide as single haploid cells. But why would mixing auxotrophs in rich medium not yield the same result as a population where the haploids are gradually formed through plasmid loss as the population grows?</italic> </p><p>We apologize that we had not discussed the results about rich media in our manuscript: In rich media the auxotrophs certainly grow without any apparent growth defect. So as the reviewer correctly states, in rich media, the mixed auxotroph, SeMeCo and the wild type strains reveal similar growth properties. We have in depth studied the growth properties of auxotrophs in supplemented media in our previous work, (Muelleder et al., Nature Biotechnology 2012), and we have included this reference and the description. Self-establishment of the community is only required to establish growth in minimal media.</p><p>To the other point, we are fully in line with the reviewer that the limiting factor is not the ratio in which the auxotrophs are mixed to each other; the key is to allow progressive self-establishment of the community starting from the initial single cell, which is certainly the main point of the paper. We have clarified this statement in the Discussion.</p><p>Related to this is the question of what prevents such growth upon co-culturing. The answer for this comes from both Shou and Murray labs, that have demonstrated that when mutating feedback regulatory mechanisms, co-cultures can complement each others deficiency (Shou et al., 2007, Muller et al., 2014). Regulatory feedback mechanisms hence limit the co-cultures to growth. We are not questioning this fact; our results however show that the initial interpretation of this finding, that yeast would not possess sufficient import/export capacities, is not correct.</p><p> <italic>One important potential artefact would be that after plasmid loss, the proteins encoded by the lost plasmids remain present and active in the cells for a few generations. It is well known that protein carry-over can persist for more than 5 doublings, so in principle, it could be possible that the population contains &quot;zombies&quot; – cells that are able to survive and even divide for a few rounds, but whose lineage is eventually bound to disappear when the limiting proteins become too diluted because of divisions and protein turnover…. This could also explain why at least a fraction of the population remains prototrophic.</italic> </p><p>We can fully exclude this being a problem for the interpretation of our experiments for the following reason: We are not monitoring the plasmids themselves, but the auxotrophic phenotype of the cells. For this we replicate a minimum number of 200 colonies on six media types (~1200 spots per replicate); and if a cell can grow, it counts as a prototroph, if not, as an auxotroph. Even if it would have lost the plasmid a cell division before that (but is still biochemically competent by possessing the biosynthetic enzyme) it is still recognised as a prototroph as long as it physiologically is one (and we fully agree with the reviewer, this is what matters). This is in fact the huge advantage of using replica plating over microscopy or PCR based techniques that would only give an indirect measure of auxotrophy over the presence of absence of the gene.</p><p>Second, there is a control in respect to this in the manuscript. We have compared the segregation rate prediction with the actual appearance of auxotrophs on YPD media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The results are overall nicely in agreement, implying that if pseudo- prototrophic cells with protein carry-over do exist, they are not significantly influencing overall population composition.</p><p>Finally, the maintenance of the prototrophs is explained by the uracil requirement; once this metabolite is supplemented, the remaining content of prototrophs is dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).Reviewer #3 [abridged]: <italic>I am fine with the revision – it is a considerably improved and focused version of the manuscript. There are several instances where the text will benefit from further edits. I will point out a few: The authors mention that they &quot;re-isolated individual prototrophs from the established colonies…&quot;. I am somewhat confused – is this a typo and it should be &quot;individual auxotrophs&quot;, since the authors attempt and fail to co-culture them later? Or do the authors mean that culturing prototrophs for 48 hour in supplemented medium (liquid? solid?) may induces plasmid loss? Either way, it could be worth clarifying this point.</italic> </p><p>We apologize that we have misleadingly written this paragraph. What we meant with “individual prototrophs” is a strain prototrophic for methionine, uracil, leucine and/or histidine, but that it is auxotroph for the other three markers. The reviewer is correct that the appropriate would have been “individual auxotrophs”. We now have simplified the paragraph.</p><p> <italic>In the subheading “SeMeCos reveal composition dynamics in response to nutritional changes”, the authors state that: &quot;These findings are hence consistent with the notion that metabolic cooperation prevents population intermixing, so that cooperation partners within the colony retain close proximity to prevent diffusion of the exchanged metabolite&quot;. Yet, the authors also show that metabolite exchange is not constrained by colonial growth and does continue in liquid cultures. I wonder if the authors could add a sentence or two to discuss this point.</italic></p><p>We have expanded this section: There is literature saying that in a metabolically cooperating community, metabolite exchanging cells keep physical proximity to each other, and that this would be a condition for metabolic cooperation. The reviewer is right, we see proximity reflected within the colony, not however in liquid culture. The liquid culture experiments show spatial structure is not a basic condition for metabolic cooperativity.</p></body></sub-article> </article>
