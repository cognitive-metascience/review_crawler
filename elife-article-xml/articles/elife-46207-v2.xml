ESCRT-III hetero-polymers adopt variable architectures, but the mechanisms of inter-subunit recognition in these hetero-polymers to create flexible architectures remain unclear. We demonstrate in vivo and in vitro that the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> ESCRT-III subunit Snf7 uses a conserved acidic helix to recruit its partner Vps24. Charge-inversion mutations in this helix inhibit Snf7-Vps24 lateral interactions in the polymer, while rebalancing the charges rescues the functional defects. These data suggest that Snf7-Vps24 assembly occurs through electrostatic interactions on one surface, rather than through residue-to-residue specificity. We propose a model in which these cooperative electrostatic interactions in the polymer propagate to allow for specific inter-subunit recognition, while sliding of laterally interacting polymers enable changes in architecture at distinct stages of vesicle biogenesis. Our data suggest a mechanism by which interaction specificity and polymer flexibility can be coupled in membrane-remodeling heteropolymeric assemblies.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46207.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are separated from the outside environment by a fatty layer called the plasma membrane. This layer not only isolates the inside of the cell from the outside, it is also essential for the cell to sense and respond to cues around it. For example, the plasma membrane contains different types of proteins that can act as receptors for signals from outside the cell or as channels to take in essential nutrients. One of the ways that the cell can respond to its environment is by recycling the proteins at the plasma membrane.</p><p>During a cell’s life, proteins from its membrane are recycled by being pulled into lysosomes, which are sacs or vesicles full of enzymes that digest these molecules. However, before reaching the lysosomes, the molecules pass through another set of vesicles called endosomes. There, ESCRT-III, a flexible scaffold made out of the proteins Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2, forms a spiral like-structure that collects the proteins and fats from the membrane. This corkscrew-like shape allows the ESCRT-III scaffold to work, but it is unclear how it is formed.</p><p>Snf7 is a protein that forms long bending chains, or “polymers”, by linking to itself. Banjade et al. found that Snf7 uses its negatively charged surface to interact with the parallel chain that Vps24 and Vps2 form at its side. However, Vps24 and Vps2 do not fit rigidly into Snf7 like a key fits in a lock. Rather, their interaction is flexible, based on charge. This flexibility may allow Vps24 and Vps2 to slide along the side of the Snf7 chain, helping to create a spiral. Banjade et al. used budding yeast as a model organism and also imaged purified proteins with electron microscopy to come upon these findings.</p><p>Understanding how ESCRT proteins interact to form complex structures may lead to a better understanding of how other membrane-bound polymers form elsewhere in the cell. ESCRT proteins are also involved in degenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s, where proteins that need to be recycled cannot be properly processed, and they are important for viruses such as HIV to spread between cells. Understanding how these proteins interact to form their characteristic spiral structure could potentially lead to the development of new therapies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ESCRT-III</kwd><kwd>polymers</kwd><kwd>multivesicular bodies</kwd><kwd>self-assembly</kwd><kwd>Snf7</kwd><kwd>Vps24</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007231</institution-id><institution>Cornell University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CU3704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Emr</surname><given-names>Scott D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001021</institution-id><institution>Damon Runyon Cancer Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DRG-2273-16</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Banjade</surname><given-names>Sudeep</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007273</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tang</surname><given-names>Shaogeng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ESCRT-III heteropolymers utilize non-specific lateral electrostatic interactions to recognize one another, which may enable the polymers to slide along one another and adapt to different curvatures.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Eukaryotic organelles that are demarcated by membranes undergo continuous remodeling to maintain their integrity and function. Different evolutionarily conserved heteropolymeric machines and scaffolds including ESCRTs (endosomal sorting complexes required for transport), dynamin, clathrin, COP coatmers, BAR-domain containing proteins, etc. control the remodeling at different organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zimmerberg and Kozlov, 2006</xref>). This polymerization-mediated membrane remodeling in eukaryotes is important for various cellular events such as trafficking, cell-division and migration. In bacteria, structural homologs of actin and tubulin (that include FtsZ and MreB proteins) also form heteropolymers, which deform and remodel membranes, leading to cell shape maintenance and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eun et al., 2015</xref>). In most cases these proteins are recruited to the membrane from the cytosol as monomers, polymerization then occurs on the 2D membrane, which generates the mechanical force to bend membranes. Given the functional importance of polymerization, elucidating mechanisms of how these various machines recognize their partners to form heteropolymers, and how these polymers adapt to physical and mechanical changes in the cellular environment is critical to our overall understanding of how cells control membrane homeostasis.</p><p>ESCRTs drive an ever-growing list of cellular processes. These include biogenesis of multivesicular bodies (MVBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Odorizzi et al., 1998</xref>), viral budding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garrus et al., 2001</xref>), cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carlton and Martin-Serrano, 2007</xref>), nuclear envelope reformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olmos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vietri et al., 2015</xref>), plasma membrane repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jimenez et al., 2014</xref>), surveillance of defective nuclear pore complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Webster et al., 2014</xref>), lysosomal protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>), endolysosomal repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Skowyra et al., 2018</xref>), and so on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hurley (2015)</xref>.</p><p>This machinery consists of five evolutionarily conserved complexes, ESCRT-0, I, II, III and the AAA ATPase Vps4. ESCRT-0, I and II are recruited to the membrane through interactions with ubiquitinated proteins, while ESCRT-0 and ESCRT-II also bind phosphatidyl-inositol-3-phosphate (PI3P) at membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Robinson et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rothman et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Raymond et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Katzmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Babst et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Katzmann et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babst et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babst et al., 2002b</xref>). ESCRT-II recruits ESCRT-III, also nucleating ESCRT-III polymerization. Polymerization of ESCRT-III is dynamically rearranged and directed towards disassembly via the recruitment of the AAA ATPase Vps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mierzwa et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adell et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The requirement of early ESCRTs (0, I and II) varies between the different membranes. For example, in viral budding processes, the ESCRT-0 complex is not required, while in cytokinetic abscission neither ESCRT-0 nor ESCRT-II are required. ESCRT-III, however, is ubiquitously required in all ESCRT-dependent processes. This membrane-modifying property of ESCRT-III is assumed to be a direct consequence of its self-assembly into meso-scale polymers. The requirement of ESCRT-III function in all ESCRT-dependent processes emphasizes the importance of understanding the molecular details of ESCRT-III co-assembly.</p><p>ESCRT-III proteins are ~26 KDa charged proteins that assemble into a polymer at membranes. In yeast, the ‘core’ ESCRT-III machinery consists of Vps20, Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2, as the deletion of any of these four genes leads to a strong defect in the MVB pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Babst et al., 2002b</xref>). Other ESCRT-III proteins consist of Ist1, Did2, Vps60 and Chm7, which have accessory roles in the MVB pathway, but are essential in mammalian cytokinesis (Ist1/Did2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bajorek et al., 2009a</xref>) or nuclear envelope sealing (Chm7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Webster et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>All ESCRT-III proteins consist of an N-terminal helical bundle, which is predominantly basic, and a C-terminal flexible and acidic region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muzioł et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bajorek et al., 2009b</xref>). The N-terminal helical bundle is known to be important for ESCRT-III co-assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2012</xref>), while the C-terminus recruits the AAA ATPase Vps4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Obita et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>Different architectures of ESCRT-III polymers have been visualized with electron microscopy – flat sheets, rings, spirals and helices, owing to the flexible nature of the polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shen et al., 2014</xref>). The most abundant of the ESCRT-III proteins, Snf7, forms 2D spirals. Combination of Snf7 with downstream proteins Vps24 and Vps2 changes the architecture of these spirals to form three dimensional helical polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2012</xref>). The mammalian orthologues of Vps24 and Vps2 (named CHMP3 and CHMP2) co-assemble to form helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lata et al., 2008</xref>), whereas Vps24 has been visualized to form linear polymers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ghazi-Tabatabai et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Despite our understanding of the individual homo-polymerization mechanism (Snf7-Snf7), the mechanisms of how ESCRT-III proteins recognize one another to create heteropolymers remain unclear. While recruitment of downstream ESCRT-III proteins Vps24 and Vps2 by Snf7 is established, what roles these partners of Snf7 play in regulating the polymers of Snf7 remain unclear. How these proteins change the architecture of the flat 2D spirals of Snf7 to 3D helical structures also remains undefined.</p><p>Furthermore, in analyzing ESCRT-III polymerization, most studies only focus on either biochemical/structural approaches, or only cell biological approaches, with a limited number of studies combining both approaches to understand ESCRT-III function in vivo. Here, we apply a combination of in vivo and in vitro approaches to shed light on the hetero-polymerization mechanisms of ESCRT-III proteins Snf7 and Vps24. In particular, we utilize powerful directed evolution-based approaches in yeast to select for Snf7 mutants that rescue polymerization defects. These approaches allow us to describe in vivo mechanisms that ESCRT-III utilizes to co-assemble in the MVB pathway and provide guidance to understand existing literature on ESCRT-III filament structures.</p><p>We previously reported the crystal structure of Snf7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2015</xref>), which depicted the ESCRT-III subunit in an ‘active,’ polymerization-capable conformation. This structure provided important clues regarding how the polymerization of Snf7 is regulated. Here, we identify and characterize a motif in Snf7 critical for recruitment of its downstream partner Vps24. Mutagenesis analyses suggest that this motif is involved in Snf7/ESCRT-III lateral interaction in vitro. The acidic nature on its solvent-exposed surface, rather than a consensus sequence, is important for the function of this helix, suggesting an electrostatic mechanism that Snf7, and most likely all ESCRT-III subunits, use to recognize their partners. We hypothesize that ESCRT-III proteins utilize these lateral charge interactions with weak residue-to-residue specificity to slide on the filaments, enabling them to form spiraling polymers of different diameters and architectures.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mutations in the peripheral helix-4 of Snf7 induce cargo-sorting defects</title><p>Our structural analysis of Snf7 allowed us to specify helices 1, 2 and 3 as the core polymeric interface that drives longitudinal polymerization.

In in vitro assays using the mutation D131K, the protein behaves similarly to the non-mutated version.

The helix-4 mutant D131K (with R52E) is able to form polymers of Snf7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref>).

Upon further analysis in this current study, we find a strong thermodynamic and kinetic dependence on the formation of these helices. At lower concentrations (1 μM each of Snf7<sup>R52E</sup>, Vps24 and Vps2) and shorter incubation times on lipid monolayers (10 min), all three proteins are required for the formation of 3D helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">2</xref>). However, at higher concentrations (7 μM of Snf7<sup>R52E</sup>) and shorter times (10 min), just Snf7<sup>R52E</sup> and Vps24 can together form 3D helices, albeit at a lower frequency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A and C</xref>).

Similar to this property of Snf7, all ESCRT-III subunits likely have an ability to form flexible polymers, the architecture of which can be modulated by various properties – conformational changes, lateral strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>), surface density of the filaments and crowding effect of proteins (cargo/filaments).</p><p>Pure filaments of Snf7 also have an ability to form lateral interactions into bundles, as we and others have observed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chiaruttini et al., 2015</xref>). This lateral interaction of Snf7 polymers also seems to depend upon both the kinetics and thermodynamics of polymerization.

The difference in thickness of polymers of Snf7<sup>R52E</sup> with and without Vps24/Vps2 is not easily apparent, especially as this condition represents later stages of polymerization.

How heteropolymerization of these proteins creates polymers of different curvatures and architectures remains uncharacterized. The molecular details that allow co-assembly of ESCRT-III proteins in general remains an important mechanistic question in cell biology.</p><p>Recent structural studies have provided important clues on the mechanism of activation and assembly of the mammalian ESCRT-III subunits IST1 and CHMP1B, the yeast ESCRT-III subunit Snf7, and the fly Snf7 ortholog Shrub. These structures defined the active, open conformation of the ESCRT-III proteins, and in the case of CHMP1B/IST1 copolymer, an open and a closed conformation. Previous genetic and biochemical experiments had suggested that different stimuli – membrane binding and ESCRT-II interaction – trigger ‘opening’ of the closed ESCRT-III conformation. This conformational change presents a hydrophobic surface and an electrostatic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McMillan et al., 2016</xref>) for the core Snf7 subunits to assemble into polymeric structures.</p><p>Here we find that the overall electrostatics of one of the helices of Snf7 (helix-4) is critical for Snf7 to recruit its partner Vps24.

We observe strong dependence of kinetics and thermodynamics in the formation of laterally interacting polymers, suggesting that over time and with an increase in concentration of the polymerizing species, Snf7 can progressively associate into lateral bundles. In the presence of another ESCRT-III subunit such as Vps24, this interface recruits the partner Vps24 to create a co-polymer, which then remodels the Snf7 spirals to create 3D helices through sliding of laterally interacting polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.46207.030</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Cooperative lateral associations define ESCRT-III polymers.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cartoon model of Snf7 filament interacting with Vps24 filament in trans in lateral fashion.

It is possible that these mutations in Vps24 allosterically enhance the affinity of Vps24/Vps2 for Snf7 rather than providing a direct interaction surface for Snf7. However, the following lines of evidence suggest that these mutants probably lie at the interface of Snf7/Vps24. First, we find strong evidence that Snf7 helix-4 uses its acidic nature to recruit Vps24. Interestingly, helix-1 of Vps24 is predominantly basic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), and helix-1 of all ESCRT-III proteins is the most basic surface of these complexes. Second, the D131 (in helix-4) residue in the Snf7 crystal lattice contacts helix-1 in trans of a laterally coexisting polymer. Third, in thiol-based ex vivo crosslinking experiments, placing cysteines at Snf7 helix-4 and Vps24 helix-1 induces crosslinks. Fourth, in the cryo-EM structure of CHMP1B-IST1, CHMP1B helix-4 contacts the helix-1 in IST1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCullough et al., 2015</xref>). These data are consistent with the idea that Snf7 helix-4 contacts helix-1 of Vps24.</p><p>Interestingly, we observe that the overall electrostatics on one surface of helix-4 in Snf7 is important for this recognition, rather than a consensus sequence on that surface. The suppressor mutations in Vps24 lie in the basic helix-1 region. We note that our data point to the R19/K26 region of Vps24 as the binding surface for Snf7, and do not directly show that the binding surface may be spread out throughout the basic helix-1 region. However, it is possible that on a polymeric surface of Vps24 (and Vps2) where Snf7 is bound, each Snf7 monomer may engage with the same location of Vps24 (<bold>R19</bold>) through different residues of helix-4 (D127, D131, E142) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

Additionally, our crystal structure suggests that helix-4, and most likely the C-terminal region, which lie at the periphery of the polymer and away from it, can also exist in different conformations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tang et al., 2015</xref>). An ability to easily change conformations at the periphery of the polymer could additionally enable the polymer to change its architecture.</p><p>Our data and the reported structure of CHMP1B/IST1 suggest that, similar to the core longitudinal assembly mechanism that are similar between these ESCRT-III proteins, the recognition of partners through helix-4 or the C-terminal peripheral region could be a general feature in ESCRT-III assembly. It is important to note that CHMP1B also contacts IST1 through the C-terminal regions of CHMP1B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Talledge et al., 2019</xref>). In the case of the Snf7-Vps24 interaction, we find that Vps24-GFP is recruited to endosomes even with a Snf7 construct in which the C-terminus (helices-5 and beyond) is deleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Henne et al., 2012</xref>). This could mean that the C-terminus of Snf7 contacts Vps24 only with a weak affinity and therefore we are unable to see an obvious effect in our cellular assays. It is also possible that the C-terminus of Snf7 does not contact Vps24. Since the topology of membrane vesicles created by the reported CHMP1B-IST1 copolymer and those created by Snf7-Vps24/Vps2 at endosomes are opposite to one another, further analyses of these two systems is necessary for us to fully understand the similarities and differences between them. One possibility on how these two systems could create opposite topologies while possessing similar heteropolymer contacts is provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>. In this model, while CHMP1B is bound to the membrane and resides inside of the polymer helix, Snf7 could reside on the outside, with the membrane bound to Snf7.</p><p>The combination of this plethora of different data is consistent with the following model: upon assembly of early ESCRTs (0, I and II) at the endosomes with cargo, Vps20 is recruited, which nucleates Snf7 polymerization. Snf7 forms a scaffold at the membrane which then is required to recruit Vps24/Vps2, although kinetically this recruitment likely happens simultaneously with Snf7 nucleation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a recently reported study of the bacterial tubulin homolog FtsZ suggests that weak van der Waals interactions between laterally interacting filaments may be an important property of that polymeric system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Guan et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, previous analyses suggested that partners of FtsZ can bundle FtsZ through lateral associations, giving rise to helical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goley et al., 2010</xref>). Filament sliding models for FtsZ and its partners have been proposed before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Szwedziak et al., 2014</xref>). However, as far as we are aware, the molecular mechanisms of how such sliding may be accomplished by the filaments have not been defined. Given the corollary between ESCRT-III and FtsZ proteins (membrane associated spiraling polymers) such lateral associations created by non-specific interactions maybe a general way for such polymeric proteins to adopt different curvatures during assembly on malleable membrane surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><p>Although we observe that non-specific charge-charge interactions is a property of helix-4 in Snf7, we suspect such promiscuous interactions to be present within other interaction surfaces (in the longitudinal interface) as well. We and others have observed heterogeneity in the diameter of Snf7 spirals, suggesting that ESCRT-III polymers can adopt different diameters to be able to organize cargo inside the spirals. A rigid polymer with the same interaction surface will be unable to perform this task. As the inter-subunit angle changes and the polymers constrict, the contacts among the surface residues should also change to allow for generation of curvature.</p><p>Currently, structural analyses only depict an energetically stable complex with the same interaction surfaces in different lattices and are unable to clarify the dynamic ensemble of different interfaces. More structures of individual ESCRT-III proteins and in protein complexes will help clarify the interfaces that are important for homo and hetero polymerization of these fascinating self-assembling proteins and will allow us to understand how nature controls these ensembles.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, plasmids and reagents</title><p>Strains, plasmids and reagents used in this study are listed in the Key Resources table.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Electrostatic lateral interactions drive ESCRT-III heteropolymer assembly&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by John Kuriyan as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has also agreed to reveal his identity: Christopher P Hill (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The reviewers agree that this work significantly advances understanding of ESCRT-III filament assembly. Considerable evidence is presented in support of a model in which the conserved acidic helix 4 of Snf7 contacts a basic helix (Helix 1) of Vps24 in a relatively non-specific manner, allowing for plasticity in the interactions between these components that gives rise to different filament architectures. These data include genetic reporters, endosomal sorting, suppressor screening, crosslinking, co-immunoprecipitation assays, and negative stain EM. There are no technical concerns, and the most fundamental conclusion, that interactions between Snf7 Helix 4 and Vps24 Helix 1 are functionally important, is well-supported.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The model proposing an electrostatically driven flexible interface between Snf7 Helix4 and Helix 1 of Vps24 is consistent with the highly variable ESCRT-III curvature observed in prior studies. Nevertheless, the reviewers felt that evidence presented for the model is not decisive in the absence of a more detailed structural model.

Nevertheless, the reviewers felt that evidence presented for the model is not decisive in the absence of a more detailed structural model.

The fact that the interaction between Snf7 and Vps24 is promiscuous and the polymer created are of variable architectures is possibly the reason we have been unable to crystallize the complex of a Snf7 molecule with truncated or full-length versions of Vps24. However, we do believe, as suggested by the reviewers, that our data with suppressor mutations in Snf7 strongly argue for a promiscuous interaction between Snf7 and Vps24. This latter point would have not been obvious from one static structure, and this is why we believe that our genetic and biochemical work will be of much interest and use to the ESCRT community and beyond.</p><p>We agree that the interaction site on Vps24 may be close to the R19/K26 region, and not very spread out on the monomer, although we do see that mutating Q16 or K33, which are quite far apart (~ 28 Angstroms in the homology model) still induces rescue of binding. However, on laterally interacting polymers of Snf7 and Vps24, even the same surface of Vps24 (R19/K26) would be multiplied across the polymer lattice for the acidic surface of Snf7 to interact with. Therefore, it is possible that with the same interaction site (R19/K26 surface), different residues of Snf7 helix-4 may interact across the polymer.</p><p>We have been purposefully cautious in explaining the interaction surface of Vps24, and we have added text (Discussion, sixth and seventh paragraphs; subsection “Basic to acidic mutations in helix-1 of Vps24 rescue the defect of Snf7 helix-4 mutants”, last paragraph) to explain the model better.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition to showing the inferred interactions mapped onto their earlier Snf7 crystal structure, it would be helpful if the authors could include a more complete discussion and illustration of how the interacting surfaces might map into the cryo-EM structure of IST1-CHMP1 that was published by Frost and colleagues.

We have added text in the Results (subsection “Basic to acidic mutations in helix-1 of Vps24 rescue the defect of Snf7 helix-4 mutants”, fourth paragraph), Discussion (ninth paragraph), and added two figures (Figure 2—figure supplement 3, and Figure 8—figure supplement 1) for these direct comparisons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please clarify what is meant by &quot;mature polymerization&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We find strong dependence of both concentration and time in our in vitro polymerization assays for the formation of heteropolymers of ESCRT-III. The use of the term “mature polymerization” was to suggest the idea that the polymers have reached their membrane-budding abilities (probably helices of an unclear length) over time and in their activated stage. In the absence of a clear idea of what the final membrane budding polymer looks like, we use the term “mature.” We have changed the language in the fifth paragraph of the subsection “Lateral cooperative interactions mediated by electrostatics drive ESCRT-III co-assembly” and in the last paragraph of the subsection “Lateral cooperative interactions mediated by electrostatics drive ESCRT-III co-assembly”, to better explain these ideas.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 5: Why does the presence of Vps20 prevent Snf7-Vps24-Vps2 helix formation?</p></disp-quote><p>The experiments with Vps20, Snf7, Vps24 and Vps2 were done in the presence of the wild-type Snf7, as opposed to the activating mutation R52E in Snf7. We find that the helix formation is more robust in the presence of the activating mutation, but absent in the presence of wild-type Snf7, even with Vps20 present, which is suggested to be the nucleator of Snf7 polymerization. With Vps20 and Snf7-R52E both present, we are still able to see bundled helices (new figure, Figure 5—figure supplement 4), suggesting that Vps20 in fact may not be inhibiting helix formation.</p><p>We believe that in our in-vitro assays Vps20 alone is not sufficient to fully activate Snf7. This is probably because the Vps20 we use in vitro is not myristoylated, as it is in vivo, causing it to be not fully recruited to the membrane. In the presence of a GST-tagged Vps25 (an ESCRT-II component), we start observing helices of Snf7-Vps24-Vps2 (new figure, Figure 5—figure supplement 4), suggesting that in our assays additional nucleators/activators are necessary to induce helix formation in the presence of the wild-type Snf7 protein. These explanations are also added to the text (subsection “Lateral cooperative interactions mediated by electrostatics drive ESCRT-III co-assembly”, sixth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
