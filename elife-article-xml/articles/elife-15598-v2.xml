pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.001</object-id><p>The essential process of protein secretion is achieved by the ubiquitous Sec machinery. In prokaryotes, the drive for translocation comes from ATP hydrolysis by the cytosolic motor-protein SecA, in concert with the proton motive force (PMF). However, the mechanism through which ATP hydrolysis by SecA is coupled to directional movement through SecYEG is unclear. Here, we combine all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with single molecule FRET and biochemical assays. We show that ATP binding by SecA causes opening of the SecY-channel at long range, while substrates at the SecY-channel entrance feed back to regulate nucleotide exchange by SecA. This two-way communication suggests a new, unifying 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism, whereby ATP binding and hydrolysis bias the direction of polypeptide diffusion. The model represents a solution to the problem of transporting inherently variable substrates such as polypeptides, and may underlie mechanisms of other motors that translocate proteins and nucleic acids.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>A protective membrane surrounds all cells, and controls what goes in and out of the cell. Many proteins that are made inside the cell need to be exported in order to do their job. In most organisms, a specialised transport motor that sits inside the membrane, known as 'Sec', carries out this export process. Sec recognises proteins that need to be exported and pushes them across the membrane and out of the cell. The energy required to do this comes from the cell's universal power source, a molecule called ATP.</p><p>Previous studies have shown what Sec looks like, but not how it pushes proteins from one side of the membrane to the other. Currently, the most popular theory for how Sec works is that it grabs hold of part of the protein and pushes it through a gate in the membrane. It then lets go and goes back to grab and push the next bit of the protein.</p><p>Allen, Corey, Oatley et al. have now used a combination of experimental and computational methods to look at how the different parts of Sec move around as it uses ATP. The reasoning behind using these methods was that it's easier to understand how a motor works by watching it in action rather than just looking at a still picture.</p><p>Using these methods, Allen, Corey, Oatley et al. show that the biggest movement in Sec as it uses ATP is in the membrane gate itself, which opens and closes. This suggests that Sec acts like a turnstile: proteins can freely move one way across the membrane, but are prevented from moving back in again. This mechanism has not been described before and may apply to other transport systems.</p><p>Further investigations will be needed to understand exactly how Sec recognises cargo and starts the transport process, and to explore the specific features of a protein that activate the turnstile. It also remains to be discovered how this transport process differs in other, non-bacterial cells. This could potentially help us develop new drugs that specifically block the bacterial Sec system without affecting human cells.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>protein secretion</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd>single molecule FRET</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>SecYEG</kwd><kwd>SecA</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I006737/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>William John</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>104632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Allen</surname><given-names>William John</given-names></name><name><surname>Collinson</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HECBioSim</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corey</surname><given-names>Robin Adam</given-names></name><name><surname>Sessions</surname><given-names>Richard Barry</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M003604/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Corey</surname><given-names>Robin Adam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/I008675/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Oatley</surname><given-names>Peter</given-names></name><name><surname>Radford</surname><given-names>Sheena E</given-names></name><name><surname>Tuma</surname><given-names>Roman</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007-2013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Radford</surname><given-names>Sheena E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Evidence is presented that supports a completely new, diffusion-driven mechanism for transporting proteins across membranes in bacteria.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Sec system is the main pathway for protein secretion in all forms of life. At the translocon core is a hetero-trimeric membrane protein complex – SecYEG in the plasma membrane of prokaryotes and Sec61αγβ in the ER of eukaryotes – which forms a protein channel across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ito et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Görlich et al., 1992</xref>). Pre-protein substrates with an N-terminal signal sequence are targeted to the translocon in an unfolded state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkowitz et al., 1993</xref>), whereupon they are threaded across (secretion) or transferred laterally into the membrane (insertion). Protein translocation can occur either co-translationally following emergence of the nascent chain from the ribosome, or post-translationally. In prokaryotes, secretion is mostly post-translational (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hartl et al., 1990</xref>): substrates are recognised by the cytosolic ATPase SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lill et al., 1989</xref>), which targets them to SecYEG and then drives them through the protein channel using energy derived from ATP binding and hydrolysis, and the trans-membrane proton motive force (PMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>).</p><p>A structure of SecYEβ from <italic>Methanococcus jannaschii</italic> provided the first glimpse of the trans-membrane channel through which secretory proteins pass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>) (PDB code 1RHZ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). SecY consists of ten trans-membrane helices (TMs), which form a ‘clamshell’ structure in the membrane, with five TMs on either side of the central protein channel, blocked by a ‘plug’ and a seal comprising six hydrophobic side chains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This conformation is reinforced on one side by SecE, while on the opposite side a lateral gate (LG) connects the central protein-conducting channel to the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, opening of the ‘clamshell’ could facilitate passage of secretory proteins through the central channel across the membrane, as well as the partitioning of membrane proteins <italic>via</italic> the LG into the bilayer.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of SecYEG.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Surface representations of SecYEβ from <italic>M. janaschii</italic>; PDB code 1RHZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>) viewed from the side (left) and periplasm (top right). TMs 1–5 of SecY are shown in pink and TMs 6–10 in grey, with the LG helices (TMs 2, 3 and 7) highlighted as cartoons in the side view.

The ATP turnover cycle of SecA is directly coupled to protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Economou and Wickner, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Karamanou et al., 1999</xref>), but as yet the mechanism by which this is accomplished is unclear. Structural studies have revealed that SecA consists of two RecA-like nucleotide binding domains (NBD1 and NBD2), which together form the nucleotide-binding site (NBS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hunt et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A ‘two-helix finger’ (2HF), at the SecY binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>), and a pre-protein cross-linking domain (PPXD) both make contacts with the translocating polypeptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer and Rapoport, 2009</xref>).</p><p>A breakthrough in our understanding of how SecYEG and SecA operate came with a crystal structure of a complex of the two from <italic>T. maritima</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>). SecY and SecA interact tightly, with the 2HF from SecA protruding into the SecY channel, and a long loop between TMs 6–7 of SecY buried inside SecA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The structure also revealed conformational changes within both SecYEG and SecA. In SecA, a large movement of the PPXD activates the ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gold et al., 2013</xref>) and is thought to clamp the substrate in place, while in SecYEG the LG opens, causing a widening of the channel through which translocating substrates pass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>). Presumably, these changes prime the complex for intercalation of the pre-protein: however, they represent only a single snapshot in the dynamic process of protein translocation, regulated ultimately by the binding and hydrolysis of ATP. More recently, several electron microscopy structures have been solved for the Sec machinery in complex with the ribosome and nascent chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gogala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeffer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Voorhees and Hegde, 2016</xref>). However, whilst these structures reveal key features of the interactions between components, they do not provide mechanistic insights of how protein translocation <italic>per se</italic> occurs. Here, we take a different approach: using all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we identify key structural differences between the ATP- and ADP-bound complexes, and combine these with biochemical and single molecule FRET analyses. Together, the results allow us to propose a model for ATP-dependent transport, in which two-way communication between the NBS of SecA and the channel of SecY biases the direction of random substrate diffusion, in a 'Brownian ratchet' mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Molecular dynamics reveals nucleotide-dependent structural changes in SecY</title><p>The structure of SecYEG-SecA was previously determined bound to a non-hydrolysable, non-natural nucleotide, ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; PDB code 3DIN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>).

Remarkably, this closed state closely resembles a previous structure of the resting SecY-complex in the absence of SecA (1RHZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>); <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, upper panel and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The distance over which this conformational change is propagated – over 5 nm from the NBS to the LG – is considerable.

In this system the configuration of these residues correlates to the open or closed state of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Along with additional conformational changes (detailed in the legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), these data suggest a clear route of signal transduction from the SecA NBS to the polypeptide binding sites. However, the rest of the pathway within SecA is too subtle to be apparent from the MD data. Nonetheless, the initial opening or closing event is rapid: all the ADP and ATP trajectories diverge within the first 10 ns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The speed of this suggests that the input model represents a high-energy intermediate – probably due to the presence of ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub>.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.007</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of ATP and ADP on the nucleotide binding site.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Closeup of the NBS of SecA in the <italic>T. maritima</italic> SecYEG-SecA structure (3DIN; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>]).The ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> moiety is shown as sticks (carbon green, nitrogen blue, oxygen red, phosphorus orange, beryllium lime and fluorine pale blue), and key helicase loops are shown as white cartoons.

A black dotted line marks the distance between Arg574 and Glu99. (<bold>B</bold>) The same view as in panel A, but for post-microsecond simulation snapshots in the open, part-open and closed simulations. Of note are Arg574 and Glu99, which remain distant in the open and part-open simulations (ATP), but come close enough to form a salt bridge in the closed simulation (ADP). In helicases, this conserved arginine finger on motif VI has been shown to couple ATPase activity with substrate binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hall et al., 1998</xref>), underlining its importance in SecA. After the Arg574 to Glu99 salt bridge has formed in the ADP simulations, the Walker A motif is bought into contact with a conserved threonine (Thr416) in helicase motif III, which in the helicase family has been shown to use ATP binding to create an RNA binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banroques et al., 2010</xref>). This threonine communicates directly with the SecA DEAD box—providing a likely route forsignal transmission of ATP hydrolysis away from the NBS towards the polypeptide binding sites. (<bold>C</bold>) Minimum distance analysis between residues Glu99 and Arg574 of SecA across the simulation data confirms that a Glu99-Arg574 interaction is formed in 4/5 of the ADP simulations, whereas it is absent in all 5 ATP simulations. Interestingly, the ADP simulation that does not find this salt bridge is the same simulation in which the SecY LG samples the part-open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Thus, it appears that nucleotide dependent formation and breaking of the Glu99-Arg574 salt bridge is involved in the coupling process leading ultimately to the respective closure and opening of the channel.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="postscript" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-15598-fig3-v2"/></fig></p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A FRET system monitors lateral gate opening</title><p>The stability of the three conformations observed (O, PO and C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) suggests that they represent genuine metastable states, however MD sampling is not sufficient to determine their relative populations.

Due to variability in protein preps, labelling efficiencies and reconstitutions, variation in the total magnitude of the signal was greater than the individual differences between ADP and AMPPNP. To account for this, we calculated the differences in FRET pairwise for each data set (inset).

In total, therefore, only ~12.5% of all SecYEG molecules are expected to respond to the presence of translocation partners. Two of these three problems are obviated by using single molecule FRET: (ii) is solved by using high lipid to protein ratio (see Methods for details) and extruding the PLs to 100 nm, such that only a single copy of SecY is present in each PL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deville et al., 2011</xref>); and (iii) is solved because only particles containing a single donor and a single acceptor are used for analysis (see Methods and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Because we use intact PLs, problem (i) still remains even at the single molecule level. We account for this in the final reckoning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>) by assuming that half the particles do not respond to SecA as they are inward-facing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and behave as SecA with no additional binding partners.

In order to evaluate whether the intermediate peak (E = 0.59) corresponds to a real, part open state, or results from averaging of 2 distinct states during ATP hydrolysis, we simulated two-state traces (with FRET efficiencies of 0.76 and 0.45) with interconversion between the two states.

However, simulated ATP turnover does not recapitulate the experimental data (compare red bars with panel <bold>A</bold>): only a slight shift is seen of the high FRET peak, and no intermediate FRET feature appears. This suggests that in the case of slow ATP turnover, the intermediate FRET peak cannot be due to averaging and thus represents a genuine state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.014</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15598-fig5-figsupp3-v2"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>In the absence of SecA or nucleotide, SecY**EG exists mainly as a single population with an average FRET efficiency (E<sub>FRET</sub>) of 0.76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

Intriguingly, in the presence of ATP—which under steady-state conditions is rapidly hydrolysed to ADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Robson et al., 2009</xref>)—SecY predominantly populates the part-open state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E+H</xref>). Mathematical modelling indicates that the third state cannot be explained by averaging of the two different nucleotide bound forms during data collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C+D</xref>).

No further states of the channel are detected in the presence of the pre-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F+G</xref>).

(<bold>C</bold>) Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE of a trypsin proteolysis experiment, to test the degree of crosslinking of DDM-solubilised SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG. Full-length SecY runs at ~32 kDa, and the primary SecY trypsin fragments at ~19 and 15 kDa. The first lane (1) contains a molecular weight ladder. Other lanes, from left to right, contain: wild-type SecYEG, untreated (2); treated with 0.75 µg.ml<sup>-1</sup> porcine trypsin (3); or treated with trypsin after incubation with 100 mM DTT (4). Lanes 5–12 contain SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG alone (5) or treated with trypsin following incubation with various concentrations of DTT as indicated in the panel. The full-length wild-type SecY is fully cleaved both with and without DTT. In contrast, the oxidised SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG (no DTT) digest resembles that of the intact (no trypsin) wild-type SecY, and is progressively more cleaved with increasing DTT concentration, until it is almost fully cleaved at 100 mM DTT. The results are consistent with essentially complete disulphide bond formation. Note that fragment F4 runs at ~12 kDa. As its cleavage site is unaffected by the disulphide, it is present in the same amount in all lanes that have been treated with trypsin. Note also that reconstitution into PLs occludes the trypsin cleavage site of inward-facing SecYs, so the degree of crosslinking for SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG cannot be determined in a lipid environment.

As both pulling the 2HF away from the channel (with a disulphide bond) and pushing it away (with a bulky peptide; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) elicit an increase in ADP release, it seems plausible that the 2HF is sensing the passing peptide sterically; the dramatic effects of point mutations in the 2HF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erlandson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>) are consistent with this interpretation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>The closed channel poses a barrier to the passage of bulkier regions of substrate</title><p>Previous studies of translocation by SecYEG-SecA have shown that the ease with which a stretch of polypeptide chain passes through the substrate channel depends on the nature of the amino acids in that stretch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sato et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). For example, poly-glycine regions diffuse freely and rapidly backwards and forth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>), while charged amino acids, especially positively charged, are excluded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Nouwen et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liang et al., 2012</xref>). It has also been shown that some combinations of amino acids form secondary structural elements even before they exit the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hardesty and Kramer, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lu and Deutsch, 2005</xref>), while others remain natively unfolded. Given that the aperture of the SecY channel is nucleotide-dependent, we thought it might form a choke point for diffusion of bulky or structured regions of a substrate sequence: in the ADP-bound state, only uncharged, unfolded stretches of polypeptide may pass; whereas the ATP-bound state is less restrictive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>To test this idea, we carried out steered MD experiments. Short peptides corresponding to those used for the cross-linking experiments (above) were modelled into the post-simulation ‘closed’ and ‘open’ structures, at the SecY channel entrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B</xref>), and pulled though the channel with a constant directional force. As expected given the dimensions of the open channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>), all three substrates crossed without difficulty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). For the closed structure however, while AGAGA readily passes through the channel, the larger substrates – especially AWAWA – are substantially retarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This indicates that the closed conformation – favoured by ADP occupied SecA – can permit passage of narrow regions of substrate, but selects against more bulky stretches. To allow these bulky regions through, the channel would need to open – as occurs when ATP is bound.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Over a decade has passed since the structure of the SecY complex was first determined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>). However the mechanism of translocation—how ATP turnover by SecA drives unfolded pre-proteins across the membrane through SecY—is not yet understood. At present, the most favoured model posits that substrate is pushed through the channel by the 2HF, with ATP providing energy <italic>via</italic> a power stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erlandson et al., 2008</xref>). This model has recently been updated to allow free diffusion of some stretches of less bulky residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>); however, as we have argued previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collinson et al., 2015</xref>), evidence for the power stroke itself is lacking. Indeed, it is not clear from the structure of SecYEG-SecA where the 2HF would move, and how it could selectively bind and move both hydrophobic and charged regions of substrate. Furthermore, as immobilisation of the 2HF inside the channel does not prevent translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whitehouse et al., 2012</xref>), any 'power-stroke' conformational change would have to be extremely subtle.</p><p>Here, we have combined all-atom molecular dynamics simulations with single molecule FRET and ensemble biochemical assays to investigate the events that couple the ATPase cycle of SecA with the rest of the complex. Four key observations were made: (i) the SecY channel is predominantly open with ATP bound to SecA and closed with ADP; (ii) the aperture of the channel regulates nucleotide exchange in SecA; (iii) this regulation is sensitive to the size of substrates at the SecYEG channel entrance; and (iv) the closed channel provides a selective barrier against larger substrates.</p><p>Taken together, these observations are consistent with a mechanism for coupling ATP hydrolysis in SecA to protein translocation that does not require a power stroke. In our proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Movie 1</xref>) the direction of random substrate diffusion (Brownian motion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Simon et al., 1992</xref>]) is biased by the action of the ATPase. In the absence of blockages, the polypeptide diffuses freely backwards and forwards through the closed (ADP-bound) channel (state (i) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). When a region of polypeptide that cannot pass through reaches the channel entrance (state (ii) – block region as green circle), it triggers nucleotide exchange – probably <italic>via</italic> the 2HF (state (iii)). This causes a brief opening of the channel (iv), allowing the polypeptide to diffuse freely, before ATP is hydrolysed and the channel closes ((ii) or (v) depending on the position of the block). Back-diffusion is restricted because bulky regions on the periplasmic side do not trigger nucleotide exchange (vi): the whole scheme therefore acts as a ratchet promoting translocation. In essence, the bias for forward directionality arises because the energy transducing (ATP dependent) step – which resolves channel blockages – happens at the cytosolic, but not the periplasmic, surface. Moreover, the irreversibility of the initiation and completion steps would ensure forward directionality: once the signal sequence makes contact with the lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McKnight et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hizlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corey et al., 2016</xref>) it remains firmly fixed there, and is not cleaved off until most or all of the protein has crossed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Josefsson and Randall, 1981</xref>). This ensures that backward motion of the polypeptide does not lead to aborted transport.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.023</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Proposed Brownian ratchet mechanism for translocation.</title><p>SecYEG is shown in red (LG in light red), SecA in blue (substrate channel in light blue and 2HF in cyan and indicated), and substrate in green (with signal sequence as a turquoise rectangle). The initiation process (top left) involves conformational changes that prime the SecY-complex and intercalate the pre-protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hizlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corey et al., 2016</xref>). Subsequently, the substrate is free to diffuse backwards or forwards (i) until it reaches a block (green circle) at the entrance (ii) or exit (vi) to the channel. A block at the entrance triggers nucleotide exchange (iii), which leads to opening of the LG (iv). The wider channel permits diffusion of the blocked region of substrate within the pore, until ATP hydrolysis recloses the channel, trapping the block either outside (v) or inside (ii) the membrane. This cycle produces a net forwards driving force because blocks at the channel exit (vi) do not trigger nucleotide exchange and channel opening; the substrate is therefore ratcheted in one direction. Once the entire chain emerges from the channel it can no longer diffuse backwards and cleavage of the signal sequence is all that remains (completion).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.023">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.023</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15598-fig8-v2"/></fig></p><p>It should be noted that we are limited by practical considerations in the size of peptide we can attach to the 2HF or the adjacent site on SecA. Nevertheless, its presence in the channel activates the NBS – the first demonstration of polypeptide-induced stimulation of the ATPase activity in solution (<italic>i.e.</italic> in the absence of a membrane). This selective response to differently sized peptides is very interesting: in the context of general protein transport, regions of folded secondary structure or stretches of polypeptide chain enriched in bulky amino acids are likely to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2014</xref>). These could be considerably larger than two tryptophans as in the peptide AWCWA. This, together with the fact that we see such variability in the width across LG with ATP bound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), suggests a degree of gradation in the mechanism: the larger and bulkier a region of substrate, the less likely it is to spontaneously cross the channel, but the more likely it is to induce nucleotide exchange. Indeed, at its core our model only requires a single open state to function: perhaps the most open state is reserved to conduct the largest substrates, after multiple rounds of ATP hydrolysis.</p><p>While previous models for translocation have postulated a substrate clamp within SecA, or large-scale conformational changes that physically push the substrate through the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Wolk et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Erlandson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>), the Brownian ratchet mechanism proposed here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) requires only the conformational changes predicted by MD and verified experimentally by ensemble and single molecule FRET studies. Moreover, because much of the peptide is diffusing rather than being pushed, the proposed model retains scope for further acceleration by the PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>), folding, or by the binding of periplasmic chaperones: these factors would also prevent backsliding, and thereby promote flux towards the periplasmic side of the membrane.<media content-type="glencoe play-in-place height-250 width-310" id="media1" mime-subtype="mp4" mimetype="video" xlink:href="elife-15598-media1.mp4"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.024</object-id><label>Video 1.</label><caption><title>Proposed Brownian ratchet mechanism for translocation The proposed Brownian ratchet model for protein translocation, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.</title><p>Video produced by Nan Burston.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.024">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.024</ext-link></p></caption></media></p><p>The different open and closed states required for the model are represented in the various structures of the translocon determined in the presence or absence of translocation partners and engaged translocation substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Park et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gogala et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfeffer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Voorhees and Hegde, 2016</xref>).

The pore-ring is packed tightly around this sequence, suggesting (i) that with substrate bound, the complex might not reach the fully closed state described here (upon ATP hydrolysis), and (ii) that further opening (upon ATP binding) would be required to accommodate a larger region of substrate – as we propose here.</p><p>It is important to point out that the model does not rule out further conformational changes that are not observable on the timescale of our MD simulation, or resolved by the single molecule FRET analysis presented. It has been reported that the ATP-bound state of SecA binds more tightly to substrate than the ADP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). This could be evidence of an additional pre-protein clamp in SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer and Rapoport, 2009</xref>), perhaps designed to prevent the (iv) → (ii) transition in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>: such a possibility is not precluded by the data, and would represent a refinement of the model presented here. Alternately, it could form part of a proof-reading mechanism to prevent poorly translocated substrates from clogging and jamming the Sec machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liang et al., 2012</xref>). This is known to be deleterious to cells, leading to degradation of SecY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van Stelten et al., 2009</xref>); SecA has indeed been reported to have unfolding activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arkowitz et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>The proposed model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) accounts for many previously noted properties of translocation: for example, the translocation intermediates sometimes observed at low ATP concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Wolk et al., 1997</xref>) could be caused by regions of substrate with particularly high energy barriers to transit. It would also give rise to an approximately linear dependence of translocation rate on substrate length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liang et al., 2009</xref>) – especially those with repeating sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tomkiewicz et al., 2006</xref>) – while giving different rates for substrates with markedly different sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sato et al., 1997</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that ATP-bound SecA is bound tightly to the channel, while the ADP-bound form can be released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>), makes sense from the perspective of cellular homeostasis and membrane integrity: release of SecA from a wide open SecY channel would allow the leakage of ions and compromise the energy conserving capabilities of the plasma membrane.</p><p>The above mechanism represents a breakthrough in our understanding of protein export through the ubiquitous Sec complex. It also resembles a suggested mechanism for the eukaryotic Sec machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Matlack et al., 1999</xref>), but with ratcheting from the cytosolic rather than the distal side of the membrane, which compensates for the absence of ATP in the periplasm. Regulated constriction of the channel, therefore, may offer a unifying concept for protein transport more generally, <italic>e.g.</italic> in mitochondrial and chloroplast protein import. Furthermore, two-way communication between the ATPase NBS and the polymer binding site over distances ranging from 2 to 15 nm has been observed for several molecular motors such as RecA-like helicases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mancini et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kainov et al., 2008</xref>) and AAA+ dynein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kon et al., 2009</xref>).

Membranes expressing SecY<sub>LG</sub>EG, prepared as for wild-type, were oxidised with 1 mM copper phenanthroline prior to solubilisation in 1% n-Dodecyl β-D-Maltopyranoside (DDM). The samples were subjected to overnight batch-binding with Activated Thiol Sepharose 4B (GE Healthcare, U.K.), followed by centrifugation to remove uncross-linked protein. They were then treated by gel filtration as per the wild-type preparation.</p><p>SecA<sup>G793C</sup>, SecA<sup>Q644C</sup> andSecA<sup>R20C</sup> were prepared as for wild-type. Peptides (AGCGA, AFCFA or AWCWA) were purchased from Cambridge Research Biochemicals, all N-terminally acetylated and C-terminally amidated. Cross-linking was performed by incubating each single cysteine variant with a 20-fold excess of peptide and 10 mM oxidised glutathione for 1 hr on ice. Excess free peptide was removed by gel filtration (Superdex-200). The efficacy of this method was confirmed for the AWCWA peptide using reverse-phase HPLC (0–50% acetonitrile in 0.1% TFA) on an XBridge BEH300 C4 column (Waters, U.K.), following absorbance at 280 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>PLs of <italic>E. coli</italic> polar lipid containing SecYEG were produced as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>ATPase and translocation assays</title><p>ATPase activities were determined as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gold et al., 2007</xref>). In brief, ATP consumption was coupled to NADH depletion using a pyruvate kinase/lactate dehydrogenase regenerating system in the presence of excess phosphoenol pyruvate, and the absorbance at 340 nm followed. Rates were determined by fitting to a straight line, and the slopes (in ∆A<sub>340</sub>.min−<sup>1</sup>) divided by the concentration of SecA and the molar extinction coefficient of NADH (6,220 M−<sup>1</sup> at 340 nm) to give (M ATP).(M SecA)−<sup>1</sup>.min−<sup>1</sup>.

Measurements were performed in TKM buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 50 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>), starting with 50 nM SecY**EG, then adding sequentially 1 µM nucleotide-stripped SecA, 1 mM AMPPNP, ADP or ATP, and 0.7 µM pOA. At least 5 mins were left after each addition before measuring, and each spectrum was repeated three times to confirm that a steady state was reached. Data were corrected for dilution before plotting.</p><p>FRET measurements for SecY**EG in DDM were performed in TSG buffer (20 mM Tris pH 7.5, 130 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol) with 0.02% DDM and 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> on a Nanodrop 3300 Fluorospectrometer (Thermo Scientific, Waltham MA, ). 100 nM DDM-solubilised SecY**EG was measured alone, with 1 µM SecA, with SecA and 1 mM ADP, or with SecA and 1 mM AMPPNP. After excitation with blue light, fluorescence signals at 519 nm (donor; F<sub>D</sub>) and 617 nm (acceptor; F<sub>A</sub>) were measured, and FRET efficiencies calculated as F<sub>A</sub> / (F<sub>D</sub> + F<sub>A</sub>). For each data point, three repeats were taken and the average FRET efficiency used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Affinity assays</title><p>Affinity assays employing SecY**EG were performed by mixing 50 nM SecY**EG PLs with 500 µM ADP or AMPPNP in TKM buffer with varying amounts of SecA.

AMPPNP affinity assays were carried out by mixing varying concentrations of AMPPNP with pre-equilibrated 100 nM SecA and 500 nM SecYEG in the same buffer. DTT was either omitted or included at 100 mM; note that DTT has no effect on the interaction of SecA with wild-type SecYEG. Single channel fluorescence readings were taken at 522 nm and FRET readings at 519 nm and 617 nm, using a Nanodrop 3300 Fluorospectrometer with blue light excitation.

PLs were immobilised on a glass supported lipid bilayer and imaged with a TIRF microscope as described previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The buffer used was TKM with 1 mM 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (TROLOX) and 71 mM β-mercaptoethanol as oxygen scavenging agents to extend florescent dye lifetimes. Immobilised samples were treated with 40 nM SecA and 1 mM ADP, 1 mM AMPPNP or 1 mM ATP and the ATP regeneration system used for ATPase assays, with or without 200 nM pOA. For the high SecA/high pOA sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), 1 µM SecA and 700 nM pOA were used with 1 mM ATP and the ATP regeneration system. TIRF movies (200 ms frame rate) were taken from samples between 15 and 45 min after the addition of substrate.</p><p>The data processing flow is outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>. The two channels of each image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>) were aligned and fluorescence count traces (donor and acceptor) were extracted as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharma et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Since the system is essentially at equilibrium and the signals remain stationary we used the consecutive acceptor (first) and donor (second) single-step photobleaching events to identify complexes with exactly a single donor and single acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Only traces which exhibit an anti-correlated rise in donor signal upon acceptor photobleaching, a signature of single molecule FRET, are included in the analysis.</p><p>While this method discards FRET traces in which the donor photobleaches first, it eliminates the possibility of selecting traces with an ill-defined number of acceptor dyes in each immobilized PL. As the method provides access to the donor signal with acceptor present (before acceptor photobleaching) and absent (after acceptor photobleaching), it is a valid way to compute FRET efficiencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lakowicz, 2013</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This method has the additional advantage that it does not need signal corrections for quantum yield changes or channel sensitivity. Note that while the acceptor signal is not directly used to calculate FRET efficiency its changes are employed to identify the smFRET traces and the relevant regions of the donor signal for data analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>The experiments were repeated three times using independent PL preparations, then FRET values were collated as histograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) and the three repeat histograms were averaged bin by bin to produce the final histogram with standard error for each bin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–G</xref>).</p><p>Singular value decomposition (SVD) of histograms for different conditions indicated than minimum of three components were necessary to describe the ATP data within experimental error (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

Using global fitting, the resulting amplitudes of the Gaussian peaks for the three independent repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) were subjected to ANOVA yielding mean amplitude and standard errors (SEM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p><p>To measure dye anisotropy, 100 nM reconstituted SecY**EG was incubated for 5 min at 25°C alone or with 1 µM SecA and 1 mM ADP, AMPPNP or 1 mM ATP with the ATP regenerating system and 700 nM pOA. A Florolog (Horiba Jobin Yvon) was use to collect emission spectra for dye anisotropy. The samples were either excited at 492 nm and 510–650 nm emission was detected or excited at 590 nm and 610–700 nm emission recorded (increment 2 nm, integration time 1 s, slits 5 nm). Sensitivity correction (G factor) was determined using excitation polarisation parallel to emission propagation direction.

In the case of PLs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), this is likely a complication caused by the presence of lipids. For ease of comparison, we simply normalised the plots to give a total amplitude of 1 and rather than attempting to extract potentially spurious individual rates, we simply estimated the time taken to reach 50% completion (t<sub>1/2</sub>). For SecY<sub>x</sub>EG-SecA<sub>2HF</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), we reasoned that SecY<sub>x</sub>EG-SecA<sub>2HF</sub> is inevitably contaminated with some free SecA<sup>A795C </sup>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whitehouse et al., 2012</xref>), so the populations most likely correspond to a mix of SecY<sub>x</sub>EG-SecA<sub>2HF</sub> and SecA<sup>A795C</sup>.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Two-way communication between SecY and SecA suggests a Brownian ratchet mechanism for protein translocation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Yibing Shan (peer reviewer).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Allen et al. have presented a combined computational and experimental analysis of protein translocation through the SecY-SecA translocation apparatus. The conclusion is that an interplay between pre-protein, nucleotide state of the SecA ATPase, and conformation of the SecY channel act to bias the directionality of pre-protein diffusion toward the periplasm. In this model, the bias arises from the fact that pre-protein bulkiness is preferentially detected (and subsequently relieved) at the cytosolic side of the channel. The key elements of this model are four-fold. First, MD simulations, bulk FRET, and single-molecule FRET studies suggest that widening of the lateral gate, and hence the pore diameter, of the SecY channel is favored by the ATP state of SecA. Second, a narrow SecY lateral gate enforced by a disulfide bridge can communicate to SecA to slow ADP release (and hence ATP binding). Third, steered MD simulations suggest that bulky peptides have more trouble crossing a narrow SecY pore than less bulky peptides. Fourth, bulky peptides crosslinked to the SecA two-helix finger at the cytosolic opening of the SecY channel communicate to hasten ADP release. When combined with earlier observations, this leads to a model where non-bulky stretches of peptide can move through the narrow SecY, bulky residues on the periplasmic side cannot backslide effectively through the channel, while bulky residues near the cytosolic side trigger channel widening to permit their diffusion through the channel.</p><p>The referees all agreed that the study is original, of high technical quality, and an important contribution to this field. The most salient referee comments are provided below. During the discussion leading from these comments, the following two points were felt to be essential in preparing a revised manuscript. The other referee comments are less central, but should be addressed with revisions to the text as necessary.</p><p>1) The interpretation of the experiment crosslinking peptides to the two-helix finger should be more cautious at this stage. It was felt that with the currently available data, the conclusion that bulky residues are 'sensed' by the two-helix finger was premature. Unless a strong justification can be provided, it is probably safer to conclude that positioning bulky peptides in the cytosolic vestibule of SecY stimulates ADP dissociation by a yet undermined mechanism. One can certainly present ideas in the Discussion about possible mechanisms, including sensing by the two-helix finger, but this should be clearly indicated as speculation.</p><p>2) Referee 3 raises an important point about the speed of conformational changes observed (on the nanosecond scale) relative to expectation from other systems. As this might imply the (interesting) possibility that the starting structure could represent a transition state, the referee recommends performing some additional relatively short (microsecond scale, or shorter – long enough to see the conformational transitions) simulations. In particular, this would involve verifying the result with a different force field, and additional simulations with the apo state. It is strongly recommended that this issue be addressed if at all possible.</p><p>In addition to these two issues, please note that two of the three referees also recommended a more complete discussion of the relationship of the new model to earlier model(s). This would seem important to add to the Discussion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Overall, I thought the paper presented a nice analysis that was clearly described, and provides a new and plausible mechanism for translocation. The topic is certainly of wide interest, and it is likely to stimulate further analysis in this field and may cause analogous processes in other ATP-driven systems to be re-considered. Thus, I generally support publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, pending the addressing of a few queries:</p><p>1) I feel the Discussion needs a more thorough comparison of the new model with the earlier &quot;pushing&quot; model to better explain to the reader why they favor a ratchet. In particular, the somewhat superficial resemblance of the idea that also placed a key emphasis on bulky residues (in that case, as the point of pushing) will leave readers wondering whether the earlier observations can now be reconciled into the new model. It is also worth discussing whether there was really any strong evidence for pushing per se (i.e., conformational changes that markedly move the 2HF) and whether such movement is needed in the new model.</p><p>2) The part of the argument that was least convincing to me was the sensing of bulky residues by the 2-helix finger. The authors directly crosslinked peptide to it, which seemed to me not a good way of determining if it is 'sensing' peptide since the putative 'sensor' is now perturbed. Would it not be better to choose a nearby site (and one further away as a negative control) to crosslink the peptides? This way, one can see if the 2HF is really able to detect peptides in its proximity. Alternatively, perhaps some other nearby region of SecA (or SecY) is doing the actual sensing. Or perhaps the authors are imagining a scenario where the extra space occupied by the bulkier peptide forces the 2HF into a different position. Either way, I can't quite see how crosslinking peptide to the 2HF is mimicking preprotein bulkiness, and a better explanation of what the authors think is going on here (and any alternatives that remain to be tested) is warranted.</p><p>3) In the model (i.e., the movie), the signal peptide is shown to remain translocon-bound until after translocation is complete. Is there evidence for this or is this just speculation? It is not an entirely trivial point because the new SecA-SecY structure with a putative signal peptide (Li et al., Nature, 2016) suggests that the signal binds between helices 2 and 7. Thus, if it stays there, the SecY might not be able to close in the ADP state (although probably beyond the scope of this paper, an MD simulation with the signal bound at this site would certainly be interesting). Some discussion of this new work and how it might relate to the model is warranted. If a bound signal essentially prevents lateral gate closing, it would seem that a key part of the model would need to be revised.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The data presented in this manuscript is of a very high quality. The authors provide compelling evidence that the nucleotide-binding state SecA influences the conformation in SecYEG and that binding to ATP appears to promote an &quot;open&quot; conformation of SecYEG. The evidence suggesting that the presence of nascent substrate proteins in the channel influences the rate of nucleotide exchange by SecA is similarly convincing. The authors also suggest that the 2HF of SecA senses the presence of a preprotein in the channel and that this can be transmitted back to the nucleotide binding site. The interaction of preproteins with the 2HF is required for translocation, and the 2HF has therefore been implicated in physically pushing preproteins through SecYEG. Although it isn't clear from the data that the 2HF is the <italic>only</italic> feature of SecA that senses the presence of preprotein, the evidence clearly suggests that the 2HF is involved in sensing the presence of preprotein.</p><p>The Brownian-ratchet-type model proposed by the authors is consistent with the experimental data and could potentially provide an explanation for some of the inconsistencies with more deterministic models for SecA-driven translocation. Regardless of whether SecA-driven translocation is deterministic or stochastic, the experiments provide important insight into the mechanism of SecA-driven translocation. I feel that the manuscript merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. I have only a few comments. However, I do not feel any additional experiments are required for publication.</p><p>1) The stochastic model proposed by the authors is interesting, consistent with the data presented and potentially resolves a number of inconsistencies with previously proposed models. However, it isn't clear why the data presented in this paper is inconsistent with more deterministic models. For example, is it possible that this data is consistent with a variation of the &quot;push-and-slide&quot; model proposed by Bauer et al?</p><p>2) The authors do not deal consistently with the issue of back-sliding in the discussion of their Brownian-ratchet model. For example, in the second paragraph of the Discussion, the authors state, &quot;Back diffusion is prevented because blocks at the exit do not trigger nucleotide exchange.&quot; This (rather obscure) statement appears to contradict a later suggestion in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion that a second (?) clamping mechanism by SecA could prevent backsliding.</p><p>3) In the second paragraph of the Discussion the authors suggest that binding of the signal sequence to SecYEG (or potentially partitioning of the signal sequence into the cytoplasmic membrane) ensures directionality. This insurance would require that the signal sequence be cleaved after the completion of translocation. However, multiple lines of evidence (e.g. Randall and colleagues. Cell 25:151) suggest that the signal sequence is cleaved off during the process of translocation. Wouldn't this make translocation reversible in their model?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Regarding the molecular dynamics simulations of this study, I think an important opportunity would be missed if the investigators do not look into the simulation data deeper and try to understand--in atomic details the simulations afford – the differential local effects ADP- and ATP-binding give rise to and the allosteric mechanism propagating the effects to the pore. A basic biophysical understanding and the conformational changes in the nucleotide binding sites, presumably involving key conserved residues, should be discussed. (Potentially relevant, there are two analogous papers that show two distinct states ensues ADP-/ATP-binding of a protein kinase [Shan et al., PNAS, 2009; Foda et al., Nature Comm, 2015]).</p><p>Separately, I am concerned of the fastness of the pore closing/opening following placing ADP/ATP in the nucleotide binding site (~20 nanosecond). This is unusually, almost suspiciously fast, considering that typically such conformational changes occur at micro- to millisecond timescale and, because in SEC the information originating for the binding site has to travel nanometers to the pore, I would expect this to take significantly more than several microseconds. It is possible that the crystal structure by serendipity is positioned at a high-energy (possibly even the transition state, which would be very interesting and informative). If so, no barrier-crossing is required, which would be consistent with the nanosecond timescale observed. This should be further examined. Would we qualitatively see the same effect if a different force field (Amber or Charmm) is used? What happens if the nucleotide binding site is unoccupied in the simulations? (The new simulations do not need to run to 1 microsecond each if the conformational change occurs in 10s of nanoseconds).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The interpretation of the experiment crosslinking peptides to the two-helix finger should be more cautious at this stage.

We have amended our Results and Discussion to make this clearer. Note that we have included additional data that further supports the 2HF-sensor concept (see below).</p><p><italic>2) Referee 3 raises an important point about the speed of conformational changes observed (on the nanosecond scale) relative to expectation from other systems.

It is strongly recommended that this issue be addressed if at all possible.</italic></p><p>Nanosecond timescale conformational changes across the distances observed here (&gt;5 nm) are indeed unusual. The referee is probably correct that the input structure represents a high energy intermediate on the ATPase cycle. As stated in the manuscript (now clarified further), ADP-BeF<sub>x</sub> has previously been reported as producing transition state-like intermediates. We believe this is what has happened here. Indeed, in previous work, we have shown that when solution hydrogen deuterium exchange experiments are performed (by mass spec), the results more closely resemble those of MD-relaxed structures than the original crystal coordinates (Radou et al. 2014). However, this does not prohibit same starting structure from sampling different conformations, depending on which nucleotide is bound.</p><p>With this in mind, the rapid relaxation to the lower energy ADP-bound state (with no energy barrier to cross) is unsurprising. This observation is supported by simulation data collected where the system was run with ATP present, which was then ‘hydrolysed’ to ADP. In this case, significant channel closing was not seen within 100 ns of simulation data (data not included), implying the actual speed of conformational changes is slower.</p><p>We have set up and run simulations in apo conditions, as per the referee’s suggestion (two repeats, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>). These show a rapid closing of the LG, but to a lesser degree than for ADP.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.15598.025</object-id><label>Author Response Image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.15598.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.15598.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-15598-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig></p><p>This supports the idea that the input structure is not at an energy minimum. However, the exact conformational change is unlikely to have direct physiological relevance: the apo state is transient and would not normally follow the ATP-bound state. As such, we prefer not to include this data in the paper itself.</p><p>To further address the referee’s concerns, and provide evidence that the conformational changes are not simply due to force field bias, we have carried out additional simulations using the Amber ff99SB-ILDN force field with a Lipid14 POPC membrane. The results of this work are similar to those obtained using OPLS-AA, and are shown in a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>In addition to these two issues, please note that two of the three referees also recommended a more complete discussion of the relationship of the new model to earlier model(s).

However, this is not necessarily evidence of pushing: the data can also be explained by the higher affinity of SecA for SecYEG when AMPPNP is bound. In our opinion, therefore, there is no direct evidence for a pushing role of the 2HF.</p><p>The model we present does not require any such conformational change. Indeed, we think this is one of its strengths: crosslinking the 2HF into the SecY channel does not prevent translocation, contrary to its proposed action as a piston (see (Whitehouse et al. 2012)).</p><p>We have amended the Discussion to reflect this point.</p><p><italic>2) The part of the argument that was least convincing to me was the sensing of bulky residues by the 2-helix finger.

In addition, we crosslinked the bulky (AWCWA) peptide to a position distant from the channel and observed no effect on ADP release. These results have been incorporated into the paper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2C</xref>), and the three crosslinking positions have been mapped onto the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>We have also added more detail of what we think is happening, and reworded to make clear what is shown experimentally and what is speculation.</p><p><italic>3) In the model (i.e., the movie), the signal peptide is shown to remain translocon-bound until after translocation is complete.

We have added reference to this to the Discussion.</p><p>The conformation of the channel in the Li et al. resembles our 'part open' conformation, with a narrow polypeptide in the channel (although no 2HF). As passage of a wider substrate would probably require further opening, this seems to support the model. We have extended the Discussion to incorporate this new information.</p><p>MD with substrate is indeed beyond the scope of this paper.
