During <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis, a niche regulates prohemocytes to control hemocyte production. Immune challenges activate cell-signalling to initiate the cellular and innate immune response. Specifically, certain immune challenges stimulate the niche to produce signals that induce prohemocyte differentiation. However, the mechanisms that promote prohemocyte differentiation subsequent to immune challenges are poorly understood. Here we show that bacterial infection induces the cellular immune response by modulating occluding-junctions at the hematopoietic niche. Occluding-junctions form a permeability barrier that regulates the accessibility of prohemocytes to niche derived signals. The immune response triggered by infection causes barrier breakdown, altering the prohemocyte microenvironment to induce immune cell production. Moreover, genetically induced barrier ablation provides protection against infection by activating the immune response. Our results reveal a novel role for occluding-junctions in regulating niche-hematopoietic progenitor signalling and link this mechanism to immune cell production following infection.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>occluding junctions</kwd><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd><kwd>infection</kwd><kwd>permeability barrier</kwd><kwd>prohemocytes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.T.-MOP-272122</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tanentzapf</surname><given-names>Guy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Occluding-junctions form a permeability barrier around the hematopoietic niche in Drosophila that controls the production of immune cells in response to infection by shaping the signalling micro-environment produced by the niche.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Stem cells are essential for animal development and allow the maintenance and regeneration of tissues. Stem cell fate and behavior is often governed by signals derived from their local microenvironment, also known as the stem cell niche (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jones and Wagers, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Morrison and Spradling, 2008</xref>). When stem cells divide the daughter cells can either self-renew to replenish the stem cell population or differentiate to give rise to a particular cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuchs and Chen, 2013</xref>). Stem cell differentiation and self-renewal are tightly regulated as producing too many stem cells can result in tumor formation while producing too many differentiated cells depletes the stem cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">He et al., 2009</xref>). Exploring how a niche regulates its resident stem cells is a major topic in stem cell biology. An important biological process where stem cell-niche interactions play a key regulatory role is the process of hematopoiesis, the production of new blood cells from hematopoietic progenitor cells, known as prohemocytes in <italic>Drosophila. Drosophila</italic> hematopoiesis produces blood cells, called hemocytes, that have specialized and essential functions in mediating fly immunity.</p><p>There are two waves of hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the first of which occurs in the embryo. While embryonic hemocytes persist into later stages, a second wave of hematopoiesis takes place in a specialized organ called the Lymph Gland (LG) in larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hartenstein, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Holz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stofanko et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Makhijani et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zaidman-Rémy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leitão and Sucena, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Vlisidou and Wood, 2015</xref>). The LG consists of the primary lymph gland lobe and a series of posterior lobes (secondary lymph gland lobes). The primary lobe serves as the main site of hematopoiesis in larvae while the functional importance of the posterior lobes is currently not well defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalamarz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>). The prohemocytes in the posterior lobes tend to be more proliferative but, similar to the primary lobe prohemocytes, express markers like DE-cadherin and JAK/STAT receptor, Domeless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2005</xref>). As the main site of larval hematopoiesis the primary lobe has been the subject of intense study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kulkarni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khadilkar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tokusumi et al., 2015</xref>). The primary lobe is organized into three regions: at the posterior end is a well-defined hematopoietic niche (also known as PSC or Posterior Signalling Centre). This niche is connected to the Medullary Zone (MZ), which houses the prohemocytes, while the differentiated hemocytes are found in the Cortical Zone (CZ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Prohemocytes can differentiate into three blood cell types: plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2005</xref>), which perform the immune functions of phagocytosis, melanization, and encapsulation, respectively.

The signalling environment in the lymph gland is highly complex, with multiple pathways acting simultaneously to regulate hematopoiesis including Wingless, Hedgehog, JAK/STAT, Dpp and Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dey et al., 2016</xref>). Mutations that perturb these signalling pathways result in severe disruptions to hematopoiesis including loss of the prohemocytes or hematopoietic malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crozatier and Vincent, 2011</xref>). Most of what is known about cell signaling in the LG is derived from work on the primary lobes, where cell-signaling pathways have been extensively characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kulkarni et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khadilkar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Milton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tokusumi et al., 2015</xref>). However, there is also some evidence that perturbation of the signals that regulate prohemocyte behavior in the primary lobe also affect hemocyte differentiation in the secondary lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benmimoun et al., 2015</xref>). The PSC in the primary lobe of the LG is known to be the source of a number of cell signalling ligands including Dpp, Hedgehog and Wingless which are all required for prohemocyte maintenance or for regulating blood cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). Addional signalling molecules, such as Pvr, STAT and ADGF-A are known to act outside of the PSC to regulate prohemocyte maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mondal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khadilkar et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, ongoing communication between the PSC, the prohemocytes, and differentiating hemocytes is key for maintaining homeostasis in the LG and also for facilitating the ability of prohemocytes to rapidly respond to inductive cues to undergo differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mondal et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crozatier and Vincent, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Khadilkar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mondal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Increased production of differentiated hemocytes is one of the main ways by which flies could possibly respond to infection as in the case of wasp infestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>). There are two arms of the immune response in flies: the humoral arm and the cellular arm. The humoral immune response is largely based on the production of antimicrobial peptides (AMP) while the cellular arm is largely mounted by the hemocytes. Different signalling pathways are activated following immune challenges in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: The Toll and Imd pathways are induced following infection by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ferrandon et al., 2007</xref>), and the EGFR pathway is induced following wasp infestation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>). Wasp infestation is presently the only known immune challenge that affects LG function, since following infestation the PSC induces prohemocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ferguson and Martinez-Agosto, 2014</xref>). It has been shown that the Toll pathway is active in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Qiu et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiu et al., 2005</xref>), specifically, the PSC responds to wasp infestation by activating the Toll-NFκB signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gueguen et al., 2013</xref>). However, presently, whether the LG is involved in mounting the immune response following bacterial infection is a major unresolved question. Nonetheless, the ability of the LG to induce hemocyte differentiation in response to infection is likely to be tied to carefully orchestrated changes in the signalling microenvironment produced by the PSC.</p><p>The mechanisms by which prohemocytes are primed towards differentiation and how the cellular immune response becomes activated following infection are not well understood. Stem cell-niche interactions have been shown in multiple systems to be regulated by cell junctions, such as cadherin-based adherens junctions and integrin-based Cell-ECM adhesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tanentzapf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellis and Tanentzapf, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>). Recent evidence has linked occluding junctions, such as vertebrate tight junctions or their invertebrate counterparts Septate Junctions (SJs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2016</xref>), in regulating stem cell-niche interactions. Occluding junctions, serve an essential function in animals by creating permeability barriers that generate different compartment inside and/or in between tissues. For example, in the fly testes an occluding-junction based permeability barrier has a crucial role in regulating stem cell differentiation by enclosing the differentiating germline in an isolated compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). In this system, SJs block external signals from reaching the germline and thus restrict the range of niche-derived stem cell maintenance cues. In the absence of SJs the range of niche-derived stem cell maintenance cues is greatly extended (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, SJ mediated regulation of the signalling microenvironment at the niche can control niche size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, occluding junctions have been implicated in the control of intestinal stem cells in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Resnik-Docampo et al., 2017</xref>). This raises the question whether occluding junctions might also have a function in regulating prohemocytes in the LG.</p><p>Here we demonstrate that SJs play an essential role in regulating hematopoiesis in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lymph gland. Using a novel dye-based assay we identify a previously uncharacterized permeability barrier separating the PSC from the prohemocytes. This permeability barrier disintegrates following bacterial infection and there is a corresponding change in the signalling microenvironment generated by the PSC. As a result of the change in the PSC-produced microenvironment the differentiation of prohemocytes into immune cells is increased. Importantly, genetic ablation of the permeability barrier around the PSC is sufficient to activate the cellular immune response and provides long-lasting protection against bacterial infection. These results provide new insight into how the PSC responds to bacterial infection in order to initiate the cellular immune response.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Septate junctions form a permeability barrier at the PSC in the lymph gland</title><p>We recently described the development of a non-invasive dye-based assay to show that the stem cell niche in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes was enclosed within a permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). To determine if the LG contained a similar permeability barrier around the PSC we adapted this assay. Dissected LGs were kept in culture and incubated with fluorescently-conjugated dextrans of various sizes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>). The ability of the dye to access the surface of cells in the LG was assessed and quantified. We found that, in wild-type flies, 10 kDa and 40 kDa dextran freely labeled the surface of all cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a–d’’, f–f’</xref>) but that 70 kDa dextran was effectively excluded from PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a’–a’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1e–e’’,f’’</xref>). This indicated that a permeability barrier was present at the niche and that the size at which the movement of molecules became restricted was between 40 kDa and 70 kDa. To better, quantitatively, assess permeability barrier function in the LG we further developed this approach. In this enhanced version of the assay, called Dual Dye Assay (DDA), green 70 kDa and red 40 kDa dyes were used simultaneously (see materials and methods). The use of the smaller, non-excluded dye, provides an internal control for changes in the tissue and allows numerical measurement of dye co-localization to assess barrier function. RNAi-mediated knockdown of the essential SJ components Coracle (<italic>cora</italic>) and NeurexinIV (<italic>NrxIV</italic>) in the PSC abolished this permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b–d’’</xref>). Depletion of Cora or NrxIV in the PSC followed by DDA analysis showed an increase in the Pearson’s co-localization coefficient of the 70 kDa and 40 kDa dyes in PSC consistent with failure to exclude the larger, 70 kDa dextran conjugated dye, compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–e’</xref>). This effect was specific for the PSC as the ability of the dye to label other regions of the LG were not affected by knockdown of Cora and NrxIV in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e–e’</xref>). Consistent with the role of Cora and NrxIV in maintaining a permeability barrier in the niche both proteins were enriched in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f–j’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2f–f’’</xref>). In addition to this, we also found that ATPα and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> claudins, Sinuous and Kune-kune that are required for pleated septate junction organization and function show high levels of expression in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2g–l’</xref>). Moreover, EM analysis revealed the presence of extensive pleated SJs throughout the LG that were especially prominent between cells in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k–k’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–c,f</xref>). Since PSC cells do not exhibit the conspicuous polarity of epithelial cells it seems that septate junctions are not localized to a particular domain. Instead our data suggests that in the PSC cells septate junctions are found in multiple sites, corresponding to contact sites with neighboring PSC cells, and form extensive large plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1k–k’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a–c,f</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Loss of Septate Junctions in the PSC results in increased prohemocyte differentiation and a higher number of cells in the PSC</title><p>Next, we asked whether and how loss of the permeability barrier impacted the morphology of the LG or the behavior of the prohemocytes. To allay concerns about specificity of expression of the PSC driver (<italic>collier-Gal4</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>) as well as off-target effects of the transgenic RNAi lines used for depleting Cora and NrxIV, additional transgenic RNAi lines and PSC drivers (<italic>Antp-Gal4</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mandal et al., 2007</xref>; <italic>Ser9.6-Gal4</italic>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bachmann and Knust, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lebestky et al., 2003</xref>) were used to confirm our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a–n’’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4a–p</xref>). The efficiency of the knockdown was validated by analyzing the expression of Cora protein subsequent to knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1h–i’’</xref>). Knockdown of Cora or NrxIV resulted in loss of the permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Consistent with this, electron micrographs of the PSC region showed that septate junctions were absent following PSC- specific knockdown of SJ components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2d–e</xref>). Moreover, two additional defects were observed: First, the average number of cells in the PSC was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a’</xref>’-c’’’,g’,h-j’,n and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d–f’,n</xref>). Second, we observed increased differentiation of the prohemocytes into both the plasmatocyte and crystal cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e–f’, l–m’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a–a’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3d–f’’’, g’’–g’’’, h’’–m’, n’, n’’</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4g–l’,o,p</xref>). To analyze the differentiation of prohemocytes into plasmatocyte and crystal cell lineage quantitatively, we calculated a differentiation index, as reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>), by determining the ratio of differentiated hemocytes to the total number of cells in the primary lobe of the LG. Using this approach we observed that the differentiation indices for crystal cells and plasmatocytes were between 5–10 times higher upon knockdown of Cora or NrxIV in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2s,t</xref>).Moreover, we confirmed that none of the lines used for our experiments or as controls contained a mutation in the NimC1 antigen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Honti et al., 2013</xref>) which would have confounded our observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1j–l’</xref>).We also used an additional marker for plasmatocytes, Eater-dsRed, to confirm that this result was due to prohemocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tokusumi et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1m–n’’</xref>). To see if increased hemocyte differentiation resulted in depletion of the prohemocyte population we used the prohemocyte marker Dome-MESO following PSC- specific SJ knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5a–f</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hombría et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tokusumi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Oyallon et al., 2016</xref>). We found that following SJ knockdown in the PSC, there was an increase in the total number of cells in the primary lobe as well an increase in the number of differentiated hemocytes but a marked decrease in the number of prohemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5a–f</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2i’’’</xref>). Importantly, even a partial reduction in the levels of SJ components resulted in increased differentiation of prohemocytes. Specifically, a significantly higher differentiation index for plasmatocytes and crystal cells were seen in flies heterozygous for hypomorphic mutations in Cora, NrxIV and other components of SJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2g–i,n–p,s,t</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b–f’’’</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28081.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The septate junction-mediated permeability barrier is essential for PSC integrity and function.</title><p>(<bold>a–d</bold>) PSC (red and green) in wild-type, Cora or NrxIV knockdown LGs, (<bold>d</bold>) quantification of PSC cell numbers.

Nevertheless, since all the PSC drivers used are also expressed in tissues other than the LG, we cannot fully discount the possibility that effects, mediated outside of the PSC, are also contributing to the phenotypes we observe.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Over-expression of septate junction components in the PSC affects lymph gland hematopoiesis</title><p>Since we see a correlation between depletion of the SJ-mediated permeability barrier at the PSC and defects in hematopoiesis we hypothesized that over-expression of septate junction components might affect hematopoiesis. <italic>collier-gal4</italic> was used to express <italic>UAS-cora</italic> and <italic>UAS-NrxIV</italic> transgenes and overexpression was confirmed using Myc specific antibody to stain the Myc-tagged Cora or NrxIV over-expression lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a–c’</xref>).

Therefore one possible functional consequence of disruption of the permeability barrier at the PSC, which leads to prohemocyte differentiation, is enhanced protection against infection. Consistent with this, knockdown of SJ components in the PSC conferred a survival advantage to flies infected with either <italic>B. subtilis</italic> or <italic>E. coli</italic> using either a feeding or a systemic infection model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4q–r’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1s,t</xref>). Moreover, larval infections, that disrupt the permeability barrier, confer a long-term advantage that improves the ability of adult flies to survive bacterial infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1i</xref>). We investigated how depletion of SJ components contributes to this survival advantage and found it likely resulted from activation of the cellular arm rather than the humoral arm of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response. To assay the humoral immune response, we tracked the expression of markers for an antimicrobial peptide (AMP) response in the fat body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–l’</xref>). In wild-type controls AMP reporters were only detected following infection; importantly, depletion of SJ components did not induce the endogenous activation of AMP reporters in uninfected controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–l’</xref>). Intriguingly, over-expressing SJ components in the PSC did not compromise the ability of flies to survive bacterial infection suggesting that other immune mechanisms may take over in such a scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2j</xref>). To assay for activation of the cellular arm we counted the number of circulating hemocytes in early pupal stages 12 hr after puparium formation (APF), shortly after the LG bursts open to release its hemocytes into circulation. Counts were done using two approaches: by incision in the pupal integument and by a whole pupal scraping assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petraki et al., 2015</xref>). Depletion of SJ components in the PSC caused a significant increase in the number of plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and Ad1 positive hemocytes compared to controls whereas lamellocyte counts were not affected (marked with P1 or Eater-dsRed for plasmatocytes, C5 or BcF6GFP or BcF6mcherry for crystal cells, L1 for lamellocytes and Ad1 was used for specifically labeling adult hemocytes (and not embryonic/larval ones), respectively: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–f,g–i’</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Honti et al., 2014</xref>).

The Toll and Imd pathways initiate the immune response in <italic>Drosophila</italic> following infection by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Gregorio et al., 2002</xref>). Intriguingly, Toll as well as the Imd pathway component Relish were both detected in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1a–f’’</xref>). Interestingly, an earlier study has shown that the PSC responds to wasp infestation by activating the Toll-NFκB signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gueguen et al., 2013</xref>). In order to investigate the possible role of the Toll and Imd pathways in SJ depletion following infection both pathways were ectopically activated in three different ways: in the PSC, in the gut to mimic systemic activation, or ubiquitously throughout the animal. The Toll pathway was activated by expression of a constitutively active Toll transgene, while the Imd pathway was activated by reducing the expression of either of the two Imd inhibitors <italic>Pirk</italic> or <italic>dRYBP</italic>. Activating either the Toll or Imd pathway in the PSC, systemically, or ubiquitously caused loss of the permeability barrier (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–f,j</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2a–c’</xref>). Consistent with this, localized activation of the Toll pathway in the PSC resulted in the down-regulation of Coracle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1g–h’’</xref>). Moreover, activating the Toll and Imd pathways caused the prohemocytes to differentiate into plasmatocytes and crystal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7g–i’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2d–k</xref>). This data is consistent with previous results showing that expressing activated Toll in the larval fat body induces hemocyte differentiation in the LG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Schmid et al., 2014</xref>). Strikingly, we found that compromising the permeability barrier using mutations in SJ components was able to partially rescue dominant loss-of-function Toll and Imd pathway mutants.

We envisioned two possible mechanisms whereby a permeability barrier in the LG can shape the PSC signalling microenvironment. The first possible mechanism is by limiting the diffusion of niche-derived signals so that they do not reach the prohemocytes in sufficient concentration. Data consistent with such a mechanism is derived from experiments looking at Dpp signalling, which is primarily active in, and regulates the size of the PSC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). The transgenic Dpp reporter <italic>Dad-GFP</italic> revealed that the range of BMP (Bone morphogenetic protein) signals was extended further from the PSC following depletion of SJ components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9i–k’’</xref>). The second possible mechanism is concentrating signals locally, at or near the PSC, by limiting the ability of signals to diffuse freely. For example, in such a model, occluding junctions could facilitate the build-up of high concentrations of signaling molecules inside the barrier. Data consistent with such a mechanism is derived from experiments looking at Wingless signalling. Specifically, the levels of the Wg ligand at the PSC were reduced by depletion of SJ components in the PSC but increased by overexpression of SJ components in the PSC as compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9h</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1m–p’’</xref>). Upon depletion of SJ components Wg levels were observed to be lower throughout the LG, and not just the PSC, consistent with the reduction in number of prohemocytes which have been shown to express Wg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sinenko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1m–p’’</xref>). Also in line with this model, we find that the expression of dMyc, which is typically downregulated by BMP signals in the PSC, is elevated following SJ knockdown in the PSC suggesting a reduced level of BMP signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2d–f’,h</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). Intriguingly, elevating the levels of the Wg ligand at the PSC rescued prohemocyte differentiation phenotypes caused by Cora or NrxIV knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9a–g</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1a–l’,q</xref>). Similarly depletion of dMyc in the PSC following knockdown of SJ components rescues their PSC cell number phenotype though it does not affect plasmatocyte differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2i–l’, o,m–n’</xref>). In addition to changes in the diffusion of PSC derived signals, depletion of SJ may modify the PSC microenvironment in other ways. For example the expression of Dally like protein (Dlp) was decreased following SJ knockdown in the PSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2a–c’,g</xref>). Dlp, a heparan sulfate proteo-glycan, is highly expressed in the PSC, where it regulates BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). The observed decrease in Dlp following SJ depletion can account for some of the phenotypes we observe such as an increase in the number of PSC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a–d</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a’’–c’’’,g’,h–j’,n</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4d–f’,n</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pennetier et al., 2012</xref>). Of note, the relation between SJ components and the Wingless and BMP signaling pathways is not bi-directional since the expression of Cora is not altered by abrogation of either pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3a–d</xref>).

Specifically, our data suggests that increased differentiation of immune cells post-infection is mediated via the breakdown of a permeability barrier around the hematopoietic niche. Loss of the permeability barrier at the niche modifies the signalling microenvironment in such a way as to drive blood progenitors towards differentiation. As a result of this sequence of events there is increased availability of hemocytes in the circulating hemolymph to fight infection. Intriguingly, we find that inducing hemocyte differentiation by breaking down the permeability barrier in larva has long lasting effects including an increase in the number of circulating hemocytes in adults, increased pathogen clearance, and substantial improvement in the ability of adult flies to fight infection. This effect is specific to the PSC as depleting SJ components in other tissues and organs did not result in any changes in the LG. Importantly, we find that breakdown of the permeability barrier is both necessary and, at least in part, sufficient for inducing the cellular arm of the immune response. Taken together, our results argue that the novel mechanism we uncovered, involving the regulation of SJ at the PSC, is an important and powerful component of the regulatory network that controls the innate immune response in flies.</p><p>Our current study focused on the role of SJ components specifically in the primary lobe of the LG. It is unclear whether SJs are also involved in regulating hematopoiesis in the posterior lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jung et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kalamarz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Letourneau et al., 2016</xref>). Currently there is a great deal more known about the regulation and function of the primary lobe of the LG, but as we learn more about the posterior lobes it will be worthwhile to investigate the possible role of SJ in the posterior lobes. By focusing on the primary lobes we were able to analyze the fate of prohemocytes following SJ depletion and observed a dramatic reduction in their number concomitant with hemocyte differentiation. These results suggest one possible function of the permeability barrier around the PSC is to assist in prohemocyte maintenance, perhaps by altering the signaling environment around the prohemocytes.</p><p>How would changes in the SJ-mediated permeability barrier around the PSC affect the signalling microenvironment? Molecules can cross tight-junction-mediated permeability barriers via two mechanisms: small (4 Å) selective pores or larger non-selective pores that may represent gaps in the barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shen et al., 2011</xref>). The 40–70 kDa exclusion size observed at the PSC is consistent with the large-pore non-selective mechanism and is larger than that seen to date for epithelia in the fly, which is in the range &lt;10 kDa, perhaps indicating the LG SJs are highly specialized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lamb et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Paul et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Genova and Fehon, 2003</xref>). Secreted signalling proteins known to regulate prohemocyte differentiation such as Wg and Dpp, are within the 40–70 kDa exclusion size range. Infection can therefore change the signalling microenvironment at the PSC by down-regulating occluding junction components allowing signals to escape the niche. Consistent with this hypothesis our analysis of Dpp and Wg signalling illustrate how changes in occluding junctions can affect the concentration of signalling molecules both inside and possibly outside the PSC. These changes in concentration can manifest in diverse ways as a permeability barrier can both concentrate signals, as appears to be the case for Wg, or alternatively restrict the range and concentration of signals, as is the case for Dpp. For example, we are able to rescue the prohemocyte differentiation defect caused by depletion of SJs by restoring Wg levels in the PSC. This rescue might be due to effects of Wg on the niche itself, as Wg is required to maintain the niche, or by restoring a steep concentration gradient of Wg that SJs help in creating. A second example is provided by dMyc, which is usually repressed in the PSC by high levels of BMP signal, is de-repressed as a result of SJ depletion and the subsequent drop in BMP levels in the PSC. Depleting dMyc in the PSC following SJ component knockdown substantially rescue the phenotype caused by loss of the permeability barrier. Alternatively, SJs can shape the signaling environment at the niche in other ways as suggested by the altered distribution of Dlp upon knockdown of SJs, a result which hints at the kind of additional, more direct, roles for occluding-junction components in mediating signal transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Matter and Balda, 2003</xref>). Full understanding of the effects mediated by modulation of occluding junctions on the PSC microenvironment will require accounting for changes in all possible signalling molecules present in the niche; this will be the focus of future studies.</p><p>The breakdown of the permeability barrier in the PSC may represent an evolutionary adaptation to infection, since pathogens are known to attack such barriers as this provides increased access to the tissues in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guttman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guttman and Finlay, 2009</xref>). Indeed, in vertebrates, activation of the immune system and interferon production are also known to cause a reduction in the expression of occluding junction components and breakdown of permeability barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Watson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Edelblum and Turner, 2009</xref>). It is tempting to speculate that as pathogens developed the ability to induce breakdown of permeability barriers animals adapted by using the degradation of such barriers as a cue to activate the cellular immune response.</p><p>As evidenced by our previous studies in the testes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fairchild et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fairchild et al., 2016</xref>), modulation of occluding junctions may represent a general feature of stem-cell niche systems. Consistent with this hypothesis, prominent expression of tight junction and/or the presence of a permeability barrier has already been described as integral to many vertebrate stem cell niche models including the adult neural stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tavazoie et al., 2008</xref>), germline stem cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Oatley and Brinster, 2012</xref>) and human hair follicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandner et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meyer-Blazejewska et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together, our work suggests that occluding junctions play a novel and important role in shaping the stem cell microenvironment to regulate stem cell maintenance and differentiation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly stocks</title><p><italic>w1118</italic> was the wild type control strain used.

This MatLab script has been uploaded as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref> along with a supporting accessory file, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode2">Source code 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="scode1">Source code 1</xref> was used for all the hemocyte quantitation analysis. We first filtered every image in the z-stack in the DAPI channel using a difference of Gaussians approach. A wide filter is used to remove background intensity, and a smaller filter is used to remove small objects. We applied each filter to the image and subtracted the result of the smaller filter from that of the wide filter, then thresholded the final image to generate a binary mask which effectively identified cell nuclei. The script then automatically identified the bright spots within the 3 dimensional image corresponding to nuclei in order to determine their numbers and centroid coordinates. To calculate differentiation index, we determined what proportion of these cells also expressed markers for differentiation. For each cell nucleus identified, we automatically measured intensity in the red channel within a search radius around the nucleus centroid. The search radius was defined as 1.5 times the average radius of nuclei. Nuclei surrounded by above threshold intensity in the red channel were considered differentiated. These numbers were then used to calculate the plasmatocyte and crystal cell differentiation indices. In addition to this, Dome-MESO lacZ reporter which is active in the medullary zone prohemocytes was used to estimate the total number of prohemocytes and the relative proportion of prohemocytes in the LG upon PSC- specific depletion of SJ components. Dome-MESO lacZ positive cells were identified using beta-Gal antibody and were counted using the MatLab script. This MatLab script was also used for estimating the circulating hemocyte counts.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Larval oral infection assay</title><p>Early third instar larvae were first kept in empty vials and starved for 2–3 hr.

They show that the loss of permeability barrier leads to PSC proliferation, hematopoietic progenitor proliferation and increased differentiated blood cells. Interestingly, permeability barrier is lost by infection, leading the authors to propose this is the mechanism of immune response to produce more blood cells upon infection. They further demonstrate that Toll and Imp pathways are responsible for the breakdown of permeability barrier and blood cell proliferation.</p><p>Control experiments are very carefully designed, and overall conclusion is quite exciting.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>This manuscript reports a novel function of occluding junctions in the hematopoetic niche in the regulation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> prohemocyte differentiation. The manuscript contains the data of great interest and proposes a novel concept not only for a role of occluding junctions in stem cell niche but also for a signalling pathway of the infection-triggered immune cell proliferation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The overall experiments are carefully performed. Additional data of the ultrastructure of septate junctions will improve the manuscript.</p><p>For general readers, overall organization of PSC and the localization of its septate junctions should be presented and explained in more detail.</p><p>Generally, septate junctions are located at cell-cell contacts of epithelial cells circumscribing each cell. Is PSC surrounded by a bag of epithelial cellular sheet with septate junctions? If not, do all cells in PSC have septate junctions? If the latter is correct, where are septate junctions localized in PSC cells? To clarify these issues, electron micrographs of PSC in low and middle magnification need to be presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. It is also important to present the ultrastructure of septate junctions in PSC by knockdown of NrxIV and Cora.</p><p>Judging from the expression of NrxIV, septate junctions in PSC seem to be pleated septate junctions, but not smooth septate junctions. To confirm this, the expressions of other pleated septate junction components ATPa, Sinu or Kune in PSC need to be confirmed.</p><p>Decreased expression of NrxIV in PSC upon bacterial infection should be presented in addition to Coracle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>This reviewer may not clearly understand the aim of the experiment in which SJ components were deleted in hemocytes outside of PSC, by using a pan hemocyte Gal4 driver (Results, fifth paragraph). Do hemocytes have septate junctions? Why did this experiment cause an increase in the number of cells differentiated from prohemocytes?</p><p>It is also difficult to understand &quot;the second possible mechanism&quot; whereby a permeability barrier in the LG can shape the PSC signalling microenvironment, based on the presented data of Wingless (Results, last paragraph).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A-F</xref>', the expression and distribution of Wg should also be presented.</p><p>Based on these data, the authors need to discuss a possible mechanism for the suppression of the prohemocyte differentiation phenotype by Wg overexpression with PSC-specific Gal4.</p><p>To know whether the regulation of septate junctions upon bacterial infection is unique in PSC or not, it would be quite interesting to see whether bacterial infection leads to reduction of septate junction components NrxIV and Cora in other organs, such as foregut, hindgut, salivary gland or perineural sheath.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>Khadilkar et al. have made some very interesting discoveries. They bring strong evidence that the regulation of the PSC permeability barrier controls the homeostasis of the larval lymph gland. They also show that bacterial infection controls the PSC permeability barrier and, thereby, lymph gland development and the cellular immune response. There is already a plethora of results, however I have several concerns and I would like to see a much revised version of this manuscript.</p><p>First, the manuscript does not read well and should be much improved. For instance, the Abstract is awkward; the Introduction is not very well documented nor precise enough; the Results section would definitely benefit from sub-headings; there are a lot of results that are not sufficiently described; the figures (and legends) are not easy to follow and the pictures often too small; finally in the Discussion, the authors do not sufficiently put their results in the context of the pathway regulating LG/blood cell differentiation.</p><p>Second, the authors claim that the increase in plasmatocyte and crystal cell is caused by precocious prohemocyte differentiation. However, the total number of cells in the LG also increases, so the differences in plasmatocyte and crystal cell number could be due to increased proliferation of intermediates progenitors (or differentiated plasmatocytes) rather than &quot;precocious&quot; prohemocyte differentiation. The author must show whether the amount and proportion of prohemocyte in the primary lobe is affected.</p><p>Third and more importantly, the authors do not really explore the mechanisms by which the changes in PSC cells permeability affect primary lobe homeostasis (PSC cell number, primary lobe size, plasmatocyte and crystal cell number…). Actually the effect of the bacterial infection is surprisingly fast: in 12hours it leads to a ± 2 folds increase in PSC cell number while these cells are not proliferating in wild type third instar larvae! Also, their analysis of Dpp and Wg response is too preliminary and should be pushed forward to build a stronger model. These results should also be better discussed in light of the known function of these molecules in the LG.</p><p>Fourth, and also very importantly, the authors do not show how the disruption in the permeability barrier confer a (long term) survival advantage upon bacterial infection. Actually, the author must first test if Cora/NrxIV over-expression in the PSC increases fly susceptibility to infection (cf <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: what happens to these larvae in term of survival?). Also, while they claim that the survival advantage could be due to an increase in LG-derived blood cells (as observed in the pupa), they do not show that this effect is long lasting (they should monitor the number of LG-derived hemocytes in the adult, not in the pupa), they do not test for instance if it increases bacterial clearance, and they do not demonstrate that this increase in LG-derived hemocytes is required to see a survival advantage.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.28081.050</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Despite the clear and well-controlled experiments, the text needs considerable improvement.

It is also important to present the ultrastructure of septate junctions in PSC by knockdown of NrxIV and Cora.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer asks an interesting question. The PSC is composed of cells that would not typically be considered epithelial. We found no evidence that the PSC is surrounded by a bag of epithelial cells. Rather, all the cells in the PSC seem to have septate junctions. However since PSC cells do not exhibit the conspicuous polarity of epithelial cells it seems that septate junctions are not localized to a particular domain. Instead our data suggests that in the PSC cells septate junctions are found in multiple sites, corresponding to contact sites with neighboring PSC cells, and form extensive large plaques. We completely agree that these observations should be illustrated with additional electron micrographs, specifically, low and mid magnification images requested by the reviewer and this new data are now included in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-C</xref> and discussed in the subsection “Septate junctions form a permeability barrier at the PSC in the lymph gland”.</p><p>In addition, as requested by the reviewer we now include micrographs of the PSC following knockdown of Cora.These images show a striking near complete absence of SJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D-E</xref> and discussed in the subsection “Loss of Septate Junctions in the PSC results in increased prohemocyte differentiation and a higher number of cells in the PSC”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Judging from the expression of NrxIV, septate junctions in PSC seem to be pleated septate junctions, but not smooth septate junctions. To confirm this, the expressions of other pleated septate junction components ATPa, Sinu or Kune in PSC need to be confirmed.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. In order to address the reviewer’s query about the nature of septate junctions in the PSC we have analyzed the expression of the pleated septate junction components ATPalpha (using a YFP trap line), as well as Sinu and Kune-kune (both using immunofluorescence). As the reviewer suggests all three are expressed in the PSC consistent with the conclusion that the septate junctions in PSC are indeed pleated septate junctions. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G-L</xref>’ and described in the subsection “Septate junctions form a permeability barrier at the PSC in the lymph gland”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Decreased expression of NrxIV in PSC upon bacterial infection should be presented in addition to Coracle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer requests we now include this data and it is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1M-N</xref>’. Also, see the subsection “Bacterial infection disrupts the permeability barrier at the PSC triggering hemocyte differentiation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This reviewer may not clearly understand the aim of the experiment in which SJ components were deleted in hemocytes outside of PSC, by using a pan hemocyte Gal4 driver (Results, fifth paragraph). Do hemocytes have septate junctions? Why did this experiment cause an increase in the number of cells differentiated from prohemocytes?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggests, this experiment should have been presented in a clearer way. Firstly, the evidence we show very much supports the conclusion that the expression of septate junctions proteins in the lymph gland is not restricted to the PSC (See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F-J</xref>’). It was incorrect of us to describe the Hml-deltaGal4 as a pan-hemocyte driver. The Hml-deltaGal4 is in fact a Cortical Zone or differentiated hemocyte specific driver. As such given the context of the rest of our data using this driver is not really relevant to the story we present. We therefore chose to not include the Hml-deltaGal4 and instead present it as a part of follow up studies where we explore possible roles for SJ at later, differentiated, hemocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is also difficult to understand &quot;the second possible mechanism&quot; whereby a permeability barrier in the LG can shape the PSC signalling microenvironment, based on the presented data of Wingless (Results, last paragraph).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity on our part, we were trying to be succinct and did not do a great job explaining this model.

They bring strong evidence that the regulation of the PSC permeability barrier controls the homeostasis of the larval lymph gland. They also show that bacterial infection controls the PSC permeability barrier and, thereby, lymph gland development and the cellular immune response. There is already a plethora of results, however I have several concerns and I would like to see a much revised version of this manuscript.</p><p>First, the manuscript does not read well and should be much improved. For instance, the Abstract is awkward; the Introduction is not very well documented nor precise enough; the Results section would definitely benefit from sub-headings; there are a lot of results that are not sufficiently described; the figures (and legends) are not easy to follow and the pictures often too small; finally in the Discussion, the authors do not sufficiently put their results in the context of the pathway regulating LG/blood cell differentiation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the very helpful suggestions and advice. We have made a substantial effort to improve upon the weaknesses they identified in the text. Some examples: we have rewritten the part of the Abstract the reviewer found problematic, we rewrote and expanded parts of the Introduction to make it more precise and better documented (See second, third and last paragraphs). We have tried to expand the descriptions in the Results to the best of our abilities given the word limit in <italic>eLife</italic> (see subsection “Loss of Septate Junctions in the PSC results in increased prohemocyte differentiation and a higher number of cells in the PSC”; subsection “Permeability barrier breakdown at the PSC introduces localized changes in the PSC micro-environment affecting Wingless and BMP signalling”).</p><p>We have substantially reworked our figures to make the images bigger, the information more compact, and the legends easier to follow.

However, the total number of cells in the LG also increases, so the differences in plasmatocyte and crystal cell number could be due to increased proliferation of intermediates progenitors (or differentiated plasmatocytes) rather than &quot;precocious&quot; prohemocyte differentiation. The author must show whether the amount and proportion of prohemocyte in the primary lobe is affected.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raised an important point that we have addressed with additional experiments. Specifically, we sought to address whether the differences in plasmatocyte and crystal cell number is due to an increase in prohemocyte differentiation or due to increased proliferation of intermediates progenitors. To accomplish this we used the reporter domeMESOlacz as a marker for prohemocyte fate (Hombria et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2009; Tokusumi et al., 2012; Oyallon et al., 2016). This combined with DAPI and plasmatocyte marker, P1 allowed us to quantify the total number of prohemocytes, the total number of plasmatocytes (representative of differentiated hemocytes) and the total number of cells in the lymph gland, as well the ratio of prohemocyte numbers to the total numbers of cells in the LG. Overall these results strongly support our claim that the increase in plasmatocyte and crystal cells that we see following loss of the permeability barrier is caused by prohemocyte differentiation. We found that following SJ depletion in the PSC the total number of prohemocytes is decreased while the total number of plasmatocytes, the ratio of plasmatocytes to total cells in the LG and the total number of cells in the lymph gland is increased. This additional data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A-F</xref> and discussed in the subsection “Loss of Septate Junctions in the PSC results in increased prohemocyte differentiation and a higher number of cells in the PSC”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third and more importantly, the authors do not really explore the mechanisms by which the changes in PSC cells permeability affect primary lobe homeostasis (PSC cell number, primary lobe size, plasmatocyte and crystal cell number…). Actually the effect of the bacterial infection is surprisingly fast: in 12hours it leads to a ± 2 folds increase in PSC cell number while these cells are not proliferating in wild type third instar larvae! Also, their analysis of Dpp and Wg response is too preliminary and should be pushed forward to build a stronger model. These results should also be better discussed in light of the known function of these molecules in the LG.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that we needed to explore in greater depth how changes in the permeability barrier cause such profound and dynamic response in LG homeostasis. We now include a couple of additional experiments to provide more in-depth analysis. As the reviewer asserts, there is a rapid and dramatic increase in the number of PSC cells, which is puzzling given that these cells are not proliferating. To our eyes at least the situation we encounter here is similar to that we observed in our recent exploration of the effects of permeability barrier removal upon another stem cell niche model found in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> testes (see Fairchild et al., Current Biology, 2016). In the testes removal of a permeability barrier also resulted in rapid niche expansion even though niche cells are generally not thought of as being mitotic. Using lineage-tracing approaches we showed that this was due to reprogramming and subsequent recruitment into the niche of differentiated cells, likely as a result of changes in the signaling environment following loss of the permeability barrier. We are very curious to carry out a similar lineage tracing experiment in the LG to see if something similar is going on. However as these experiments are very time consuming we believe they are outside of the scope of the current work. Nonetheless, we added a number of pieces of data that help clarify how the signaling environment in the PSC is altered following depletion of the SJ:</p><p>1) One mechanism that is known to underlie the sort of increase in PSC cell number that we observe following depletion of SJs, is altered BMP signaling. Specifically, it is known that the heparan sulfate proteo-glycan, Dally like protein (Dlp), is highly expressed in the PSC where it regulates the levels of BMP signalling (Pennetier et al., 2012). Loss of Dlp causes increased BMP signaling and expansion in the number of PSC cells (Pennetier et al., 2012). We now report data showing the depletion of SJ components results in lower Dlp levels in the PSC which helps explain the expansion phenotype. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2A-C</xref>’, G and described in the subsection “Permeability barrier breakdown at the PSC introduces localized changes in the PSC micro-environment affecting Wingless and BMP signalling”.</p><p>2) We explored another known mechanism that regulates PSC cell size involving dMyc. It was previously shown that dMyc is normally repressed in the PSC by BMP signaling, loss of BMP from the PSC results in dMyc de-repression and consequently PSC size increase (Pennetier et al., 2012). We have added new data to the manuscript showing dMyc is upregulated in the PSC following depletion of SJs. Moreover, knockdown of dMyc in the PSC concomitant with SJ depletion abrogates PSC expansion. This analysis implicates dMyc and its downstream targets in the pathway that leads to PSC expansion following SJ depletion. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2D-F</xref>’, H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2I-U</xref> and described in the subsection “Permeability barrier breakdown at the PSC introduces localized changes in the PSC micro-environment affecting Wingless and BMP signalling”.</p><p>3) In addition to this, we also tested if Coracle expression at the PSC is itself downstream of Wg or BMP inactivation. We found that Cora is expressed independently of either pathway suggesting a rather straightforward pathway between depletion of SJ components and alterations in the Wg and BMP pathway. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s3">Figure 9—figure supplement 3A-D</xref> and described in the subsection “Permeability barrier breakdown at the PSC introduces localized changes in the PSC micro-environment affecting Wingless and BMP signalling”.</p><p>4) We modified the Discussion to talk about these results in a more direct and full way. These changes are found in the third paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fourth, and also very importantly, the authors do not show how the disruption in the permeability barrier confer a (long term) survival advantage upon bacterial infection. Actually, the author must first test if Cora/NrxIV over-expression in the PSC increases fly susceptibility to infection (cf <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>: what happens to these larvae in term of survival?). Also, while they claim that the survival advantage could be due to an increase in LG-derived blood cells (as observed in the pupa), they do not show that this effect is long lasting (they should monitor the number of LG-derived hemocytes in the adult, not in the pupa), they do not test for instance if it increases bacterial clearance, and they do not demonstrate that this increase in LG-derived hemocytes is required to see a survival advantage.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises two excellent points and we have now carried out additional experiments to address both comments in full:</p><p>1) We have now tested whether Cora/NrxIV over-expression in the PSC, which we might expect to reduce the flies’ ability to induce the cellular immune response, increases fly susceptibility to infection. However, we did not find increased susceptibility, suggesting that even if we compromise the cellular immune response, flies can defend themselves from pathogens. This may be accomplished by compensatory action of the humoral immune response using Anti Microbial Peptides (AMPs). This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2J</xref> and described in the subsection “Flies bearing septate junction depletion in the PSC mount a robust hemocyte-mediated cellular immune response leading to better survival upon infection”.</p><p>2) In order to properly show “long-lasting” survival advantage following depletion of SJ component from the larval PSC we performed representative hemocyte counts in control and SJ depleted adult flies. We consistently found higher hemocyte numbers in adults following SJ depletion in the larva. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K-L</xref>’’ and described in the subsection “Flies bearing septate junction depletion in the PSC mount a robust hemocyte-mediated cellular immune response leading to better survival upon infection”.</p><p>Higher hemocyte numbers might not, by themselves, confer a survival advantage. Therefore we assayed directly the function of the cellular immune response following SJ depletion from the larval PSC. Specifically, we assayed in vivo bacterial clearance and an ex vivo bacterial phagocytosis. Both showed improved immune system function following larval depletion of SJs. This new data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-E</xref> and described in the subsection “Flies bearing septate junction depletion in the PSC mount a robust hemocyte-mediated cellular immune response leading to better survival upon infection”. Taken together these data clearly demonstrate how effects on cellular immunity can extend into adult life and, in that sense, provide a “long-lasting” advantage.</p></body></sub-article></article>
