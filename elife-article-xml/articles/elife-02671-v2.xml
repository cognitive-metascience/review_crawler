contralateral brain. Ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) plays an essential role in the development of the OC by regulating RGC axon growth in a non-cell autonomous manner. In this study, we identify an unexpected function of Vax1 that is secreted from ventral hypothalamic cells and diffuses to RGC axons, where it promotes axonal growth independent of its transcription factor activity. We demonstrate that Vax1 binds to extracellular sugar groups of the heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs) located in RGC axons. Both Vax1 binding to HSPGs and subsequent penetration into the axoplasm, where Vax1 activates local protein synthesis, are required for RGC axonal growth. Together, our findings demonstrate that Vax1 possesses a novel RGC axon growth factor activity that is critical for the development of the mammalian binocular visual system.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02671.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02671.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02671.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>We see the world around us when light bounces off of objects and hits the retina at the back of our eyes. This triggers electrical signals in neurons called retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which have long structures called axons that extend out from the retina and into the parts of the brain where the signals are interpreted. As the axons grow, various ‘guidance’ molecules direct the axons to the correct part of the brain.</p><p>One molecule that is important for the growth of retinal ganglion cells' axons is a protein called Vax1. This protein is a transcription factor and binds to DNA to control how and when the molecular templates used to make proteins are made—a process called transcription. Vax1 is not produced in retinal ganglion cells, but it does control the extension of these cells' axons into part of the brain called the ventral hypothalamus. In this study, the axons cross to the other side of the brain by forming a structure called optic chiasm. Humans and mice lacking Vax1 are unable to develop the optic chiasm, and the axons of their retinal ganglion cells do not reach their targets in the brain. These defects were thought to occur because the guidance molecules whose transcription is normally controlled by Vax1 were not produced in the correct amounts when Vax1 is absent.</p><p>Kim et al. now challenge this view by creating a mutant version of Vax1 that cannot bind to DNA or regulate the transcription of other proteins. Retinal ganglion cell axons could still grow correctly when they were put close to cells expressing this version of the Vax1 protein. This contradicts a hypothesis that Vax1 supports axonal growth by transcribing guidance molecules. Kim et al. followed up these results by examining developing mice and reached the unexpected conclusion that Vax1 is secreted from cells in the ventral hypothalamus and binds to a type of sugar molecule found on the surface of the axons. Once bound, Vax1 can enter the axons where it appears to stimulate the production of proteins inside axons, which helps the axons to grow.</p><p>These findings reveal unconventional functions for Vax1 that occur in addition to its role as a transcription factor. Vax1 is known to regulate the development of several structures in the brain, so the work of Kim et al. also raises new questions about how Vax1 controls these processes.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02671.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02671.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1)</kwd><kwd>retinal axon growth</kwd><kwd>optic chiasm</kwd><kwd>intercellular protein transfer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning, Republic of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2009-00424; NRF-2013-056566; NRF-2014R1A2A2A01003069</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Jin Woo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Ministry of Science, ICT, and Future Planning, Republic of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2006-2004289</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kang</surname><given-names>Kyung Hwa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Secreted Vax1 homeodomain protein supports the development of optic chiasm by directly acting at the retinal ganglion cell axon.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Development of the mammalian binocular visual system requires topographic synaptic connections of retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axons to neurons on the lateral geniculate nucleus and superior colliculus of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lemke and Reber, 2005</xref>). To access their synaptic targets, RGC axons exit from the retina and grow in selective directions by recognizing guidance cues expressed in optic pathway structures, including the optic disc (OD), optic stalk (OS), optic chiasm (OC), and optic tract (OT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Petros et al., 2008</xref>). RGC axon guidance cues include cell surface ligands such as semaphorins in the OS and ephrinB2 in the OC, and soluble factors such as netrin-1 in the OD and Slit1 in areas surrounding the OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Erskine and Herrera, 2007</xref>). Ultimately, only about 3% of mouse RGC axons, which originate from the ventral and temporal part of the retina, are linked to targets on the same side of the brain, whereas a majority of RGC axons are connected to those on the opposite side after crossing the midline at the OC, located at the ventral-medial hypothalamic (vHT) area.</p><p>Subsets of vHT cells therefore express molecules that determine the directionalities of RGC axons at the OC. It has been shown that vHT radial glial cells express ephrinB2, which binds to EphB1 receptors expressed in ventral-temporal RGC axons and repels the axons toward the ipsilateral optic tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakagawa et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Williams et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, vascular endothelial growth factor 164 (VEGF164), an isoform of the vascular endothelial growth factor VEGF-A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Soker et al., 1996</xref>), and neuronal cell adhesion molecule (NrCAM) expressed in the vHT have been suggested to support the growth of RGC axons across the vHT midline by binding to neuropilin-1 and plexin-A1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erskine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuwajima et al., 2012</xref>). To receive the directional guidance of these molecules at the vHT, RGC axons must pass through the ventral-lateral diencephalic area, where repulsive guidance cues, such as Slit and semaphorins, are expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erskine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plump et al., 2002</xref>). However, the molecules that support RGC axon growth toward the vHT midline are still unknown.</p><p>Ventral anterior homeobox 1 (Vax1) is a homeodomain transcription factor expressed in various ventral-medial forebrain-derived structures, including the medial and lateral geniculate eminences, the ventral septum, the anterior entopeduncular area, the preoptic area, the vHT, and the OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hallonet et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</xref>). Genetic inactivation of <italic>Vax1</italic> in humans and mice causes agenesis of multiple midline structures of the brain, including the anterior commissure, the corpus callosum, and the OC, in addition to the coloboma of the eye (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hallonet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Slavotinek et al., 2012</xref>). RGC axons in <italic>Vax1</italic>-deficient mice can grow through the OS but cannot access the vHT area and fail to form an OC. <italic>Vax1</italic> is not expressed in RGCs despite its critical roles in growth and fasciculation of RGC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mui et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, it has been suggested that defects in OC formation in <italic>Vax1</italic>-deficient mouse RGCs might be caused by the loss or gain of axon guidance cues that are potential transcription targets of Vax1 in vHT cells.</p><p>Contrary to expectation, we here found that Vax1 promoted RGC axon growth in a transcription-independent manner. Moreover, Vax1 is secreted from vHT cells and binds and enters RGC axons to stimulate axonal growth. This unexpected trafficking of Vax1 to RGC axons was mediated by heparan sulfate proteoglycans (HSPGs), such as syndecan and glypican, expressed in RGC axons. However, Vax1 binding to HSPGs was not sufficient to trigger RGC axon growth; penetration into the RGC axoplasm and subsequent stimulation of local protein synthesis were also necessary. Taken together, our findings reveal an unconventional function of Vax1 as an RGC axon growth factor that enables RGC axons to grow toward the midline during development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Vax1 regulates the RGC axonal growth in a non-cell autonomous manner</title><p><italic>Vax1</italic> is expressed in cells located in optic pathway structures, such as the OS and vHT, and plays an essential role in fasciculation of RGC axons and formation of the OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hallonet et al., 1999</xref>).

To determine the potential binding of Vax1 to HS side chains of Sdc2 in RGC axons, we used co-immunoprecipitation assays to test whether excess free heparin competed with HS side chains of HSPGs, including Sdc2, Sdc3, and Glp1, for binding to Vax1.

Spinal commissural axons are prevented from prematurely entering the midline by Slit1 expressed in the medial spinal cord and grow in the ventral direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001</xref>). In much the same way, Slit1 in the preoptic area and ventral-lateral diencephalon prevents RGC axons from accessing the brain anywhere but at the vHT to form the OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erskine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plump et al., 2002</xref>). The spinal commissural axons sense attractive cues, such as netrin and Shh, secreted from the FP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Stein and Tessier-Lavigne, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charron et al., 2003</xref>). The attractive netrin and Shh signals are expected to compete with the co-existing repulsive signal of Slit2, which can be accumulated locally by HSPGs, including α-dystroglycan, at the ventral FP (vFP), to determine the directionality of spinal commissural axon growth cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Matsumoto et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wright et al., 2012</xref>). RGC-expressed HSPGs were also reported to play roles as co-receptors for netrin and Slit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hussain et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piper et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogata-Iwao et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting a similar HSPG-based antagonistic regulation of RGC axon growth. However, both netrin and Shh are dispensable with respect to attracting RGC axons toward the vHT and instead function as repulsive cues for RGC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Deiner and Sretavan, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sanchez-Camacho and Bovolenta, 2008</xref>). In this study, we propose vHT-secreted Vax1 as a RGC axon growth factor that is analogous to vFP-secreted netrin and Shh. This unconventional axon growth factor also utilizes HSPGs for anchoring to RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and could compete with Slit for HSPGs binding in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">Figure 9—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, it is unclear whether this competition is valid in physiological conditions because Slit does not inhibit RGC axon growth toward the vHT midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erskine et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plump et al., 2002</xref>). Moreover, cell penetration-defective Vax1(WF/SR) mutant could not induce RGC axon growth in vivo as well as in vitro, despite of its capability of HSPG binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8 fig9">Figures 8 and 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). It suggests that HSPG binding of Vax1 is not sufficient to induce RGC axon growth but local protein synthesis induced by internalized Vax1 is necessary. Collectively, we propose a hypothetical model that Vax1 promotes RGC axon growth towards the vHT midline by directly targeting mRNA in the axons rather than by serving for a conventional axon guidance molecule that binds specific receptors and triggers on intracellular signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Identification of axonal target mRNA awaits future investigations.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02671.027</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Model depicting Vax1 functions as a secreted retinal axon growth factor.</title><p>Vax1 is expressed in radial glia and NPCs of the vHT as well as the OS APCs (<bold>A</bold>) and secreted to the extracellular space (<bold>B</bold>). RGC axons that grow in the OS capture APC-secreted Vax1 by HSPGs, resulting in an increase in Vax1 concentration at RGC axons for subsequent penetration and local activation of translation in the axon (<bold>B</bold>). The imported Vax1 in RGC axoplasm not only promotes axonal growth towards the vHT, but it also enhances fasciculation of RGC axons. This axon growth stimulatory activity of Vax1 supports sustained RGC axon growth to the vHT midline after the axons were avoided from progressing to dorsal diencephalon, which expresses high concentration of Slit repulsive axon guidance cue (<bold>C</bold>, top). Therefore, RGC axons stop at the lateral wall of <italic>Vax1-ko</italic> mouse diencephalon and fail to access the midline (<bold>C</bold>, bottom). At the vHT midline, RGC axon guidance cues, including VEGF164, NrCAM, and ephrinB2, determine the directionalities of RGC axon growth cones by acting their specific receptors (<bold>D</bold>). Vax1 does not likely determine the directionalities of RGC axon growth cone at the midline but does promote the growth of the RGC axon shaft as well as the growth cone regardless of their original positions in the retina.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02671.027">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02671.027</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-02671-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>Translation-dependent, but transcription-independent, RGC axon guidance by a secreted transcription factor has also been reported for En2, which regulates RGC growth cone turning by increasing the expression of mitochondrial proteins involved in elevating the local ATP, which potentiates ephrin A5 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunet et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Stettler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yoon et al., 2012</xref>). Since Vax1 and En2 share a homologous homeodomain, Vax1 could function in a similar manner by cooperating with attractive RGC axon guidance cues, such as VEGF164 and NrCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Williams et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Erskine et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kuwajima et al., 2012</xref>), and by modulating mitochondrial activity. Conversely, En2 could also use HSPGs to bind target axons and fine-tune their selective growth.</p><p>In their use of HSPGs as docking sites for RGC axons, Vax1 can be compared to Otx2 that binds specifically to CSPGs of the perineuronal net surrounding parvalbumin (PV) neurons in the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beurdeley et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Miyata et al., 2012</xref>). The differential affinities of Vax1 and Otx2 for HS and CS might be related to their different homeodomains. Among homeodomain proteins proven to exhibit transfer, Vax1 possesses an antennapedia class homeodomain homologous to that of Emx2 and En2, whereas Otx2 shares a paired class homeodomain similar to that of Pax6 (paired box 6) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bürglin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spatazza et al., 2013</xref>). One intriguing possibility that has not yet been explored is that these secreted homeodomain proteins share the property of preferential binding to HS and CS; however, it is at least as likely that intercellular transfer of homeodomain proteins are target-selective events.</p><p>Vax2 was not as effectively secreted from COS7 cells as Vax1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), despite sharing an identical homeodomain with Vax1. This suggests that secretion of Vax1 is not solely mediated by the homeodomain but is also dependent on a three-dimensional structure that supports the secretion property of the homeodomain. Unlike Vax1, Vax2 undergoes a specific phosphorylation that results in its cytoplasmic retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim and Lemke, 2006</xref>). Phosphorylation of En2 inhibits its secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maizel et al., 2002</xref>), suggesting that the phosphorylation might change the structure of these proteins in such a way that it interferes with homeodomain recognition by secretion regulators. However, phosphorylation-defective Vax1(S170A) was still unable to be secreted from COS7 cells (data not shown). Instead, Vax2 could be secreted from different types of cells, where Vax2 might form three-dimensional structures that can be recognizable by secretion machineries (<italic>Lee et al., unpublished data</italic>). The results suggest that the secretion of homeodomain proteins is a cell context-dependent event.</p><p>Multiple midline-crossing defects, including agenesis of the corpus callosum, anterior commissure, and hippocampal commissure, are observed in <italic>Vax1-</italic>deficient mice and homozygous <italic>VAX1</italic> mutant human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Slavotinek et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular functions of Vax1 in the development of these structures remain unknown. In this study, we show that Vax1-induced RGC axonal growth is independent of its transcription factor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3">Figures 2A and 3C</xref>). Instead, Vax1 acts as a regulator of translation after penetrating into RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Although we cannot rule out Vax1 functions as a transcription factor in the development of those commissures, our results suggest a potential role of secreted Vax1 in the growth of cortical axons (<italic>Min et al., unpublished data</italic>). Whether axonal growth of these commissural axons in the mammalian forebrain also requires local protein synthesis triggered by Vax1 protein secreted from cells located in other midline structures, such as the ventral-medial telencephalon and the septum, is a question that warrants further investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice and explant culture</title><p><italic>Vax1</italic> knock-out (<italic>Vax1</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) and <italic>Vax1</italic> knock-in (<italic>Vax1</italic><sup><italic>lacZ/lacZ</italic></sup>) mice were reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hallonet et al., 1999</xref>).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor, Marianne Bronner, and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is an interesting study that identifies a somewhat unexpected mechanism by which the transcription factor Vax1 regulates retinal ganglion cell (RGC) axon growth. The authors report that despite the lack of Vax1 mRNA expression in RGCs, they detect Vax1 protein in RGCs in vivo. The authors utilize in vitro experiments to demonstrate that Vax1 functions in a non-cell autonomous manner and, similar to other homeobox transcription factors, Vax1 can be secreted. The authors go on to show that similar to En-2, Vax1 is internalized by RGC axons, where it stimulates axonal outgrowth in a transcription-independent manner by upregulating axonal translation. The authors also perform a screen in drosophila for molecules that mediate the intercellular transfer of Vax1 and identify HSPGs as critical for Vax1 function. Finally, the authors perform in vivo rescue experiments in Vax1 knockout mice to show that wildtype Vax1 in the 3rd ventricle can increase RGC growth, whereas a mutant version of Vax1 that cannot penetrate RGC axons fails to rescue. Taken together, these data lead the authors to propose a model in which Vax1, secreted from external sources such as the radial glia in the optic chiasm, can penetrate RGCs in an HSPG dependent manner to upregulate local translation in axons to positively regulate their outgrowth.</p><p>The identification of homeodomain transcription factors as “axon guidance molecules” is interesting. The present study is not the first report of this phenomenon, but does provide a solid basis for making this claim.</p><p>Substantive concerns:</p><p>1) The references to other studies are deficient (missing or improper citation/interpretation) and the text should be edited for proper English usage. For example, the authors should cite papers regarding the idea that HSPGs are involved in axon guidance, and particularly at the optic chiasm, since this is not a new concept. For example: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al., 2001</xref>, J Comp Neurol 436: 236; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pratt et al., 2006</xref>, J Neurosci.26:6911; Conway et al., 2011, J Neurosci 31: 1955; Wilson and Stoeckli, 2013, Neuron 79:478; Sánchez-Arrones et al., 2013, J Neurosci 33:8596; Fabre et al., 2010, J Neurosci 30:266 and Yam and Charron, Curr Op Neurobiol 2013).</p><p>2) Although the authors show that the chiasm appears normal by RC2 staining, they should confirm that the expression of known chiasm localized cues (Vegf, ephrinB1, NrCAM) is normal. Similarly, there is no information on localization of HSPGs on RGCs nor is there any proposal/analysis on the fate of HSPGs after Vax1 binds: are they also internalized? If not, are they cleaved once bound to Vax1? These points should be discussed. A large number of HSPG binding proteins have been identified (e.g. FGF2, slit2, Semas, ephrins, syndecans, glypicans, etc). For all these cues HSPGs function as co-receptors for a transmembrane spanning signaling receptor. The authors should discuss this possibility and whether there is data for co-localization of these on RGCs.</p><p>3) The explants tested were taken from dorsal retina, at E13, when a few cells project ipsilaterally but ultimately disappear. The ventrotemporal retina gives rise to the permanent ipsilateral component after E14. Have the authors analyzed expression of syndecan or glypican in the “ipsi” retina and how Vax1-HSPG interactions underlie ipsi axon midline avoidance? This could be addressed by comparing ventrotemporal versus dorsotemporal retina.</p><p>4) The authors propose that vax1 overrides Robo/slit repulsion. Is slit repulsion of cultured RGC axons reduced (blocked) in the presence of recombinant vax1? Slits are thought to inhibit RGC axons from straying (defasciculating) from the main bundles at the chiasm, in an “inhibition-surround” mechanism, not as an inhibitory molecule at the crossing point (see Erskine et al., J Neurosci 2000, 20:4975; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plump et al., 2002</xref> Neuron 33:219). The authors placed Vax-1-containing cells in the third ventricle above the chiasm in an isolated prep, showing that growth was enhanced, and application of Fc-Robo3 also enhanced RGC axon growth (together growth was further enhanced). While this experiment argues for Slit involvement in this preparation, it cannot relate to guidance in vivo because Robo3 is not expressed in the mouse retina (see above references and Thompson et al., 2006, J Neurosci 26:8092). Further, there should be axon extension in the control preparation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>. Finally, the model posed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> is misleading: how would the Vax1-HSPG interaction act on Slit inhibition leading to action of molecules important for contralateral crossing (e.g., VEGF164, NrCAM, and Semaphorin6D, latter, erroneously indicated for ipsilateral growth)?</p><p>5) The authors show that in contrast to Vax1, Vax2 is not secreted and does not bind to HSPGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7–figure supplement 1B</xref>). This is somewhat surprising, since the domains that regulate secretion of homeodomain transcription factors are typically within the homeodomain region, which is highly conserved between Vax1 and Vax2. Have the authors attempted to identify the specific domains required for secretion and HSPG binding that differ between Vax1 and Vax2? The authors should test whether the addition of exogenous Vax2 can bind to RGCs and promote their outgrowth using assays like those used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>.</p><p>6) Immuno-EM studies show that vax1 is localized to the axonal surface of RGCs and also found in endocytosed vesicles. To participate in local translation, vax1 likely needs to be in the cytoplasm not inside vesicles?</p><p>7) In the co-culture assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-D</xref>, WT retinal explants cultured with Vax1-/- vHT not only shows no attraction, but appears to show active repulsion. This may be due to the secretion of Slit from the explants, which should be tested by examining whether addition of Robo-Fc (similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>) inhibits this repulsion. With respect to Vax localization and uptake, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref> shows immunostaining for Vax1 protein on axons and in D in the immune-EM figures, only on the axon surface; this is puzzling as the authors' model is that Vax1 is internalized and thus one would expect Vax1 to be in the cytoplasm of the cell <italic>–</italic> axon or cell body.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>, the authors show that Vax1 and Slit are mutually antagonistic with respect to axon outgrowth. In the images (S9C), it appears that the addition of Slit blocks Vax1 localization in the axons to some extent.

As is, the DiI quality distracts from the overall point of the figure.

Are the authors trying to say that, yes, they think Vax1 actions are both chemotrophic and chemotropic, or are they undecided? As it currently reads, these statements are weak.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Overall, I think the manuscript is much improved, particularly with respect to grammar and inclusion of appropriate references and added discussion points. The authors have addressed most of the concerns to an acceptable level, and I would support the acceptance of the paper, pending addressing the following points:</p><p>Regarding substantive concerns point 2: Although NrCAM and VegfA are expressed in the Vax1-/- chiasm, the morphology of the chiasm is clearly abnormal (Figure A.B and Supplemental Figure 1). In the text, the authors state: “The development of these OC-forming cells was normal in Vax1-deficient (Vax1-/-) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bertuzzi et al, 1999</xref>) (Figure 9 1A,B; bottom rows), suggesting that the impairment in OC development in Vax1-deficient mice is not caused by the lack of OC-forming vHT cells but rather by a loss of RGC attractant molecules in these cells ”. It would be more accurate to state: “Although the morphology of the chiasm is abnormal in Vax1-/- deficient mice, the OC-forming cells and several chiasm localized cues (NrCAM, VegfA) are present.”</p><p>Also regarding substantive concerns point 2, with respect to the point about HSPGs functioning as co-receptors for other secreted proteins, I think the authors missed the reviewers' point. If I understand correctly, they were asked to consider whether Vax1/HSPGs co-localize with known cell surface receptors that may mediate internalization of Vax1. In addition, the co-localization of Vax1 and Sdc3 in RGC axons in tissue sections is pretty dirty and the co-localization isn't very convincing. Have the authors tried this in cultured RGCs? This might improve the quality of the images.</p><p>Regarding substantive concerns point 5: Despite the fact that Vax2 is not secreted, the ability of recombinant Vax2 to be internalized and induce axonal growth strengthens the findings of the paper. These data should be included in the manuscript as a supplemental figure, at the least.</p><p>Regarding substantive concerns point 8: While the authors nicely showed that Vax1 and Slit compete with one another for binding to HSPGs, they did not show whether addition of Slit blocks Vax1's ability to induce translation in axons. Did the authors do this experiment?</p><p>Regarding substantive concerns point 9: The authors should include the data showing that the Vax1 antibody blocks the function of Vax1 secreted from Cos7 cells as supplemental data.</p><p>Regarding minor concern 7: If this is the best image for IP experiments, perhaps the authors could complement the experiments by using overexpression of tagged constructs for Sdc2, Sdc3, Pax2 and Glp1 or by performing the reverse IP if antibodies are available.</p><p>In general, the proposed model of Vax1 action in RGC axons is still a bit confusing. Does it primarily function as a promoter of axonal growth via increased translation, or by competing with Slit binding to HSPGs? While these need not be mutually exclusive, I'm still a little unclear as to what the Slit/Robo data adds to the model, since Slit doesn't function as a general inhibitor of growth, but rather functions as a repulsive cue from the surrounding tissue.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02671.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) The references to other studies are deficient (missing or improper citation/interpretation) and the text should be edited for proper English usage.

The results indicated that these chiasm cues are still expressed in E14.5 <italic>Vax1-ko</italic> mouse embryonic ventral diencephalon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>). These are even expanded more dorsally, suggesting that defective midline access of <italic>Vax1-ko</italic> mouse RGC axons was not resulted from the loss of these attractive chiasm cues.</p><p><italic>Similarly, there is no information on localization of HSPGs on RGCs nor is there any proposal/analysis on the fate of HSPGs after Vax1 binds: are they also internalized? If not, are they cleaved once bound to Vax1? These points should be discussed</italic>.</p><p>We investigated the distribution of Vax1 and Sdc3 in E14.5 mouse retinas by co-immunostaining. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>, Vax1 and Sdc3 are co-localized in RGC axons, whereas these co-localized Vax1 signals disappeared after treating retinal sections with heparinase I. These results suggest that Vax1 interacts with Sdc3 in a HS-dependent manner at the cell surface, but is unlikely internalized by Sdc3-mediated endocytosis, which can protect Vax1-HS interaction from heparinase. We were also not able to detect any cleavage of Sdc2 or Vax1 in transfected cells. We provide the results for the reviewers’ inspection only. Our overall hypothetical model is that HSPGs capture secreted Vax1 and release it to the plasma membrane for further cytoplasmic penetration.</p><p><italic>A large number of HSPG binding proteins have been identified (e.g. FGF2, slit2, Semas, ephrins, syndecans, glypicans, etc). For all these cues HSPGs function as co-receptors for a transmembrane spanning signaling receptor. The authors should discuss this possibility and whether there is data for co-localization of these on RGCs</italic>.</p><p>We discussed possible roles of HSPGs as co-receptors for netrin, Shh, and Slit during axonal projection of spinal commissural neurons and RGCs (please see the first paragraph of Discussion). We did not check the co-localization of these cues on RGCs. We have also not found any studies reporting co-localization of these cues on RGC axons, although previous results suggest that HSPGs are required for the actions of netrin and Slit on RGC axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Johnson et al, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogata-Iwao et al, 2011</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) The explants tested were taken from dorsal retina, at E13, when a few cells project ipsilaterally but ultimately disappear. The ventrotemporal retina gives rise to the permanent ipsilateral component after E14. Have the authors analyzed expression of syndecan or glypican in the “ipsi” retina and how Vax1-HSPG interactions underlie ipsi axon midline avoidance? This could be addressed by comparing ventrotemporal versus dorsotemporal retina</italic>.</p><p>We examined the distribution of Sdc3 in E14.5 retinas, and found no region-specific enrichment of Sdc3 in the nasal-temporal (N/T) axis (Sdc3 images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7–figure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with a previous report showing a uniform distribution of HSPGs in RGCs along the N/T axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chung et al, 2001</xref>).</p><p>We also tested axonal responses of retinal quadrants to Vax1. We provide the results for the reviewers’ inspection. The results suggest that ventral retinal axons respond to Vax1 as efficiently as those from the dorsal retinal explants. These results also show that V/T retinal axons express Sdc3 and project as efficiently as those from the dorsal retinal explants upon incubating with Vax1.</p><p>Therefore, as we propose in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>), Vax1 supports the projection of RGC axons toward the vHT midline regardless of their original positions in the retina. In the vHT midline, EphB1-expressing V/T RGC axons are repelled by ephrinB2-expressing radial glia while the remaining RGC axons continue growing in the contralateral direction.</p><p><italic>4) The authors propose that vax1 overrides Robo/slit repulsion. Is slit repulsion of cultured RGC axons reduced (blocked) in the presence of recombinant vax1?</italic></p><p>Yes. Slit and Vax1 competitively inhibit each other’s effects as well as their binding to RGC axons (please see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>Slits are thought to inhibit RGC axons from straying (defasciculating) from the main bundles at the chiasm, in an “inhibition-surround” mechanism, not as an inhibitory molecule at the crossing point (see Erskine et al., J Neurosci 2000, 20:4975;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34"><italic>Plump et al., 2002</italic></xref> <italic>Neuron 33:219)</italic>.</p><p>As the reviewers indicate, Slit-Robo signaling inhibits RGC axons from exiting the optic track and projecting toward ectopic sites, such as the POA and contralateral OS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erskine et al, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plump et al, 2002</xref>). This suggests that the role of Slit-Robo signaling in RGC axons is related to reducing the dynamics of the RGC axon growth cone rather than specifically enhancing fasciculation, which is still normal in the OS of <italic>Slit1/2-ko</italic> mice (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Plump et al., 2002</xref>, Neuron 33: 219).</p><p><italic>The authors placed Vax-1-containing cells in the third ventricle above the chiasm in an isolated prep, showing that growth was enhanced, and application of Fc-Robo3 also enhanced RGC axon growth (together growth was further enhanced). While this experiment argues for Slit involvement in this preparation, it cannot relate to guidance in vivo because Robo3 is not expressed in the mouse retina (see above references and Thompson et al., 2006, J Neurosci 26:8092). Further, there should be axon extension in the control preparation in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9A</italic></xref>.</p><p>As the reviewers’ indicated, Robo3 is not expressed in mouse RGCs, where Robo1 and Robo2 are consistently expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erskine et al, 2000</xref>). In addition, Robo3-Fc alone was not effective in restoring RGC axon growth in <italic>Vax1-ko</italic> mouse embryos (original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we therefore replaced the original results with those using Robo1-Fc. As shown in revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, implanted Robo1-Fc induced RGC axon regrowth in <italic>Vax1-ko</italic> mouse brains and it further facilitated the effects of co-implanted Vax1.</p><p><italic>Finally, the model posed in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9</italic></xref> <italic>is misleading: how would the Vax1-HSPG interaction act on Slit inhibition leading to action of molecules important for contralateral crossing (e.g., VEGF164, NrCAM, and Semaphorin6D, latter, erroneously indicated for ipsilateral growth)?</italic></p><p>We modified our model (revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>) regarding Vax1 and Slit competition for HSPGs in RGC axons and antagonistic regulation of local translation. Accordingly, in this competition, vHT-enriched Vax1 displaces Slit, which is bound to HSPGs in RGC axons at the lateral diencephalon, and promotes further growth toward the midline where RGC axons meet pathway determinants (e.g., VEGF164, NrCAM, Semaphorin6D, and ephrinB2).</p><p><italic>5) The authors show that in contrast to Vax1, Vax2 is not secreted and does not bind to HSPGs (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2C</italic></xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1"><italic>Figure 7–figure supplement 1B</italic></xref><italic>). This is somewhat surprising, since the domains that regulate secretion of homeodomain transcription factors are typically within the homeodomain region, which is highly conserved between Vax1 and Vax2. Have the authors attempted to identify the specific domains required for secretion and HSPG binding that differ between Vax1 and Vax2?</italic></p><p>According to our unpublished results, only about 40% of homeodomain transcription factors can be secreted at least in one cell type (<italic>Lee et al., manuscript in preparation</italic>). It suggests that secretion of homeodomain proteins is not solely dependent of homeodomain but rely on their three-dimensional structures. Therefore, in COS7 cells, Vax2 might fail to form a three-dimensional structure that can be recognized by secretion machineries that have not been identified yet.</p><p>We previously showed that Vax2 can be localized to the cytoplasm of the developing mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kim &amp; Lemke, 2006</xref>). This cytoplasmic retention of Vax2 is mediated by phosphorylation at S170, which is absent in Vax1. However, replacing of this phosphorylation site by alanine (S170A) or aspartate (S170D) was failed to induce secretion of the Vax2 proteins (data not shown). It suggests that the phosphorylation-induced cytoplasmic retention of Vax2 is unlikely related with secretion.</p><p><italic>The authors should test whether the addition of exogenous Vax2 can bind to RGCs and promote their outgrowth using assays like those used in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref>.</p><p>Bacterial-expressed recombinant Vax2 was able to induce RGC axon growth after penetration. We provide the results for reviewers’ inspection only. This suggests that Vax2, which shares an identical cell-penetration sequence with Vax1, is functionally equivalent to Vax1 <italic>in vitro</italic> but is simply not secreted from COS7 cells.</p><p><italic>6) Immuno-EM studies show that vax1 is localized to the axonal surface of RGCs and also found in endocytosed vesicles. To participate in local translation, vax1 likely needs to be in the cytoplasm not inside vesicles?</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript, we provide additional iTEM images showing cytoplasmic Vax1 (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) In the co-culture assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1C-D</italic></xref><italic>, WT retinal explants cultured with Vax1-/- vHT not only shows no attraction, but appears to show active repulsion. This may be due to the secretion of Slit from the explants, which should be tested by examining whether addition of Robo-Fc (similar to</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9"><italic>Figure 9A</italic></xref><italic>) inhibits this repulsion</italic>.</p><p>As recommended by the reviewers, we tested the effects of Robo1-Fc on RGC axon growth from retinal explants co-cultured with vHT explants. We provide the results for reviewers’ inspection. We found that Robo1-Fc treatment stimulated RGC axonal projection, not only toward <italic>Vax1-ko</italic> vHTs but also in other directions. Therefore, consistent with the reviewers’ hypothesis, Slit from the hypothalamic explants repels RGC axons more efficiently in the absence of Vax1.</p><p><italic>With respect to Vax localization and uptake,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4C and D</italic></xref> <italic>shows immunostaining for Vax1 protein on axons and in D in the immune-EM figures, only on the axon surface; this is puzzling as the authors' model is that Vax1 is internalized and thus one would expect Vax1 to be in the cytoplasm of the cell – axon or cell body</italic>.</p><p>Although a majority of Vax1 bound to the RGC membrane, a significant amount of Vax1 protein was also detectable in the RGC cytoplasm. This cytoplasmic Vax1 protein might be sufficient to exert axon growth-stimulatory effects. In the revised manuscript, we provide additional iTEM images showing cytoplasmic Vax1 (please see images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) In</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1"><italic>Figure 9–figure supplement 1</italic></xref><italic>, the authors show that Vax1 and Slit are mutually antagonistic with respect to axon outgrowth. In the images (S9C), it appears that the addition of Slit blocks Vax1 localization in the axons to some extent. This should be examined in biochemical assays by assessing how the presence of Slit or Vax1 affects the other's binding to HSPGs (similar to assays in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1"><italic>Figure 7–figure supplement 1A</italic></xref><italic>).

The results indicated that Vax1 and Slit2 compete for binding to RGC axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9–figure supplement 1C</xref>). These results therefore suggest that Vax1 and Slit proteins compete for binding to the sugar chain in the extracellular domain of HSPGs. However, a possible antagonism between Vax1 and Robo signaling in enhancing the translation of specific target mRNAs cannot be excluded at this point. Therefore, we propose a model in which Vax1 antagonizes Slit-Robo signaling not only at the level of ligand accumulation but also at the level of intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>).</p><p><italic>9) It is not clear whether soluble vax1 primarily exerts its function as a growth promoting factor (chemotrophic, i.e.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5"><italic>Figure 5</italic></xref><italic>) or steering function (chemotropic, i.e.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1"><italic>Figure 1</italic></xref><italic>) or both?</italic></p><p>Vax1 can also play roles as a steering factor in certain context, which Vax1 is expressed in a specific region.

It makes RGC axons be consistently exposed to Vax1 until it reaches to optic tract. In addition, Vax1 not only works in RGC axon terminal, but it is also present in axon shaft to promote axon growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, we propose Vax1 is an axon growth factor in general.</p><p><italic>Can the effects of vax1 secreted from COS7 cells be blocked in the presence of the anti-vax1 serum?</italic></p><p>We provide results showing that anti-Vax1 antibody sequestered secreted Vax1 from COS7 cells and blocked the transfer of Vax1 into retinal axons.

From the graphic, one cannot intuit the process of Vax attachment to HSPGs on RGC surface, then enhancement of growth during midline crossing</italic>.</p><p>We presented this simplified model owing to limited space as a sub-figure, i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>. We present a detailed diagram in a separate figure, i.e. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, reflecting the reviewer’s requests in following.</p><p><italic>The various interactions might be broken into steps (attachment of Vax to HSPGs, then internalization, followed by retrograde transport to the cell body and/or action locally in the growth cone, finally axon extension)?</italic></p><p><italic>The growth cone should be enlarged, and perhaps use a different icon for the guidance molecules</italic>.</p><p><italic>Sema6D is not a repellant for ipsilateral axons; it belongs with NrCAM on the contralateral axons</italic>.</p><p>We apologize for omitting Sema6D in the contralateral cues. Sema6D is indeed a context-dependent cue for RGC axons rather than simple an attractive or repulsive cue as Erskine <italic>et al.</italic> (2013) showed. It repels RGC axons in the absence of NrCAM and Plexin A1. To avoid confusion, we simplified the attractive cues as NrCAM and VEGF164 in our revised model diagram (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) In the rebuttal, major point 7: The co-culture assays with knockout vHT and Robo1-Fc should be included in the manuscript; these are important data and should not be hidden only for reviewers' inspection</italic>.</p><p>Following the reviewer’s suggestion, we included this figure in the paper. The reason that we provided this for reviewers’ inspection only was not for hiding but for making the paper compact. The original paper already had a large body with 9 figures, 9 figure supplements, and 2 video files. We were afraid that our readers would be overwhelmed by the large amount of data. In the revised paper, we provide all “reviewers’ inspection only” figures as figure supplements.</p><p><italic>3) Response to minor point 7 is a little dismissive and unsatisfactory. The DiI labeling in the images of cryosectioned DiI is so fuzzy/overexposed/difficult to see clearly, that they would be better off just using the cytoarchitecture to determine the location of the RGC axon bundle. As is, the DiI quality distracts from the overall point of the figure. If the immunostaining is more important for them to show, as they indicate, they should focus on that and orient things based on cytoarchitecture, which should be sufficient to locate the axon bundles, and just leave out the DiI altogether</italic>.</p><p>We removed DiI fluorescence images from dark field images in the figures as the reviewer suggests. We also redraw a schematic diagram of slab experiment in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> (please see a drawing in top row).</p><p><italic>4) In minor point 10 re:</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2A</italic></xref><italic>: the authors don't address concerns about the quality of the Myc-GFP staining or show higher mag images</italic>.</p><p>We did not use Myc-GFP for control but use 3X-Myc tag in this figure. We have already provided a negative control for anti-Myc antibody on top row (Mock).</p><p><italic>5) In minor point 10 about</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2D</italic></xref><italic>: is it not acceptable to run a negative control on a separate gel</italic>.</p><p>We replaced these with new Western blot bands shown in a same gel.</p><p><italic>6) Response to minor point 10,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3A</italic></xref><italic>. Increasing the concentration of until one sees a response is a bit iffy. The explanation is confusing</italic>.</p><p>We explained more clearly in the revised rebuttal. We also provide a video recorded retinal axons treated with 6X-His-FITC peptide at same weight of Vax1-His-FITC protein (please see <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).</p><p><italic>7) Likewise, the response to minor point 10,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7A&amp;B</italic></xref> <italic>is unsatisfactory. The difficulties in getting good bands with some proteins and antibodies in Western blots is acknowledged. However, these are really very difficult to see and if the authors ran it 4 times and these are the best looking bands, the accuracy and reliability of these bands are questionable. Readers should not have to squint to tell whether or not there is a band present. The images are very grainy and pixelated</italic>.</p><p>We repeated the experiments with rabbit anti-Glp1 and anti-Sdc3 antibodies from different company sources, and replaced those with new results with better qualities (please see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p><italic>8) The response to Major point 9 is “hand-wavy”... Are the authors trying to say that, yes, they think Vax1 actions are both chemotrophic and chemotropic, or are they undecided? As it currently reads, these statements are weak</italic>.</p><p>Although we believed Vax1 is mainly a chemotrophic factor, which stimulates RGC axon growth in a non-direction selective manner, we could not rule out a possible chemotropic activity in a certain condition such that Vax1 can bind to unidentified receptors that turn on intracellular signal cascades. However, our current results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) decline the latter chemotropic activity of Vax1. We therefore answered more clearly by changing our rebuttal (please see our revised rebuttal to Substantive concern #9).</p><p>Reviewer 2: <italic>Overall, I think the manuscript is much improved, particularly with respect to grammar and inclusion of appropriate references and added discussion points. The authors have addressed most of the concerns to an acceptable level, and I would support the acceptance of the paper, pending addressing the following points:</italic></p><p><italic>Regarding substantive concerns point 2: Although NrCAM and VegfA are expressed in the Vax1-/- chiasm, the morphology of the chiasm is clearly abnormal (Figure A.B and Supplemental Figure 1). In the text, the authors state: “The development of these OC-forming cells was normal in Vax1-deficient (Vax1-/-) mice (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2"><italic>Bertuzzi et al, 1999</italic></xref><italic>) (Figure 9 1A,B; bottom rows), suggesting that the impairment in OC development in Vax1-deficient mice is not caused by the lack of OC-forming vHT cells but rather by a loss of RGC attractant molecules in these cells ”. It would be more accurate to state: “Although the morphology of the chiasm is abnormal in Vax1-/- deficient mice, the OC-forming cells and several chiasm localized cues (NrCAM, VegfA) are present</italic>.<italic>”</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion and changed the expression in the text.</p><p><italic>Also regarding substantive concerns point 2, with respect to the point about HSPGs functioning as co-receptors for other secreted proteins, I think the authors missed the reviewers' point. If I understand correctly, they were asked to consider whether Vax1/HSPGs co-localize with known cell surface receptors that may mediate internalization of Vax1. In addition, the co-localization of Vax1 and Sdc3 in RGC axons in tissue sections is pretty dirty and the co-localization isn't very convincing. Have the authors tried this in cultured RGCs? This might improve the quality of the images</italic>.</p><p>We replaced these with co-staining images with Vax1/NF160/Sdc3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>.</p><p><italic>Regarding substantive concerns point 5: Despite the fact that Vax2 is not secreted, the ability of recombinant Vax2 to be internalized and induce axonal growth strengthens the findings of the paper. These data should be included in the manuscript as a supplemental figure, at the least</italic>.</p><p>We included the results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3–figure supplement 3</xref>.</p><p><italic>Regarding substantive concerns point 8: While the authors nicely showed that Vax1 and Slit compete with one another for binding to HSPGs, they did not show whether addition of Slit blocks Vax1's ability to induce translation in axons. Did the authors do this experiment?</italic></p><p>We have done the experiments but failed to observe the inhibition of translation (data not shown). It might be related with Slit-Robo also induces local translational for RGC axon growth cone repulsion.</p><p><italic>Regarding substantive concerns point 9: The authors should include the data showing that the Vax1 antibody blocks the function of Vax1 secreted from Cos7 cells as supplemental data</italic>.</p><p>We included the results as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3–figure supplement 2</xref>.</p><p><italic>Regarding minor concern 7: If this is the best image for IP experiments, perhaps the authors could complement the experiments by using overexpression of tagged constructs for Sdc2, Sdc3, Pax2 and Glp1 or by performing the reverse IP if antibodies are available</italic>.</p><p>We replaced these with new results with better qualities (please see revised <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).</p><p><italic>In general, the proposed model of Vax1 action in RGC axons is still a bit confusing. Does it primarily function as a promoter of axonal growth via increased translation, or by competing with Slit binding to HSPGs? While these need not be mutually exclusive, I'm still a little unclear as to what the Slit/Robo data adds to the model, since Slit doesn't function as a general inhibitor of growth, but rather functions as a repulsive cue from the surrounding tissue</italic>.</p><p>We apologize to leave this part still unclear. This can be clarified by removing unnecessary sentences that we had added in the rebuttal as well as in the manuscript. As we answered to reviewer #1, the main activity of Vax1 for RGC axon growth is a promoter of axonal growth via local protein synthesis than HSPG binding. We also redrew a hypothetical model diagram by explaining HSPGs binding of Vax1, cell penetration, and stimulating local translation in detail (please see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).</p></body></sub-article></article>
