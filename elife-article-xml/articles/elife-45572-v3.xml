However, most studies have been performed in cancer cells, where co-occurring mutations and tumor selective pressures complicate the influence of NRF2 on metabolism. Here we use genetically engineered, non-transformed primary murine cells to isolate the most immediate effects of NRF2 on cellular metabolism. We find that NRF2 promotes the accumulation of intracellular cysteine and engages the cysteine homeostatic control mechanism mediated by cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1), which catalyzes the irreversible metabolism of cysteine to cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA). Notably, <italic>CDO1</italic> is preferentially silenced by promoter methylation in human non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) harboring mutations in KEAP1, the negative regulator of NRF2. CDO1 silencing promotes proliferation of NSCLC by limiting the futile metabolism of cysteine to the wasteful and toxic byproducts CSA and sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>), and depletion of cellular NADPH. Thus, CDO1 is a metabolic liability for NSCLC cells with high intracellular cysteine, particularly NRF2/KEAP1 mutant cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45572.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancers form in humans and other animals when cells of the body develop mutations that allow them to grow and divide uncontrollably. The set of chemical reactions happening inside cancer cells, referred to as “metabolism”, can be very different to metabolism in the healthy cells they originate from. Some of these differences are directly caused by mutations, while others are a result of the environment surrounding the cancer cells as they develop into a tumor.</p><p>A protein called NRF2 is often overactive in human tumors due to mutations in its inhibitor protein KEAP1. Previous studies have shown that NRF2 changes the metabolism of cancer cells by switching specific genes on or off. However, since cancer cells also have other mutations that could mask or amplify some of the effects of NRF2, the precise role of this protein in metabolism remains unclear.</p><p>To address this question, Kang et al. generated mice that could switch between producing the normal KEAP1 protein or a mutant version that is unable to inhibit NRF2. The mouse model was then used to examine the immediate effects of activating the NRF2 protein. This revealed that NRF2 altered how mouse cells used a molecule called cysteine, which is required to make proteins and other cell components. When NRF2 was active, some of the cysteine molecules were converted into two wasteful and toxic particles by an enzyme called CDO1.</p><p>Kang et al. found that inactivating CDO1 in human lung cancer cells prevented these wasteful particles from being produced. This allows cancer cells to grow more rapidly, and may explain why human tumors generally evolve to shut down CDO1.</p><p>The findings of Kang et al. show that not all of the changes in metabolism caused by individual mutations in cancer cells help tumors to grow. As a tumor develops it may need to acquire further mutations to override the negative effects of these changes in metabolism. In the future these findings may help researchers develop new therapies that reactivate or mimic CDO1 to limit the growth of tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KEAP1</kwd><kwd>NRF2</kwd><kwd>CDO1</kwd><kwd>sulfite</kwd><kwd>cysteine</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R37-CA230042</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeNicola</surname><given-names>Gina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100002590</institution-id><institution>American Lung Association</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LCDA-498544</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeNicola</surname><given-names>Gina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009164</institution-id><institution>Moffitt Cancer Center</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Milestone Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeNicola</surname><given-names>Gina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Institutional Research Grant</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>DeNicola</surname><given-names>Gina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00-CA194314</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dibble</surname><given-names>Christian C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>By increasing intracellular cysteine levels, NRF2 engages a tumor suppressive metabolic pathway mediated by cysteine dioxygenase 1.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>NRF2 (Nuclear factor-erythroid 2 p45-related factor two or NFE2L2) is a stress-responsive cap’n’collar (CNC) basic region leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor that directs various transcriptional programs in response to oxidative stress. Under basal conditions, NRF2 is kept inactive through binding to its negative regulator KEAP1 (Kelch-like ECH-associated protein), which is a redox-regulated substrate adaptor for the Cullin (Cul)3-RING-box protein (Rbx)1 ubiquitin ligase complex that directs NRF2 for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kobayashi et al., 2004</xref>). KEAP1 is the major repressor of NRF2 in most cell types, which is supported by the evidence that disruption of <italic>Keap1</italic> in the mouse increased the abundance and activity of Nrf2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wakabayashi et al., 2003</xref>). NRF2 plays a critical role in tumor initiation and progression in response to oncogenic signaling and stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeNicola et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Todoric et al., 2017</xref>). Further, NRF2 and KEAP1 mutations are common in many cancers and lead to impaired NRF2 degradation and constitutive NRF2 accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ohta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shibata et al., 2008</xref>), thereby promoting glutathione (GSH) synthesis, detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and proliferation.</p><p>While the role of NRF2 in ROS detoxification is well established, novel roles of NRF2 in the regulation of cellular metabolism have been recently identified. NRF2 promotes the activity of the pentose phosphate pathway to support the production of NADPH and nucleotides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mitsuishi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Singh et al., 2013</xref>). Further, NRF2 promotes serine biosynthesis to support GSH and nucleotide production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">DeNicola et al., 2015</xref>). These metabolic programs support cell proliferation and tumor growth but not all metabolic consequences of NRF2 activation are favorable. Although uptake of cystine (CYS)<sub>2</sub> via the xCT antiporter (system x<sub>c</sub><sup>-</sup>) promotes GSH synthesis and antioxidant defense (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>), it also induces glutamate export and limits glutamate for cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sayin et al., 2017</xref>). NRF2 suppresses fatty acid synthesis to conserve NADPH, which may antagonize proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wu et al., 2011</xref>). Importantly, the activity of these metabolic pathways may be influenced by co-occurring mutations found in the model systems used for study, such as LKB1 mutations, which commonly co-occur with KEAP1 mutations and influence NADPH levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jeon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Skoulidis et al., 2015</xref>). Further, NRF2 directs distinct transcriptional programs under basal and stress-inducible conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Malhotra et al., 2010</xref>), complicating the interpretation of its effects on cellular metabolism.</p><p>To examine the immediate consequence of constitutive NRF2 stabilization on cellular metabolism in non-transformed cells, we generated a genetically engineered mouse model expressing the KEAP1<sup>R554Q</sup> loss-of-function mutation found in human lung cancer. Using this model, we have examined the control of cellular metabolism by NRF2 in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) and find that NRF2 promotes the accumulation of intracellular cysteine (CYS) and sulfur-containing metabolites, including GSH and the intermediates of the taurine (TAU) biosynthesis pathway cysteine sulfinic acid (CSA) and hypotaurine (HTAU). Entry of CYS into the TAU synthesis pathway was mediated by cysteine dioxygenase 1 (CDO1), which was elevated in KEAP1<sup>R554Q</sup> MEFs. TAU synthesis is initiated by the irreversible metabolism of CYS by CDO1 to CSA, which is then decarboxylated by cysteine sulfinic acid decarboxylase (CSAD) to HTAU. In turn, HTAU is non-enzymatically converted to TAU, or CSA is transaminated by the cytosolic aspartate aminotransferase (GOT1) to produce β-sulfinyl pyruvate, which spontaneously decomposes to pyruvate and sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>). At the organismal level, decarboxylation of CSA via CSAD predominates over transamination by GOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weinstein et al., 1988</xref>). By contrast, lung cancer cell lines accumulated significant CYS due to epigenetic silencing of the <italic>CDO1</italic> locus. CDO1 re-expression antagonized proliferation and promoted the metabolism of CYS to CSA, but surprisingly most CSA was exported from cells or transaminated to produce toxic SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Further, continual (CYS)<sub>2</sub> reduction to replenish the CYS pool impaired NADPH-dependent cellular processes. These results demonstrate that CDO1 antagonizes the proliferation of lung cancer cells with high intracellular CYS and its expression is selected against during tumor evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NRF2 promotes the accumulation of sulfur-containing metabolites</title><p>To evaluate how constitutive NRF2 activity reprograms metabolism, we generated a genetically engineered, conditional knock-in mouse model of the cancer mutation KEAP1<sup>R554Q</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Mutations at this residue prevent the association of KEAP1 with NRF2, thereby stabilizing NRF2 and inducing the expression of NRF2 target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hast et al., 2014</xref>). We inserted a loxP-flanked wild-type <italic>Keap1</italic> cDNA upstream of the R554Q mutation in exon four in the endogenous <italic>Keap1</italic> gene. Prior to exposure to Cre recombinase, wild-type Keap1 protein is expressed. Following Cre-mediated excision of the loxP-flanked cargo, mutant Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> is expressed at physiological levels, thus recapitulating the genetic events of human NSCLC and allowing for the interrogation of the consequences of Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> expression in an isogenic system. Mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) harboring this allele were derived to evaluate the consequence of Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> expression in primary cells. The expression of homozygous <italic>Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup></italic> led to Nrf2 accumulation and increased expression of the Nrf2 target Nqo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We performed non-targeted metabolomics to identify metabolite alterations in these cells and found that the most abundant metabolites following Nrf2 accumulation are sulfur-containing metabolites derived from CYS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), while infection of wild-type MEFs with adenoviral Cre did not significantly alter metabolite levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To interrogate cysteine metabolism in more detail, we performed targeted metabolomics to quantify the concentration of intracellular CYS and its downstream metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). As expected, Nrf2 promoted an increase in intracellular CYS and its downstream metabolite GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), consistent with previous observations that NRF2 promotes the uptake of (CYS)<sub>2</sub> and the synthesis of GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sasaki et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wild et al., 1999</xref>). Surprisingly, we also observed a significant increase in intermediates of the TAU biosynthesis pathway, including CSA and HTAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–I</xref>). Importantly, HTAU is a highly abundant metabolite and the increase of HTAU was similar to the increase of GSH in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,H</xref>), suggesting that entry into the TAU biosynthesis pathway may represent a significant percentage of total CYS usage. Collectively, these results indicate that NRF2 promotes the accumulation of intracellular cysteine and entry of cysteine into multiple downstream pathways.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45572.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Nrf2 promotes the accumulation of intracellular cysteine and sulfur-containing metabolites.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic of the murine Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> allele.

We observed a robust increase in Cdo1 protein in Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> MEFs compared to Keap1<sup>WT</sup> MEFs in the absence of an increase in mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>), consistent with the known mechanism of Cdo1 regulation. To examine whether Cdo1 mediates CYS metabolism to CSA and HTAU, and whether this limits the use of CYS for GSH synthesis, we deleted Cdo1 with CRISPR/Cas9, followed by infection with empty or Cre expressing adenovirus to generate Cdo1-deficient, isogenic Keap1<sup>WT</sup> and Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> MEFs. Western analysis of Cdo1 protein revealed a significant reduction of Cdo1 expression in Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> MEFs, although the already low Cdo1 levels did not change significantly in Keap1<sup>WT</sup> MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). We performed quantitative <sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>-cystine [(CYS)<sub>2</sub>] tracing to examine the entry of CYS into GSH and TAU synthesis and found that depletion of Cdo1 inhibited HTAU synthesis from CYS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,I</xref>). However, HTAU labeling was not completely abolished, which may be explained by incomplete Cdo1 deletion or Cdo1-independent HTAU synthesis from CYS via CoA breakdown, which cannot be distinguished by this method.

To evaluate this possibility, we examined the expression of <italic>CDO1</italic> in NSCLC patient samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). CDO1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in lung adenocarcinoma samples compared to normal lung (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), which was associated with <italic>CDO1</italic> promoter methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and poor prognosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

First, we used NRF2-deficient A549 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torrente et al., 2017</xref>), in which we restored NRF2 expression in combination with CDO1<sup>WT</sup>, CDO1<sup>Y157F</sup>, or GFP. NRF2 restoration in these cells led to higher expression of endogenous xCT and accumulation of ectopically expressed CDO1 compared to GFP control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, we selected the two KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> NSCLC cell lines that had the lowest ectopic CDO1 accumulation and low intracellular CYS in our cell line panel, H1299 and H1975. Using a NRF2<sup>T80K</sup> mutant that is unable to bind KEAP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berger et al., 2017</xref>), the effects of NRF2 on CDO1 accumulation were recapitulated in these KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> NSCLC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Interestingly, we observed that NRF2<sup>T80K</sup> could also promote the accumulation of endogenous CDO1 in H1299 cells. Further, NRF2 stabilization with the ROS inducing agent β-lapachone promoted NRF2, CYS and CDO1 accumulation in H1299 and H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A,B</xref>), which was most pronounced the day following the 4 hr treatment window. Consistently, NRF2 depletion in KEAP1<sup>MUT</sup> NSCLC cells following KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> expression led to CDO1 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), although the effects were more modest than what was observed with NRF2 activation. Notably, NRF2 expression promoted intracellular CYS accumulation, while NRF2 depletion impaired CYS accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>), supporting a role for intracellular CYS in CDO1 stabilization. To directly assess the requirement for CYS, A549 cells were cultured in high or low (CYS)<sub>2</sub> and CDO1 levels were found to be dependent on CYS availability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined the consequence of CDO1 expression on cellular proliferation. Using the isogenic NRF2 KO A549 cell system, we observed that CDO1 expression significantly impaired the proliferation of NRF2-expressing cells, while no effect was observed on NRF2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). Looking more broadly, we observed that CDO1 expression generally antagonized the proliferation of NSCLC cell lines and proliferation inhibition was strongly correlated with CDO1 protein expression, but not RNA expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3D,E</xref>). Overall, these results demonstrate that NRF2 and other mechanisms of intracellular CYS accumulation promote CDO1 accumulation, which leads to a selective growth disadvantage in lung cancer cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>CDO1 depletes CYS, leading to its export as CSA</title><p>To evaluate the mechanism by which CDO1 expression impaired proliferation we interrogated CYS metabolism following CDO1 expression. CYS has multiple intracellular fates, including the synthesis of GSH. CDO1 metabolizes CYS to CSA, which is then decarboxylated to HTAU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). CDO1<sup>WT</sup> and CDO1<sup>Y157F</sup>-expressing A549 cells were fed fresh (CYS)<sub>2</sub>-containing medium and sulfur containing metabolites were quantified over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–D</xref>). CDO1<sup>WT</sup>, but not the enzyme-inactive CDO1<sup>Y157F</sup>, limited intracellular CYS levels and promoted the accumulation of CSA, which peaked at 4 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We observed a steady increase in both CDO1<sup>Y157F</sup> and CDO1<sup>WT</sup> protein over the 24 hr time period, although CDO1<sup>WT</sup> protein levels were lower, consistent with the intracellular CYS levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Interestingly, unlike what was observed in MEFs, the levels of GSH, HTAU, and TAU were not changed over the time course of this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We also interrogated metabolite changes in the medium and observed that (CYS)<sub>2</sub> was rapidly depleted from the medium by 24 hr, while CSA steadily accumulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Based on this time course, 4 hr was selected for all subsequent experiments to prevent (CYS)<sub>2</sub> starvation by CDO1. Importantly, deletion of endogenous CDO1 in H1581 cells reduced CSA production and (CYS)<sub>2</sub> consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E,F</xref>). To examine the NRF2-dependence of these metabolite alterations, we utilized the NRF2<sup>KO</sup> cells, KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> cells, or KEAP1<sup>MUT</sup> cells from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>. NRF2 promoted CSA accumulation and (CYS)<sub>2</sub> consumption following CDO1<sup>WT</sup> expression in NRF2 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G,H</xref>). This effect was recapitulated by NRF2<sup>T80K</sup> expression in KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I,J</xref>). Consistently, NRF2 depletion by KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> expression in KEAP1<sup>MUT</sup> cells inhibited the CDO1-dependent production of CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K–M</xref>). Interestingly, KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> expression did not robustly affect CDO1 protein levels in H322 cells but significantly impaired CSA production by CDO1. Intracellular CYS can also influence CDO1 activity promoting its catalytic efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dominy et al., 2008</xref>), which may explain these results. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CDO1 expression promotes the production of CSA from CYS, leading to CSA accumulation both intracellularly and extracellularly, and enhanced (CYS)<sub>2</sub> consumption.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45572.017</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>CDO1 depletes cyst(e)ine, leading to its export as CSA.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Schematic depicting intracellular cysteine metabolism.

Further, the accumulation of the product of the sulfitolysis reaction, cysteine-S-sulfate (CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup>), was also observed in the medium of CDO1<sup>WT</sup>-expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed that CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> appeared earlier than SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and stopped accumulating once (CYS)<sub>2</sub> levels were depleted, suggesting that SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> reacted with (CYS)<sub>2</sub> in a rapid and complete manner. To test this possibility, we incubated either CSA or sodium sulfite (Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>) with culture medium in the absence of cells, and observed rapid and robust conversion of (CYS)<sub>2</sub> to CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> by Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>), but not CSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), within 5 min. Interestingly, similar depletion kinetics in this experiment could also be observed by substituting (CYS)<sub>2</sub> with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), although intracellular and extracellular levels of GSSG in cell culture were much lower than (CYS)<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>), suggesting it is not the major target of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. These results demonstrate that SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> is generated downstream of CDO1 and rapidly reacts with (CYS)<sub>2</sub>, thereby depleting (CYS)<sub>2</sub> from the culture media.</p><p>To evaluate whether SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> production was a consequence of our CDO1 overexpression system, we transduced Keap1<sup>WT</sup> and Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> MEFs with our inducible CDO1 vectors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Consistent with its regulation by intracellular CYS, ectopic CDO1 expression was significantly higher in Keap1<sup>R554Q</sup> MEFs compared to Keap1<sup>WT</sup> MEFs. While CDO1 overexpression promoted the accumulation of intracellular CSA and HTAU, and the depletion of CYS and GSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–G</xref>), we did not observe the production of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> or CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> in MEFs (data not shown). Interestingly, MEFs express lower Got1 but higher Csad protein compared to A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and NSCLC cell lines were uniformly low for CSAD and high for GOT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>) suggesting that expression of CSA metabolic enzymes may be a key determining factor in the generation of HTAU vs. SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>. Importantly, deletion of endogenous CDO1 in H1581 cells resulted in a dramatic reduction in CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), thereby demonstrating that SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> is generated by CDO1 under physiological expression levels in lung cells.</p><p>To examine the NRF2-dependence of (CYS)<sub>2</sub> depletion via SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, we utilized the NRF2 KO cells, KEAP1<sup>WT</sup>, and KEAP1<sup>MUT</sup> cell lines. NRF2 promoted CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production following CDO1<sup>WT</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), which was accompanied by significant accumulation of both intracellular and extracellular SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B,C</xref>). These findings were recapitulated in KEAP1<sup>WT</sup> and KEAP1<sup>MUT</sup> NSCLC cell lines expressing NRF2<sup>T80K</sup> or following KEAP1 restoration, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–K</xref>), with the exception of H322, which maintained CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> production following KEAP1 restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3G</xref>). While KEAP1 restoration in these cells significantly reduced CSA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>), unlike A549 and H1944, intracellular CSA levels in H322 cells were still in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D–F</xref>), suggesting that CSA transamination by GOT1 was saturated. Further, NRF2 stabilization with β-lapachone promoted CDO1-dependent CSA and CYS-SO<sub>3</sub><sup>-</sup> production and (CYS)<sub>2</sub> depletion in H1299 and H1975 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3H–J</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that NRF2 induces CDO1-mediated sulfitolysis, thereby depleting extracellular (CYS)<sub>2</sub> in NSCLC cells.</p><p>Next, we examined the toxicity of CDO1 products to NSCLC cell lines. Treatment of cells with CSA and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub>, but not HTAU, led to cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4A</xref>). We found that (CYS)<sub>2</sub> starvation and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> treatment were universally toxic to NSCLC cell lines, which did not depend on NRF2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4B,C</xref>). In addition, CDO1, CSA and Na<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>3</sub> sensitized A549 cells to oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s4">Figure 5—figure supplement 4D,E</xref>), consistent with their ability to deplete (CYS)<sub>2</sub>. Collectively, these results demonstrate that CSA and SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> are toxic to NSCLC cells regardless of NRF2 activity, suggesting that resistance to (CYS)<sub>2</sub> starvation is not an inherent phenotype of NRF2<sup>HIGH</sup> cells. Rather, they are sensitive to CDO1 expression due to high intracellular CYS and CDO1 stabilization.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Sulfitolysis is not required for the inhibition of proliferation by CDO1</title><p>To evaluate the role of GOT1 in CDO1-dependent sulfitolysis and cell growth inhibition, we generated GOT1 KO A549 and H460 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

After (CYS)<sub>2</sub> enters cells through its transporter xCT, it must be reduced to two CYS molecules using NADPH as the electron donor. As such, we hypothesized that the continual reduction of (CYS)<sub>2</sub> to CYS in CDO1-expressing cells would consume a significant amount of cellular NADPH. Indeed, we observed that the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio was lower following CDO1 expression in both GOT1 KO and GOT1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Consistently, (CYS)<sub>2</sub> starvation had the opposite effect on the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio, which increased following starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). NADPH is critical for both antioxidant defense and cellular biosynthetic processes. While we found that the decrease in the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio did not dramatically influence the levels of GSH and GSSG in non-stressed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), expression of CDO1 increased sensitivity to the lipid peroxidation inducer cumene hydroperoxide (CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) independent of GOT1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and CDO1 deletion in H1581 cells promoted CuH<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> resistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we placed cells into detached conditions, which has been shown to increase reliance on IDH1-dependent reductive carboxylation to promote NADPH generation in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiang et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, CDO1 expression significantly impaired the ability of NSCLC cell lines to grow in soft agar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we examined the consequence of the altered NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio on NADPH-dependent metabolic reactions. Using <sup>13</sup>C<sub>5</sub>-glutamine tracing, we observed that glutamine readily entered the TCA cycle to produce M + 4 citrate, which was unaffected or increased following CDO1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>), but CDO1 impaired both NADPH-dependent synthesis of proline from glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and NADPH-dependent reductive carboxylation of α-ketoglutarate to produce M + 5 citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). The antiproliferative effects of CDO1 were CYS-dependent, as either inhibition of (CYS)<sub>2</sub> uptake with erastin or low (CYS)<sub>2</sub> conditions resulted in loss of CDO1 expression and completely rescued the CDO1-induced proliferation defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>).

The carbon, nitrogen and sulfur atoms are incorporated into protein, GSH, TAU and CoA. Further, the sulfur atom of cysteine is incorporated into iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters. CYS is generally thought to be more limiting than glycine or glutamate for GSH synthesis in most tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stipanuk et al., 2006</xref>). CDO1 plays a critical role in limiting CYS availability and toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jurkowska et al., 2014</xref>). CYS promotes both the stability and activity of CDO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stipanuk et al., 2009</xref>), leading to the irreversible metabolism of CYS to CSA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stipanuk et al., 2009</xref>). This mechanism of regulation prevents toxicity associated with CYS accumulation. However, the contribution of this regulatory process to CYS availability in cancer was not well understood.</p><p>Our findings implicate CDO1 as a metabolic liability for lung tumor cells with high intracellular CYS levels, particularly those with NRF2/KEAP1 mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). We find that high intracellular CYS levels are a common feature of lung cancer cell lines, suggesting that NRF2-independent mechanisms exist to promote (CYS)<sub>2</sub>/CYS uptake. Indeed, (CYS)<sub>2</sub> uptake is regulated by many signaling pathways, including EGFR, mTORC2 and p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tsuchihashi et al., 2016</xref>). Further, de novo CYS synthesis via the transsulfuration pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Prigge et al., 2017</xref>), direct CYS transport, or decreased CYS utilization may play a role in CYS accumulation. Notably, CDO1 promoter methylation is common across multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brait et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jeschke et al., 2013</xref>) raising the possibility that CDO1 antagonizes the proliferation or viability of other cancers through similar mechanisms. We find that CDO1 promotes the wasting of the carbon, nitrogen and sulfur molecules of CYS as CSA and SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, promotes (CYS)<sub>2</sub> depletion by SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>, and induces depletion of NADPH. Any of these mechanisms could contribute to its growth suppressive function in vivo, but additional work is needed to evaluate the consequence of CDO1 loss in the relevant tumor microenvironment. Importantly, while limited GSSG is present in our cells and media, Sullivan et al. find that GSSG levels may exceed (Cys)<sub>2</sub> levels in murine tumor interstitial fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sullivan et al., 2019</xref>), suggesting that GSSG may be a major target of SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>in vivo.

Normal intracellular CYS concentrations are approximately 100 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stipanuk et al., 2006</xref>), around the Km for GCLC for CYS and typically an order of magnitude lower than GSH levels, consistent with our observed concentrations in wild-type MEFs. However, in many cases KEAP1 mutant NSCLC cell lines and even some KEAP1 wild-type lines accumulated CYS to millimolar levels without any apparent toxicity. CYS toxicity is a poorly described phenomenon that has been attributed to the reactivity of the free thiol on the CYS molecule, the production of hydrogen sulfide (H<sub>2</sub>S), autooxidation and free radical formation, and other mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stipanuk et al., 2006</xref>). More work is needed to understand whether high intracellular CYS levels are a vulnerability of CDO1-silenced cancer cells as a consequence of these mechanisms, or whether there is an advantage to high intracellular CYS.</p><p>We observe that Cdo1 modestly limits GSH synthesis in MEFs, similar to what has been demonstrated in the liver, where deletion of Cdo1 in vivo resulted in the accumulation of CYS and GSH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roman et al., 2013</xref>). By contrast, CDO1 depleted intracellular CYS but did not limit GSH synthesis or other CYS-dependent processes in NSCLC cell lines. One potential explanation for this difference is that cancer cells are more efficient at maintaining intracellular CYS levels and/or GSH synthesis. While more efficient maintenance of intracellular CYS is an advantage for CYS-dependent metabolism, it is also a liability because considerable resources in the form of reducing power must be committed to continually reduce (CYS)<sub>2</sub> to replenish the CYS pool. Although we do not know the rate of NADPH production in our cell lines, comparison with NADPH production rates in other lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2014</xref>) suggest that CDO1-dependent (CYS)<sub>2</sub> consumption would consume a significant fraction of the cellular NADPH produced, consistent with our observations.</p><p>Interestingly, we find that CSA is differentially metabolized in cancer cells and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, which correlates with differential expression of CSAD and GOT1. Partitioning between the decarboxylation and transamination reactions is likely influenced by the levels and activities of CSAD and GOT1, but this is not well studied. Evaluation of CSA metabolism at the organismal level has shown that decarboxylation of CSA via CSAD predominates over transamination by GOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weinstein et al., 1988</xref>) but little is known about this partitioning in individual tissues. Consistently, CSAD has a lower Km for CSA than GOT1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Recasens et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wu, 1982</xref>). Importantly, HTAU and TAU are non-toxic molecules that have important physiological functions in controlling osmolarity, mitochondrial function, cellular redox, and other processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aruoma et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schaffer et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>). TAU biosynthesis is not a required process in non-hepatic tissues, however, as adequate TAU is supplied from the liver via the blood supply (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stipanuk, 2004</xref>). By contrast, SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> is toxic in large quantities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Menzel et al., 1986</xref>) and thus excessive CSA transamination is likely disadvantageous in most cell types. Interestingly, hemorrhagic pulmonary edema is a consequence of sulfur dioxide exposure in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Charan et al., 1979</xref>), and additional work is needed to determine if Cdo1-mediated SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup> production is the cause of lung hemorrhage in the Keap1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup> mice. It is unclear what function the CSA transamination reaction serves for cells. Unlike the decarboxylation pathway, it retains carbon and nitrogen intracellularly as pyruvate and glutamate. Sulfite oxidase (SUOX) can reduce sulfite (SO<sub>3</sub><sup>2-</sup>) to sulfate (SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2-</sup>), which is an important precursor for sulfation-based detoxification of phenols, hydroxylamines, or alcohols to sulfate esters. Sulfation is also an important post-translational modification of proteins.</p><p>There are currently several approaches being developed to target aberrant CYS metabolism in cancer, including NRF2/KEAP1 mutant cancer. Despite their increased antioxidant capacity, KEAP1 mutant cells are still sensitive to (CYS)<sub>2</sub> starvation, which could be targeted with cyst(e)inase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cramer et al., 2017</xref>). Further, (CYS)<sub>2</sub> uptake via xCT results in a central carbon imbalance and dependence on glutamine that can be targeted with glutaminase inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Romero et al., 2017</xref>). Our findings suggest excessive (CYS)<sub>2</sub> uptake can also impair NADPH-dependent processes and activating CDO1 expression may have unique therapeutic potential compared to (CYS)<sub>2</sub>-depleting strategies. We find that Cdo1 accumulates in tumors from our Keap1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup> mutant lung cancer GEMM, which is correlated with a block in lung tumor formation. Further work is needed to determine whether Cdo1 impairs tumorigenesis in this model, and to evaluate the consequences of strategies to induce CDO1 expression on tumor growth and metabolism in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Alternatively, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, washed and dried. Crystal violet was solubilized in 10% acetic acid and the OD<sub>600</sub> was measured. Relative cell number was normalized to untreated cells. Experiments were repeated more than twice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Cell proliferation assays</title><p>Prior to the start of the proliferation assay, cells were treated with 0.25 μg/mL doxycycline for 2 days to induce CDO1 or GFP expression. Cells were seeded at 5,000 cells/well in 96-well plates and allowed to proliferate for the indicated time points. Plates were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde, stained with crystal violet, washed and dried. Crystal violet was solubilized in 10% acetic acid and the OD<sub>600</sub> was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Lysates were prepared in RIPA buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate) containing protease inhibitors (Roche complete). Protein concentrations were determined by the DC protein assay (Bio-Rad). Lysates were mixed with 6X sample buffer containing β-ME and separated by SDS-PAGE using NuPAGE 4–12% Bis-Tris gels (Invitrogen), followed by transfer to 0.45 μm Nitrocellulose membranes (GE Healthcare). The membranes were blocked in 5% non-fat milk in TBST, followed by immunoblotting. During this study, the Abcam CDO1 antibody was discontinued. The CDO1 antibody from Sigma Aldrich provides similar results for human and mouse CDO1 (data not shown).</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup>assay</title><p>NSCLC cells were plated in 6 cm dishes and analyzed at 70% confluence. 4 hr prior to harvest, cell culture medium was changed to fresh media. Cells were extracted and the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio was measured using the NADP/NADPH-Glo Assay kit (Promega) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Protein synthesis assay</title><p>Protein synthesis analysis was performed using the Click-It HPG Alexa Fluor 488 Protein Synthesis Assay Kit (Life Technologies). Briefly, cells were treated with doxycycline (0.25 μg/mL) for 24 hr, then seeded into black walled, clear bottom 96-well tissue culture plates at 20,000 cells/well in doxycycline-containing media. The following day, cells were treated with HPG (1 μg/mL) in methionine-free DMEM (10% dFBS, 1% Pen/Strep, 10 mM HEPES). Cycloheximide (50 μg/mL) treatment was included as a positive control. After 4 hr, the cells were fixed with 3.7% formaldehyde in PBS for 15 min at room temperature, and stained according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The fluorescence signal (ex/em: 475/520 nm) was measured using a Glomax plate reader (Promega), followed by staining with crystal violet. The fluorescence signal was normalized to the crystal violet absorbance value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Soft agar assays</title><p>Soft agar assays were performed in triplicate in 6-well dishes. A 1 mL base layer of 0.8% agar in RPMI was plated and allowed to solidify, then 5,000 cells/well were plated in 0.4% agar on top. The following day, 1 mL of RPMI was added to each well, and changed as needed. Colonies were allowed to form for 10–14 days, and wells were stained with 0.01% crystal violet in a 4%PFA/PBS solution. Plates were scanned on a flatbed scanner and colonies quantified with Image J.</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Data were analyzed using a two-sided unpaired Student’s t test unless otherwise noted. GraphPad Prism seven software was used for all statistical analyses, and values of p&lt;0.05 were considered statistically significant (*p&lt;0.05; **p&lt;0.01; ***p&lt;0.001, ****p&lt;0.0001. In some figures with multiple comparisons # is used in addition to *). The mean ± standard error of experiments performed in at least triplicate is reported. Similar variances between groups were observed for all experiments. Normal distribution of samples was not determined.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Florian Karreth and Isaac Harris for critical reading of the manuscript and Sae Bom Lee for laboratory assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by Sean Morrison as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Mara Sherman (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the effects of NRF2 activation on cell metabolism, focusing on its impact on cysteine metabolism. It finds that NRF2 promotes cystine uptake, leading to cysteine increases in cells and engagement of cysteine breakdown pathways involving CDO1. This has the consequence of producing the toxic products CSA and sulfite. As a result, they argue that loss of CDO1 expression in NRF2 active cancer cells, primarily through promoter methylation, occurs to suppress the formation of these toxic byproducts. Loss of CDO1 appears to be strongly selected for in cancers with KEAP1 mutations (which activate NRF2) and provides a mechanism to explain a metabolic adaptation and may have therapeutic implications.</p><p>The reviewers were generally positive about publication of this study, but felt consideration of the following points would improve the manuscript. Most involve text changes, but there are a couple points that should be experimentally addressed, if possible.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose that CDO1 promoter methylation and suppression in gene expression is more prevalent in KEAP1 mutant tumors. The data in Figure 3A,B are not very convincing since it appears that all lung tumors (KEAP1 WT or MUT) have decreased CDO1 expression. At a minimum, please discuss how CDO1 loss could benefit tumors that do not have KEAP1 mutations. Some additional work may also shed light on this question. For example, is it possible that many of the WT tumors have NRF2 activation through another mechanism? The authors could use existing NRF2 gene expression signatures (e.g. Goldstein, 2016) to assess the correlation of CDO1 loss with the enrichment of NRF2-driven transcriptional signatures in lung cancer. One reviewer also questioned whether NRF2 stabilization by ROS-dependent post-translational stabilization of NRF2 in KEAP1 WT lung cancer cells might mediate the same level of toxicity of CDO1 re-expression as seen in KEAP1 MUT lung cancer cells? This would be very interesting because it would suggest that the proposed mechanism described in this paper could occur in cancer types with exposure to high levels of ROS and therefore NRF2 activation.</p><p>2) Evidence of a putative growth-suppressive role for CDO1 in lung cancer is not as strong. Cystine tracing results are somewhat subtle (Figure 2E,F,H,I) and suggest that CDO1 is only partly responsible for directing CYS fate into the taurine synthesis pathway and for regulating GSH production in KEAP1-mutant cells, as part of a broader metabolic program. This is further reflected in the GSH, HTAU, and TAU measurements in CDO1 WT vs mutant lung cancer cells in Figure 4C, and the modest change in GSH levels in Figure 5A compared to other relevant metabolites. Importantly, though, CDO1 seems to play an important role in CSA production, and the authors demonstrate that CSA can phenocopy WT CDO1, suppressing cell proliferation and increasing sensitivity to lipid peroxidation. Together, it seems that the data in the study strongly link CDO1 to (CYS)2 uptake and to production of CSA, but further links to the taurine synthesis pathway and impacts on GSH levels are less clear. Revising of language throughout the manuscript to reflect possible alternative mechanisms and to leave room for roles of additional, perhaps compensatory pathways in regulation of cellular GSH levels in this context would be helpful. This is mentioned in the Discussion section in relation to cancer cells, but as effects of CDO1 on GSH production in MEFs are quite subtle, the proposed connection between CDO1 and GSH should be revised throughout the text.</p><p>3) There was a concern raised that complete depletion of cystine (Figure 5—figure supplement 4B) is not physiological and will lead to robust growth suppression in most cells. To further test the proposed mechanism by which the increased uptake of cystine through XCT stabilized CDO1 leading the toxic byproducts, the authors should assess whether pharmacologic or genetic loss of XCT would suppress toxicity by CDO1 complementation. Furthermore, they can also modulate cystine levels in the media to regulate the uptake of cystine by XCT and thus impact intracellular cystine levels and sensitivity to CDO1 re-expression.</p><p>4) Based on many prior studies, KEAP1 mutant cells produce high levels of glutathione and NADPH which create a highly reduced intracellular environment. Furthermore, based on recent data (Cao et al., 2019) NRF2 induces transporters that enable the secretion of glutathione. It is therefore possible that the reactive cysteines of glutathione would also react with the CDO1/GOT1 generated sulfite molecules both intracellularly and extracellularly. Measurement of GSH/GSSG ratios upon re-expression of CDO1 are likely present within their existing LC-MS data. If so, can this be reported? A decrease in the ratio would also be in line with the fact that NADPH/NADP ratio decreases in response to CDO1 re-expression.</p><p>5) Regarding the ideas in Figure 7 that the supply of cysteine via import of cystine and its reduction by NADPH-dependent enzymes like thioredoxin reductase or glutathione reductase (the thioredoxin or glutaredoxin systems) the authors should discuss the possibility of the transsulfuration pathway from methionine. An article showing the importance of this pathway can be found in: Prigge et al., 2017.</p><p>6) One reviewer was concerned about the lack of any data to support the importance of this mechanism in vivo. They felt transplants using some of the human lung cancer cell lines to assess whether re-expression of WT CDO1 suppresses tumor growth as opposed to re-expression of mutant inactive CDO1 would help the paper. I agree this is a nice experiment, but is not essential for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. If the data could be provided in a reasonable time frame it would improve the paper. If providing these data is not possible, then please discuss that the lack of in vivo data is a limitation of the study and mention that this work will be needed to further test the model in the future.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.45572.043</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors propose that CDO1 promoter methylation and suppression in gene expression is more prevalent in KEAP1 mutant tumors.

We find that KEAP1 mutation-independent activation of NRF2 accounts for an additional fraction of the CDO1 methylated patient population, and when combined with the KEAP1 mutant population these “NRF2 high” patients are still significantly enriched for CDO1 methylation (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). However, a significant fraction of the CDO1 methylated patients remain unaccounted for by NRF2 activation. This finding is consistent with the findings from our cell line studies, in which a fraction of the KEAP1 wild-type lines were found to accumulate significant cysteine in a NRF2- and xCT-independent manner (Figure 3D). These lines accumulated CDO1 and were sensitive to its anti-proliferative effects. Thus, our findings support that NRF2 activation is only one mechanism by which cells can accumulate intracellular cysteine, providing an explanation for how CDO1 loss could benefit KEAP1 wild-type (and NRF2 low) tumors that have high intracellular cysteine.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One reviewer also questioned whether NRF2 stabilization by ROS-dependent post-translational stabilization of NRF2 in KEAP1 WT lung cancer cells might mediate the same level of toxicity of CDO1 re-expression as seen in KEAP1 MUT lung cancer cells?

To address this point, we used the superoxide-generating compound β-lapachone, which induces NRF2 stabilization in the KEAP1 wild-type cell lines H1299 and H1975 (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2A). We find that NRF2 stabilization by β-lapachone promotes the accumulation of intracellular cysteine, CDO1 stabilization, the production of CDO1-dependent metabolites CSA and Cys-SO3, and cystine depletion (new Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, Figure 5H-J). Thus, chronic oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment may also select for CDO1 loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Evidence of a putative growth-suppressive role for CDO1 in lung cancer is not as strong.

First, only modest effects on GSH are observed in MEFs (modestly is added to subsection “Nrf2 promotes the entry of cysteine into the taurine synthesis pathway via Cdo1 in non-transformed, primary MEFs”and the Discussion section), which may be due to incomplete CDO1 deletion by CRISPR/Cas9, feedback inhibition of GCLC by GSH, or other mechanisms. Further, the reviewer is correct that CDO1 is only partly responsible for directing CYS into taurine, as the alternative route of CYS entry into the taurine synthesis pathway via CoA breakdown is CDO1-independent and cannot be distinguished from CDO1-dependent taurine synthesis (subsection “Nrf2 promotes the entry of cysteine into the taurine synthesis pathway via Cdo1 in non-transformed, primary MEFs”). Second, we agree that CDO1 plays an important role in cystine uptake and CSA production, but has a minor role in taurine synthesis and GSH production in NSCLC cells (Discussion section). These points have been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There was a concern raised that complete depletion of cystine (Figure 5—figure supplement 4B) is not physiological and will lead to robust growth suppression in most cells.

Importantly, we find that sulfite production and cystine starvation are not necessary for the growth suppressive functions of CDO1 (Figure 6 and Figure 7, GOT1 KO cells). We perform most experiments in our manuscript four hours after media replenishment to avoid the secondary effects of starvation raised by the reviewer. The objective of the experiment in Figure 5—figure supplement 4B) is to interrogate whether cystine starvation is uniformly toxic to NSCLC cells, as the reviewer points out, regardless of KEAP1 status. We have clarified this in the text (subsection “CDO1 restoration in NSCLC cells promotes sulfite production, thereby depleting cystine via sulfitolysis”). The data in Figure 5—figure supplement 4B support that the toxicity of CDO1 is not a consequence of some cell lines having increased tolerance to cystine starvation or sulfite than others.</p><p>We thank the reviewers for the suggestion to use xCT inhibition and cystine modulation to further support our findings regarding CDO1 toxicity. To this end, we have first used a sublethal concentration of erastin (0.5uM), which was previously demonstrated to rescue the effects of glutaminase inhibition in KEAP1 mutant cells (Sayin et al., 2017), and have confirmed that cystine uptake is inhibited under these conditions (Figure 5—figure supplement 1E). In agreement with the post-translational stabilization of CDO1 by cysteine, we find that erastin treatment leads to complete loss of CDO1 expression in H460 and A549 cells and completely rescues the CDO1 proliferation defect (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,F). We further cultured the cells in 10uM cystine, which produced similar results (Figure 5—figure supplement 1D,F). Collectively, these results support role of cysteine in the stabilization of CDO1 and its growth suppressive effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Based on many prior studies, KEAP1 mutant cells produce high levels of glutathione and NADPH which create a highly reduced intracellular environment. Furthermore, based on recent data (Cao et al., 2019) NRF2 induces transporters that enable the secretion of glutathione.

Measurement of GSH/GSSG ratios upon re-expression of CDO1 are likely present within their existing LC-MS data. If so, can this be reported? A decrease in the ratio would also be in line with the fact that NADPH/NADP ratio decreases in response to CDO1 re-expression.</p></disp-quote><p>In agreement with prior studies (Menzel et al., 1986), we do find that sulfite is capable of reacting with GSSG with similar kinetics to cystine, when an excess of sulfite is mixed with GSSG in the absence of cells (New Figure 5—figure supplement 2C,D). However, as the reviewer states, we observe that KEAP1 mutant cells have a highly reduced intracellular environment. While intracellular GSH concentrations are in the 10-20mM range, intracellular GSSG levels are approximately 20uM and undetectable extracellularly (New Figure 5—figure supplement 2E,F). It is important to note that sulfite would react with GSSG, not GSH, and there is little GSSG available to react with sulfite, in contrast to cystine, which is approximately 200um intracellularly and from 200um-50um extracellularly, depending on how long the cells are cultured (New Figure 5—figure supplement 2E,F). Importantly, through our quantitative analysis of cystine and downstream metabolites, most CDO1-dependent cystine is accounted for (Figure 6B), suggesting that if sulfite does react with glutathione it is not a major fate of cysteine in our system. However, the levels of GSSG in the extracellular tumor microenvironment may exceed that of cystine (Sullivan et al., 2019), and we have added this point to the Discussion section.</p><p>Regarding the relationship between the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio and the GSH/GSSG ratio, we examined our existing quantitative GSH and GSSG data. While we did not have these data from the GOT1 KO cells, we did have it from our KEAP1 complementation experiment for A549, H460 and H1944. We find that under non-stressed conditions CDO1 expression does not dramatically affect GSH or GSSG (new Figure 7B). The concomitant decrease in NADPH-dependent processes including proline synthesis and reductive carboxylation suggests that NADPH is more limiting for these processes than glutathione reduction. This is consistent with a low Km of glutathione reductase for NADPH (8uM, Brenda) and a high Km of PYCR1 (proline synthesis) for NADPH (300uM, Brenda). This is also consistent with recent work from Zou et al., which finds that the NADPH/NADP<sup>+</sup> ratio fluctuates throughout the cell cycle to support proliferation without any change in ROS. However, under oxidizing conditions, Zou et al. find that NADPH becomes significantly depleted and thiols become oxidized. Therefore, NADPH may only be limiting for GSSG reduction following oxidant exposure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Regarding the ideas in Figure 7 that the supply of cysteine via import of cystine and its reduction by NADPH-dependent enzymes like thioredoxin reductase or glutathione reductase (the thioredoxin or glutaredoxin systems) the authors should discuss the possibility of the transsulfuration pathway from methionine.

However, it is possible that the transsulfuration pathway may significantly contribute to the cysteine pool in the NRF2- and xCT- low / cysteine high cell lines in Figure 3D, where the high intracellular cysteine levels are not currently explained.

To this end, we have generated K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup>; p53<sup>flox/flox</sup> lung tumor mice expressing either wild-type KEAP1, heterozygous for KEAP1<sup>R554Q</sup>, or homozygous for KEAP1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup>. We chose this model because KEAP1 deletion in the K-Ras<sup>G12D</sup>; p53<sup>flox/flox</sup> lung tumor model was recently shown to increase NRF2 activity and promote cystine uptake (Romero et al., 2017). We find that KEAP1 loss of function leads to a gradient of NRF2 activation with KEAP1<sup>W/WT</sup> tumors expressing little to no NQO1. KEAP1<sup>R554QWT</sup> tumors displayed increased NQO1 expression, and KEAP1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup> tumors were strongly positive. KEAP1<sup>R554Q/WT</sup> tumors were modestly larger than KEAP1<sup>WT/WT</sup> tumors, but surprisingly KEAP1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup> tumors were very small and low grade. Importantly, KEAP1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup> tumors strongly expressed CDO1, demonstrating that NRF2 activation promotes CDO1 accumulation under physiological conditions in vivo, and suggesting that CDO1 may impede tumor progression. These new data are found in Figure 8.</p><p>To directly interrogate whether CDO1 impedes tumor progression, we have crossed a lox-STOP-lox-Cas9 allele (Chiou et al., 2015) into our model to delete CDO1 by CRISPR. However, these experiments are still ongoing and therefore, we have added a section to both the results and the discussion regarding the additional in vivo work needed to determine whether CDO1 mediates the block in tumorigenesis in the KEAP1<sup>R554Q/R554Q</sup> model (Discussion section).</p></body></sub-article></article>
