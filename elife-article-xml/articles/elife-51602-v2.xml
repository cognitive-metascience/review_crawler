FKBP12.6, and phosphorylation on type II ryanodine receptor (RyR2) arrangement and function were examined using correlation microscopy (line scan confocal imaging of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks and dual-tilt electron tomography) and dSTORM imaging of permeabilized Wistar rat ventricular myocytes. Saturating concentrations (10 µmol/L) of either FKBP12 or 12.6 significantly reduced the frequency, spread, amplitude and Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark mass relative to control, while the tomograms revealed both proteins shifted the tetramers into a largely side-by-side configuration. Phosphorylation of immunophilin-saturated RyR2 resulted in structural and functional changes largely comparable to phosphorylation alone. dSTORM images of myocyte surfaces demonstrated that both FKBP12 and 12.6 significantly reduced RyR2 cluster sizes, while phosphorylation, even of immunophilin-saturated RyR2, increased them. We conclude that both RyR2 cluster size and the arrangement of tetramers within clusters is dynamic and respond to changes in the cellular environment. Further, these changes affect Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ryanodine receptor</kwd><kwd>excitation-contraction coupling</kwd><kwd>immunophilins</kwd><kwd>3D electron tomography</kwd><kwd>superresolution microscopy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>148527</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Moore</surname><given-names>Edwin DW</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT-153305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Petegem</surname><given-names>Filip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chou</surname><given-names>Keng C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000196</institution-id><institution>Canada Foundation for Innovation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Chou</surname><given-names>Keng C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Repositioning the type II ryanodine receptors on the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane is a potential new mechanism regulating their function, and therefore the strength of cardiac contraction.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Ryanodine receptors are large (~2.2 MDa) homotetrameric Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion channels located in the endoplasmic and sarcoplasmic reticulum of virtually every cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lanner et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Petegem, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meissner, 2017</xref>). They are distributed in discrete clusters whose various shapes and sizes contribute to the spatial and temporal characteristics of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. Of the three highly homologous isoforms, ventricular myocytes only express the type II ryanodine receptor (RyR2) and its intracellular location is restricted to the junctional sarcoplasmic reticulum (jSR) membrane in close apposition to the sarcolemma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carl et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 1995</xref>). The small distance between the two membranes,~15 nm, provides a space of restricted diffusion where a small influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through sarcolemmal L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2) can open the RyR2 via Ca<sup>2+</sup>-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (CICR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Franzini-Armstrong, 2018</xref>). This architecture is critical for normal cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Louch et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Song et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In diastole, and in the absence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx through Ca<sub>v</sub>1.2, RyR2 open stochastically but with a very low probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Satoh et al., 1997</xref>). A single tetramer can either open without further effect, or it can activate other RyR2 through inter-RyR2 CICR producing a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheng et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santiago et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sobie et al., 2006</xref>). This diastolic SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, with and without sparks, is normal and asymptomatic in a healthy individual, but it is elevated in both acquired and inherited cardiac diseases such as hypertrophy, heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Song et al., 2005</xref>) and catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uchinoumi et al., 2010</xref>), leading to increased morbidity and mortality. Less Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the SR results in a negative inotropic effect, and the elevated release reduces the rate of decline of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> transient producing a negative lusitropic effect. Removing the excess Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the myoplasm is energetically costly since it utilizes ATP. If the leak is sufficiently large, the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchanger can depolarize the cell and seed a potentially lethal arrhythmia, a common cause of death in cardiac disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bers, 2014</xref>). For these reasons, elevated SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is a significant driver behind current efforts to understand how RyR2 are regulated and how they function.</p><p>Abnormal RyR2 activity and Ca<sup>2+</sup> release has also been linked to many other disorders, including atrial fibrillation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobrev et al., 2011</xref>), cognitive dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2012</xref>), Alzheimer’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stutzmann et al., 2006</xref>), and diabetes mellitus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Santulli et al., 2015</xref>). All of these, in addition to heart failure and arrhythmia, have been suggested to originate, at least in part, through RyR2 phosphorylation and a decrease in its affinity for the immunophilin FKBP12.6 (calstabin 2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kushnir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marx et al., 2000</xref>). While this mechanism remains contentious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camors and Valdivia, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>), as do the actions of the FKBPs even in the absence of disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonano and Jones, 2017</xref>), the adverse effects of pathologic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release through abnormally functioning RyR2 has been well established.</p><p>Recently, pathologically induced changes in the RyR2 cluster sizes was identified as the likely cause of cerebral artery smooth muscle tone dysfunction in the mdx mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pritchard et al., 2018</xref>) and in rat ventricle the probability of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark was found to be correlated to the size of the cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galice et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that tetramer movement and cluster size might be variables that contribute to regulating RyR2 function in both health and disease. Intuitively, the receptors’ relative positions should also be of importance in regulating the positive feedback of inter-RyR2 CICR and could therefore be modulated, but mathematical models have produced conflicting results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cannell et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tanskanen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Iaparov et al., 2019</xref>). Empirical studies are few, but phosphorylation and Mg<sup>2+</sup> were seen to reorient the tetramers and their relative positions were correlated with the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al., 2014</xref>). We therefore set out to test the impact of FKBP binding, hypothesizing that it would alter distribution and spark frequency, and to examine the effect on RyR2 cluster sizes.</p><p>We used correlative microscopy to examine the position and orientation of RyR2 tetramers relative to each other, and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks from within the same cells, and found that exposing the tetramers to a saturating concentration of either FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 resulted in a reduced SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and a more densely packed side-by-side tetramer array. Exposing similarly treated myocytes to cell-wide phosphorylation produced the opposite result; increased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and more widely spaced tetramers. dSTORM microscopy observed widespread changes in RyR2 cluster sizes and in the number of tetramers per cluster that supported and extended those obtained from correlative microscopy.</p><p>We conclude that RyR2 are not distributed randomly or independently of each other on the jSR membrane. Rearranging the tetramer array and changing the cluster sizes is part of the normal operation of the mammalian ventricle and are likely mechanisms that alter the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>RyRs can have from zero to 4 FKBPs associated with them. The amount and the proportion of each isoform in the native cell is uncertain, and the level of saturation of the binding sites is estimated to be between 45–100% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jeyakumar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zissimopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). To isolate the effects of each isoform, and to ensure saturation of the RyR2 tetramers, we delivered 10 μmol/L of purified FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 to the permeabilized myocytes. The results thus obtained illuminate the inherent ability to cluster and move for those RyR2 channels with four FKBPs bound.</p><p>The images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> are representative line scans of Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks recorded from saponin permeabilized myocytes at room temperature in a solution containing 100 nmol/L Ca<sup>2+</sup> and 1 mmol/L Mg<sup>2+</sup>, conditions comparable to those in a resting myocyte.

For each spark parameter in the six experimental groups there are fifteen different comparisons, and for this reason we used a color code to indicate statistical differences. Data that were not significantly different from each other share the same color, while those that are significantly different, do not. Some box plots contain two or more colors; for example, the spark mass plot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, phosphorylation is bi-colored because it was not significantly different from control (white) or FKBP12.6 plus phosphorylation (blue), but the latter two were significantly different from each other.

Comparing control, FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 treated cells to their phosphorylated counterparts demonstrated that phosphorylation significantly increased many of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark parameters, although the degree depended on the particular immunophilin. FKBP12 plus phosphorylation produced far fewer sparks than FKBP12.6 plus phosphorylation (p&lt;10<sup>−12</sup>), possibly reflecting their differing effects on RyR2 gating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gonano and Jones, 2017</xref>).

We examined the distribution of RyR2 tetramers in junctions using the Multi Planner Viewer (Amira software), simultaneously viewing three orthogonal sections of a selected junction enabling a 360-degree view of the dual aligned 3D data sets, and of every RyR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

A single XZ plane that bisects the cleft enabling all of the tetramers’ positions and orientations to be visualized and mapped is usually impossible because of the uneven and undulating surface of the jSR membrane. We therefore positioned a XZ plane as parallel to the jSR surface as possible and, progressing in 0.5 nm increments, moved through the cleft to identify a plane where a given tetramer was clearly seen; the tomogram was then tilted in X and Y until its four corners were clear, at which point a red box of the appropriate size (27 nm on a side) was manually positioned over the tetramer and the image was captured. This was done for each tetramer in the tomogram. These images were then used to inform the positioning of the boxes in the RyR_fit program. For displaying all of the RyR2 in the tomogram, we used RyR_fit to manually insert all of the red boxes onto a single XZ plane with a tilt of 0°. Not all of the tetramers are clearly visible in a single image plane, so some of the boxes are atop what appear to be oddly shaped blobs. For clarity, we redisplay the boxes on a black background. Of the 28 XZ planes that spanned this cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the selected tetramer (arrows) was clearly seen in planes 2–6, and plane 4 (outlined in blue) was tilted in X and Y to visualize its corners (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>); in this instance rotations of ~5° in X and 0° in Y gave a clear result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Fi</xref>).

We therefore defined a cluster in the dSTORM images as a group of lit pixels that had no pixel separated from its nearest neighbor by more than 50 nm. Each cluster had an alpha shape drawn around it enabling calculation of the enclosed area. The clusters were irregularly shaped and sometimes included subgroups (arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We then pooled all of the areas from a given experimental group and plotted them as a CDF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>).

The median cluster area and the number of clusters analyzed in each experimental group are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>.

We first drew alpha shapes around the tetramer arrays in the tomograms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>) to calculate the median tetramer coverage/cluster for each of the experimental groups giving the percentage of the area covered by the tetramers; the values were different for the different experimental groups (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). This is a measure of the group behavior of the array and is not comparable to the NND. The phosphorylated value was slightly larger than the control because ordering the array reduced the area of the alpha shape so that the tetramers occupied slightly more of the area defined. In the immunophilin treated cells the receptors clustered together reducing the alpha shape area and increasing the proportion covered by the tetramers. Phosphorylation of the immunophilin treated cells had the opposite effect – separating the tetramers, increasing the alpha shape area and decreasing the proportion covered. For each of the dSTORM images we multiplied the cluster area by coverage/cluster giving the area covered by the tetramers. When this was divided by the area occupied by a single tetramer, 729 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Petegem, 2015</xref>), the result was the number of tetramers per cluster in the dSTORM images (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). The pooled values for each experimental group were plotted as a CDF, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, where the steps in the curves reflected rounding to the nearest integer.

The k-sample Anderson Darling test showed that each curve was sampled from a different population (p&lt;0.01). These quantitative results support the visual impression; the immunophilins fractured the clusters into smaller units with fewer members. While phosphorylation, either with or without the immunophilins present, produced larger clusters with more members.</p><table-wrap id="table3" position="float"><label>Table 3.</label><caption><title>Tetramer Density per Cluster.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">Tomograms</th><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">dSTORM Images</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" valign="middle">Median Tetramer Coverage/Cluster</th><th align="center" valign="middle">No. of Tomograms Examined</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Median No. of Tetramers/Cluster</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Mean No. of Tetramers/Cluster</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control</td><td align="center" valign="middle">49.5%</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">13</td><td align="center" valign="middle">8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">18.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phosphorylated</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">52.8%</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9</td><td align="center" valign="middle">8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">23.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">57.1%</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">12</td><td align="center" valign="middle">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9.7</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">62.5%</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">9</td><td align="center" valign="middle">5</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">11.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12 + Phos</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">44.9%</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">7</td><td align="center" valign="middle">10</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">20.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12.6 + Phos</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">46.2%</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">8</td><td align="center" valign="middle">8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">20.5</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Median mean cluster areas and number of clusters examined.

However, we have observed a large range of NND values corresponding to tetramers that are in a wide variety of configurations; from fully side-by-side to completely isolated from each other. In a study of RyR2 deposited on a grid, Cabra et al reported unexpected tetramer interactions, suggesting that the tetramers can contact each other at multiple sites, not solely at the clamp domains as previously thought (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cabra et al., 2016</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Nearest Neighbour Centre-to-Centre Distances.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">Checkerboard</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" colspan="2" valign="bottom">Side-by-Side</th></tr><tr><th align="center" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" valign="bottom">Mean ± SD</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Median</th><th align="center" valign="bottom"/><th align="center" valign="bottom">Mean ± SD</th><th align="center" valign="bottom">Median</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.8 ± 2.0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">35.0</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.4 ± 0.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.5</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12 + Phos</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.3 ± 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.6 ± 0.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.8</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">33.3 ± 2.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">33.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.0 ± 0.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">FKBP12.6 + Phos</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">35.1 ± 2.1</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.4 ± 0.2</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.4</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Control</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.2 ± 1.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.6</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.3 ± 0.8</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">28.1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Phosphorylation</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.2 ± 1.9</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">34.3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom"/><td align="center" valign="bottom">27.7 ± 0.3</td><td align="center" valign="bottom">27.7</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>Recently published superresolution data appeared to show mostly single and isolated tetramers in a unimodal distribution with a mean NND of 40 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jayasinghe et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, our data shows that almost all the tetramers appear in groups of two or more and are rarely separated by more than 39 nanometers, a distance corresponding to a corner to corner configuration. It is clear when examining our results that the distributions are not random and that the tetramers are not positioned independently of each other. This conclusion is also supported by the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref> demonstrating the consistently preferred centre-to-centre NND of 34 nm in the checkerboard-like configuration and the large proportion of those that are side-by-side; results that are inconsistent with random or independent positioning. The reasons for these differences are unclear, but the resolution of electron tomography is an order of magnitude higher than any current optical approach and the tetramers are directly visualized, as opposed to indirectly via an antibody-dependent technique.</p><p>Both FKBP12 and FKBP12.6 produced dramatic shifts in the tetramers’ relative positions, packing them into a predominantly side-by-side configuration, with FKBP12.6 being more effective than FKBP12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The results were comparable to those we reported for high Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which also inhibits RyR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al., 2014</xref>). dSTORM images of RyR2 clusters on cell surfaces demonstrated that the effects were widespread, as expected, but they also revealed other details.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, and the data in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">3</xref>, show that saturating the tetramers with immunophilins resulted in clusters that occupied a smaller area and had fewer members, while phosphorylation, even in the continued presence of the immunophilins, did the opposite.The data supports RyR2 trafficking over significantly larger distances than we would have predicted from the tomographic images alone. This data is consistent with other results that have recently reported relatively rapid and unexpectedly long range trafficking of RyR2 clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hiess et al., 2018</xref>) and individual tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>sparks and FKBP12/12.6</title><p>The interpretation of our Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark data is dependent on an intact myocyte architecture, so we have compared our results to others who have used comparable experimental systems.</p><p>We demonstrated that FKBP12.6 reduced spontaneous SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and increased SR Ca<sup>2+</sup> content, which is broadly consistent with the published literature.

The difference between their results and ours might be due to the higher RyR2 saturation we obtained using 10 μmol/L FKBP12 in comparison to their 1 μmol/L. Transgenic rabbit models acutely overexpressing FKBP12 showed a reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency and gain of ECC, but they displayed an increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark amplitude and duration. FKBP12 null mice largely die in utero and have severe dilated cardiomyopathy.

Co-immunoprecipitation experiments have demonstrated the continued binding of immunophilins to RyR2 despite phosphorylation by either CaMKII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kohlhaas et al., 2006</xref>) or PKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xiao et al., 2004</xref>).

The effects of phosphorylation plus FKBPs were much closer to phosphorylation alone than to FKBPs alone, making it likely that phosphorylation predominates over the FKBPs in determining the tetramers’ function and that the FKBPs, phosphorylation and the combination of the two result in different conformations of RyR2. It is notable that phosphorylation was significantly less effective in reversing FKBP12’s effects on spark frequency, FDHM and spark mass compared to FKBP12.6, despite its significantly lower affinity for RyR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Ca<sup>2+</sup> sparks in cells treated with FKBP12.6 plus the phosphorylation cocktail were significantly more frequent than in any other treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) and when combined with the increase in spark mass, these cells would have the largest diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Differential Effects of FKBP12 and 12.6</title><p>The different effects of the FKBPs, with or without phosphorylation, occur despite their binding to the same site on RyR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zissimopoulos et al., 2012</xref>). A possible explanation is that each immunophilin produces direct, unique, effects on RyR2 gating. Unfortunately, the data published from lipid bilayer studies is perplexing and neither proves nor disproves this contention. For example, FKBP12.6 has been shown to inhibit RyR2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marx et al., 2000</xref>), to have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barg et al., 1997</xref>) and to act as a partial agonist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galfré et al., 2012</xref>). FKBP12 has been reported to have no effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barg et al., 1997</xref>) and to increase RyR2 open probability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Galfré et al., 2012</xref>). Although a substantial part of the FKBP12 and 12.6 surfaces are involved in binding the SPRY1 and solenoid domains of RyRs, their outer surfaces are accessible in all current cryo-EM studies, and these may be directly involved in interactions with a neighboring RyR2. Since these sequences are less conserved, the contact sites might differ, resulting in different tetramer distributions and spark characteristics for the FKBPs. Finally, proteomic data may offer a different explanation, FKBP12 can be phosphorylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lundby et al., 2012</xref>), while no such reports exist for FKBP12.6. The functional consequences of RyR2 saturated with FKBP12 versus phosphorylated FKBP12 are unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Structure and function</title><p>Sparks are formed by the spontaneous opening of one or more RyR2 channels, which open their nearest neighbors via Ca<sup>2+</sup> diffusion and inter-RyR2 CICR within a single dyadic cleft. Intuitively, inter-RyR2 should be maximally effective and spark frequency the highest when the channels are closest together. This is reflected in some models of spark formation that predict the closer the tetramers are to each other the higher the probability of spark formation, while the farther apart, the less likely its occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Walker et al., 2015</xref>). Our results demonstrate a contrary relationship: all of the factors that redistribute RyR2 into a more compact distribution, high Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al., 2014</xref>) as well as FKBP12 and FKBP12.6, result in a significantly lower spark frequency than control, while phosphorylation, whether or not an immunophilin is present, separates the tetramers and increases the spark frequency above its control values. dSTORM imaging has reinforced and extended these observations. Visible changes in the organization of the RyR2 clusters in each of the images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) demonstrated that the effects of our experimental manipulations were widespread. The quantitative analysis reinforced those impressions showing highly significant changes in the sizes of the clusters in response to our experimental treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). The data implies that tetramers were being translated over larger distances than anticipated from the tomographic images. Notably, the changes in cluster size were correlated with significant changes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark parameters. Experimental manipulations that reduced Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark frequency and related parameters also reduced the number of tetramers per cluster, while those that increased the cluster sizes had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>).</p><p>We have speculated that the changes necessary for channel opening are inhibited when the tetramers’ sides are overlapped and in contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al., 2014</xref>). Subsequently, high resolution structural analyses have demonstrated that the cytoplasmic shell of the RyR2 molecule undergoes significant reorientation and movement on channel opening which could support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">des Georges et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recent data demonstrates that the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark formation is related to the number of tetramers in the cluster, with larger clusters being more likely to produce a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galice et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Xie et al., 2019</xref>). Our data indicates a comparable relationship, but is the first demonstration that cluster size is a variable and might be regulated by factors that affect tetramer gating. This suggests that the movement and translation of the tetramers we have observed is a mechanism to alter the probability of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark formation.</p><p>The changes in the tetramer arrangement and the cluster size both occur relatively rapidly, within ten minutes. It has been shown that BIN1 is involved both in the formation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> release units and in anchoring the jSR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">De La Mata et al., 2019</xref>) as well as in the rapid translocation of RyR2 onto the jSR membrane in response to β-adrenergic stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fu et al., 2016</xref>). It could therefore contribute to the tetramer movements and dyad reorganization we have observed. Whether both the short range tetramer reorientation occurring within a dyad, and the longer range translation to and from a dyad, occur sequentially, in synchrony or independently is unknown, and they may involve different mechanisms. The clear implication is that the mammalian dyad is a dynamic environment that can rapidly change, resulting in effects on excitability, diastolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> release and contractility.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Briefly, a tetramer was in a checkerboard arrangement relative to its neighbor(s) if the sides were parallel, separated by less than 3 nm and overlapped by less than 18 nm (2/3 of its length). If those criteria were fulfilled but the overlap exceeded 18 nm, the tetramers were classified as side-by-side. Some tetramers had neighbors in both configurations, while others had none and were considered isolated. The centre-to-centre nearest neighbor distances (NND) for the tetramers were recorded and plotted. The error in placing the tetramer is ~3 nm. The basis of this estimate, and other possible errors, is discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Asghari et al.

FKBPs were induced in <italic>E. coli</italic> Rosetta (DE3) cells with 0.4 mmol/L isopropyl-β-D-thiogalactoside (IPTG) at 0.6 optical density at 600 nm. After growth for 4 hr at 37°C, the cells were collected, re-suspended in the buffer A (20 mmol/L HEPES pH 7.4, 250 mmol/L NaCl) with 100 μM PMSF, 25 μg/ml DNaseI and 25 μg/ml lysozyme and 10% glycerol, and disrupted by sonication. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 40,000 g for 30 min. Cell lysate was applied to a PorosMC column (Thermo Fisher Scientific), were washed with five column volumes (CV) of buffer A and 5 CV of buffer A plus 10 mmol/L imidazole, and were eluted with buffer A plus 300 mmol/L imidazole [pH 7.4]). The protein was dialyzed overnight against buffer A and was cleaved simultaneously with recombinant TEV protease. The samples were then run on another PorosMC column in buffer A, and the flow-through was collected and dialyzed against buffer C (10 mmol/L NaCl, 5 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mmol/L Tris-Cl [pH 8.8]), applied to a Q Sepharose column (GE Healthcare), and eluted with a gradient from 0% to 50% buffer D (1 M NaCl, 2-mercaptoethanol, 20 mmol/L Tris-Cl [pH 8.8]). Finally, the samples were run on a Superdex 200 16/60 (GE Healthcare) column in buffer A plus 5 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol, which separated dimeric and monomeric fractions. The monomeric fractions were pooled, aliquoted and flash-frozen for further use.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Modeling</title><p>To visualize and better understand the 3D architecture and arrangement of the t-tubules, jSR and ryanodine receptors, we manually segmented these compartments on the dual tilt tomograms using Amira (FEI). Using the segmentation module, the contours were hand drawn, creating a 3D model, by tracing the individual membranes in every slice of the tomograms using a Wacom Cintiq 27QHD drawing tablet. In each dyad, a single RyR2 tetramer was traced, then copies of it were placed in the proper position and orientation; this simplified the drawing. As displayed in the supplementary videos, t-tubules were traced in blue, jSR in red and RyR2 tetramers in green. Automatic smoothing was applied to the surface models to reduce the number of polygons and improve the models’ appearance. When drawing, the tomogram cannot be rotated, so to ensure that we identified the correct position and orientation of the tetramers we used the Slice option to superimpose the tomographic data onto the model. This simultaneous visualization ensured accurate positioning of the tetramers in the 3D data set. Movies of the complete models were created using Amira’s MovieMaker module.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Western blots</title><p>We used a standard Western Blot protocol to confirm that exogenous FKBP12 or FKBP12.6 raised the cellular levels beyond control values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).

The samples were frozen in liquidN<sub>2</sub> for storage at −80°C until use. Protein (quantified with a Bradford Protein assay, Bio-Rad 500–0001, Hercules, CA) was separated on 12% SDS-polyacrylamide gels and transferred to Immobilon-P transfer membrane (PVDF – pore size 0.45 µm; Millipore Sigma) overnight at 4°C. Membranes were then blocked in skim milk in Tris-buffered saline with 0.1% Tween (TBS-T Sigma) at room temperature for one hour.

While spark frequency/Ca<sup>2+</sup> load was normally distributed, virtually none of the other parameters were, so, similar to Sikkel et al., we used the log transformation to analyze the data. We treated the p value generated by the R-program differently from Sikkel et al, using the Holm-Bonferroni correction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holm, 1979</xref>) rather than the Bonferroni as the latter is statistically weaker and a higher family-wise error rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Olejnik et al., 1997</xref>). The tables (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1—source data 1</xref>) describing the statistical results for each parameter have five columns – first the comparison, then the p values and the statistical significance generated by Sikkel et al’s R program. The final two columns show the results from the Holm-Bonferroni analysis, which involves ranking the probability from smallest to largest. A critical p value (column 4) is calculated according to the rank of the probability. If the p value (column 2) is less than this critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected (column 5).</p><p>The distribution of centre-to-centre NND of each of the groups was converted to a cumulative distribution function and then compared using the non-parametric k-sample Anderson-Darling test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Scholz and Stephens, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scholz and Zhu, 2016</xref>) to determine whether the distributions were significantly different from each other.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy</title><p>The isolation of the cardiomyocytes, the labeling of the ryanodine receptor and the custom-built microscope have been described in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tafteh et al., 2016</xref>), but is notable for providing a highly stable imaging platform with drift in x and y of less than 0.7 nm RMS. Briefly, cells treated with the various cocktails as described in the experimental protocol were fixed, settled on coverslips and then labeled with anti-RyR2 and with anti-mouse Alexa 647 (Life Technologies, Burlington, ON). A low concentration of 100 nm tracking beads (F8799; Life Technologies) were added to the coverslips and allowed to settle overnight. Imaging was performed in a standard GLOX-thiol solution (a nitrogenated TN buffer [50 mmol/L Tris, 10 mmol/L NaCl, pH 8.0], 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 µg/ml catalase, 10% (w/v) glucose and 140 mmol/L 2-mercaptoethanol). The coverslip with the attached cardiomyocytes was mounted onto a chamber with a volume of 700 µl which was filled with the imaging solution and sealed. Blinks with an estimated error in their XY position &gt;10 nm, Z position &gt;40 nm, a goodness of fit &lt;0.9, and nearest neighbors &gt; 30 nm distant were excluded.

All superresolution images were displayed as binary; the pixel was on if blinks were present and off it was not.</p><p>To ensure that we could get an accurate measure of the area covered by the tetramer clusters, we imaged the surface of the cells where they contacted the coverslip and the tetramers would be near normal to the optical axis. A 100–150 nm thick slice that contained the surface and excluded structures beneath it was mapped onto a 2D grid of 10 nm x 10 nm pixels; those pixels that contained a single blink and had no neighbors were treated as empty.</p><p>To interpret the images, we defined a cluster as consisting of pixels where no pixel was more than 50 nm distant from its nearest neighbor. The area of each cluster was determined by defining the boundary with an alpha shape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bernardini and Bajaj, 1997</xref>). Clusters with an area of less than 1600 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Petegem, 2015</xref>) were omitted from the analysis to remove noise that resulted from fluorophores which had attached to the coverslip. This filter also removed isolated single tetramers more than 50 nm distant from any cluster. We used data obtained from the tomograms to estimate the number of tetramers in a cluster. For each tomogram, we positioned the tetramers and then drew an alpha shape around the tetramers. Knowing the area occupied by a single tetramer (729 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Van Petegem, 2015</xref>) we could calculate how much of the cluster was covered by the tetramers (median value, expressed as a percentage, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). We then used these values to estimate the number of tetramers for each cluster. These values were plotted on as a cumulative data function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) and were analysed using a k-sample Anderson-Darling test.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bjorn Knollmann (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript by Asghari et al. reports the distribution, arrangement, and cluster size of the type II ryanodine receptor (RYR2) tetramers under various conditions. This group has previously reported that phosphorylation and low concentrations of magnesium moved the tetramers into a predominantly checkerboard arrangement, whereas high concentrations of magnesium induced a dense side-by-side configuration. The present work confirms and extends their early findings and shows that FK506 binding proteins (FKBP12 and FKBP12.6) moved the tetramers into a largely side-by-side configuration and decreased the cluster size. In contrast, phosphorylation even in the presence of FKBPs moved the tetramers into a checkerboard-like configuration and increased the cluster size. By correlating the effects of FKBPs and phosphorylation with their tetramer arrangements, the authors propose that the side-by-side configuration of tetramer arrangement is associated with channel inhibition, whereas the checkerboard-like configuration is associated with channel activation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should show cluster rearrangements together with changes in Ca sparks in intact cells in response to strong phosphorylation. This would go a long way to demonstrate that the structural rearrangement modulate RyR function in a more physiologic setting. Importantly, these results show that hyperphosphorylation takes precedence over excess FKBP12 or 12.6.&quot; How do you reconcile this statement with some reports that phosphorylation itself leads to reduced binding of FKBPs to RyR2? Is it phosphorylation itself or is it consequent unbinding of FKBP's. How much FKBP is still bound to phospho-RyR2? I think this is shown in Supplementary Figure 6, but that figure is not referenced in the text. Is it a co-IP? This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Basically, does phosphorylation remove the immunophilins from the RyR2 tetramers or not? In addition to co-IP, this could/should be done with fluorescent-labelled FKBP.</p><p>2) Statistical evaluation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark experiments and RyR distribution experiments. Recently, Sikkel et al. [1] published an analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark data and included a discussion of general experiments with myocytes. They concluded that it may be required to conduct a hierarchical analysis to draw valid conclusions from myocyte experiments. The authors should show that their results hold up to such a hierarchical data analysis.</p><p>3) Determination of tetrad position and orientation in tomograms. The procedures used to determine these parameters are not clear to this reviewer. In the Materials and methods the authors say &quot;An individual tetramer's position relative to its neighbors was classified using a custom-written C++ program, 'RyR_fit', as previously described (Asghari et al., 2014).&quot;. I consulted Asghari et al., 2014, and could not see any reference to this or a similar software in the main text or supplementary of Asghari et al., 2014. I downloaded the C++ source of RyR_fit from the supplementary of this manuscript to learn more but had difficulty to decipher answers to my questions from the lengthy source listing. In particular, is the extraction of tetrad positions and orientations fully automatic? Alternatively, does the software require the user to choose positions and orientations? A mixture of the two? In addition, with what precision/error can these parameters be determined? For example, looking at Figure 2F: for several tetrads it is not clear how the &quot;smudges&quot; shown can be related to a precise orientation? A more detailed description of the procedures used, particularly the role of a human operator or the robustness of an automatic procedure, should be added – including a procedure to estimate the precision with which the orientation and centre of a tetramer can be determined.</p><p>4) Actual resolution in dSTORM data. There are now a set of tools, in particular Fourier ring correlation, that can estimate the actual resolution in super-res images. This would be important to carry out to establish at what resolution level this data provides reliable information. In my experience dSTORM data often has resolution worse than 50 nm which limits conclusions that can be drawn about detailed cluster shape changes. It is important to add such estimates and then possibly re-evaluate the information that is accessible from this data.</p><p>5) &quot;Importantly, these results show that hyperphosphorylation takes precedence over excess FKBP12 or 12.6.&quot; How do you reconcile this statement with some reports that phosphorylation itself leads to reduced binding of FKBPs to RyR2? Is it phosphorylation itself or is it consequent unbinding of FKBP's. How much FKBP is still bound to phospho-RyR2? I think this is shown in Supplementary Figure 6, but that figure is not referenced in the text. Is it a co-IP? This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Basically, does phosphorylation remove the immunophilins from the RyR2 tetramers or not? In addition to co-IP, this could/should be done with fluorescent-labelled FKBP.</p><p>6) The major novelty of the work is the discovery of the tremendous plasticity of the RyR2 cluster. The authors should quantify the degree of movement in more detail. What is the time course? Distances?</p><p>7) Determining the mechanism responsible for the RyR2 movements is beyond the scope of the work but the authors should discuss possible mechanisms in more detail. For example, what is the role of Bin-1 or other molecules postulated to be important for dyad formation/assembly.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.51602.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should show cluster rearrangements together with changes in Ca sparks in intact cells in response to strong phosphorylation.

These are discussed in the subsection “Phosphorylation”. They agree with others who have performed co-IP experiments and have examined fluorescent FKBP derivatives concluding there was no significant dissociation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Statistical evaluation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark experiments and RyR distribution experiments. Recently, Sikkel et al. [1] published an analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> spark data and included a discussion of general experiments with myocytes. They concluded that it may be required to conduct a hierarchical analysis to draw valid conclusions from myocyte experiments. The authors should show that their results hold up to such a hierarchical data analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Our results do hold up and the conclusions were unchanged. We reanalysed our data using the Sikkel et al. methodology as requested, but we differed in our handling of the probability with multiple comparisons and used the sequential Holm-Bonferroni rather than the simple Bonferonni correction. We have been in contact with the R-program’s author, Dr. James Howard (the 3<sup>rd</sup> author on the Sikkel et al. manuscript), and he agrees with us that the modified correction has greater statistical power. The statistical analysis is discussed in the subsection “Statistical Analyses”. There were minor changes in the results and these are reflected in Figure 1B and its source data, and in various places throughout the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Determination of tetrad position and orientation in tomograms. The procedures used to determine these parameters are not clear to this reviewer. In the Materials and methods the authors say &quot;An individual tetramer's position relative to its neighbors was classified using a custom-written C++ program, 'RyR_fit', as previously described (Asghari et al., 2014). &quot;. I consulted Asghari et al., 2014, and could not see any reference to this or a similar software in the main text or supplementary of Asghari et al., 2014. I downloaded the C++ source of RyR_fit from the supplementary of this manuscript to learn more but had difficulty to decipher answers to my questions from the lengthy source listing. In particular, is the extraction of tetrad positions and orientations fully automatic? Alternatively, does the software require the user to choose positions and orientations? A mixture of the two? In addition, with what precision/error can these parameters be determined? For example, looking at Figure 2F: for several tetrads it is not clear how the &quot;smudges&quot; shown can be related to a precise orientation? A more detailed description of the procedures used, particularly the role of a human operator or the robustness of an automatic procedure, should be added – including a procedure to estimate the precision with which the orientation and centre of a tetramer can be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made adjustments to Figure 2 and to the text in the Results to clarify the procedure.</p><p>RyR_fit is used to manually place a square of the appropriate size and orientation over a tetramer once the operator has identified it using Amira. RyR_fit is essential for classifying the tetramers’ positions (side-by-side, checkerboard, both and isolated), for generating the NND and for determining the area occupied by the tetramers using α shapes (Figure 6D).</p><p>We estimated that the positioning error for a tetramer was ~3 nm; the basis for this estimate, and other possible errors, is discussed in detail in Asghari et al., 2014, pg 258. We have added this information to the subsection “Classifying RyR2 Positions”.</p><p>New high resolution cryo-EM structures of RyR2 show that the tetramers are 27 nm on a side (Peng et al., 2016), rather than 29 nm, which was the best estimate at the time Asghari et al. was published. It is notable that this difference has not affected our conclusions. Comparing the results from Asghari et al., 2014 to the results presented here, Control cells still show a bimodal distribution in their NND, and we see the same changes in distribution in response to agents that moved the tetramers apart (phosphorylation and low Mg<sup>2+</sup>) and those that brought them together (immunophilins and high Mg<sup>2+</sup>). These are large changes, and an error of a few nm in determining the centre of the tetramer, or of degrees in their angle, has no impact on our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Actual resolution in dSTORM data. There are now a set of tools, in particular Fourier ring correlation, that can estimate the actual resolution in super-res images. This would be important to carry out to establish at what resolution level this data provides reliable information. In my experience dSTORM data often has resolution worse than 50 nm which limits conclusions that can be drawn about detailed cluster shape changes. It is important to add such estimates and then possibly re-evaluate the information that is accessible from this data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion. Fourier ring correlation indicated that the resolution of our images was between 16 and 25 nm. This is stated in the first paragraph of the subsection “Super-resolution immunofluorescence microscopy”, and an image of the program’s output is included in Figure 6—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) &quot;Importantly, these results show that hyperphosphorylation takes precedence over excess FKBP12 or 12.6.&quot; How do you reconcile this statement with some reports that phosphorylation itself leads to reduced binding of FKBPs to RyR2? Is it phosphorylation itself or is it consequent unbinding of FKBP's. How much FKBP is still bound to phospho-RyR2? I think this is shown in Supplementary Figure 6, but that figure is not referenced in the text. Is it a co-IP? This is a critical issue that needs to be addressed. Basically, does phosphorylation remove the immunophilins from the RyR2 tetramers or not? In addition to co-IP, this could/should be done with fluorescent-labelled FKBP.</p></disp-quote><p>Please see the answer to question 1 and the subsection “Phosphorylation”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The major novelty of the work is the discovery of the tremendous plasticity of the RyR2 cluster. The authors should quantify the degree of movement in more detail. What is the time course? Distances?</p></disp-quote><p>Comparisons of tetramer and cluster positions before and after treatment aren’t possible because we fix the myocytes for examination by both tomography and superresolution immunofluorescence microscopy. Each of the experimental treatments involves different cells, so we cannot track individual tetramers with either technique, making it impossible to quantify the distance and time course of their movements.</p><p>Since the first time point we examined was 10 minutes after the application of the treatments we must assume that the changes occurred within this period. This is now stated in the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Determining the mechanism responsible for the RyR2 movements is beyond the scope of the work but the authors should discuss possible mechanisms in more detail. For example, what is the role of Bin-1 or other molecules postulated to be important for dyad formation/assembly.</p></disp-quote><p>A brief examination of the role of BIN1 as a possible mechanism of tetramer translocation has been added to the last paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
