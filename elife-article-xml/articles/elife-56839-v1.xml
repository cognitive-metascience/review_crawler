While their function is well documented in slices, requirements for their activation in vivo are poorly understood. We examine this question in adult mice in vivo using 2-photon imaging of cerebellar molecular layer interneurons (MLIs) expressing GCaMP. In anesthetized mice, parallel fiber activation evokes beam-like Ca<sub>i</sub> rises in postsynaptic MLIs which depend on co-activation of mGluR1s and ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs). In awake mice, blocking mGluR1 decreases Ca<sub>i</sub> rises associated with locomotion. In vitro studies and freeze-fracture electron microscopy show that the iGluR-mGluR1 interaction is synergistic and favored by close association of the two classes of receptors. Altogether our results suggest that mGluR1s, acting in synergy with iGluRs, potently contribute to processing cerebellar neuronal signaling under physiological conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cerebellum</kwd><kwd>mglurs</kwd><kwd>glutamate receptors</kwd><kwd>parallel fiber</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>in vivo</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-11BSV401001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-18-CE16-0010-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Llano</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Marie Curie Intra European Fellowship, grant number 302819</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571073</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81401025</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NeRF postdoctoral fellowship</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Astorga</surname><given-names>Guadalupe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During parallel fibre activity in vivo, postsynaptic mGluR1 receptors in molecular layer interneurons of the cerebellar cortex are engaged in a frequency-dependent manner and in concert with inotropic glutamate receptors.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A considerable body of data, spanning from genomics and structural studies of receptors to functional studies at the synaptic level, indicates that glutamate released at excitatory synapses of the mammalian nervous system binds to both ionotropic (iGluRs) and type 1 metabotropic receptors (mGluR1s) and engages a complex pattern of signaling pathways often involving a synergistic action of both receptors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Reiner and Levitz, 2018</xref>). In the cerebellar cortex, glutamate released by parallel fibers (PFs) binds to receptors on Purkinje cells (PCs) and on molecular layer interneurons (MLIs), which form an interconnected circuit governing the output of the cerebellar cortex. Patterns of PF activity convey information on the sensorimotor state of the animal (review by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jörntell, 2017</xref>) and determine the recruitment of MLIs through PF-MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). From work in brain slices it is known that several types of iGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter and Regehr, 2000</xref>) as well as mGluR1s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karakossian and Otis, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Collin et al., 2009</xref>) are activated in MLIs by synaptically released glutamate. Furthermore, it is well documented that the PF-MLI synapse is susceptible to activity-dependent modulation such that postsynaptic AMPARs can change their Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability in response to neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Cull-Candy, 2000</xref>). This plastic shift in Ca<sup>2+</sup> permeability has been linked to specific behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Liu et al., 2010</xref>) and it is thought to involve activation of mGluR1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kelly et al., 2009</xref>). As MLIs are key elements of the cerebellar circuit during motor behavior and cerebellar-dependent motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wulff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelitai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowan et al., 2018</xref>), examining mGluR1-mediated plasticity at PF-MLI synapses is of great importance in understanding cerebellar function.</p><p>In contrast to the wealth of knowledge from slice work, the contributions of iGluRs and mGluR1s to signaling in vivo have not been investigated in any detail. Yet significant differences between work in slices and in vivo may arise from morphological perturbations due to tissue slicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bak et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dzhala et al., 2012</xref>) and from changes in either glutamate homeostasis or in molecules involved in ionotropic and/or metabotropic glutamate signaling.

Although both MLIs and Purkinje cells (PCs) are PV positive, the combined use of specific viral serotype (either AAV2/1 or AAV2/9) and of the human synapsin promoter to drive expression, resulted in the almost exclusive GECI expression in somata and neurites of MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuhn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astorga et al., 2015</xref>). In a horizontal plane of focus, we observed a periodic narrow striped fluorescence pattern characteristic of the parasagittal organization of MLI neurites while the wider interspaced non-fluorescent stripes (about 10 μm thick) correspond to unlabeled PC dendrites. The absence of GCaMP expression in PCs is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> (left panel), which shows no overlap between GCaMP3 and calbindin (CB), a protein that is absent from MLIs but has a strong expression in PCs.

High frequency PF stimulation generated robust Ca<sub>i</sub> rises in MLIs expressing GCaMP3 proteins and ΔF/Fo images displayed a characteristic beam-shaped increase in MLI fluorescence along the PF orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sullivan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Increasing the train duration led to progressively larger peak Ca<sub>i</sub> transients, with ΔF/Fo values increasing from 138.9 ± 30.6% for trains lasting 0.2 s to 347 ± 43% for 1 s long trains (N = 18).

We found that CPCCOEt significantly decreased peak amplitudes for the somatic signals in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A1, A2 and B3</xref>). The stability of the normalized ΔF/Fo values versus time plot in the control period, followed by a drastic drop after drug application, indicates that the decrease in Ca<sub>i</sub> rises is due to mGluR1 block rather than to a run-down effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The remaining Ca<sub>i</sub> signal was abolished in all cases by adding a combination of non-competitive antagonists of AMPARs and NMDARs (GYKI53655 and DCK respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, yellow traces), indicating the activation of iGluRs in MLIs. The finding of a complete block of the response by iGluR antagonists ensures that the theta stimulation does not induce direct MLI activation. In two of the experiments DCK was added prior to GYKI53655; this failed to affect the CPCCOEt-insensitive Ca<sub>i</sub> rises (example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), indicating that this residual signal depended on AMPARs but not on NMDARs. On average, ratios of peak ΔF/Fo values in CPCCOEt over control in response to 1 s-long 100 Hz trains in vivo were similar to what we found in parallel experiments in slices (compare last two bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; control peak ΔF/Fo was 347 ± 43% in vivo, n = 18; and 653 ± 58% in slices, n = 9), arguing for a strong contribution of mGluR1s in both cases.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>mGluR1s contribute to PF-evoked MLI somatic Cai rises.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pharmacology of MLI Ca<sub>i</sub> rises reported by GCaMP3 following PF stimulation. 2PLSM images at rest and at the peak of the response to PF stimulation (100 Hz for 1 s) in vivo in control (A1) and in CPCCOEt (A2).

The smaller contribution of mGluR1s to the neuropil compared to the somatic signals may reflect the fact that when analyzing the neuropil we have no unambiguous way to discriminate dendrites versus axon. Therefore, our neuropil analysis reflects a mixed population of neurites, with dendrites having a presumably more robust mGluR1 signaling than axonal processes. Nonetheless, analysis of the neuropil allows us to confirm that mGluRs are engaged in dendrites, where the density of parallel fibers synapses is 3 fold higher than in the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Focusing again on somatic responses, we then examined the time window necessary for efficient mGluR1 recruitment in vivo, by quantifying the block by CPCCOEt for trains of different durations while keeping the stimulus frequency at 100 Hz. We found that as the train duration was shortened the extent of block decreased, such that with a 100 ms train essentially no mGluR1 component was observed (pooled data from 8 animals in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>We next asked whether increasing stimulation frequency enhances mGluR1 responses during short bursts of activity.

Pooled data analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) indicated that a significant mGluR1 component was present only for the highest frequency tested (500 Hz).

We observed an overall reduction in locomotion fluorescence with increasing number of recordings, which was shared across all ROIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).

Nevertheless, the direction and the amplitude of fluorescence changes appeared to be predicted by the overall level of pre-drug locomotion fluorescence. Indeed, a linear regression analysis on all the cells gave a correlation of −0.547 (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.3, p&lt;0.0001) meaning that a more probable decrease in Ca<sub>i</sub> signal happened after CPCCOEt application if a higher fluorescence response was elicited during locomotion before drug application. These results suggest that under control conditions large signals are more likely to involve mGluR1s than small signals, in accord with the finding that longer or higher frequency PF stimulations are more successful in recruiting mGluR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D and E</xref>). Altogether, the experiments argue for an involvement of mGluR1 in physiologically relevant situations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Synergy between iGluRs and mGluR1s is not mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs</title><p>We next investigated whether iGluR activation was required for the mGluR1-linked Ca<sub>i</sub> increases at PF-MLI synapses, as reported previously for PF-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okubo et al., 2004</xref>). We found that simultaneous addition of GYKI53655 and DCK (which together should abolish iGluR activation) strongly decreased PF-evoked Ca<sub>i</sub> rises for all train durations tested in slices as well as in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). The extent of this inhibition was much larger than the value expected from the earlier results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> if the fractions of inhibition by ionotropic and metabotropic blockers were independent. Thus, considering that CPCCOEt blocks close to 50% of the signal elicited by a 100 Hz stimulation train lasting 1 s (ratio of drug to control: 0.47 ± 0.12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), the block by iGluRs would be expected to be around 50%.

Given the dependence of mGluR1s on AMPAR activation, we used the same technique to examine the location of mGluR1s with respect to the PSD. We used an mGluR1α antibody because strong mGluR1α immunoreactivity has been described for all GABAergic neurons in the cerebellar cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baude et al., 1993</xref>) while no immunoreactivity has been found in MLIs for other mGluR1 isoforms (mGluR1b and mGluR1c) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grandes et al., 1994</xref>).

MLIs, the neurons of interest in the present study, have long been considered to participate in cerebellar coding through lateral inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Eccles et al., 1966</xref>), with recent studies lending further support to this view (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dizon and Khodakhah, 2011</xref>). We present here the first evidence for recruitment of mGluR1s on MLIs in vivo. We further show that high frequency trains of PF activity, resembling sensory input to the cerebellar cortex and spike bursts recorded from granule cells (GCs) in vivo during somatosensory peripheral stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>), engage mGluR1s depending on the activation of iGluRs. Previous documentation of mGluR1 activation in vivo is very scarce. While mGluR1-dependent Ca<sub>i</sub> signaling has been observed before in vivo following beam activation of PFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), this signal may have been indirect as it had a latency &gt;10 s; furthermore, its cellular origin remained uncertain, even though it was suggested that the primary signal source was PCs. By contrast, our work indicates direct mGluR1 activation at PF-MLI synapses with a latency well below 1 s. Demonstrating mGluR1 activation at PF-MLI synapses is particularly significant, since in contrast to PF-PC contacts, these synapses lack ensheathing elements that slow neurotransmitter concentration decay and that favor the activation of slowly activating receptors such as mGluR1s. Therefore, our results suggest that mGluR1 activation in vivo may be a widespread phenomenon, occurring under a variety of morphologically different synapses, and following common presynaptic activity patterns.</p><p>The activation of MLIs during locomotion reported here is expected as we recorded in lobule IV/V of the cerebellar vermis which encodes fore- and hindlimb sensory-motor information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Provini et al., 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buisseret-Delmas and Angaut, 1993</xref>). It is in accord with recent work showing that both electrical activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelitai et al., 2016</xref>) and activity-dependent Ca<sub>i</sub> signals in MLIs increase during locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozden et al., 2012</xref>). How comparable are the two experimental paradigms used in the present work ? Although peak ΔF/Fo signals are comparable (114 ± 31 and 347 ± 43% for 0.2 and 1 s long trains of electrical stimulation at 100 Hz and 128.2 ± 8.5% during locomotion), spatial and temporal patterns of activation differ. Thus, the electrical stimulation we used imposes a ‘beam’ like pattern of MLI recruitment (with a beam width in the range of 20 to 50 μm; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astorga et al., 2015</xref>). On the other hand, locomotion engages a much larger population of MLIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in accord with results from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozden et al. (2012)</xref>. Concerning the number of PFs recruited, we presume that action potential thresholds are rather homogeneous across PFs when extracellular stimulation is used, so that all PFs within a beam are excited at the frequency imposed by extracellular stimulation. During locomotion, likewise, a vast majority of GCs are activated, 94% of all GCs in a large field of view, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ozden et al. (2012)</xref> and the impact on MLIs is a change in firing rate from an average value of 20 Hz in quiet mice to 60 Hz during self-paced locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelitai et al., 2016</xref>). GC firing in mice walking spontaneously is very heterogeneous in time and in space. In time, firing occurs in high frequency bursts with instantaneous frequencies within a burst ranging from 60 to 142 Hz, and burst durations ranging from 30 to 140 ms. Strikingly, these values are close to those needed to obtain measurable mGluR responses with extracellular stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In space, individual GCs are reported to vary markedly in their firing patterns when mice are walking. In view of the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> indicating a measurable mGluR contribution in a rather small proportion of MLIs, it is plausible that particularly active GCs cooperate within the dendritic field of these particular MLIs to produce mGluR activation as a result of temporal and spatial summation of the perisynaptic glutamate concentration.</p><p>Our finding that mGluR1 block affects the magnitude of the Ca<sub>i</sub> rises associated with locomotion points to an important role of mGluR1s in cerebellar signal processing during physiologically relevant behaviors. The correlation between the extent of block and the Ca<sub>i</sub> rise amplitude may arise from different patterns of PF activity during the behaviors. Together with our results on PF stimulation, the data from behaving mice aids to generate a picture of mGluR1 activation in the MLIs. During natural behavior, PFs carry sensory codes to the cerebellar cortex where sensory feedback is converted to a well programmed sequence of excitation and inhibition of PCs. MLIs provide the indispensable inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jelitai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gaffield and Christie, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rowan et al., 2018</xref>) and the PF-MLI synapses are the sites controlling the amount of inhibition output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bao et al., 2010</xref>). High frequency or prolonged PF activity will induce strong Ca<sub>i</sub> rises in MLIs through the synergy between iGluRs and mGluR.

In this context, our in vivo results showing that mGluR1-dependent rises are totally dependent on simultaneous iGluR activation strongly suggest that AMPAR activation provides a depolarization that activates VGCCs, thus initiating the Ca<sub>i</sub> rise and bootstrapping the mGluR1-activated response. Although most of our experiments used both AMPAR and NMDAR blockers, the evidence shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> indicates that AMPARs alone are responsible for the synergy. This is in accordance with the reliance of mGluR1-dependent IP3 production on AMPAR activation at PF-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Okubo et al., 2004</xref>). A plausible source for the synergistic nature of the signals is the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependence of phospholipase C, which has been documented in cerebellar PCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2011</xref>). Taken together these results suggest that AMPAR/mGluR1 synergy constitutes a double key system controlling postsynaptic Ca<sub>i</sub> responses following prolonged PF stimulation. This double key control is analogous to the well-documented joined requirement for AMPAR and NMDAR activation in the induction of long-term synaptic plasticity. Interestingly, while NMDARs are present extrasynaptically in MLIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter and Regehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002</xref>), the PF-MLI synapses lack NMDARs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Glitsch and Marty, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Cull-Candy, 2002</xref>). Our data indicates that Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs are also absent at this synapse. Nevertheless, PF-MLI synapses are the site of various forms of synaptic plasticity (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dean et al., 2010</xref>). The combined activation of AMPARs and mGluR1s at PF-MLI synapses could control the rise of a postsynaptic calcium signal responsible for associative synaptic plasticity, similarly to the combined activation of AMPARs and NMDARs in other synapses. Likewise, in a subset of interneurons in the hippocampus, a form of long-term synaptic plasticity requires simultaneous activation of mGluR1s, of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeant AMPARs, and of T-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicholson and Kullmann, 2017</xref>). Interestingly, there is another form of synergy between iGluRs and mGluRs involving the electrical field induced by activation of iGluRs, which retards the escape of charged glutamate from the synaptic cleft and favors the activation of mGluRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sylantyev et al., 2013</xref>). Our data does not allow us to exclude this possibility, but this phenomenon alone is unlikely to account for the observed synergy, because this synergy depends on Ca<sup>2</sup> influx.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Distribution of mGluR1s</title><p>It is interesting to compare the mGluR1α distribution on MLIs and PCs, as these two neuron types share a common presynaptic element but differ regarding the nature of the postsynaptic partner and the morphology of the postsynaptic site. PF-PC synapses are located on PC spines while PF-MLI synapses occur on smooth MLI dendrites. Furthermore, PF-PC synapses are encapsulated with glia, thus preventing neurotransmitter escape, whereas PF-MLI synapses lack ensheathing elements. As in the present work, the location of mGluR1α on PF-PC synapses was found to be perisynaptic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baude et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lujan et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Luján et al., 1997</xref>), and it was calculated that 50% of mGluR1α particles were located within 60 nm of the edge of the synapse. This percentage is close to the value reported here for MLIs. The close association of mGluR1s with the PSD rim in both synaptic types is consistent with the AMPAR/mGluR1 synergy proposed above. In addition, this spatial arrangement strongly suggests that in both cases, mGluR1 activation primarily results from homosynaptic glutamate release, and not from glutamate spillover. Nevertheless, differences between the two synaptic types are significant. The PSD size for PF-MLI synapses is twice smaller than that of PF-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrahamsson et al., 2012</xref>), and this results in a significantly shorter distance between the site of vesicular release and mGluR1s, favoring homosynaptic activation of mGluR1s. On the other hand, while glial covering and glutamate uptake favor synapse isolation and hence homosynaptic signaling in PF-PC synapses, the absence of a diffusion barrier imposed by glial membranes around the PF-MLI synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Palay and Chan-Palay, 1974</xref>), and a lower density of glutamate transporter proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chaudhry et al., 1995</xref>), would seem to favor activation by synaptic cross-talk in PF-MLI synapses. Nevertheless, the present finding of a close association of mGluR1 to the PSD at PF-MLI synapses suggests that the advantage of the short distance overrules the disadvantage of the lack of glial covering, so that overall, homosynaptic activation prevails also in the case of the PF-MLI synapse.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Temporal pattern for mGluR1 activation</title><p>Compared to AMPARs, mGluR1s display slow activation kinetics and low desensitization rates. Consequently, single synaptic release results in a small number of activated receptors. A few pulses of high frequency release, however, can recruit a sufficient number of mGluR1s to trigger a measurable response as observed in slice experiments for PF-PC synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Finch and Augustine, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Takechi et al., 1998</xref>) and for PF-MLI synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Karakossian and Otis, 2004</xref>). Longer stimulation trains are expected to recruit an increasing proportion of mGluR1s as their activation develops further while AMPAR desensitization occurs. Our in vivo results are in line with this expectation, showing a growing contribution of mGluR1s to PF-induced Ca<sub>i</sub> responses as a function of train duration. We start seeing mGluR1-mediated Ca<sub>i</sub> rises for bursts of PF activity lasting about 100 ms, a duration commonly recorded in vivo during sensory input or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jörntell and Ekerot, 2006</xref>). Given the above slice results, and because our GCaMP-based signals do not have the same resolution as signals reported by organic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes, it is probable that the actual threshold for activation of mGluR1 in vivo is somewhat lower than our 100 ms estimate.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Experimental procedures complied with animal care guidelines of the University Paris Descartes and the guidelines of the Animal Care and Use committee of University of Science and Technology of China.

Before surgery (10–15 min), mice were injected with buprenorphine (0.35 mg/kg intraperitoneal) for pain reduction. Lidocaine was used as a local anesthetic. Surgeries were performed under isoflurane (1.5–2.0% by volume in air) to maintain a surgical plane of anesthesia as determined by non-responsiveness to toe pinch. Eye ointment was applied under anesthesia at the start of surgery. Animals were held in a stereotaxic apparatus using ear and nose bars to stabilize the head. Body temperature was set with a heating pad and controller using biofeedback from a rectal thermocouple.</p><p>For the surgical procedure, the area of the head over the cerebellum was first shaved and the underlying skin was treated repeatedly with ethanol (70%) and Betadine in alternation. The skin above the skull was removed and the opening of the periosteum as well as any membranous tissue were cleaned. Once the skull was dry, a cranial window was carefully drilled using a handheld high-speed micromotor drill (Foredom). The center of the craniotomoy was located ~2 mm from lambda on the midline targeting lobule IV/V of the cerebellar vermis. Skull removal was performed under application of an ACSF solution to minimize the risk of damaging the dura overlying the brain. After skull removal, the ACSF solution was used to clean any debris from the brain surface and to maintain the brain moist providing an interface to the chronic window. A chronic window was fabricated from a cover glass (#1, thickness 150 μm) laser cut to a small oval shape (2.5 mm x 2 mm) to better fit the cranial opening, and to feature two holes of ~500 μm diameter and 1.5 mm separation on the major axis for drug delivery. The window was placed over the cerebellar vermis lobule IV/V and kept in direct contact with the brain by lowering the window with the help of a needle mounted in the stereotaxic setup. The chronic window was fixed in place with dental cement (Super-Bond C and B). After setting of the dental cement, the bone surrounding the craniotomy was thinned with the micromotor drill to allow for better access with the 20x objective. Then a custom-made stainless steel head post with a central opening for the craniotomy was cemented in place with dental cement (Super-Bond C and B). The chronic window was covered with silicone for protective purposes after surgery.

Mice were positioned with the tip of the nose ~5 mm above the spherical treadmill, and with an angle of ~10° between the tangent of the treadmill and the bottom of the lower jaw, a position which was inferred from free walking on the treadmill. The treadmill's surface was covered with a plastic mesh (square grid of 5 × 5 mm) allowing for easy grip. Mice could walk self-paced on the treadmill. 2-photon laser scanning imaging was performed in the medial part of lobule IV/V of the cerebellar vermis region with a custom-built setup (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franconville et al., 2011</xref>), which was extended with a resonant scanning mirror (Sutter Resscan-Gen). Imaging was performed in the molecular layer at depths of 50 to 100 μm from the surface and the field of view was chosen in order to maximize the number of simultaneously recorded MLI somata. Excitation wavelength of the laser (MaiTai, Spectra Physics) was set at 910 nm and in some cases to 820 nm to measure movement related fluorescent changes. Laser power out of the objective (20x, 1.0 NA, Olympus, XLUMPlanFl N) was typically &lt;80 mW.

At 6 s, a servo motor moved a continuous rotation servo in a gear attached to the axis of the treadmill. The continuous servo started to linearly accelerates (3.33 cm/s<sup>2</sup>) the wheel at 7 s until a maximal speed of 10 cm/s was reached at 10 s. This rotation speed was kept constant until 23 s at which point the motor linearly decelerated (−3.33 cm/s<sup>2</sup>) until standstill at 26 s and then moved out of the gear on the treadmill axis allowing for self-paced walking.

When using the 75th percentile, the fluorescence values of the drops of fluorescence during locomotion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>) do not affect the analysis. Rather, the 75th percentile emphasizes the high fluorescence parts on which we want to focus here. We observed an overall decay of locomotion fluorescence with increasing number of repetitions, which was shared across all ROIs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). In order to compensate for that decay, we fitted a single-exponentially decaying function <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mfenced separators="|"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfenced><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> (where <italic>j</italic> denotes pre-drug recording numbers as linearly increasing integers; A, B, C are fit parameters) to the <italic>pre-drug</italic> locomotion fluorescence values. This function is subtracted from <italic>all</italic> recordings, pre- and after-drug, which normalized the pre-drug locomotion fluorescence to zero and revealed any drug induced change beyond the general decay (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Note that by considering the decay as function of recordings <italic>j</italic>, the fluorescence decay is linked to the increasing number of the recordings rather than explicit time.</p><p>To test for changes in drug-induced fluorescence, we performed paired t-test comparisons for each ROI between all pre- and post-drug locomotion fluorescence values (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) excluding the first three recordings after drug-delivery to account for the wash-in time of the drug (τ = 5.5 min, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To assess fluorescence changes linked to calcium vs. changes related to movement artifacts in the recorded tissue, we performed forced locomotion recordings before application of CPCCOEt at 820 nm laser excitation wavelength at which GCaMP fluorescence is insensitive to the calcium changes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). The calcium imaging recordings went through the same image processing procedure as outlined above for the 910 nm excitation wavelength recordings. However, ROI detection was impaired in Suite2p due to the strongly reduced temporal ROI fluorescence dynamics. ROIs corresponding to MLI cell bodies were therefore mostly labeled by hand using oval shapes. Fluorescence images from before drug application and 820 nm excitation runs were aligned (see above). ROIs with an overlap of at least 30% of the total ROI area were considered corresponding to the same cell body (see above). The standard deviation and 75<sup>th</sup> percentile of the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>Δ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> were calculated for the maximal-speed locomotion period ([10,25] s). The same values were extracted for the corresponding ROIs from the runs before drug application and averaged. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> summarizes the ratios between the 820 and the 910 nm excitation wavelength runs of all ROIs per animal. A fraction of 30–50% of the fluorescence changes can be attributed to movement artifacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), while the increase in fluorescence is largely driven by calcium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marco Capogna (Reviewer #2).</p><p>All three reviewers agree that the study is of high potential interest. However, major issues have been raised such that the conclusions are not firmly supported by the data shown. Because it is <italic>eLife</italic>'s policy to reject manuscripts that are likely to require more than 2 months of additional work, the decision was made to reject this version so that you are free to submit it elsewhere at this time, should you wish. Nonetheless, all the reviewers and editors see the very high potential value and interest of the work, and if you agree that doing the requested experiments will strengthen the manuscript, <italic>eLife</italic> would welcome a new submission of this work. The authors are encouraged to take the time to address the concerns thoroughly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The study addresses physiological requirements for activation of group 1 mGluRs and their functional and spatial relationship to AMPARs at the parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron (MLI) synapses in the cerebellum in vivo. Using GCaMP Ca imaging of MLI neurons, the authors report that longer duration PF stimulation (1 s rather than 200 ms) at 100 Hz is more effective in eliciting mGluR1-dependent Ca rises in MLI soma, in a manner that is synergistic with activation of AMPARs. Interestingly, AMPARs involved are not Ca-permeable in contrast to previous studies at developing MLI synapses, and the depolarization caused by AMPAR activation likely recruits VGCC to confer VGCC-dependence of mGluR1 activation as shown in acute slices. The authors also perform ultrastructural analysis of mGluR1 subcellular distribution by freeze-fracture replica labelling, which shows its localization close to the PSD. Altogether, in identifying several features of mGluR1 involvement at PF-MLI synapses in vivo, while somewhat descriptive, the findings are valuable. The major technical issue is the use of different GCaMP variants. While the initial demonstration of sensory stimuli-evoked MLI activity and its similarity to PF stimulation-triggered response are shown by GCaMP6s, subsequent analyses use mostly GCaMP3 imaging which not only differ in sensitivity for detecting MLI activity but also display different kinetics. In addition, demonstration of the involvement of mGluR1 for 100 ms-long trains at 500 Hz is shown using GCaMP5. There needs to be a consistency in the activity readout used across experiments to compellingly demonstrate that mGluR1 activity as reported is involved in vivo under physiologically relevant paradigms.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This work directed by Isabel Llano and Ryuchi Shigemoto investigates parallel fibers (PFs) glutamatergic synapses onto molecular layer interneurons (MLI) of the mouse cerebellum. They found that mGluR1s are activated in vivo by synaptically-released glutamate and act together with ionotropic (i)GluRs to trigger intracellular calcium rise. Furthermore, and this is one of the nicest findings of this manuscript, high resolution analysis of the spatial distribution of postsynaptic mGluR1 PF-MLI synapse distribution show that these receptors are remarkable close to iGluRs, consistent with their observed synergic functional effects.</p><p>The manuscript is competently written and illustrated. The senior authors are expert researchers in the field of cerebellum synapses, calcium imaging and high resolution receptor localization analysis.</p><p>Overall, I like this manuscript. I have some constructive criticism that I hope will help the Authors to improve the quality and completeness of their study and ultimately enhance the impact of their manuscript when it will be published.</p><p>1) It is a pity that most of the study uses electrical stimulation of PFs, and not a more physiological way to stimulate the PFs-MLI pathway, to investigate the calcium signaling in MLIs and iGluRs/mGluR1 synergic activation. In a few experiments, calcium responses of MLI are evoked by air puffs. However, due to the relatively high calcium signal variability observed after air puff stimulation, the Authors decided to conduct most of their pharmacological experiments by using electrical stimulation. On the contrary, I recommend the Authors to reproduce key results (eg, iGluRs/mGluR1 synergic activation) by using air puffs stimulation, and to include the results of these new experiments in the revised version of the manuscript. Moreover, it would be extremely interesting to investigate the PFs-MLI synapses and the iGluRs/mGluR1 signaling evoked by eyeblink conditioning, a form of classical conditioned learning, that overwhelming evidence demonstrate to involve cerebellar synapses as major substrate. In my opinion to include the requested new experiments (more air puff data and eyeblink conditioning) would enhance very significantly the significance and the impact of this work.</p><p>2) Drugs are applied to the pool bathing the craniotomy and no wash out is possible and observed. Furthermore, the actual concentration of the drugs reaching the receptors remains unknown. It would useful to perform some control experiment (e.g., application of a drug at two or three different concentrations; or fluorescence imaging of applied drug diffusion) to be reassured that the lack of the action of some drugs (e.g., IEM1460) is a genuine result and not (at least in part) due to poor drug diffusion to plasma membranes containing AMPARs.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Bao et al. seeks to find out whether mGluRs are engaged on Molecular Layer Interneurons (MLIs) of the Cerebellum during physiologically relevant synaptic activation in vivo and whether their signalling is dependent on iGluR activity. To answer these questions, the authors perform novel and technically demanding recordings of Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients from MLIs in vivo, and also in ex vivo slices. These are important questions and innovative techniques are employed to address them, but the data are preliminary which leaves the conclusions poorly supported.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) It is claimed that MLIs are activated as a &quot;beam&quot; by air puffs. This is not quantified so conclusions on this question are premature. This also questions whether it is reasonable to replicate the physiological stimulation with electrical stimulation of the PFs.</p><p>2) The observed timecourse of the putative mGluR1-mediated calcium response is very rapid for a G-protein induced response (eg Figure 2). Furthermore, the timecourse seems to be exactly the same for both mGluR1-mediated and iGluR-mediated components. This doesn't seem likely which calls into question whether the responses are indeed mediated by mGluR1. To confirm this requires more than just a single drug application, which could in fact be inhibiting glutamate release from PFs.</p><p>3) The rationale for the use of direct PF stimulation is that it gives a more reliable signal than air puffs and that they are equivalent. However, the signals are not that similar despite the assertion. Decay rates much slower for air puffs. Furthermore the most equivalent stimulation is 20 pulses at 100Hz but at this stimulation duration and frequency there is little effect of mGluR1.</p><p>4) One of the core findings claimed in the manuscript is the synergy between iGluR and mGluR but this is never directly demonstrated. Need to compare application of iGluR antagonist and then mGluR antagonist vs mGluR antagonist alone and quantify the difference.</p><p>5) Overall there is reasonable evidence for lack of Ca-permeable AMPARs but it would be useful to show a positive control for IEM use in vivo. What does it do in vitro?</p><p>6) The experiment to test role of VGCCs is very preliminary. Photorelease of Glu onto the soma likely initiates APs leading to the observed calcium signal. The fact this is blocked in a single experiment is not convincing and in any case does not reveal much about whether the AMPARs are calcium permeable. The claim that &quot;response of MLIs to mGluR1 agonists is abolished by inclusion of VGCC blocker Cd2+&quot; is not supported by the data.</p><p>7) An alternative possibility for synergy between iGluR and mGluR is electrotonic effects on glutamate diffusion (Sylantyev et al., 2013). However, insufficient evidence is presented to distinguish between this and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mechanisms.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;Synergism of type1 metabotropic and ionotropic glutamate receptors in cerebellar molecular layer interneurons in vivo&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gary Westbrook as the Senior Editor The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marco Capogna (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that additional data would make the manuscript stronger.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a revision of a previously submitted study, examining the activation of group 1 mGluRs at parallel fiber-molecular layer interneuron (MLI) synapses in the cerebellum during physiological activity, now monitored in awake behaving mice. The authors demonstrate recruitment of mGluR-dependent Ca signals during locomotion, and that mGluR activation is synergistic with the activation of iGluRs.</p><p>Although the two reviewers of the original submission found that the revision suitably addressed their points, the third reviewer who was new, had some concerns, especially pointing out that although demonstrating the activation of mGluRs during walking was novel, whether this resulted from PF activity similar to the electrical stimulation used in anesthetized mice and in other slice physiology experiments remained unclear. Upon discussion amongst all three reviewers and the senior editor, we request that the authors carefully address the following points by making use of data or information that they might already possess, by toning down the claims or by referencing existing literature.</p><p>1) Information about the intensity of the electrical stimulation used in anesthetized mice experiments and how it relates to the data acquired in awake behaving mice would be valuable. That is, how many PFs are being recruited? What EPSC amplitudes are associated with the reported calcium transients?</p><p>2) Reword the text inciting anticipation that the study addresses a specific role for mGluRs in synaptic plasticity, for example at the start of the Abstract.</p><p>3) The freeze-fracture EM data is very nice and convincing. However, many of the measurements in the manuscript are taken from the cell body where surely few excitatory synapses are found. The authors should acknowledge this issue in the text.</p><p>4) It would be nice to have more details about the location of the imaging, i.e. how deep into the molecular layer. Having this information would help the reader determine the type of cells imaged because there could be functional heterogeneity between cells localized in different parts of the molecular layer.</p><p>5) Figure 2D and 2E.

The new set of experiments in behaving mice (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2) were performed in animals expressing GCaMP3, that is, the same protein as that used for the initial characterization of the effect of mGluR block on PF-evoked Cai rises. These new experiments demonstrate that mGluRs are activated in awake and physiologically relevant conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] Overall, I like this manuscript.

While the suggestion of the reviewer to study signals “evoked by eyeblink conditioning” is interesting, we preferred to continue working in the same cerebellar region as that used during the studies with electrical stimulation of PFs. This choice is dictated by the need to decrease biological variability, already large in a behaving situation. We decided to a conduct pharmacological study on the effect of mGluR1 block on the calcium signals recorded from MLIs while mice walk in a wheel since walking was previously shown to engage MLI activity in the vermis both with electrophysiological recordings (Jelitai et al., 2016) and with calcium imaging (Ozden et al., 2012). The results of these experiments are described in section “Activation of mGluRs in MLIs during locomotion” (Figure 3 and Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and 2).</p><p>The data show that mGluR1 block decreases the magnitude of the calcium signals associated with walking. Furthermore, the amount of inhibition depends on the initial amplitude of the signal, which is in accord with the results obtained with electrical stimulation of PFs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Drugs are applied to the pool bathing the craniotomy and no wash out is possible and observed.

The situation is not well suited to perform dose-response curves. However, we do have several lines of evidence indicating that the drugs reach the molecular layer at sufficiently high concentrations to achieve the desired block. Concerning experiments on anesthetized mice, as shown in Figure 2, addition of ionotropic blocker after mGluR block totally abolishes the calcium signals elected by PF stimulation.</p><p>Concerning the new experiments in behaving mice, we added Alexa 594 to the craniotomy and followed the time course of fluorescence increase. The results are shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 and indicate that the Alexa concentration equilibrates with a time constant of 5 minutes. Since Alexa and CPCCOEt have similar molecular weights, the time constant of equilibration of CPCCOEt is likely close to 5 minutes as well.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The manuscript by Bao et al. seeks to find out whether mGluRs are engaged on Molecular Layer Interneurons (MLIs) of the Cerebellum during physiologically relevant synaptic activation in vivo and whether their signalling is dependent on iGluR activity.

The general objection of the reviewer is that data is preliminary: “, but the data are preliminary which leaves the conclusions poorly supported.” This statement was primarily directed to the air puff experiments, which have been removed. For the rest of the manuscript, we stress that our initial presentation of our results was very succinct, thus giving perhaps a false impression of superficiality. In fact our work, as presented in the original manuscript, strongly supports the conclusion that mGluRs type 1 are engaged in MLIs following PF stimulation in anesthetized mice. The new experiments that have now been incorporated to the revised version show that these receptors are also recruited during walking in awake mice. Furthermore, the manuscript investigates details of iGluR-mGluR interactions, and it presents for the first time the distribution of mGluR1 at the PF-MLI synapse, using quantitative EM. Altogether, the work presents a complete description of the mGluR1 component of PF-MLI synapses, all the way from the molecular level up to awake in vivo data. In the revised version, we have added some quantification and experimental detail to document better the experimental bases of our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) It is claimed that MLIs are activated as a &quot;beam&quot; by air puffs. This is not quantified so conclusions on this question are premature. This also questions whether it is reasonable to replicate the physiological stimulation with electrical stimulation of the PFs.</p></disp-quote><p>This data set has been removed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The observed timecourse of the putative mGluR1-mediated calcium response is very rapid for a G-protein induced response (eg Figure 2). Furthermore, the timecourse seems to be exactly the same for both mGluR1-mediated and iGluR-mediated components. This doesn't seem likely which calls into question whether the responses are indeed mediated by mGluR1. To confirm this requires more than just a single drug application, which could in fact be inhibiting glutamate release from PFs.</p></disp-quote><p>Concerning the speed of the responses: G-protein induced responses vary considerably in their onset kinetics. Our own work on MLIs has shown that mGluR1-induced currents and mGluR1- induced calcium rises in these cells can rise within a few tens of ms after application of a glutamatergic agonist (Collin et al., 2005). Such a time course is compatible with the time course of calcium rises observed in the present work.</p><p>Concerning the comparison of response kinetics with and without blockers: Because we are using a calcium probe with relatively slow kinetics, the time course of the calcium rises is largely dictated by the probe and is unlikely to give us insight into the receptors and/or signaling pathways involved. This is the reason that we have refrained from time course considerations.</p><p>Concerning the drug application, which could in fact be inhibiting glutamate release from PFs.:We are not aware of any evidence for mGluR1 being expressed at the presynaptic side of central synapses. R Shigemoto’s laboratory has looked at different stages of development and found no immunoreactivity for mGluR1 at PF axons (Lopez-Bendito et al., 2001). On the other hand, block of mGluR1 reduces the LTD induced at PF-stellate cell synapses with certain stimulation protocols (Soler-Llavina and Sabatini, 2006). As endocannabinoid production in PCs is enhanced by mGluR1 activation, the LTD is thought to involve an inhibition of glutamate release by endocannabinoids receptors present in PFs. Although we have no evidence for LTD induction in our work, one could argue that there is an endogenous level of LTD at this synapse that is modulated by endocannabinoids. However, block of mGluR1 would be expected to decrease endocannabinoid production and then increase glutamate release. Therefore, this mechanism has the wrong sign to explain the observed inhibition associated with mGluR1 block.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rationale for the use of direct PF stimulation is that it gives a more reliable signal than air puffs and that they are equivalent. However, the signals are not that similar despite the assertion. Decay rates much slower for air puffs.

Need to compare application of iGluR antagonist and then mGluR antagonist vs mGluR antagonist alone and quantify the difference.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our rationale was not explained correctly and we added an explicit comparison for the percentage of block observed with iGluRs versus mGluR1 antagonists. Concerning the suggestion of blocking mGluR1 in the presence of iGluRs antagonists, as shown in Figure 4B, blocking iGluRs results in an almost total block of the calcium rises evoked by PF stimulation (&gt;90 % block at 100 Hz during 1 s), so that it is impractical to study the pharmacology of the remaining response. By contrast, applying CPCCOEt alone inhibits the response by approximately 50 % (Figure 2D), and the remaining response is abolished by iGluR blockers (Figure 2C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Overall there is reasonable evidence for lack of Ca-permeable AMPARs but it would be useful to show a positive control for IEM use in vivo. What does it do in vitro?</p></disp-quote><p>We have no positive control for this drug in vivo. However, the fact that calcium rises are abolished after addition of mGluR1 and iGluRs blockers (Figure 2) indicates that drugs do reach the molecular layer. Furthermore, the new data set with ALEXA (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) gives us a time constant of 5 minutes for diffusion of this fluorophore in the tissue. These results suggest that IEM, as well as the other drugs used, did reach the imaged site. And given the published effect of IEM in vitro , the absence of effect on the calcium rises can be interpreted as indicative of lack of calcium-permeable AMPA Rs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The experiment to test role of VGCCs is very preliminary. Photorelease of Glu onto the soma likely initiates APs leading to the observed calcium signal. The fact this is blocked in a single experiment is not convincing and in any case does not reveal much about whether the AMPARs are calcium permeable. The claim that &quot;response of MLIs to mGluR1 agonists is abolished by inclusion of VGCC blocker Cd2+&quot; is not supported by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We conducted new experiments in slices to verify that the signals evoked by 1ms glutamate uncaging over the soma are due to mGluR1 activation. The results were clear, with robust response in control saline and hardy any signal in the presence of the mGluR1 blocker. This is now reported in subsection “Synergy between iGluRs and mGluR1s is not mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable AMPARs”.</p><p>Concerning the block by Cd, the block shown in Figure 4C is one example that is representative of 4 experiments as stated in the text (subsection “Synergy between iGluRs and mGluR1s is not mediated by Ca<sup>2+-</sup>permeable AMPARs”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) An alternative possibility for synergy between iGluR and mGluR is electrotonic effects on glutamate diffusion (Sylantyev et al., 2013). However, insufficient evidence is presented to distinguish between this and Ca2+-dependent mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a paragraph to discuss this possibility (subsection “Synergistic Ca<sub>i</sub> rises following combined activation of mGluR1s and iGluRs”).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the two reviewers of the original submission found that the revision suitably addressed their points, the third reviewer who was new, had some concerns, especially pointing out that although demonstrating the activation of mGluRs during walking was novel, whether this resulted from PF activity similar to the electrical stimulation used in anesthetized mice and in other slice physiology experiments remained unclear. Upon discussion amongst all three reviewers and the senior editor, we request that the authors carefully address the following points by making use of data or information that they might already possess, by toning down the claims or by referencing existing literature.</p><p>1) Information about the intensity of the electrical stimulation used in anesthetized mice experiments and how it relates to the data acquired in awake behaving mice would be valuable. That is, how many PFs are being recruited? What EPSC amplitudes are associated with the reported calcium transients?</p></disp-quote><p>The intensity of the extracellular stimulation (30 to 80 V; 200 µs long pulses) as well as the criteria for choosing the stimulation voltage are described in Materials and methods as:</p><p>“The pipette was placed on the superficial molecular layer more than 150 µm from site imaged to avoid direct stimulation of the neurons in that field. Ag-AgCl electrodes connected the pipette to an isolated pulse stimulator (AM-systems) delivering 200 µs long pulses at 30-80 V amplitude. Initial search for stimulation site and parameters was performed with the criteria that 10 pulses at 100 Hz elicited Ca<sub>i</sub> rises whose trial-totrial variability did not exceed 10 %.”</p><p>To estimate how comparable are signals recorded with parallel fiber (PF) stimulation protocol and those during locomotion, we first compared the calcium transients evoked in these two types of experiments. For 0.2 to 1 sec long PF trains at 100 Hz, we obtained peak DF/Fo of 114+31 and 347+43 % (mean+sem) respectively, whereas for the locomotion associated transients the corresponding values were 128.2+8.5 %. Thus, calcium transients in MLIs somata are in a comparable range for both experimental conditions. Secondly, as the reviewers suggested, we can estimate the EPSC in MLIs under these two conditions. We have data from Jin Bao’s paper in Journal of Neuroscience (2010) reporting in stellate cells an EPSC amplitude of ~100 pA following stimulation of GCs with theta glass pipettes, as used in the current study. This value is comparable to that obtained from in vivo patch clamp recordings of stellate cells in locomoting mice (60-70 pA, Supl. Figure 3, Jelitai, et al., 2016). However, spatial and temporal patterns of activation differ. The electrical stimulation we use imposes a “beam” like pattern of MLI recruitment (with a width in the range of 20 to 50 µm; Figure 1, see also Astorga et al., 2015). On the other hand, locomotion engages a much larger population of MLIs (Figure 3) in accord with results from Ozden et al., 2012. Temporal differences are also expected, as discussed below.</p><p>Concerning the number of PFs recruited: In extracellular stimulation experiments, we presume that action potential thresholds are rather homogeneous across PFs, so that all PFs within a beam are excited at the frequency imposed by extracellular stimulation. During locomotion, likewise, a vast majority of GCs are activated (94% of all GCs in a large field of view, according to Ozden et al., 2012). The impact on MLIs is a change in firing rate from an average value of 20 Hz in quiet mice to 60 Hz during self-paced locomotion (Jelitai et al., 2016). GC firing in mice walking spontaneously is very heterogeneous in time and in space. In time, firing occurs in high frequency bursts with frequency within a burst ranging from 60 to 142 Hz, and burst durations ranging from 30 to 140 ms. Strikingly, these values are close to those needed to obtain measurable mGluR responses with extracellular stimulation (Figure 2). In space, individual GCs are reported to vary markedly in their firing patterns when mice are walking. In view of the results of Figure 3 indicating a measurable mGluR contribution in a rather small proportion of MLIs, it is plausible that particularly active GCs cooperate within the dendritic field of these particular MLIs to produce mGluR activation as a result of temporal and spatial summation of the perisynaptic glutamate concentration.</p><p>We added a slightly shorter version of these arguments to Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reword the text inciting anticipation that the study addresses a specific role for mGluRs in synaptic plasticity, for example at the start of the Abstract.</p></disp-quote><p>We deleted from the Abstract the mention of synaptic plasticity. We also removed from Introduction the sentence referring to “other forms of synaptic plasticity”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The freeze-fracture EM data is very nice and convincing. However, many of the measurements in the manuscript are taken from the cell body where surely few excitatory synapses are found.

Having this information would help the reader determine the type of cells imaged because there could be functional heterogeneity between cells localized in different parts of the molecular layer.</p></disp-quote><p>Imaging depth ranged from 50 to 100 µm from the surface (now specified in the Materials and methods).
