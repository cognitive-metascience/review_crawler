distinct metabolic niches within multi-species communities. However, it has remained largely unclear whether metabolic specialization can similarly occur within a clonal bacterial population. More specifically, it is not clear what functions such specialization could provide and how specialization could be coordinated dynamically. Here, we show that exponentially growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cultures divide into distinct interacting metabolic subpopulations, including one population that produces acetate, and another population that differentially expresses metabolic genes for the production of acetoin, a pH-neutral storage molecule. These subpopulations exhibit distinct growth rates and dynamic interconversion between states. Furthermore, acetate concentration influences the relative sizes of the different subpopulations. These results show that clonal populations can use metabolic specialization to control the environment through a process of dynamic, environmentally-sensitive state-switching.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33099.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The chemical reactions that occur within a living organism are collectively referred to as its metabolism. Many metabolic reactions produce byproducts that will poison the cells if they are not dealt with: fermenting bacteria, for example, release harmful organic acids and alcohols. How the bacteria respond to these toxins has been most studied at the level of entire microbial populations, meaning the activities of individual cells are effectively “averaged” together. Yet, even two bacteria with the same genes and living in the same environment can behave in different ways. This raises the question: do bacterial populations specialize into distinct subpopulations that play distinct roles when dealing with metabolic products, or do all cells in the community act in unison?</p><p>Rosenthal et al. set out to answer this question for a community of <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, a bacterium that is commonly studied in the laboratory and used for the industrial production of enzymes. The analysis focused on genes involved in fundamental metabolic processes, known as the TCA cycle, which the bacteria use to generate energy and build biomass. The experiments revealed that, even when all the cells are genetically identical, different <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cells do indeed specialize into metabolic subpopulations with distinct growth rates.</p><p>Time-lapse movies of bacteria that made fluorescent markers of different colors whenever certain metabolic genes became active showed cells switching different colors on and off, indicating that they switch between metabolic subpopulations. Further biochemical studies and measures of gene activity revealed that the different subpopulations produce and release distinct metabolic products, including toxic byproducts. Notably, the release of these metabolites by one subpopulation appeared to activate other subpopulations within the community.</p><p>This example of cells specializing into unique interacting metabolic subpopulations provides insight into several fundamental issues in microbiology and beyond. It is relevant to evolutionary biologists, since the fact that fractions of the population can switch in and out of a metabolic state, instead of evolving into several inflexible specialists, may provide an evolutionary advantage in fluctuating natural environments by reducing the risk of extinction. It also has implications for industrial fermentation processes and metabolic engineering, and may help biotechnologists design more efficient ways to harness bacterial metabolism to produce useful products.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>division of labor</kwd><kwd>Bacillus subtilis</kwd><kwd>acetate</kwd><kwd>overflow metabolism</kwd><kwd>fermentation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>B. subtilis</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1GM079771</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>Adam Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yutao</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name><name><surname>Elowitz</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000185</institution-id><institution>Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biochronicity Grant DARPA-BAA-11-66</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>Adam Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Yutao</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Sophia Hsin-Jung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Center for Environmental Microbial Interactions at Caltech</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rosenthal</surname><given-names>Adam Z</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1547056</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elowitz</surname><given-names>Michael B</given-names></name><name><surname>Park</surname><given-names>Jin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Metabolic division of labor in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> controls the extracellular environment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Co-utilization of carbon sources was described alongside diauxie by Jacques Monod in his PhD thesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Monod, 1958</xref>), and is common in many organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Peyraud et al., 2012</xref>). In the Gram-positive bacterium <italic>Bacillus subtilis,</italic> two preferred carbon sources are co-utilized: glucose and malate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleijn et al., 2010</xref>). When both of these carbon sources are available they are consumed simultaneously, generating growth rates that surpass those achieved with either substrate alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kleijn et al., 2010</xref>). Under conditions of rapid growth, co-consumption of glucose and malate leads to the accumulation of high levels of acetate (Kleijn et al., 2010). As a weak organic acid, acetate can be harmful to cells even in buffered medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosenthal et al., 2008</xref>). Acetate and related short-chain fatty acids enter the cell passively in the neutral form and then dissociate intracellularly, releasing a proton and transiently acidifying the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Russell and Diez-Gonzalez, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roe et al., 1998</xref>). The intracellular dissociation of acetate also disrupts the cellular anion balance, with negative effects on metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Roe et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roe et al., 2002</xref>) and transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rosenthal et al., 2008</xref>). When extracellular acetate levels rise to toxic levels the growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> culture consumes the acetate and produces acetoin, a non-toxic pH-neutral overflow metabolite that can be used as a carbon source in later growth stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Speck and Freese, 1973</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33099.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Two genes in central carbon metabolism are heterogeneously expressed in a clonal population of <italic>B. subtilis</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>B. subtilis</italic> uses glucose and malate as preferred carbon sources, and under aerobic culture conditions produces acetate and acetoin as major overflow metabolites.

However, it has generally been studied only at the population level, implicitly assuming a homogeneous progression of the entire culture from acetate producing to acetate detoxifying states. By contrast, single cell approaches suggest that bacterial populations can exhibit enormous heterogeneity in functional and gene expression states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Locke et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Süel et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Levine et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Davidson and Surette, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dubnau and Losick, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gefen and Balaban, 2009</xref>). This prompts the questions of whether microbial cells differentiate into metabolically distinct subpopulations, and more specifically, whether acetate production and detoxification might occur in distinct cells specializing in acetate production or detoxification, respectively.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>To address these questions we constructed a library of strains with reporters for key genes involved in central carbon metabolism, acetate production, and organic acid detoxification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We introduced a fluorescent protein (YFP) under the control of promoters for 13 different metabolic genes and stably incorporated them into the commonly used <italic>sacA</italic> site within the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Locke et al., 2011</xref>). We chose to use fluorescent promoter reporters because they allow acquisition of dynamic measurements from individual living cells, are easy to construct and integrate into the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> genome, allow for analysis of multiple genes within the same cell, and can be used in fluorescence cell sorting for RNAseq experiments. Using quantitative single-cell fluorescence microscopy, we analyzed the distribution of expression levels of these 13 metabolic genes in individual cells at different times along the growth curve in buffered culture medium containing 22 mM glucose and 50 mM malate. To eliminate oxygen gradients, 10 mL cultures were grown in 250 mL flasks with rapid shaking (250 RPM).</p><p>Four genes had expression levels that were at or near background and were not considered further (<italic>acoA</italic>, <italic>gntZ</italic>, <italic>pycA</italic>, <italic>sdhC</italic>). Most of the genes showed unimodal distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), with relatively little skew (less than ±0.7). Two genes, <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>alsS</italic>, encoding succinate co-A ligase and acetolactate synthase, respectively, were more heterogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We observed skew values greater than 1 (4.72 and 1.14, respectively) with 3.8% of P<italic><sub>sucC</sub></italic>-YFP and 8.1% of P<italic><sub>alsS</sub></italic>-YFP cells exhibiting high expression levels (≥2 standard deviations above the mean) at OD<sub>600</sub> ~0.8 (<italic>sucC</italic>) and OD<sub>600</sub> ~2 (<italic>alsS</italic>). In addition, for both genes, we observed cells whose expression exceeded the mean by &gt;3 fold. While gene expression distribution can be broader immediately after gene activation than at steady-state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shahrezaei and Swain, 2008</xref>), both <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>alsS</italic> maintained heterogeneous expression for several hours after the onset of expression. For these reasons, we decided to focus on these two genes for further study.</p><p>To better understand when this heterogeneity emerges in batch culture, we performed a time course analysis of the fraction of <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>alsS</italic> positive cells (cells ≥ 2 standard deviations above the mean were denoted <italic>sucC+</italic> and <italic>alsS+</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We observed that the subpopulation of <italic>sucC+</italic> cells only existed transiently, in mid- to late-exponential phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), coinciding with the time and culture optical density at which acetate production was observed (when the time derivative in acetate, that is, the rate of change in acetate concentration, is positive ~150–300 min, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). This observation suggested that <italic>sucC</italic> expression could be involved in acetate production. A parallel analysis of <italic>alsS</italic> expression revealed the opposite behavior, with <italic>alsS</italic> expression dynamics coinciding with a decrease in acetate and a concomitant increase in acetoin levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D</xref>). This behavior is generally consistent with the known role of <italic>alsS</italic> in acetoin production in response to acetate toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Speck and Freese, 1973</xref>). Together, these results show that a dynamic change in acetate and acetoin levels in the culture overlaps with changes in the population fraction of <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>alsS</italic> expressing cells.</p><p>A role for sucC in acetate production has not been studied previously. To understand the relationship between the subpopulation marked <italic>sucC+</italic> and acetate production, we used fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) of the P<italic><sub>sucC</sub></italic>YFP reporter strain to sort cells expressing YFP from a <italic>SucC</italic> promoter at the time of peak acetate levels, and performed RNAseq to compare gene expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). As expected, <italic>sucC</italic> expression was elevated 2-fold in the <italic>sucC+</italic> sorted subpopulation (blue dot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). This is particularly meaningful considering the fact that the fluorescent marker used for sorting is a stable reporter, making it likely that some sorted cells may have high level of fluorescent signal even after exiting the transcriptionally active state. For most genes, we observed a broad correlation in gene expression between the two populations. However, RNAseq analysis with cuffdiff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Trapnell et al., 2010</xref>) and gene set enrichment analysis with GSEA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Subramanian et al., 2005</xref>) showed that genetic competence genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berka et al., 2002</xref>) were significantly enriched in the ~300 upregulated genes in the <italic>sucC+</italic> subpopulation (red dots and inset, −2A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">supplementary file 2</xref>; GSEA p&lt;e-16). The <italic>sucC+</italic> population also exhibited increased expression of the phosphate acetyltransferase gene, <italic>pta</italic> (green dot, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), the enzyme that catalyzes the final step in overflow acetate production. Thus, <italic>sucC</italic> expression marks a distinct gene expression state that could be involved in acetate production.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33099.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The heterogeneous expression of <italic>sucC</italic> is correlated with the genetic-competence regulon, and this metabolic state produces extracellular acetate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RNAseq of cells sorted at either a high or moderate <italic>sucC</italic> level reveals positive correlation between sucC expression, the competence program, and the acetate metabolism gene <italic>pta.</italic> Cells expressing YFP under the control of the <italic>sucC</italic> promoter were sorted at high or normal expression levels.

In many fruits and vegetables both organic acids (including malic acid) and sugars are very high, providing a natural setting where <italic>B. subtilis</italic> has access to its two preferred carbon sources simultaneously. <italic>B subtilis</italic> is commonly enriched (almost to levels of purity) in traditional fermentation of certain foods, including fermented soy-bean foods (eg natto) that are common in Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kubo et al., 2011</xref>). In these beans sugar is present, and malic acid is also present in the root system of legumes and in soybean exudate, where it plays a role in iron homeostasis as a metal chelating agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Tiffin and Brown, 1962</xref>).</p><p>The ‘acetate switch’ refers to the accumulation and reabsorption of acetate. It is a classic hallmark of bacterial growth in aerobic conditions, common to many bacteria including <italic>B. subtilis</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolfe, 2005</xref>). It allows for rapid initial growth until acetate levels and associated acidity reach toxic levels, at which point acetate is reabsorbed and replaced with pH-neutral overflow metabolites such as acetoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolfe, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Speck and Freese, 1973</xref>). Growth strategies in which a preferred toxic overflow metabolite is produced under aerobic conditions are also used by other organisms that expel and control different fermented toxic overflow metabolites, including ethanol fermentation by yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Otterstedt et al., 2004</xref>) and lactic acid in lactobacillus species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borch and Molin, 1989</xref>). Interestingly, in the fermentation of ethanol by the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, ethanol is produced in dynamic bursts in which some cells switch in and out of fermentative metabolism. These bursts can be synchronized in chemostat growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Tu et al., 2005</xref>), but also appear in batch culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Silverman et al., 2010</xref>). In yeast, the single cell dynamics, mechanisms, and role of these bursts have not been fully elucidated. However, the presence of metabolically specialized subpopulations of cells in both eukaryotes and bacteria suggests that segregating different fermentative or respiratory pathways into individual cells may be a general strategy. It could function to avoid metabolic incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brandriss and Magasanik, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kumar et al., 2010</xref>), controlling cellular challenges such as reducing potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2017</xref>), or to optimize enzyme and substrate scaling, in which locally high concentrations of enzymes and substrates may be needed for efficient enzymatic conversion to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nikel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ackermann, 2015</xref>). Better understanding of the principles that govern segregation of metabolic activities will facilitate metabolic engineering and industrial fermentation approaches. This is especially true for commonly used industrial strains which naturally produce multiple fermentation products. For example, <italic>E. coli</italic> strains simultaneously produce five different fermentation products during mixed-acid fermentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark, 1989</xref>).</p><p>The rapid release of toxic overflow products also has a role in the context of competition within a multi-species environment. In such environments, a quick buildup of toxic products can be advantageous to ward off competing species. In the case of human infectious disease, the buildup of byproducts such as lactic acid from normal microbiota limits infection by pathogens that are not lactic acid specialists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">O'Hanlon et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, in industrial fermenters and microbial food fermentation secreted overflow metabolites, including acetate and ethanol, limit contamination. Additionally, if a particular metabolic niche is transient, as in the case of acetate production in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> colony growth or batch culture, a strategy in which cells can switch in and out of metabolic states can be advantageous relative to an alternative scenario in which multiple strains are evolutionarily ‘locked’ into distinct specialist roles. This is especially true if the metabolic niche (e.g. acetate) is short-lived, because a ‘locked’ specialist strain would be at a disadvantage during periods of growth when acetate is absent.</p><p>In this study, we linked the presence of extracellular acetate with the activation of <italic>alsS</italic> in a subset of cells. In the case of competence and <italic>sucC</italic>, which are both controlled by the master regulator <italic>comK</italic>, quorum sensing plays a critical role in the activation of the competence program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dubnau, 1991</xref>). Maximizing competence requires specific media conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dubnau, 1982</xref>), raising the possibility that alongside quorum sensing peptides, secreted metabolic byproducts also play a role in this process.</p><p>Our results reveal that several metabolic processes may be affiliated with a given subpopulation. For instance, it is not clear at this point how <italic>sucC</italic> is related to acetate metabolism. One possible connection between <italic>sucC</italic> expression and acetate production might be that during co-consumption of glucose and malate, the TCA cycle may be overloaded with incoming material, causing accumulation of intermediates that can impact the glycolytic pathway, including acetate secretion. Another possibility is that <italic>sucC</italic> is used to regulate coenzyme-A levels at a time when a large amount of coenzyme-A is used and freed when pyruvate is converted to acetyl-coA and then acetate. Additionally, alongside the roles of the <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>pta</italic> metabolic genes, arginine metabolism genes are also differentially regulated by competence, as seen in our results and in prior microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berka et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ogura et al., 2002</xref>), further complicating our understanding of the full physiological role of this subpopulation. Tools to systematically study metabolites in single cells would help to map the actual metabolic states of each subpopulation in a given condition and will allow us to address these questions.</p><p>Going beyond microbial systems, cell-cell heterogeneity can be advantageous as a ‘bet-hedging’ strategy both for microbial and cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Veening et al., 2008</xref>). In such cases, cell-cell heterogeneity enables the population as a whole to withstand unforeseen challenges, such as antibiotic or chemotherapeutic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sharma et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rotem et al., 2010</xref>), or metabolic shifts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Solopova et al., 2014</xref>). By contrast to simple bet-hedging, the emergence of <italic>alsS+</italic> acetoin producing populations described here arises as a response to an anticipated challenge that is part of the growth progression in conditions favoring weak organic acid production. Thus, unlike in bet-hedging, metabolic state switching could provide a predictable benefit in a more deterministic dynamic environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid design</title><p>Plasmids for the integration of fluorescent reporters were made as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eldar et al., 2009</xref>).

SU80 wafers were made based on masks provided by the Losick lab. PDMS devices were prepared by pouring degassed Sylgard 184 PDMS silicone (corning corporation, Corning NY) onto wafers and curing the molds for a minimum of 8 hr at 65°C. Cured PDMS devices were bonded onto microscopy coverslips (60 × 22 mm, Gold Seal coverslips Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham MA) by plasma cleaning. Plasma bonding was done in a PDC32G plasma cleaner (Harrick Plasma Ithaca, NY) set to chamber pressure between 600–700 microns. Coverslips were cleaned separately for 1 min, and then the devices and coverslips were cleaned jointly for 20 s. Device bonding was immediately done by inverting the plasma treated device onto the treated coverslips. After bonding the devices were cured for an additional 4 hr at 65°C. Devices were kept for up to 2 weeks in the dark at room temperature.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Metabolic Interactions Between Dynamic Bacterial Subpopulations&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Martin Ackerman (Reviewer #1), served as a guest Reviewing Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael G Surette (Reviewer #2). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript addresses a fundamental question about microbial metabolism: do individual cells in clonal populations differentiate into different phenotypes that specialize on different metabolic processes, and that complement each other in their metabolic activities? Such metabolic differentiation could have important consequences: Metabolic differences between cells in clonal populations could potentially reduce metabolic incompatibilities between different pathways, and increase the rate at which different reactions can be performed at the level of clonal populations. Such metabolic specialization has been suggested in a few earlier studies, but the evidence has often remained inconclusive. This manuscript here provides substantial evidence for metabolic differentiation in acetate metabolism in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>, and suggests that this specialization has the consequence of detoxifying the local environment and allowing sustained growth. It can make a substantial contribution to our understanding of how cellular individuality can lead to emergent properties at the level of clonal groups.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A first question pertains to the connection between <italic>sucC</italic>, acetate and competence. More specifically, two steps are currently quite weak: the first is whether <italic>sucC</italic> activity is really associated with acetate secretion. The metabolic connection between the two is not straightforward, and may be correlative rather than causal. The authors may be able to provide better evidence from revisiting their existing data (e.g. looking at other genes, and pathway activity). One possible connection between <italic>sucC</italic> increase and acetate production might be the fact that (especially with the malate coming directly into the TCA cycle), the TCA cycle is jammed with incoming material, causing accumulation of intermediates that would then slow down the whole glycolytic pathway, including acetate secretion. The reviewers suggest that the authors consider this scenario, or other possible metabolic explanations of the observations (with the caveat of the delay, discussed below). Alternatively, if the authors see <italic>sucC</italic> primarily as a proxy for a gene expression phenotype that is putatively producing acetate, without assuming that <italic>sucC</italic> plays a direct role in this, then they should state this explicitly. Some of the current phrasing seems to imply a direct role of <italic>sucC</italic> in acetate production (for example the beginning of the third paragraph in the Results section).

It would seem useful to see, in addition to this revised Figure 1—figure supplement 1, another version in which all graphs have the same x and y axes scales.

We have made several major improvements: First, to address reviewer concerns, we added an RNAseq experiment comparing global gene expression profiles of cells in a constitutive competent state to cells in which the master regulator of competence (<italic>comK</italic>) has been deleted (Figure 2—figure supplement 4). Results of this experiment are fully consistent with our other findings. Second, we added an experiment demonstrating that the presence of <italic>alsS</italic> expressing cells is able to enhance the growth of non-expressing cells by altering the extracellular environment (Figure 4—figure supplement 3). Third, we addressed concerns about the display of data and experimental setup (Figure 2—figure supplement 1, and various improvements throughout the main text and Materials and methods). Fourth, we improved clarity by incorporating items according to the specific suggestions of the reviewers. Finally, we also made a comprehensive effort to add details that provide environmental and physiological context, as well as historical references (including a detailed discussion of physiological relevance of growth on multiple co-utilized carbons). Together, we believe that these changes have produced a greatly improved manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A first question pertains to the connection between sucC, acetate and competence. More specifically, two steps are currently quite weak: the first is whether sucC activity is really associated with acetate secretion. The metabolic connection between the two is not straightforward, and may be correlative rather than causal. The authors may be able to provide better evidence from revisiting their existing data (e.g. looking at other genes, and pathway activity). One possible connection between sucC increase and acetate production might be the fact that (especially with the malate coming directly into the TCA cycle), the TCA cycle is jammed with incoming material, causing accumulation of intermediates that would then slow down the whole glycolytic pathway, including acetate secretion. The reviewers suggest that the authors consider this scenario, or other possible metabolic explanations of the observations (with the caveat of the delay, discussed below). Alternatively, if the authors see sucC primarily as a proxy for a gene expression phenotype that is putatively producing acetate, without assuming that sucC plays a direct role in this, then they should state this explicitly. Some of the current phrasing seems to imply a direct role of sucC in acetate production (for example the beginning of the third paragraph in the Results section).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers correctly point out that the connection between <italic>sucC</italic> expression and acetate secretion is correlative rather than causal, with <italic>sucC</italic> indeed representing a proxy or marker for the competent state. We show that competent cells, which also express <italic>sucC</italic>, secrete more acetate (Figure 2D), but we have not shown that <italic>sucC</italic> is necessary or sufficient for acetate secretion. The key point is that cells in the competent state secrete more acetate. These issues were confusing as originally presented, and we have therefore clarified the presentation in the revised version, and also added a discussion of the alternative scenarios and caveats suggested by the reviewers and additional scenario, in the second to last paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The other weak link is the one between sucC and competence. It is not obvious, for example, whether the competence system master transcription factor (comK) controls specifically acetate secretion, as opposed to affecting metabolism globally. Again, this may be at least partially alleviated by revisiting the data, and making sure that statements in the text do not claim more than what the data actually show.</p></disp-quote><p>There are two issues here: First, to what extent does <italic>sucC</italic> expression depend on competence? Second, could the metabolic differences between competent and non-competent cells extend beyond <italic>sucC</italic> and acetate secretion? To address the first issue, we now better highlight Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and also add a new experiment. The original version of Figure 2—figure supplement 4 showed that deletion of the competence master regulator <italic>comK</italic> eliminates elevated <italic>sucC</italic> expression. In addition, we now also compare global gene expression between a ∆<italic>comK</italic> strain and a strain in which we have induced ectopic <italic>comK</italic> expression. This experiment (now Figure 2—figure supplement 4) shows that competence-associated genes, including <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>pta</italic> are elevated in induced competent cells compared to ∆<italic>comK</italic> cells, showing that <italic>comK</italic> is sufficient for elevated expression of <italic>sucC</italic> and <italic>pta</italic>. We also note that these results are consistent with previous microarray analyses of competence (Berka et al., 2002 and Ogura et al., 2002), which are now discussed and cited in the text (Results).</p><p>Regarding the second issue, we agree that our results do not rule out the possibility of additional metabolic differences between competent and non-competent cells. Indeed, in our data and previous work, expression of Arginine-metabolism genes is up-regulated in competent cells. We now mention and discuss this issue in the Discussion (second to last paragraph of Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second question is whether alsS+ cells indeed detoxify the environment, a statement that is central to the idea that metabolic specialization controls the microenvironment, as stated in the Abstract. At the moment, the detoxifying activity is inferred from the analysis of gene expression reporters alone. To test whether alsS+ cells detoxify the environment, the authors could either construct an alsS knock-out strain, or (probably simpler) analyze existing microcolonies, and ask whether alsS- cells that are in a colony with many alsS+ cells grow faster than alsS- cells that are in a colony with few alsS+ cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is an important point. To address it, we performed a new experiment in which we analyze the ability of WT colonies to rescue growth defects in adjacent ∆<italic>alsS</italic> colonies. This result (now added as Figure 4—figure supplement 3) is discussed in the last paragraph of the Results section. When grown on agarose plates, colonies lacking <italic>alsS</italic> form smaller colonies compared to wildtype colonies that include the <italic>alsS</italic> expressing cell population. This defect can be partially rescued when the <italic>alsS</italic> deletion colony is grown close to a colony that contains <italic>alsS</italic> positive cells (a wildtype colony). Thus, we now demonstrate that <italic>alsS+</italic> cells can enhance the growth environment for non <italic>alsS</italic> expressing cells. Finally, we note in the text that while the detoxification explanation is the most plausible, we cannot rule out the possibility that <italic>alsS+</italic> cells provide benefits in other ways, e.g. by producing growth-promoting substances rather than removing growth-inhibitory toxins. We also further emphasize this limitation in our discussion of this data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviewers feel that these two first points will require either new experiments or new analysis of existing data, in addition to revising the text.
