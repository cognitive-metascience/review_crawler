Emerging research establishes a role for specialized signalling filopodia, or cytonemes, in morphogen dispersion and signalling. Previously we demonstrated that Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen is transported via vesicles along cytonemes emanating from signal-producing cells to form a gradient in <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelia. However, the mechanisms for signal reception and transfer are still undefined. Here, we demonstrate that cytonemes protruding from Hh-receiving cells contribute to Hh gradient formation. The canonical Hh receptor Patched is localized in these cellular protrusions and Hh reception takes place in membrane contact sites between Hh-sending and Hh-receiving cytonemes. These two sets of cytonemes have similar dynamics and both fall in two different dynamic behaviours. Furthermore, both the Hh co-receptor Interference hedgehog (Ihog) and the glypicans are critical for this cell-cell cytoneme mediated interaction. These findings suggest that the described contact sites might facilitate morphogen presentation and reception.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24045.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24045.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24045.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When an embryo develops, it is critical that tissues and organs form properly and at the right time. For this, cells need to be able to communicate over long distances by using signalling molecules called morphogens. Morphogens disperse via extensions that protrude from the surface of a ‘source’ cell. Previous research has shown that these extensions called cytonemes can transport the morphogens to ‘receiver’ cells, and depending on the distance from the source, build a concentration gradient that will either be higher or lower. These gradients then help unspecialized cells to develop into different specialized ones.</p><p>One of the key morphogens during the development is the Hedgehog protein. Researchers have previously shown that vesicles along cytonemes of cells that produce Hedgehog transport the morphogen to the receiver cells. However, until now it was unclear how the Hedgehog signals are transferred and received.</p><p>Here, González-Méndez et al. – including researchers involved in the previous studies – investigated the cytonemes located on Hedgehog-receiving cells in the fruit fly. The results showed that these cytonemes are oriented towards the Hedgehog-producing cells and help to create a concentration gradient by varying their length. Moreover, the cytonemes from signal-producing and signal-receiving cells connect at specific sites that are distributed along their lengths. This suggests that the contact sites might help to transfer and receive the morphogens.</p><p>Thus, the way cells communicate in other tissues of the body could be similar to how nerve cells communicate with each other in the brain. Our next challenges will be to fully understand how cytonemes transfer the Hedgehog signal. This could shed more light on how Hedgehog signaling can be controlled and modulated.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.24045.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.24045.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>Hedgehog signaling</kwd><kwd>morphogen gradient</kwd><kwd>cytonemes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2014-59438-P and BFU2015-72831-EXP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008054</institution-id><institution>Fundación Ramón Areces</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRA14</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003329</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Student Fellowship (BFU2011-25987)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Guerrero</surname><given-names>Isabel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Direct interaction between Hedgehog-sending and Hedgehog-receiving cytonemes is a fundamental mechanism for morphogen transfer and gradient establishment.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Long-distance cell-cell communication is essential for development and function of multicellular systems. During embryogenesis morphogens are produced at a localized source and act at a distance, controlling the differential activation of target genes in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Crick, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Morgan, 1901</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rogers and Schier, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stumpf, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Turing, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wolpert, 1969</xref>). Thus, the graded distribution of morphogens, together with the ability of the receptor cells to respond specifically to different ligand concentrations, need to be tightly regulated. Increasing evidence supports active signal transport along specialized filopodia (also called cytonemes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ramírez-Weber and Kornberg, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradilla and Guerrero, 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kornberg, 2014</xref>), challenging models based on the free diffusion of morphogens. Here we keep investigating the mechanisms of gradient formation by active transport of morphogens across the epithelial surfaces.</p><p>The Hedgehog (Hh) morphogen has a central role in many metazoan developmental processes. Hh is implicated in stem cell maintenance, axon guidance, cell migration and oncogenesis in a wide range of organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>). Hh production, transport, release and reception must be kept under strict spatial and temporal control to fulfil its signalling function. Hh is also post-translationally modified by the addition of cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Porter et al., 1996</xref>) and palmitic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pepinsky et al., 1998</xref>), which promote its association with cell membranes making Hh transport potentially inconsistent with free morphogen diffusion. Hh gradient establishment has been extensively studied in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal disc epithelium, which is formed by anterior (A) and posterior (P) cell populations with different adhesion affinities. The P compartment cells produce Hh, which moves across the A/P compartment border to reach the Hh-responding cells in the A compartment. As Hh spreads away from the border, its concentration decreases, providing a graded signal that activates the different target genes that regulate imaginal disc development (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Briscoe and Thérond, 2013</xref>).</p><p>In both wing disc and abdominal histoblasts, cytonemes from Hh-producing cells extend across its morphogenetic gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>). Critically, there is a strong correlation between the extent of cytonemes from the P compartment and the graded response to Hh signalling in the A compartment. In vivo imaging of abdominal histoblasts showed that cytonemes extend and retract dynamically, and that Hh gradient establishment correlates with cytoneme formation in both space and time. These data support a model for Hh transport in which cytonemes act as conduits for morphogen movement mainly at the basal plane of the epithelium. Furthermore, we have shown that Hh is associated with vesicles transported along cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanisms for Hh signal transfer and reception, however, remain open questions.</p><p>Here we show that cytonemes emanating from the Hh-receiving cells in the A compartment contribute to Hh reception and gradient formation. These cytonemes have similar dynamics than those emanating from the Hh-producing cells, falling between two different dynamic behaviours. We show that reception Hh signalling components localize to the signal-receiving cytonemes, including the glypicans Division abnormally delayed (Dally) and Dally-like (Dlp), the adhesion molecule Interference hedgehog (Ihog) and the canonical Hh receptor Patched (Ptc). Significantly, the spreading capacity of cytonemes is dependent on the glypicans present in the membranes of neighbouring cells. Thus, cytonemes cannot properly extend across Dally or Dlp mutant cells. In addition, cytonemes can cross <italic>smo</italic> (<italic>smoothened</italic>) and <italic>ptc</italic> mutant clones, which cannot internalize Hh, providing a bridging mechanism and allowing Hh delivery to adjacent wild type cells. Finally, we describe discrete cell-cell contact structures between Hh-sending and Hh-receiving cytonemes, where the morphogen may be transferred from one cytoneme to the other for its reception.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Hh-responding cells extend dynamic cytonemes to receive Hh</title><p>Hh-producing cells in the P compartment of the wing imaginal disc extend cytonemes that transport Hh to the A compartment cells and that are essential for the restricted distribution of Hh during <italic>Drosophila</italic> epithelial development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Callejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, the Hh-receiving cells of the anterior compartment also extend cytonemes towards the Hh-secreting cells of the P compartment. Here we have characterized the cytonemes from the signal-receiving cells and investigated their role in Hh morphogen reception.</p><p>In previous studies on Hh signalling filopodia in the abdominal histoblasts we showed that the P compartment generated highly dynamic protrusions that reached anteriorly the Hh-receiving cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>). The Hh-receiving cells also produce highly dynamic protrusions oriented towards the Hh-producing cells, easily visualized when expressing the actin-binding domain of moesin (GMA) fused to GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1A</xref>). These GMA-labelled filopodia are less dynamic when they co-express Ihog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1B</xref>), as was previously described for the Hh-producing histoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>).

In a more detailed analysis of filopodia dynamics, we have been able to distinguish two different dynamic behaviours: one of filopodia that elongate and immediately retract, which we have classified as ‘triangle dynamics’ and another one with a ‘stationary’ interphase between the elongation and retraction phases, which we have classified as ‘trapezoid dynamics’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; see Materials and methods).

In summary, Ihog overexpression leads to more stable cytonemes also in the A compartment cells.</p><p>To further analyse the role of A compartment cytonemes, we manipulated actin cytoskeletal components implicated in filopodia formation within the wing imaginal disc, monitoring the expression of Ptc and Cubitus interruptus (Ci) as a read-out of Hh signalling. We knocked down SCAR, Diaphanous (Dia), Filamin (Cheerio, Cher) or actin Capping protein alpha (Cpa) function in the A compartment using specific <italic>RNAi</italic> lines. In addition, we expressed these RNAis together with <italic>ihog-RFP</italic> to visualize cytonemes. The aberrant extension of cytonemes observed by knocking down these proteins in the Hh-receiving cells resulted in reduced Ptc and Ci expression domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), revealing a role of the A compartment cytonemes in regulating the Hh gradient. Thus, cytonemes control both Hh export from P compartment and Hh distribution and reception in the A compartment.</p><p>Cytoneme-mediated long distant communication between Hh-producing and Hh-responding cells is visualized when Ihog-RFP marked cytonemes from the A and P compartments meet at the A/P boundary in the basal part of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, arrow; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media3">Video 3</xref>).

As expected, GFP fluorescence was localized to the A/P border when complementary fragments were expressed at the same time in each compartment. The pattern of GFP fluorescence varies along the apico-basal axis, as both A and P cells extend cytonemes along the basal surface of the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B,B’</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>). Cytoneme membrane contacts occur on both sides of the A/P compartment border, although predominantly on the A side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Furthermore, periodic annular structures are present along the length of overlapping cytoneme (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>), while the GRASP signal also indicates that cytonemes overexpressing Ihog-RFP are indeed in contact with neighbouring cell membranes, presumably receiving cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, arrows).

Here we analyse the potential role of HSPG glypicans, in cytoneme function. The <italic>Drosophila</italic> glypicans Dally and Dlp are required for both Hh presentation and reception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ayers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yan et al., 2010</xref>). We observe that extension of Ihog-RFP expressing cytonemes is significantly reduced when glypicans levels are lowered by knocking down Dally or Dlp, in the opposite compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–C</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>, arrows).

In addition, cytonemes emanating from the A compartment cells accumulate Dally and Dlp present in the neighbouring P compartment cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, arrow; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bilioni et al., 2013</xref>). This effect is observed by expressing Ihog-RFP and eliminating Dlp in the same compartment; Dlp of one compartment accumulate in labelled cytonemes emanating from other one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>, arrow). This dependence on the glypicans present in the neighbouring cells is also observed for the P compartment cytonemes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E and F</xref>, arrows).

Here we have extended this work and showed that the cytonemes emanating from signal-receiving cells in the A compartment also have a critical role in Hh gradient formation. Therefore, both A and P compartment cytonemes weigh in the formation of the Hh gradient. The two sets of cytonemes make contact through the basal side of the epithelium and show similar values of average maximum extent, lifetime, and elongation and retraction velocities. A and P cytonemes contact predominantly on the anterior side of the compartment boundary. Furthermore, receiving cytonemes include components of the Hh reception complex (Ptc, Ihog, Dlp and Dally), supporting their signalling role; consistently, we find that manipulating their actin dynamics modifies Hh graded signalling.</p><p>As implied in our earlier study, signal transmission might be dependent on cytoneme stability and the frequency with which A and P cytonemes make contact.

In agreement with this hypothesis, GRASP fluorescence analysis suggests that A cytonemes from cells close to the A/P boundary establish contact primarily with the cytonemes from adjacent P compartment cells, where Hh would also be delivered by further P cells cytonemes. The sum of these spatial interactions would then result in high levels of Hh signalling close to the A/P border. The longest cytonemes from cells further from the A/P compartment border would interconnect to deliver the reduced levels of Hh signalling in more distant A cells.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hh pathway components are crucial for A and P compartment cytoneme interaction</title><p>We analysed the behaviour of confronting A and P cytonemes with mutated or overexpressed Hh signalling components. Interestingly, the expression in the P compartment of membrane-tethered Hh (Hh-CD2), which results in a non graded signalling response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Strigini and Cohen, 1997</xref>), alters the receiving cytonemes cargo by hindering Ptc internalization. Despite that Hh receptor Ptc is usually rapidly internalized and not visualized at the plasma membrane, both Ptc and Ihog accumulate in A compartment cytonemes at contact sites with Hh-CD2 expressing P compartment cytonemes. Thus, this form of Hh attached to membranes plausibly affects the reception process, potentially explaining the absence of a signalling gradient and further confirming that Hh release from the presenting membranes is necessary. The mechanism by which Hh is liberated from plasma membrane anchoring lipids in <italic>Drosophila</italic> remains unknown. However, in strong support of a Hh shedding process, proteolytic removal of both lipidated peptides releases active Sonic hedgehog (Shh) from the surface of cultured cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ohlig et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, Ihog trans interaction with glypicans in cytoneme-mediated cell-cell contacts has a critical role for cytoneme dynamics. The spreading capacity of Ihog overexpressing cytonemes is dependent on the glypicans presence in the membranes of neighbouring cells. Cytonemes protruding from one compartment aberrantly extend over the other compartment when is mutant for <italic>dally</italic> and <italic>dlp</italic>. This is in agreement with our previous results showing that the Tout-velu (Ttv) and Brother of Ttv (Btv) proteins (needed for the HSPGs synthesis) are required to stabilize Ihog cytonemes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bischoff et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, Dally or Dlp overexpressing cytonemes from one compartment seem to be stabilized by Ihog overexpressing cytonemes from the other one, with which they associate along their length by trans interaction between Ihog and glypicans. Thus, cytonemes from one compartment can contribute to the stability of the cytonemes from the other one with which they contact.</p><p>However, to elucidate the specific mechanism of this altered cytoneme behaviour (impairment in elongation, stability or retraction processes) further in vivo analysis is required.</p><p>Taken together, these results establish that dynamic interactions between A and P compartment cytonemes play an important role in the formation of the Hh gradient. In conjunction components for both reception and presentation of Hh critically influence the performance of this cytoneme interaction.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Hh-reception takes place at sites of direct contact between opposing A and P cytonemes</title><p>The membrane-bound GRASP fluorescence shows that A and P compartment cytonemes overlap in a region spanning the A/P compartment boundary. Within this region, direct ‘kissing’ contacts appear along the membranes of interacting A and P cytonemes to connect the two sets of cytonemes. These contact points are associated with annular structures, which may represent more stable links and are reminiscent of synaptic buttons. Similar ‘synaptic contacts’ have been previously described between air sac primordium (ASP) and wing disc cells for Dpp morphogen transference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Roy et al., 2014</xref>). ASP cells receive Dpp by emitting long cytonemes that contact with the target cell of the wing disc by their tips. This process was visualized by the same membrane-bound GRASP. Although Dpp uses a cytoneme-mediated contact-dependent mechanism for signalling at distance, the reception takes place where Dpp-receiving cytoneme tip contacts with the Dpp source cell body, in contrast with the cytoneme-cytoneme contacts here described for Hh. Nevertheless, the ‘synaptic contacts’ described for Dpp reception in ASP might be conceptually comparable with the ‘kissing rings’ distributed along the length of overlapping Hh-sending and Hh-receiving cytonemes.</p><p>We have previously demonstrated that Hh moves along cytonemes in multivesicular bodies (MVB) to be secreted as extracellular vesicles known as exosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gradilla et al., 2014</xref>), which raises intriguing questions about the mechanism of interaction between exosomal Hh and its receptor Ptc in the A cytonemes. Interestingly, Ptc and Hh can be detected co-localizing with cytoneme contact sites, suggesting that they could represent specific sites for Hh reception and internalization. These data strengthen our proposal of cytoneme-mediated Hh morphogen distribution and suggest that Hh containing exosomes could be received at intimate contacts between P and A cytonemes.</p><p>Finally, we have shown that cytonemes are able to cross <italic>ptc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>smo<sup>−/−</sup></italic> clones, enabling the Hh transport from P to A cells for Hh signalling reestablishment in wild type cells located anterior to the clones. In agreement, it is known that the Hh signal can cross small mutant clones of <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>smo</italic> to reach the adjacent wild type territory. Similar behaviour, has been described for <italic>ptc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>smo<sup>−/−</sup></italic> clones induced in the A abdominal histoblast nests and attributed to different cell polarity and cell affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Struhl et al., 1997</xref>). Therefore, Hh transport and reception by cytoneme-mediated cell-cell contacts can explain the Hh signalling in wild type cells located anterior to <italic>ptc<sup>−/−</sup></italic> and <italic>smo<sup>−/−</sup></italic> clones.</p><p>In summary, the data strengthen our proposal of cytoneme-mediated Hh morphogen distribution and suggest that Hh containing exosomes could be received at intimate contacts between P and A cytonemes. The described intimate interaction between these two sets of cytonemes at membrane contact sites, where ligand and receptor complex colocalize, may facilitate morphogen reception.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly mutants</title><p>A description of mutations, insertions and transgenes is available at Fly Base (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://flybase.org">http://flybase.org</ext-link>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Diethard Tautz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Steffen Schlopp (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This interesting work extends the study of filopodia/cytoneme-mediated signaling in a powerful invertebrate system. González-Méndez et al., take advantage of high-resolution imaging and genetics to elucidate the function of cytonemes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Here intercellular Hh trafficking is investigated with a particular focus on the receiving cells. The authors demonstrate that the receiving cells project signalling filopodia decorated with iHog, Ptc and Smo towards the Hh expressing compartment. Using GFP reconstitution experiments, they demonstrate that sending and receiving cytonemes come in close contact. Hh is delivered via cytonemes from the signalling cells to cytonemes of the receiving cell to induce signalling. Furthermore, the authors focus on gradient formation and show that, as previously reported for sending cells, cytonemes in receiving cells also play an important part in gradient formation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Both reviewer #2 and #3 were not entirely convinced about the effects of the receiving cell cytonemes on Hh gradient formation and signaling output, and reviewer #1 also agreed that more data could be delivered to address this issue. However the reviewers didn't all concur that looking at Wg or Dpp signaling would be helpful. Considering this, we request that you provide additional data supporting your contention that receiving cell cytonemes affect gradient formation and Hh signaling output.</p><p>2) Most of data showing cytonemes were generated under conditions of Ihog overexpression. If such extensions indeed play important roles in transporting Hh, we would expect to see higher levels of Hh protein when Ihog is overexpressed in A or P, or both compartments. Such data is important to logically correlate cytoneme extensions with their roles in Hh transport and dispersion. Can you please provide data addressing this issue?</p><p>3) As a corollary to point 2 above, reviewers #1 and #2 would like to see additional data supporting a few key results in the absence of Ihog overexpression.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Cytoneme-mediated cell-cell contacts for Hedgehog reception&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor and two reviewers.</p><p>Both reviewers are quite enthusiastic about the manuscript, but one reviewer raised some questions that should ideally be addressed by further revisions. Please see the comments below:</p><p>1) The authors show that Ihog overexpression increases the lifetime of cytonemes and in previous work showed that the spread of Hh and Hh signaling correlate with cytoneme presence and length. Don't we expect that ptc.Gal4&gt;ihog might increase Hh spread, Hh signaling and ptc expression? I may have missed it, but did the authors look at Ptc expression +/- ptc.Gal4&gt;ihog?</p><p>2) Although it is highly unlikely that Ihog overexpression creates a new mechanism of signaling, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> panels show Hh accumulation at both apical and basal surfaces of the P compartment cells. Is the accumulation at the basal surface a consequence of Ihog overexpression? If it is, it might relevant to the interpretations of the findings reported in the paper and to the relative importance of sending and receiving cytonemes. It would be helpful to show Hh in a disc that does not overexpress Ihog.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>' shows that the red and green fluorescence do not precisely coincide and the authors conclude that the red fluorescent Ihog and green fluorescent Hh are in distinct spaces and separate structures. It is my understanding that the resolution limit for confocal z sections is approximately 0.4–0.5microns, yet the diameter of a cytoneme is around 200nm and a synaptic gap is around 20–50nm. The authors do not indicate what objective was used or whether the images were processed with a deconvolution routine, so it is not obvious what the color separation in the confocal images might mean. The offset of red and green channels may be a technical artifact, namely chromatic aberration. Is there an independent way to define the spatial resolution in z with their microscope? It seems that the authors propose a model with three layers arranged in apical to basal order – the plasma membrane, receiving cytonemes, and sending cytonemes. If the plasma membrane of the P compartment cells is marked, does the same confocal imaging resolve Ihog-RFP basal to the cell membrane? Is there a way to show all three layers? In the proposed model, what are the minimum dimensions of the structures and what must their spatial separation be to be consistent with the images?</p><p>4) Subsection “Cytonemes from producing and receiving cells interact for Hh reception” &quot;…these results clearly indicate that Hh reception is mediated by contacts between Hh-sending and Hh-receiving cytonemes.&quot; I would urge the authors to temper this statement to acknowledge that it is based on observations with Ihog over-expression and that Ihog overexpression may change the relative probabilities of the alternative modes of transfer by sending and receiving cytonemes.</p><p>5) Subsection “Descrete sites for cytoneme-mediated Hh reception” It would be appropriate to cite previous uses of GRASP to image long distant contacts and to contrast the results obtained here with previously published results.</p><p>6) Subsection” Cytonemes bridge <italic>ptc-/-</italic> and <italic>smo-/-</italic> mutant clones to re-establish Hh reception in adjacent territories” &quot;Therefore, the presence of the network of cytonemes is independent of Hh signaling.&quot; The authors might consider being more cautious and to qualify this statement, as their conclusion is based on the effects they observed under conditions of partial Hh inactivation and Ihog over-expression.&quot;</p><p>We encourage you to address these points in a revision. It should be satisfactory to do this without adding new data. Point #4 is especially important to address, since if the color offset seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, H</xref>', and H&quot; is actually a technical imaging artifact, then it is not biologically relevant and the interpretation of this figure must be changed. In your response to the reviews, and the revision, please note the resolution of your imaging system in Z and XY dimensions, please add scale bars where they are missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>', H&quot;), and please provide some evidence that chromatic aberrations have not confounded the interpretation of the results. This seems most likely to be an issue in the Z-axis imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24045.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) Both reviewer #2 and #3 were not entirely convinced about the effects of the receiving cell cytonemes on Hh gradient formation and signaling output, and reviewer #1 also agreed that more data could be delivered to address this issue.

We have observed that the knocking down of these proteins affects the cytoneme extension and leads to shorter extension of the <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>ci</italic> gene expression domains.</p><p> <italic>2) Most of data showing cytonemes were generated under conditions of Ihog overexpression. If such extensions indeed play important roles in transporting Hh, we would expect to see higher levels of Hh protein when Ihog is overexpressed in A or P, or both compartments. Such data is important to logically correlate cytoneme extensions with their roles in Hh transport and dispersion. Can you please provide data addressing this issue?</italic> </p><p>We have previously demonstrated that Ihog overexpression in the P compartment cells increases Hh retention (Bilioni et al., 2013). This Hh retention in the P compartment cells decreases the extension of the Hh gradient (Bilioni et al., 2013). Here we show that Ihog overexpression in the A compartment cells also increases Hh sequestration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, G</xref>’, G”) and changes the shape of the Hh gradient (causing an extended gradient, data not shown).</p><p>In this manuscript we have not shown the Hh gradient in conditions of Ihog overexpression in the A compartment. Data showing how the manipulation of actin dynamics affects Hh gradient was done without the overexpression of Ihog. The co-expression of Ihog was performed only to better visualize the effect on cytonemes of the expression of RNAis that knock down actin dynamics.</p><p> <italic>3) As a corollary to point 2 above, reviewers 1 and 2 would like to see additional data supporting a few key results in the absence of Ihog overexpression.</italic> </p><p>Although the best cytoneme marker is Ihog because of its effect on the stabilization of cytonemes, in the revised version we have included data using the expression of the actin-binding domain of moesin fused to GFP (GMA-GFP). Importantly, we demonstrate that the maximum extension of filopodia is similar with or without overexpression of Ihog (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This overexpression, however, changes cytoneme dynamics as we previously showed in Bischoff et al., 2013. Moreover, the membrane-bound GRASP fluorescence (CD4-GFP) also shows the contacts along the membranes of interacting A and P cytonemes. And these experiments were done without Ihog overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="other" rid="media5">Video 5</xref>).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p><italic>Both reviewers are quite enthusiastic about the manuscript, but one reviewer raised some questions that should ideally be addressed by further revisions. Please see the comments below:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) The authors show that Ihog overexpression increases the lifetime of cytonemes and in previous work showed that the spread of Hh and Hh signaling correlate with cytoneme presence and length. Don't we expect that ptc.Gal4&gt;ihog might increase Hh spread, Hh signaling and ptc expression? I may have missed it, but did the authors look at Ptc expression +/- ptc.Gal4&gt;ihog?</italic> </p><p>Indeed ptc.Gal4&gt;ihog increases Hh gradient extension, as shown by the expression of Ptc and Ci in the wing imaginal disc. To show these data we have included a new supplementary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p> <italic>2) Although it is highly unlikely that Ihog overexpression creates a new mechanism of signaling, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> panels show Hh accumulation at both apical and basal surfaces of the P compartment cells. Is the accumulation at the basal surface a consequence of Ihog overexpression? If it is, it might relevant to the interpretations of the findings reported in the paper and to the relative importance of sending and receiving cytonemes. It would be helpful to show Hh in a disc that does not overexpress Ihog.</italic> </p><p>Certainly, Ihog overexpression recruits Hh to cytonemes. However, there are other results described in the manuscript that support a cytoneme-mediated Hh reception in the A compartment cells that were obtained without Hh overexpression:</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref> shows Hh accumulated in basal conduits resembling filopodia oriented to the A-P axis when Hh internalization is blocked (shi<sup>DN</sup>).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> shows Hh accumulation in shi<sup>DN</sup> cells that colocalizes at contact sites between A and P compartment cytonemes.</p><p> <italic>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>' shows that the red and green fluorescence do not precisely coincide and the authors conclude that the red fluorescent Ihog and green fluorescent Hh are in distinct spaces and separate structures. It is my understanding that the resolution limit for confocal z sections is approximately 0.4–0.5microns, yet the diameter of a cytoneme is around 200nm and a synaptic gap is around 20–50nm. The authors do not indicate what objective was used or whether the images were processed with a deconvolution routine, so it is not obvious what the color separation in the confocal images might mean. The offset of red and green channels may be a technical artifact, namely chromatic aberration. Is there an independent way to define the spatial resolution in z with their microscope? It seems that the authors propose a model with three layers arranged in apical to basal order – the plasma membrane, receiving cytonemes, and sending cytonemes. If the plasma membrane of the P compartment cells is marked, does the same confocal imaging resolve Ihog-RFP basal to the cell membrane? Is there a way to show all three layers? In the proposed model, what are the minimum dimensions of the structures and what must their spatial separation be to be consistent with the images?</italic> </p><p>We do not fully understand the problem that the referee has with the images shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, since we do not describe signal colocalization in them. Due to the high resolution of the images, deconvolution was not needed for clearly distinguish the colour separation in confocal images, which means that these signals are in distinct slices of the Z-stacks. Regarding the chromatic aberrations, we did &quot;dye-swap&quot; and the result of the relative position of A and P compartment cytonemes was the same independently of colours of labelled cytonemes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>’) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, H</xref>’’). There is not an independent way to define the spatial resolution in z with our microscope. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref> shows the plasma membrane of A compartment cells, and the A and P cytonemes. These cytonemes extend along the basal membranes, forming an intricate network. Due to the impossibility to specifically label cytonemes (we label the whole plasma membranes), we can only visualize individual cytonemes when they cross from one compartment to the other (not labelled). To determine the minimum dimensions of these GRASP labelled structures we need to do Electron Microscopy. The main message in this manuscript is to describe that interaction between P and A cytonemes mediates Hh reception in the A compartment cells. Additional work is needed to characterize the structures that mediate the Hh release and internalization.</p><p>Details of the images are the following:</p><p><underline><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H and H</xref>’</underline></p><p>XY resolution = 14,45 pixel/mm</p><p>Z resolution = 16,38 pixel/mm</p><p>Number and dimension of slices = 9 slices of 0,253mm</p><p>Total Z-stack dimension = 2,28mm</p><p>Objective used: 100x</p><p><underline><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref></underline></p><p>XY resolution = 9,11 pixel/mm</p><p>Z resolution = 9,09 pixel/mm</p><p>Number and dimension of slices = 8 slices of 0,303mm</p><p>Total Z-stack dimension = 2,42mm</p><p>Objective used: 100x</p><p> <italic>4) Subsection “Cytonemes from producing and receiving cells interact for Hh reception” &quot;these results clearly indicate that Hh reception is mediated by contacts between Hh-sending and Hh-receiving cytonemes.&quot; I would urge the authors to temper this statement to acknowledge that it is based on observations with Ihog over-expression and that Ihog overexpression may change the relative probabilities of the alternative modes of transfer by sending and receiving cytonemes.</italic> </p><p>This statement is also based on observation in the absence of Ihog overexpression, as it is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref> and 3.

Point #4 is especially important to address, since if the color offset seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, H</xref>', and H&quot; is actually a technical imaging artifact, then it is not biologically relevant and the interpretation of this figure must be changed.
