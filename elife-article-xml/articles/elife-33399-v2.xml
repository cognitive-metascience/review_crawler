Auxin response proteins are represented by large families of diverse functions, but neither their origin nor their evolution is understood. Here, we use a deep phylogenomics approach to reconstruct both the origin and the evolutionary trajectory of all nuclear auxin response protein families. We found that, while all subdomains are ancient, a complete auxin response mechanism is limited to land plants. Functional phylogenomics predicts defined steps in the evolution of response system properties, and comparative transcriptomics across six ancient lineages revealed how these innovations shaped a sophisticated response mechanism. Genetic analysis in a basal land plant revealed unexpected contributions of ancient non-canonical proteins in auxin response as well as auxin-unrelated function of core transcription factors. Our study provides a functional evolutionary framework for understanding diverse functions of the auxin signal.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33399.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Across all kingdoms of life, signaling molecules like hormones, for example, control many aspects of the lives of organisms, including how they grow and develop. Cells have dedicated proteins that can recognize the signaling molecules, relay the information, and respond to the signal, for example by switching genes on or off. Such response systems usually consist of multiple components, and, throughout evolution, these response components have regularly been copied such that many species have multiple different versions of each one.</p><p>Auxin is a plant hormone that controls virtually all growth and developmental processes in plants, including many yield traits in crops. However, no one knows why it is involved in so many processes. This is partly because it is not clear how the response system for this central signaling molecule was first born, or how it has increased in its complexity.</p><p>To address this, Mutte, Kato et al. explored the genetic information of more than a thousand plant species, including algae, which span more than 700 million years of evolution. Their analysis showed that all auxin response components were assembled from pieces of much older genes, but that they first came together when plants conquered land. Indeed, the auxin response appears to have developed on top of a pre-existing genetic regulator that is still present in modern-day algae. Mutte, Kato et al. then used experiments to show how stepwise increases in the number and types of auxin response components have shaped sophisticated, complex responses in land plants, and to demonstrate how ancient components control auxin response.</p><p>Together these findings provide a framework for understanding the many functions of auxin in plants, and how this came to be. They also show how complexity can be accomplished in a signal response pathway, and how diversity evolves in gene families. Similar studies on other response systems in plants and beyond are likely to help reveal common principles of hormone response evolution and diversification of gene regulation systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>M. polymorpha</kwd><kwd>P. patens</kwd><kwd>C. richardii</kwd><kwd>charophytes</kwd><kwd>A. agrestis</kwd><kwd>auxin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VICI 865.14.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mutte</surname><given-names>Sumanth K</given-names></name><name><surname>Weijers</surname><given-names>Dolf</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALTF 415-2016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kato</surname><given-names>Hirotaka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The system that controls gene expression by the plant signaling molecule auxin has deep evolutionary roots, and stepwise increases in system complexity shaped the highly diverse auxin response in land plants.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Auxins are a group of structurally related chemical compounds that control a multitude of growth and developmental processes in plants. The most common, naturally occurring auxin is indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), but synthetic analogs such as 2,4-dichlorophenoxy acetic acid (2,4-D) have largely overlapping biological activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Woodward and Bartel, 2005</xref>). While auxins have been shown to trigger rapid cellular events such as membrane hyperpolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates and Goldsmith, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Etherton, 1970</xref>), calcium influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Monshausen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schenck et al., 2010</xref>), and changes in endocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Paciorek et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robert et al., 2010</xref>), its activity in controlling growth and development appear to be mainly mediated by changes in gene expression via a nuclear auxin pathway (NAP). Perturbation of this gene regulatory pathway interferes with most, if not all, developmental responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weijers and Wagner, 2016</xref>). Indeed, in the moss <italic>Physcomitrella patens</italic>, it was shown that a complete knock-out mutant of this pathway does not show any transcriptional response to auxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavy et al., 2016</xref>). The NAP encompasses three dedicated protein families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A,B</xref>). Various auxins, including IAA and 2,4-D, are perceived by a co-receptor complex consisting of TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB) and AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). Subsequent ubiquitination of the Aux/IAA proteins causes their degradation in the 26S proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2001</xref>). When not degraded, Aux/IAA proteins bind to and inhibit DNA-binding transcription factors, the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTORS (ARF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kim et al., 1997</xref>). Thus, auxin de-represses ARFs, allowing these to activate or repress their direct target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ulmasov et al., 1999</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33399.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Proteins in nuclear auxin pathway; mechanism and origin of the domains.</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Scheme of NAP in land plants.

In flowering plants such as <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>, it is likely that the size of TIR1/AFB (six members), Aux/IAA (29 members) and ARF (23 members) gene families allows combinatorial assembly of distinct, local auxin response pathways. Given that diversity in auxin responses follows from diversification in its response proteins, it is still unclear how NAP complexity evolved from simpler ancestral states. Furthermore, while intuitive, a key question is whether increased NAP complexity indeed enabled more complex and diverse auxin responses during plant evolution. A third important question is where, when, and from what precursors the NAP originated.</p><p>Eukaryotic photosynthetic organisms diverged into three groups, Glaucophyta, Rhodophyta (red algae), and Viridiplantae more than 1.5 billion years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoon et al., 2004</xref>). Viridiplantae are further classified into chlorophyte algae and streptophytes, which include charophyte algae and land plants. Bryophytes represent the earliest diverging land plants and consist of three groups: hornworts, liverworts and mosses. After the split from bryophytes, ancestral vascular plants changed their life cycle from haploid-dominant to diploid-dominant and established a vascular system and root architecture, forming the group of lycophytes and euphyllophytes (ferns, gymnosperms and angiosperms).</p><p>The presence of a functional NAP with reduced genetic redundancy has been reported in model bryophytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Flores-Sandoval et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prigge et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rensing et al., 2008</xref>), whereas the presence of endogenous auxin is also reported in wide range of algal species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Žižková et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, a prediction is that the auxin response system may predate land plants, and that complexity evolved after the divergence of ancestral vascular plants from bryophytes. A key challenge is to identify the origin of the NAP system, as well as to reconstruct the steps in the evolution of its complexity. However, only little genome data are currently available from non-flowering land plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rensing, 2017</xref>), which makes such inferences extremely challenging. In addition, studies using only selected model species bear the risk of generalizing observations from non-representative genomes, due to species-specific gene-duplication, -loss, and -diversification. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze multiple species to understand evolutionary trends.</p><p>Here, we describe a deep phylogenomic analysis of NAP components using a large transcriptome dataset with more than 1000 plant species including many algae. This extensive dataset enabled us to reconstruct the ancestral states of auxin response gene families at key nodes in plant evolution. We infer plausible origins and evolutionary patterns for each auxin response gene family and predict auxin response properties at evolutionary nodes. Using comparative RNA-seq of six species, we tested and extended these predictions. Finally, we used a genetic strategy in a bryophyte to demonstrate surprising non-contributions of an ancient ARF class as well as contribution of deeply conserved non-canonical NAP components to auxin signaling. Our work provides a deep view into early steps in the origin, evolution and design principles of the multi-functional auxin response system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A phylogenomic strategy for reconstructing ancestral states</title><p>To reconstruct origin and early diversification in auxin response gene families, we designed a strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) that uses a large transcriptome dataset (OneKP) including multiple species for each major branch in plant species phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Matasci et al., 2014</xref>). The depth and quality of each individual RNA-seq-derived transcriptome is limited, and a further caveat of transcriptome-based gene identifications is that the number of genes may be underestimated if a gene is not expressed under the sampling conditions or in the sampled tissue. However, the availability of transcriptomes from multiple tissue samples of multiple related species, should allow deduction of the ancestral state that defines the gene complement at each evolutionary node. It should be stressed that this number represents the ancestral state at a given node, and species-specific gene duplications and gene losses will have modified the gene complement in individual species. Given our focus on early events in nuclear auxin response evolution, we have used all available transcriptomes of red algae, green algae, bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, and gymnosperms from the OneKP dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We also included all available angiosperm species in the Chloranthales, Magnoliids and ANA grade, as well as several species in both monocots and dicots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). For reference and quality control purposes, we included genome-based sequences from well annotated model species.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Origin of nuclear auxin response components</title><p>Each of the three auxin response protein types (ARFs, Aux/IAAs, and TIR1/AFBs) are multi-domain proteins and we initially focused on the origin of these proteins. Therefore, we asked where domains, or parts thereof, were found, and at what node the multi-domain proteins first appear.</p><p>ARF proteins carry an N-terminal DNA-binding domain (DBD) which consists of a composite dimerization domain (DD; made up of two separate subdomains [DD1 and DD2] that fold into a single unit), a B3-type DNA-interaction domain, and an ancillary domain (AD) of unknown function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boer et al., 2014</xref>). In land plants, the DD and AD are only found in the ARF family. The C-terminal Phox and Bem 1 (PB1) domain is shared among ARF and Aux/IAA proteins and mediates homo- and hetero-oligomerization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Korasick et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Nanao et al., 2014</xref>). Finally, ARFs contain a less well-defined Middle Region (MR) separating the PB1 and DBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In red algae, we found proteins containing an N-terminal portion of DD1, DD2, and AD, lacking a B3 or PB1 domain, but instead flanked by a C-terminal bromodomain (BROMO; InterPro ID: IPR001487; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The DD1 and DD2 motifs in red algae are spaced by 20–30 conserved amino acids, which is much shorter than the B3 domain (~120 amino acids; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In chlorophytes, we found a protein with only AD, flanked by a DNA-binding AT-rich interaction domain (ARID; InterPro ID: IPR001606; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, we found separate proteins that either represented a B3 or a PB1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, all ARF subdomains had been established before the split of the streptophytes, but not combined in a single protein. In contrast, we discovered full-length ARF-like proteins containing a DBD with a B3 domain inserted between DD and AD in charophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Land plant ARFs can be grouped into three classes, A, B and C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finet et al., 2013</xref>). Based on transactivation assays, class A and B ARFs are classified as transcriptional activators and repressors, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kato et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ulmasov et al., 1999</xref>). Class C-ARFs are generally recognized as transcriptional repressors based on the amino acid composition of MR, but this has not yet been fully supported by experimental evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kato et al., 2018</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the ARF-like proteins in charophytes fall in two sister clades and likely represent separate precursors of class C-ARFs (proto-C-ARFs) and A/B-ARFs (proto-A/B-ARFs) of land plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, we found the PB1 domain only in proto-C-ARFs, which could, however, be due to sparse sampling in some charophyte lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33399.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Distribution of auxin signaling proteins precursors in algal lineages.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Occurrence of NAP components in red algae, chlorophytes, and charophytes.

Land plants also have a protein family containing AP2 domain in their N-terminus, followed by a B3 domain. These proteins are called REALATED TO ABI3 AND VP1 (RAV). Interestingly, land plant RAV proteins do not have a PB1 domain and it is known that the B3 domain of RAV and ARF binds different DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Boer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matías-Hernández et al., 2014</xref>). The B3 domain of RAV-like proteins in charophytes is much more similar to RAV’s than to ARF’s in land plants and phylogenetic analysis showed that the RAV-like proteins of charophytes position along with RAV family in land plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Thus, we classify these proteins as proto-RAV. In the charophyte green algae, the two classes of proto-ARFs and proto-RAVs are found in various combinations in each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). While sequencing depth may be insufficient to detect all proto-ARFs and proto-RAVs, there does not appear to be a conserved pattern in the order of appearance and retention of these genes.</p><p>We next considered the origin of the Aux/IAA proteins. These proteins contain two functional small domains in addition to a C-terminal PB1 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,C</xref>). The N-terminal domain I recruits the TOPLESS (TPL) transcriptional co-repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Szemenyei et al., 2008</xref>). Domain II mediates the auxin-dependent interaction with TIR1/AFB and thus acts as a degron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dharmasiri et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kepinski and Leyser, 2005</xref>). Because domain I and II are too small for reliable BLAST searches, we used the PB1 domain to identify potential family members. No PB1-containing proteins were identified in red algae, while we found proteins with a PB1 domain but no DBD in chlorophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis based on the PB1 domain indicated these are neither closely related to RAV, nor to Aux/IAA and ARF families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). PB1 domain-containing proteins that lack a DBD were also found in many of the charophyte algae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most of them were placed along with proto-RAV in phylogenetic tree, but the sequences from <italic>Coleochaetae irregularis</italic> were placed along with the Aux/IAA in land plants that is separate from the PB1 of both ARFs and proto-RAV proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even though the N-terminal part of the PB1 domain is not as conserved as the C-terminal part, several critical residues were found to be conserved in Aux/IAA-like sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results indicate that the PB1 domain of land plant ARFs and Aux/IAAs had separate precursors in charophytes. We could, however, not detect domain I or II in Aux/IAA-like genes of charophyte algae, even when scrutinizing individual sequences. We thus conclude that Aux/IAA proteins with all three functional domains are limited to land plants.</p><p>Finally, we explored the origin of the TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptor that consist of an N-terminal F-box domain that anchors the protein to the other subunits in the SCF E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, and a C-terminal leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain that contains the auxin-binding pocket. Auxin acts as a molecular glue to stabilize the interaction between TIR1/AFBs and Aux/IAAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2007</xref>). The closest homolog of the TIR1/AFB proteins in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> is CORONATINE INSENSITIVE 1 (COI1), which functions as a receptor of the jasmonic acid (JA) phytohormone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katsir et al., 2008</xref>). In our homology search, we could not identify any proteins showing homology to either TIR1/AFB or COI1 in red algae and chlorophytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). We did find many proteins showing homology to TIR1/AFB and COI1 in the transcriptomes of charophyte algae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Phylogenetic analysis indicated that some of these proteins form a sister group to both TIR1/AFB and COI1 in land plants and none of the charophyte proteins are specifically grouped into either TIR1/AFB or COI1 clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting that charophytes had an ancestor that gave rise to both auxin and JA receptors. To infer whether the TIR1/AFB/COI1-like proteins of charophytes function as receptors for auxin or JA, we generated homology models of the TIR1/AFB/COI1-like protein from <italic>C. irregularis</italic> and the bryophyte <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> MpTIR1 and MpCOI1, using the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> TIR1 and COI1 crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sheard et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan et al., 2007</xref>) as templates for modeling. Even though the secondary structure of the <italic>C. irregularis</italic> protein was highly similar to that of land plant TIR1 and COI1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), at the level of amino acid sequence, the protein did not resemble either TIR1/AFB or COI1. Out of 40 residues conserved in either TIR1/AFB’s or COI1’s, only 7 and 11 residues are identical to TIR1/AFBs and COI1s, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; black stars). Notably, most of the hormone-contacting residues (11 out of 12) are different from both TIR1/AFB and COI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). These results suggest that the charophyte TIR1/AFB/COI1 precursor may not act as an auxin or JA receptor, and we conclude that dedicated receptors for auxin and JA were established only in land plants. Taken together, our analyses suggest that the components of NAP were established in the common ancestor of land plants by combining pre-existing components and that the system evolved to regulate pre-existing transcription factors.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33399.010</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reconstruction of ancestral state of NAP components in plant evolution.</title><p>Phylogeny of taxonomic classes are shown in left.

We next aimed to reconstruct the evolutionary history of auxin response components across all land plant lineages.</p><p>Consistent with previous descriptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finet et al., 2013</xref>), our phylogenetic analysis showed that all land plant ARFs are divided into three phylogenetic lineages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Within the class C lineage, we did not find any duplications in the ancestors of non-angiosperm species. The split that generated <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARF10/16 and ARF17 likely occurred early in angiosperm evolution, while the PB1 domain was lost in the ARF17 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). The class A-ARF is represented by a single copy in bryophytes and lycophytes. We found that a subset of genes lacking the DBD diverged from class A-ARFs in early land plants, is missing in hornworts and has been retained in liverworts, mosses and lycophytes (non-canonical ARF, ncARF; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). A further gene duplication event in the ancestor of euphyllophytes gave rise to two class A sub-families corresponding to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARF5/7/19 and ARF6/8, respectively. In the ancestor of seed plants a gene duplication caused differentiation between the <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARF5 and ARF7/19 subfamilies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Finally, two gene duplication events in the ancestral angiosperms led to ARF6 and ARF8 and to a paralogue of ARF7/19, which was lost in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Class B-ARFs are represented by a single gene in the ancestor of liverworts, mosses, lycophytes, and ferns.

Gene duplications in the ancestral gymnosperms gave rise to three class B-ARF copies, one representing <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARF3/4, another leading to <italic>A. thaliana</italic> ARF2 and the third generating the remainder of the class B-ARFs in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the reported lack of the PB1 domain in ARF3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finet et al., 2013</xref>) is an independent loss in the common ancestor of monocots and eudicots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicated that an ancestral Aux/IAA gene lacking domain I and II had been established during the evolution of charophytes, while ‘true’ Aux/IAAs with all functional domains are found only in land plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In addition to one copy of ‘true’ Aux/IAA, we found another set of deeply conserved non-canonical Aux/IAA-like sequences that lack the domain I and II (non-canonical Aux/IAA, ncIAA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Strikingly, while the Aux/IAAs have diversified through gene duplications, the ncIAA is found only in a single copy in all evolutionary nodes examined here and is represented by IAA33 in <italic>A. thaliana</italic>. In the ancestor of euphyllophytes, gene duplication events gave rise to three Aux/IAAs, which were retained in the ancestral seed plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Finally, in addition to the ancient ncIAA generated in a first duplication event, several independent later events generated non-canonical family members lacking domains. For example, the lack of domain II in IAA20, IAA30, IAA31, IAA32, and IAA34 of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> appears to be an independent loss in their respective lineages in the core angiosperms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>Our data indicated that ancestral charophyte green algae had one common ancestor for both auxin (TIR1/AFB) and JA (COI1) F-box co-receptors, and following duplication in the ancestor of all land plants, developed into two independent receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The common ancestor of bryophytes and lycophytes had a single orthologue of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> TIR1/AFBs. Gene duplication events in the ancestor of euphyllophytes gave rise to three subgroups; one leading to TIR1/AFB1-3, one leading to AFB4/5 and another which is widely present in many species including the angiosperms, but has been lost in some monocots and dicots including <italic>A. thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Thus, our analysis of the patterns of diversification in the ARF, Aux/IAA and TIR1/AFB families identifies the auxin response complement at each evolutionary node, and in addition reveals deeply conserved non-canonical family members. Notably, many changes occurred in the composition of NAP from the common ancestor of lycophytes to euphyllophytes, which may have led to complex auxin response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Multi-species comparative transcriptome analysis reveals evolution of response complexity</title><p>The complements of auxin response components identified from phylogenomic analysis allow for clear predictions of which species possess a functional transcriptional auxin response system. Based on our predictions, only land plants should be able to respond. In addition, it is intuitive that the number of components in auxin response will relate to the complexity of response, but as yet there is no experimental basis for such relationship. To experimentally address the competence of species to respond to auxin, and to explore the relationship between auxin response components and the qualitative and quantitative aspects of auxin response, we performed comparative transcriptome analysis. We selected six species that belong to different ancient lineages and that each have a different complement of auxin response components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

To detect only early transcriptional responses, we treated plants with auxin for 1 hr, and performed RNA-seq followed by de novo transcriptome assembly and differential gene expression analysis. To avoid inactivation of the natural auxin IAA by conjugation or transport, we treated with 10 μM of the synthetic auxin 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D).

In contrast, 82% of DEG were activated in <italic>C. richardii</italic>. We also found that there was a notable difference in the distribution of fold-change values, with a larger fraction of genes being more strongly activated (maximum 28 fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>We found that the number of auxin-responsive genes is positively correlated with the number of ARFs in land plants as seen in the expanded number of ARFs and DEG in <italic>P. patens</italic> and <italic>C. richardii</italic>. A switch to gene activation is not correlated with the number of ARFs, but rather with a duplication in the class A-ARFs in the ancestor of euphyllophytes and/or increase of Aux/IAA and TIR1/AFB. The increase in amplitude of auxin-dependent gene regulation in <italic>C. richardii</italic> could be a consequence of higher activation upon treatment, increased repression in the absence of auxin, or both. To determine its basis, we compared normalized expression values for the 20 top-most auxin activated, and the 20 least auxin activated genes in all species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This revealed that the increased amplitude of the top-most activated genes in <italic>C. richardii</italic> is not correlated with increased expression in the presence of auxin, but rather caused by reduced expression in its absence.

Even though BLAST filtering is not sufficient to distinguish orthology groups in large families such as kinases, we could identify several gene families to be commonly regulated by auxin in different land plants species. Classical primary auxin-responsive genes—the Aux/IAA, GH3 and SAUR families—were shown to be auxin responsive in many angiosperm species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abel and Theologis, 1996</xref>).

To investigate the biological roles of these genes, we chose the liverwort <italic>M. polymorpha,</italic> the only genetically tractable model plant encoding <italic>ncIAA, ncARF</italic> and C-ARF genes. We first addressed ncIAA and ncARF function and performed CRISPR/Cas9-mediated mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sugano et al., 2014</xref>) to obtain two different alleles for each gene which presumably cause a loss-of-function by frame shift mutation (<italic>nciaa-6, nciaa-10, ncarf-2, ncarf-10</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A,B,E</xref>). To investigate whether ncIAA and ncARF are involved in auxin response, we grew mutants on auxin-containing medium. Exogenously supplied auxin causes severe inhibition of thallus growth and increased formation of rhizoids in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishizaki et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>nciaa</italic> mutants showed auxin response similar to wild-type, while growth inhibition was strongly suppressed in <italic>ncarf</italic> mutants although rhizoid formation was still promoted by auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

The expression of <italic>YUC2</italic> was reduced in mock condition and auxin treatment did not change the expression. Thus, in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>, ncIAA may have a function in gene expression, but is not critical for auxin response itself.

All subdomains of dedicated auxin-response proteins were recovered in transcriptomes from red algae and chlorophytes, but the multidomain protein appears only in the charophyte and land plant lineage. These findings show that proto-ARF transcription factor was established during the evolution of ancestral charophytes by combining existing domains. However, given that no defined Aux/IAA and TIR1/AFB could be identified in charophytes, a complete nuclear auxin response system is limited to land plants. Ancestors of TIR1/AFB and COI1 co-receptors could be identified in charophytes, but detailed residue analysis suggested these to be neither auxin- nor JA receptor. Thus, duplication of this gene, as well as multiple mutations in the LRR domain, must have preceded the deployment of these proteins as co-receptors. Auxin-dependence of ARFs is mediated by auxin-triggered degradation of Aux/IAA proteins, bridging ARF and TIR1/AFB proteins through two protein domains: the ARF-interacting PB1 domain and the TIR1/AFB-interacting domain II. We did find charophyte PB1-containing proteins that form a sister clade of land plant Aux/IAA. However, domain II was not detected in these proteins. Along with innovations in the proto-TIR1/AFB/COI1 protein, gain of a minimal degron motif in the Aux/IAA precursor likely completed the auxin response system in the early ancestor of land plants. Whether proto-TIR1/AFB/COI1 interact with Aux/IAA-like protein via an unknown ligand would be an interesting question for future analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Auxin responses in algal species</title><p>Despite the lack of defined Aux/IAA and TIR1/AFB auxin co-receptor, the charophytes <italic>K. nitens</italic> and <italic>S. pratensis</italic> showed an extensive transcriptional response to exogenously supplied 2,4-D within 1 hr. A recent independent study showed IAA-dependent gene expression in <italic>K. nitens</italic> upon prolonged treatment with higher concentrations (100 μM for 10 hr to 7 days; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ohtaka et al., 2017</xref>). While <italic>S. pratensis</italic> has a proto-C-ARF, <italic>K. nitens</italic> does not appear to have proto-ARFs. Thus, by definition this response system must be different from the land plant auxin response system. Indeed, the charophyte orthologue of core land plant auxin responsive genes (C2HDZ) did not respond to 2,4-D and IAA. There was little, if any, overlap between auxin-responsive transcripts in the two charophytes, and in qPCR experiments on individual genes we noticed a high variability between experiments (not shown). Thus, it appears that charophytes do respond to auxin-like molecules, but this response may not be robust, or it may strongly depend on growth conditions. Auxin resembles indole and tryptophan, and it is possible that the response to auxin observed is in fact a metabolic response to nutrient availability. Presence of endogenous IAA is observed in a wide range of algal species including charophytes, chlorophytes, rhodophytes, chromista, and cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Žižková et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, non-photosynthetic bacteria and fungi produce IAA and use it for communication with plants and algae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu et al., 2015</xref>), and thus it is likely that a response mechanism independent of the NAP exists in these species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Function of the ancestral ARFs</title><p>Our data clearly indicate that ARF transcription factors were established in common ancestor of charophyte green algae and land plants. Structural homology models suggest that all the important residues for DNA-binding are conserved in proto-ARFs, suggesting that these should bind the same target DNA sequences. This should be assessed by biochemical experiments in the future. Given that there is a core set of auxin-regulated genes shared in all land plants, an intriguing possibility is that proto-ARFs already regulated this core set of genes that only became auxin-dependent upon establishment of TIR1/AFB and Aux/IAA proteins. Identification of the transcriptional targets of these proto-ARFs should help address this question. In any event, proto-ARFs—as well as critical residues for DNA binding—have been retained in many algal genomes for hundreds of millions of years, which suggests that they perform a biologically relevant function. Whether this function is related to the processes that auxin controls in land plants is an open question.</p><p>Interestingly, our phylogenetic analysis indicated that the split between class C- and class A/B-ARFs occurred in charophytes before the establishment of Aux/IAA-TIR1/AFB co-receptor, and by extension likely before proto-ARFs were auxin-dependent. This suggests that class C-ARFs are fundamentally different from class A/B-ARFs. Indeed, genetic analysis in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> revealed that its C-ARF likely does not act in auxin-dependent gene regulation. Several studies in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> showed that C-ARFs are involved in auxin response but the proposed role was different between studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding and Friml, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mallory et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wang et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yang et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, C-ARFs of <italic>A. thaliana</italic> generally have weak affinity to Aux/IAA proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Piya et al., 2014</xref>). To clarify the function of this ancient ARF subfamily, auxin-responsiveness of C-ARF proteins and relationship with A- or B-ARFs should be investigated in different species.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Novel components in auxin response</title><p>A surprising outcome of the phylogenomic analysis was the discovery of two deeply conserved non-canonical proteins: ncIAA and ncARF. Charophytes have an Aux/IAA-like protein containing a PB1 domain, but lacking domain II, which is critical for auxin perception. This protein could regulate the function of proto-ARF (or proto-RAV), but not in an auxin-dependent manner. While the canonical Aux/IAA gave rise to a large gene family, the ncIAA clade represented by a single member in every evolutionary node. The retention of a single ncIAA gene across plants suggests a fundamental function. Unfortunately, our mutant analysis in <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> could not reveal the function of ncIAA in auxin response and development in vegetative phase. ncIAA might have a function only in other developmental stages, or under specific stress conditions or environmental signals. No mutant in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> IAA33 gene has yet been reported, and perhaps such a mutant will help understand the ancient function of this protein.</p><p>This work revealed that a class A-ARF-derived ncARF subfamily lacking a DBD is evolutionarily conserved among liverworts, mosses, and lycophytes. Mutant analysis using <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> clearly showed that ncARF functions as positive regulator in transcriptional auxin responses. There are two hypothetical models for ncARF function. (1) ncARF protects canonical ARFs from AUX/IAA-mediated inactivation through the interaction of PB1 domain. (2) ncARF interacts with target gene loci by interaction with canonical ARFs and help activate expression by recruiting co-factors. Irrespective of the mechanism of ncIAA and ncARF function, future models of auxin response will need to incorporate these conserved components.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Functional impact of increased complexity in NAP components</title><p>Through comparative transcriptomics, we infer that the number of DNA-binding ARF transcription factors scales with the number of auxin-regulated genes. Both <italic>P. patens</italic> and <italic>C. richardii</italic> have an expanded set of ARFs and display substantially more auxin-responsive genes than <italic>A. agrestis</italic> and <italic>M. polymorpha</italic>. It is likely that later duplications in the ARF family in the seed plants led to the thousands of auxin-responsive genes in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paponov et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>Another key evolutionary change is the transition from mostly gene repression to gene activation. We infer that this transition occurred in a common ancestor of euphyllophytes, and transcriptome analysis in <italic>A. thaliana</italic> and <italic>O. sativa</italic> shows this pattern persists in angiosperms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jain and Khurana, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Paponov et al., 2008</xref>). There is a defining difference between bryophyte and euphyllophyte ARF families—a persisting duplication in the class A-ARFs. We hypothesize that the euphyllophytes duplication created an ARF copy that is more potent, or perhaps even specialized for gene activation. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the difference in endogenous auxin levels or tissue complexity among species may results in different sensitivity to auxin treatment.</p><p>The comparative transcriptomics also adds an interesting twist to our understanding of the functional distinction among ARF classes. Class A-ARFs are considered activators, and class B-ARFs repressors, perhaps through competing with class A-ARFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lavy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ulmasov et al., 1999</xref>). Despite a complete lack of class B-ARFs, the hornwort <italic>A. agrestis</italic> showed comparable auxin-dependent gene repression to the other bryophytes, suggesting that auxin-dependent gene repression may not be mediated by class B-ARFs. Based on these findings, the role of class B-ARFs in auxin response may need to be reconsidered.</p><p>A remarkable difference between bryophyte and euphyllophyte auxin-dependent transcriptomes is the appearance of genes with a large amplitude of regulation in the latter. Many auxin-responsive genes that were first identified in angiosperms such as <italic>A. thaliana</italic> have very high amplitudes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2009</xref>), but this appears to be a later innovation in the response system. The high amplitude is caused by more effective repression of gene activity in the no-auxin state, a property that is likely mediated by Aux/IAA proteins. Indeed, ferns have a much larger set of Aux/IAA proteins, as do all seed plants, and we propose that expansion of the Aux/IAA family enabled plants to articulate a clear distinction between on and off states in auxin response. In summary, this analysis reveals several design principles of the auxin response system.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Christian Hardtke as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors combined a deep phylogenomics approach with comparative transcriptomics, and structural homology modeling to analyze the origin and early evolution of the auxin response system in more than 1,000 plant species. They identified auxin response proteins and their subdomains and precursors to reconstruct the birth and evolutionary trajectory of the auxin response system. This study provides important insights into understanding early steps in the origin, evolution and design principles of the auxin response system, and tackles a fundamentally important question that will be of high interest to researchers in plant biology and genome evolution.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The gene identification process for inclusion within the phylogenetic trees needs to be improved by conducting both forward and backward analysis to ensure that the orthology/parology inferences assumed in the manuscript are valid. If they are not, then the trees need to be greatly expanded to test groupings explicitly.</p><p>2) The current manuscript makes explicit claims about ancestral functions and other ancestral assumptions that have minimal experimental support. As such, the authors need to better explain what alternative hypothesis may fit the data and what future work is needed to differentiate these. It is not sufficient to merely add a paragraph in the discussion to this point but instead the entire manuscript needs extensive retuning as the vast majority of explicit claims have alternative explanations and the singular model proposed is not necessarily the best model from the data.</p><p>3) The authors should consider what would happen if rather than considering the JA pathway the outgroup, they think of JA and IAA F-box perception as independent evolutions from a common mechanistic F-box perception pool.</p><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compared with the domain structure of classic NAP components in land plants, some of the non-canonical ARF, Aux and TIR identified in algae only contain one or two (sub-)domains. It is still unclear that whether these ancestral and weird NPA genes are only present in the algae lineages, or they also could be found in land plants and belong to other gene families. The evidence that these ancient NPA-like component is alga-specific, will strongly support that these identified genes belongs to the ARF/Aux/TIR families, and also support the view that the canonical NAP proteins with multi-domain in land plants are evolved by combining existing domains together (just like gene-fusion event) during they diverged from the alga lineages.</p><p>5) The paper focuses on analyzing the evolution of three critical NPA-related genes – ARF, Aux/IAA and TIR/AFB. However, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the RAV is suddenly introduced for analysis, and meanwhile, there is little information about the RAV in the manuscript, which is a bit puzzling. The evolutionary relationship should be clearly clarified between RAV/Aux/ARF and tell us how to distinguish the RAV gene from the Aux/ARF, if defined by the domain, it is better to add the domain structure of RAV protein in the supplementary data.</p><p>6) It is claimed that a TIR homologous genes is identified in Charopyhte, which might be the precursor of TIR/COI1. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the so-called TIR1/COI1 hybrid described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> do not have any predicted structural similarity compared with the split TIR and COI proteins in land plants. If further evidence is provided that some specific conserved amino acids, separately located at the diverged TIR and COI1 in land plant, could be simultaneously found in this ancient TIR1/COI1 protein, it will strongly enhance the concept that this ancestral gene is a TIR1/COI1 hybrid, and then it was separated into two genes TIR and COI1 during the origin of the land plant that diverged from the charophyte.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is really very interesting that accompanied with the evolution and diversification of the NAP components during plant evolution, more and more auxin regulated genes tend to be downregulated, and the repression pathway begin to dominate expression pattern. However, besides the differential regulation mechanism, according to this pie chart, it is unclear that whether there is some overlap in this up- or down-regulated genes from these six plant lineages, or these up- or down-regulated genes are fully different between these ancient plant species.</p><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, according to the transcriptomic data, the YUC gene in the A. agrestis is non-regulated by auxin. However, the qRT-PCR showed that there might be a downregulated mechanism for the YUC gene in A. agrestis after treatment. Meanwhile, the difference of the YUC expression between before and after auxin treatment is so slight, not only in the A. agrestis but also in the plants Mp and Cr, so the conclusion is not so solid. To enhance it, a series of higher concentration of auxin could be applied to check whether there is enhanced down-regulation of the YUC genes after treatment. By the way, the YUC is not identified in the S. pratensis and K. nitens, which might be due to the loss of this gene in these two, specific algae species but the homologous YUC genes are really present in the green algae lineages, even in the bacteria. So, it is by no means the YUC gene originated from the land plant, the discussion here should be much more careful.</p><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, a</xref> control that the phenotype of the arf1 mutant line should be added to make the arf3 defects much more comparable. Meanwhile, the same treatment as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref> also could be extended to the arf1 and arf3 mutants, showing that the MpARF3 is important for mediating auxin signaling, rather than the MpARF1.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Origin and evolution of the nuclear auxin response system&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>.

There are innumerable branches that have no support but are shown as resolved. For example, in the TIR1 tree, the split between TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, AFB3 and AFB4/5 is from branches with 20 or lower support. And as such, how is the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> supported? It is an interesting hypothesis, but it is not clear how this diagram arose from the underlying trees.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33399.035</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The gene identification process for inclusion within the phylogenetic trees needs to be improved by conducting both forward and backward analysis to ensure that the orthology/parology inferences assumed in the manuscript are valid. If they are not, then the trees need to be greatly expanded to test groupings explicitly.</p></disp-quote><p>To confirm the orthology of basal plant sequences to queried Arabidopsis sequences, we tested all sequence we identified in all species, that were used for ARF, IAA, TIR1/AFB trees with a BLAST search against the Arabidopsis proteome and listed the best hit. All land plant sequences showed the highest similarity with corresponding family members in Arabidopsis (as given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Proto-ARFs and proto-RAV sequences in Charophytes showed the highest similarity with ARF’s and RAV, respectively. B3-containing sequences in Chlorophytes showed best hits with various B3-type transcription factors. Given that Chlorophyte B3 domains are basal to all B3-type transcription factors in land plants (Swaminathan et al., 2008), this is the expected result. Aux/IAA-like sequences from <italic>Coleochaete irregularis</italic> did not present Aux/IAA’s or ARF’s as the best BLAST hit. We believe this to be due to the large sequence distance between Coleochaete from PB1 domains in Arabidopsis. However, when we BLAST Charophyte Aux/IAA-like sequences against the <italic>Marchantia polymorpha</italic> genome, the best hit is ncIAA, confirming our orthology inference. TIR1/COI1 sequences in Charophytes showed the highest similarity with either of TIR1/AFBs or COI1 (See also further points below). We have now modified <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref> and the Materials and methods section to clarify our forward/backward BLAST strategy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The current manuscript makes explicit claims about ancestral functions and other ancestral assumptions that have minimal experimental support. As such, the authors need to better explain what alternative hypothesis may fit the data and what future work is needed to differentiate these. It is not sufficient to merely add a paragraph in the discussion to this point but instead the entire manuscript needs extensive retuning as the vast majority of explicit claims have alternative explanations and the singular model proposed is not necessarily the best model from the data.</p></disp-quote><p>In our manuscript, we made two explicit claims about the function of ancestral proteins. (1) Proto-ARFs might have the same DNA-binding mode as ARFs in land plants, and (2) auxin-perception through Aux/IAA and TIR1/AFB was established after the split of Charophytes and land plants.</p><p>In regard to claim 1), we presented that the amino acid sequence of DBD is extremely conserved between proto-ARFs and ARF’s in land plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), and the proto-ARF DBD’s also follow the same 3D structure including dimerization domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Based on these results we consider that the current hypothesis is the most plausible. Of course, the hypothesis should be experimentally confirmed in the future studies, hence we add a sentence this effect in the Discussion section.</p><p>With respect to claim 2), we appreciate a series of constructive comments related to the origin of TIR1 and COI1. As described in detail below (Essential revision 3), we improved the phylogenetic tree and homology model for TIR1/COI1-like proteins in Charophytes. The new data strongly suggests that the TIR1/COI1-like proteins in extant Charophytes form a common sister clade to both TIR1/AFB and COI1 in land plants, and they are unlikely to bind auxin or JA. Given that Aux/IAA-like proteins of Charophytes do not have the critical domain for auxin perception, the most plausible hypothesis is that auxin perception through TIR1/AFB and Aux/IAA is limited to land plants. We consider it is unlikely that the ancestral proteins to TIR1/COI1 and Aux/IAA perceived auxin and were lost independently during Charophyte evolution. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that Charophyte TIR1/COI-like proteins interact with the Aux/IAA-like protein via an unknown ligand. We now refer to this possibility in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors should consider what would happen if rather than considering the JA pathway the outgroup, they think of JA and IAA F-box perception as independent evolutions from a common mechanistic F-box perception pool.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion, and we now realise that we made this point unnecessarily complicated due to the poorly supported phylogenetic tree in our original submission.</p><p>To improve the resolution of the TIR1/COI1 phylogeny, and to confirm the evolutionary position of TIR1/COI1-like proteins in Charophytes, we generate a new phylogenetic tree for TIR1/COI1 including other, functionally unrelated but relatively similar F-box LRR proteins (MAX2, VFB, and EBF families) from land plants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, we elaborated the TIR1/AFB phylogenetic tree to focus on the evolution in land plants (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). The former tree clearly showed that none of the green algal sequences is specifically grouped with either TIR1/AFB or COI1 in land plants, and thus form a sister group to both TIR1 and COI1.</p><p>Originally, we had used Klebsormidium and Spirogyra proteins to generate homology models of TIR1/COI1 orthologues. This is because we had accesses to the (draft) genomes of these species. However, the new F-box LRR tree indicated that the Spirogyra sequence actually does not belong to the TIR1/COI1 sister clade. The Klebsormidium protein was still grouped into the sister clade of TIR1/COI1, but its protein sequence is short and very different from land plant TIR1/COI1. Therefore, we generated a new homology model using the <italic>Coleochaetae irregularis</italic> protein, which belongs to the sister clade of TIR1/COI1. The secondary structure of the Coleochaete protein is highly similar to that of TIR1 and COI1 including the 3<sub>10</sub> helix we referred to in our original manuscript (new TIR1/COI1 alignment in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). However, the overall amino acid sequence is different from both TIR1 and COI1. Out of 40 residues which are specifically conserved in either TIR1/AFB or COI1, only 7 and 11 residues are identical to TIR1/AFB or COI1, respectively (black asterisks in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, 11 out of 12 hormone contacting residues of TIR1/AFB and COI1 are not conserved in the Coleochaete protein (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Based on these data, the most plausible interpretation is that TIR1/AFB and COI1 in land plants evolved from a common ancestor in charophyte algae, and it is unlikely that TIR1/COI1-like protein in charophytes bind to either auxin or jasmonate. We have now modified the manuscript (Results section) and corresponding figures to elaborate on these new findings. In addition, we have modified “TIR1/COI1 hybrid” in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> into “TIR1/COI1 precursor” for accuracy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compared with the domain structure of classic NAP components in land plants, some of the non-canonical ARF, Aux and TIR identified in algae only contain one or two (sub-)domains. It is still unclear that whether these ancestral and weird NPA genes are only present in the algae lineages, or they also could be found in land plants and belong to other gene families. The evidence that these ancient NPA-like component is alga-specific, will strongly support that these identified genes belongs to the ARF/Aux/TIR families, and also support the view that the canonical NAP proteins with multi-domain in land plants are evolved by combining existing domains together (just like gene-fusion event) during they diverged from the alga lineages.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret this comment to refer to the sequences in red algae and Chlorophytes. In this case, indeed, the proteins containing small domains of NAP components are specific to these algae. In land plants, DD and AD are only found in the ARF family and never combined with BROMO or ARID domains. To explain these points, we added a sentence “In land plants, the DD and AD are only found in ARF family.” (subsection “Origin of nuclear auxin response components”).</p><p>In addition, Chlorophyte B3 domain-containing genes are thought to be sister to both ARF and the other B3-containing genes in land plants (Swaminathan et al., 2008). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, Chlorophyte PB1-containing genes form a Chlorophyte-specific clade along with proto-RAV in Charophytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The paper focuses on analyzing the evolution of three critical NPA-related genes – ARF, Aux/IAA and TIR/AFB.

The reason why we picked up the RAV family in this study is that proto-RAV genes in Charophytes contain a PB1 domain in their C-terminus similar to ARF’s, even though land plant RAV’s do not have this PB1 domain. Domain structures of two DBD’s, phylogenetic analysis, and amino acid sequences of B3 domains clearly indicate that proto-RAV’s in Charophytes are the homologue to the land plant RAV family. For better introduction of the RAV family and better explanation of our results, we modified the manuscript (subsection “Origin of nuclear auxin response components”) and added a supplementary figure regarding the B3 domain of RAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is claimed that a TIR homologous genes is identified in Charopyhte, which might be the precursor of TIR/COI1.

The results show that Charophyte TIR1/COI1 precursors have a similar secondary structure to TIR1 and COI1 in land plants, form a common sister clade to both TIR1/AFB and COI1 families, and amino acids in the hormone-contacting domain do not resemble either TIR1/AFB or COI1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is really very interesting that accompanied with the evolution and diversification of the NAP components during plant evolution, more and more auxin regulated genes tend to be downregulated, and the repression pathway begin to dominate expression pattern.

Unlike is stated here, our comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that more genes are “activated” by auxin in vascular plants than bryophytes (not downregulated). The question of how much overlap there is among species is highly relevant and was an omission in our original manuscript. We have now performed reciprocal BLAST searches among DEG’s in all 6 species and carried out network analysis based on similarities of DEG’s across species. This helps visualising commonly regulated gene families, or orthology groups, rather than individual paralogues (New <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). This analysis showed that there is a number of auxin-regulated gene clusters showing some similarity. BLAST filtering is not necessarily enough to identify true paralogues and it is impossible to distinguish those in large gene family such as bHLH and kinases. Thus, it is impossible to derive an exact number or percentage of gene families that overlap across the species. Nevertheless, our analysis could identify some very specific gene families including C2HDZ, WIP and YUC to be commonly regulated by auxin in land plants. This strongly supports our conclusion that land plants share a set of auxin-responsive genes through the evolution. Furthermore, this analysis also showed that Charophyte auxin-regulated genes do not fall in the land plant clusters, and in addition revealed little overlap among the two Charophytes included here. We have now added this new data and modified the manuscript accordingly. Please see Results section and Materials and methods section for details.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, according to the transcriptomic data, the YUC gene in the A. agrestis is non-regulated by auxin. However, the qRT-PCR showed that there might be a downregulated mechanism for the YUC gene in A. agrestis after treatment.

Based on studies in angiosperms, 10 μM of auxin would already be a very high concentration. To test explicitly whether our choice of concentration in the experiment was suboptimal, we treated <italic>M. polymorpha</italic> with different concentrations of 2,4-D (1, 10, 100 μM), and determined the expression of representative auxin-responsive genes. However, 100 μM showed a weaker effect than 10 μM for three out of four genes tested, probably due to toxicity (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>).</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, we did not list a YUC homologue in Charophyte species, because we could not find any YUC homologues in our de novo assemblies.

We understand the homologues of YUC and GH3 are exist in the <italic>K. nitens</italic> genome. To avoid confusion for readers, we have added a footnote to the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> to explain that the absence of these genes in our transcriptome might be caused by low expression.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.33399.029</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-33399-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7, a</xref> control that the phenotype of the arf1 mutant line should be added to make the arf3 defects much more comparable.

For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, similar growth assays for Mp<italic>arf1</italic> mutants have already been done and reported in the Kato at al. (2017) paper.

Thus, 2,4-D is often used as a stable and potent analog for experiments related to gene regulation. We now open the introduction with a statement on the chemical diversity of auxin molecules, and later in the introduction explain that these all act in the nuclear auxin pathway in comparable way.

For generating the schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, we additionally used the DBD phylogeny to resolve the relationships among ARF proteins. We agree that one should not get the wrong impression from this schematic illustration. We have therefore replaced this figure panel by a schematic tree that shows only the well-resolved branches. The aim of the figure was to illustrate that Aux/IAA’s and ARF’s have a separate origin that dates back to the Charophytes. There is no doubt about these inferences based on the “real” phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In general, for all phylogenetic trees, unsupported branches need to be shown as unresolved. There are innumerable branches that have no support but are shown as resolved. For example, in the TIR1 tree, the split between TIR1, AFB1, AFB2, AFB3 and AFB4/5 is from branches with 20 or lower support. And as such, how is the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> supported? It is an interesting hypothesis, but it is not clear how this diagram arose from the underlying trees.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment but disagree that “innumerable branches that have no support are shown as resolved”. We believe that the reviewer may have inspected the earlier version of the TIR1 tree, which indeed had poor bootstrap values, but was replaced in the revised version of our manuscript. The grouping of TIR1/AFB1, AFB2/AFB3, AFB4/AFB5 and the relative that was lost in the core eudicots with their orthologs from other tracheophyte lineages is very well supported (bootstrap values &gt;65). It is true that their relative position (and hence order) is supported by relatively poor bootstrap values. However, this does not impact the grouping we summarize in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. For this reason, we purposely avoided any discussion about the order of appearance of the gene copies in duplication events. For full clarity, we have provided all our trees as open accessible files on the iTOL website, such that all readers can interact with the trees. In summary, the diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is fully supported by the trees. We now mention in the figure legend that tree topology is derived only from the well-supported branches.</p></body></sub-article></article>
