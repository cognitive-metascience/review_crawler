virions cloaked in host membranes. Quasi-enveloped HAV (eHAV) mediates stealthy cell-to-cell spread within the liver, whereas stable naked virions shed in feces are optimized for environmental transmission. eHAV lacks virus-encoded surface proteins, and how it enters cells is unknown. We show both virion types enter by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, facilitated by integrin β<sub>1</sub>, and traffic through early and late endosomes. Uncoating of naked virions occurs in late endosomes, whereas eHAV undergoes ALIX-dependent trafficking to lysosomes where the quasi-envelope is enzymatically degraded and uncoating ensues coincident with breaching of endolysosomal membranes. Neither virion requires PLA2G16, a phospholipase essential for entry of other picornaviruses. Thus naked and quasi-enveloped virions enter via similar endocytic pathways, but uncoat in different compartments and release their genomes to the cytosol in a manner mechanistically distinct from other <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43983.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The Hepatitis A virus is a common cause of liver disease in humans.

However, many viruses that have previously been considered to be ‘non-enveloped’ are now known to be released non-lytically from infected cells in a ‘quasi-enveloped’ form, enclosed in small extracellular vesicles (EVs) devoid of virus-encoded surface proteins. This phenomenon was recognized first among members of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic>, including hepatitis A virus (HAV, genus Hepatovirus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>), poliovirus and coxsackievirus B (genus Enterovirus) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>), but it has been demonstrated also for hepatitis E virus (<italic>Hepeviridae</italic>), rotaviruses (<italic>Reoviridae</italic>), and noroviruses (<italic>Caliciviridae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagashima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santiana et al., 2018</xref>). The size of the virus-containing EVs varies widely among different viruses, as does the number of virus capsids enclosed in each vesicle, most likely reflecting different mechanisms of biogenesis. However, these membrane-wrapped, quasi-enveloped virions share the capacity to infect cells, and contribute to pathogenesis either by cloaking capsids in membranes such that they are sequestered from the host immune system, or possibly by increasing the number of viral genomes delivered to newly infected cells, thereby facilitating genetic complementation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>HAV provides a prime example of viral quasi-envelopment. An ancient pathogen that remains a common cause of enterically-transmitted hepatitis globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lemon et al., 2017</xref>), it is hepatotropic in vivo and released without cell lysis in small EVs containing 1–3 capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast to the naked, nonenveloped virus that is shed in feces, these quasi-enveloped virions (eHAV) are the only form of virus found in sera from infected humans and account for most viruses in supernatant fluids of permissive cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>). They are fully infectious,~50–110 nm in diameter, and possess a buoyant density of ~1.100 g/cm<sup>3</sup> in iodixanol. The protein composition of the quasi-envelope resembles that of exosomes, suggesting a multivesicular body (MVB) origin, and their biogenesis is dependent on ALIX (ALG-2-interacting protein 1, also known as PDCD6IP) and other components of the <underline>e</underline>ndosomal <underline>s</underline>orting <underline>c</underline>omplexes <underline>r</underline>equired for <underline>t</underline>ransport (ESCRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González-López et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKnight et al., 2017</xref>). The capsids enclosed within the eHAV vesicle are, like other picornaviral capsids, comprised of 60 copies of each of 4 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). However, they differ from the naked, nonenveloped capsids shed in feces in that they contain an unprocessed form of the VP1 capsid protein (VP1pX) retaining a 71 amino acid carboxy-terminal domain absent in naked virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Interactions between picornaviral capsids and their receptors are critical for promoting endocytosis, virion uncoating, and safe delivery of the viral RNA genome across endosomal membranes into the cytoplasm to establish a productive infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baggen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groppelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>). The phosphotidylserine (PtdSer) receptor TIM1 (T cell immunoglobulin and mucin-containing domain one protein, also known as HAVCR1) was identified as a receptor for HAV twenty years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Feigelstock et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kaplan et al., 1996</xref>), prior to the discovery of quasi-enveloped virions. TIM1 has since been shown to facilitate the binding of eHAV but not naked HAV virions to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das et al., 2017</xref>), presumably through binding PtdSer displayed on the surface of the eHAV membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). However, TIM1 is not essential for attachment or entry of either HAV or eHAV, nor is it required for infection of permissive strains of mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das et al., 2017</xref>). Thus far, an essential receptor has yet to be identified for either HAV or eHAV.</p><p>Little is known about how these two virion types enter cells, although prior studies point to the existence of distinct entry pathways for naked versus quasi-enveloped virions as might be expected from the presence of the limiting lipid membrane in eHAV. eHAV is selectively sensitive to the lysosomal poison chloroquine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>), and slower to enter cells and begin replication than naked HAV capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>). eHAV is resistant to anti-capsid neutralizing antibodies in quantal, plaque reduction-like assays, but neutralizing antibodies restrict its replication when added to cells 4–6 hr after adsorption of the virus, suggesting a delay in uncoating within an endocytic compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we report detailed roadmaps for the entry of these different types of infectious hepatitis A virions in hepatocytes, identify a key role for integrin β<sub>1</sub> in endocytosis of both, and demonstrate distinct trafficking of these virion types through the endocytic system. We demonstrate critical temporal and spatial differences in the uncoating of HAV and eHAV capsids, and show that eHAV entry is uniquely dependent on the ESCRT accessory protein ALIX as well as lysosomal proteins involved in lipid metabolism.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Determinants of HAV and eHAV endocytosis</title><p>To identify the endocytic pathways responsible for internalization of HAV and eHAV virions in Huh-7.5 human hepatoma cells, we used pharmacological and genetic approaches to disrupt the function of regulators of several canonical endocytic routes. Inhibition of clathrin- and dynamin-mediated endocytosis by the drugs chlorpromazine and dynasore, respectively, strongly inhibited the uptake of both gradient-purified HAV and eHAV virions, as measured by RT-PCR quantitation of the viral genome in cell lysates 6 hr post-infection (hpi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, inhibiting cavaeolae-dependent endocytosis with filipin resulted in mild impairment of eHAV entry only, whereas inhibiting cytosolic dynein, actin- and/or Rac1-dependent micropinocytosis, or heparan sulfate proteoglycan binding with various compounds had no effect on the entry of either virion type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Roles for clathrin and dynamin in the uptake of both HAV and eHAV were confirmed by siRNA-mediated depletion of clathrin heavy chain (<italic>CLTC</italic>), the µ1 subunit of the clathrin-associated adaptor complex 2 (<italic>AP2M1</italic>), or dynamin-2 (<italic>DNM2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Caveolin-1 (<italic>CAV1</italic>) depletion minimally inhibited entry of eHAV only, consistent with the effect of filipin treatment, while depleting the clathrin- and caveolae-independent endocytosis regulators ADP ribosylation factor 6 (<italic>ARF6</italic>) and flotillin-1 (<italic>FLOT1</italic>) had no significant effect. Consistent with these results, confocal fluorescence microscopy revealed a high-degree of co-localization of both HAV and eHAV capsid antigen with clathrin-coated vesicles between ~0.5–1 hpi, and minimal co-localization of the eHAV capsid only with caveolin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, both HAV and eHAV entry occur primarily through clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, although caveolin-dependent endocytosis may play a minor role in eHAV uptake.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43983.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Naked and quasi-enveloped HAV virions undergo clathrin-dependent endocytosis facilitated by β<sub>1</sub> integrin.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Effect of endocytic inhibitors on HAV and eHAV entry quantified by RT-PCR (mean ± SD, n = 3 independent experiments).

This suggests that eHAV entry might be mediated by integrins or adhesion molecules previously reported to be involved in the uptake of EVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">van Dongen et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this hypothesis, siRNA-mediated depletion of integrin β<sub>1</sub> (<italic>ITGB1</italic>) resulted in a striking and highly significant reduction in the uptake of quasi-enveloped as well as naked virions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Depleting integrin β<sub>1</sub> did not reduce the quantity of eHAV or HAV bound to the cell surface at 4°C, but significantly reduced the amount of eHAV and HAV RNA present in Huh-7.5 cells 6 hpi at 37˚C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of <italic>ITGB1</italic> also reduced both eHAV and HAV uptake and spread in H1-HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Consistent with these results, pre-treating Huh-7.5 cells with an RGD peptide containing an integrin β<sub>1</sub>-binding motif reduced uptake of both virion types by about 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Consistent with this, confocal microscopy demonstrated that the capsid antigen associated with quasi-enveloped eHAV, but not naked HAV, was selectively trafficked to LAMP1<sup>+</sup> and VAMP8<sup>+</sup> lysosomes as early as 4 hpi, remaining there up to 12 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, naked virion capsid antigen was never found to be associated with lysosomes, suggesting that Rab7a<sup>+</sup> late endosomes represent the final trafficking destination of naked HAV. Importantly, sorting of both eHAV and naked HAV virions was associated with co-internalization of integrin β<sub>1</sub> to these endolysosomal compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Strikingly, quasi-enveloped eHAV virions failed to reach the lysosome in cells depleted of ALIX, but not the ESCRT-III proteins CHMP1B or CHMP2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). The apparent lack of a requirement for these ESCRT-III proteins could reflect less robust depletion of the targeted mRNA than that achieved with ALIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), or possibly the existence of functionally redundant homologs such as CHMP2B. Consistent with the imaging studies, depletion of ALIX had a strong negative effect on the early replication of eHAV, but not naked HAV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).

With quasi-enveloped eHAV, however, this can only occur after the membrane cloaking the capsid is degraded or fuses with a cellular membrane. Fusion seems unlikely given the absence of any virus-encoded proteins in the quasi-envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKnight et al., 2017</xref>), whereas the selective targeting of eHAV to lysosomes suggests that the quasi-envelope, despite being stable at pH 5.0, might be degraded by cholesterol transporter proteins and hydrolytic enzymes expressed within late endosomes and lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kolter and Sandhoff, 2010</xref>).

PKH26 irreversibly stains membrane lipids, allowing the labelled virions to be purified subsequently by isopycnic ultracentrifugation, and the fate of the quasi-envelope tracked by confocal microscopy following uptake into cells. We combined this approach with immunostaining cells with a monoclonal antibody to the capsid (K24F2) under minimal permeabilization conditions. This allowed us to visualize capsid antigen associated with PKH26-labeled membranes, and to differentiate eHAV from other EVs with similar density that co-purify in iodixanol gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKnight et al., 2017</xref>). Confocal microscopy of Huh-7.5 cells inoculated with the gradient-purified, PKH26-labeled eHAV showed that capsid antigen was surrounded by PKH26-labeled membranes within lysosomes at ~6 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, eHAV reaches the lysosome cloaked in membranes. At later time points, however, the PKH26 fluorescence was absent although the capsid antigen was still detected within lysosomes, consistent with the quasi-envelope being degraded within the lysosome to produce a naked capsid. As HAV replicates slowly in cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Whetter et al., 1994</xref>), newly synthesized capsid antigen associated with the generation of progeny virions was not detected until after ~18–24 hpi, at which time there was minimal localization of capsid antigen within lysosomes.</p><p>As the data presented above suggest that LAL is important for eHAV entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>), we monitored loss of the eHAV membrane over time by following the decay of PKH26 fluorescence in cells infected in the presence or absence of the LAL inhibitor, Lalistat-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). As expected, inhibition of LAL delayed the kinetics of eHAV membrane loss without altering its trafficking to the lysosome, further supporting a model in which degradation of the eHAV membrane is facilitated by lysosomal enzymes. Interestingly, similar experiments using PKH26-labeled EVs collected from supernatant fluids of uninfected Huh-7.5 cells showed targeting of the PKH26 dye to CD63<sup>+</sup> endosomes, not lysosomes, without any decay in the fluorescence signal even as late as 24 hr post-inoculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that there may be specific targeting signals present within the eHAV membrane that are absent in unrelated EVs.</p><p>Although the quasi-envelope protects the virus against neutralization in quantal infectious focus-reduction neutralization assays, our previous studies show that eHAV (but not naked HAV virions) can be neutralized within an endocytic compartment when neutralizing IgG or IgA antibodies are added to cells as late as 4–6 hr after adsorption of the virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>). To determine whether such neutralization is dependent upon LAL-mediated degradation of the quasi-envelope within lysosomes, we pre-treated Huh-7.5 cells with Lalistat-2 prior to infection with naked HAV or eHAV, and added anti-HAV-positive human plasma (‘JC’ plasma) at intervals following removal of the inoculum. Consistent with our previous results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>), neutralizing antibodies had no effect on replication of the nonenveloped, naked HAV under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, top), whereas replication of quasi-enveloped eHAV was substantially reduced when antibody was added as late as ~4 hr after adsorption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom). Importantly, however, the period of time during which eHAV was vulnerable to neutralization was extended significantly in cells treated with Lalistat-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, bottom). These results are consistent with Lalistat-2 slowing the transition of eHAV to a neutralization-susceptible state. Collectively, these data show that the quasi-enveloped eHAV capsid remains wrapped in membranes until the virion reaches the lysosome, where the quasi-envelope is degraded by lysosomal enzymes and cholesterol transporter proteins, rendering the capsid susceptible to antibody-mediated neutralization and, presumably, interactions with a yet-to-be-identified receptor.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Kinetic and spatial differences in uncoating of HAV and eHAV capsids</title><p>To determine whether there are differences in the kinetics of uncoating of naked and quasi-enveloped capsids, we dually immunostained infected cells with a murine monoclonal antibody (K34C8) that recognizes an epitope expressed only on fully assembled capsids, and polyclonal human antibody (JC plasma) that recognizes both assembled capsids and assembly intermediates (14S pentamers) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González-López et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stapleton et al., 1993</xref>).

Cells were infected in the presence or absence of the picornaviral RNA synthesis inhibitor, guanidine hydrochloride (GnHCl), and production of nanoluciferase measured over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Nanoluciferase expression resulting from translation of the incoming naked virus genome could be detected as early as ~4 hpi, while translation of the eHAV genome was not detectable until ~8 hpi. In both cases, nanoluciferase expression increased similarly in the presence or absence of GnHCl for ~10 hr once translation had commenced, following which accelerating increases in the absence of GnHCl indicated the production of new viral transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Thus, translation of the genomic RNA as well as the first round of RNA replication occurs sooner with naked HAV than with quasi-enveloped eHAV, consistent with the relatively rapid uncoating of the naked virion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Endolysosomal membrane damage and hepatovirus entry</title><p>The data presented above indicate that late endosomes and lysosomes are the terminal trafficking destinations of naked and quasi-enveloped HAV virions, respectively, and that the capsids associated with these different virion types uncoat and release their RNA genomes within these distinct endolysosomal compartments. However, it is not clear in either case how the RNA genome released from the capsid is then translocated from the endolysosomal lumen to the cytosol where it is translated on ribosomes. The VP4 capsid peptide possesses membrane pore forming activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Shukla et al., 2014</xref>), but neither HAV nor eHAV has been shown previously to disrupt the integrity of endolysosomal membranes during infection. To determine whether hepatoviruses induce pores in endolysosomal membranes during entry as observed with other picornaviruses, we inoculated cells with eHAV or HAV in the presence of α-sarcin or restrictocin A, membrane-impermeable ribotoxins that are released into the cytoplasm only if endolysosomal membranes are compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cuadras et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fernández-Puentes and Carrasco, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>). Global protein synthesis, quantified by puromycin incorporation, was significantly reduced in cells ~ 6 hr after adsorbtion of eHAV but not naked HAV, in the presence of either α-sarcin or restrictocin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Reductions in protein synthesis were similar but not as strong as those observed in cells infected with human rhinovirus 14 (HRV14), included as a positive control in these experiments, and were not observed in cells inoculated with eHAV in the presence of neutralizing anti-HAV antibody which abrogated the ability of eHAV to induce endosomal escape of the ribotoxins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This effect was specific to eHAV, and naked HAV was never found to induce ribotoxin escape from endosomes at any time post-infection, even under conditions in which it was able to initiate translation of its genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that eHAV induces endolysosomal membrane injury and to determine more specifically that it occurs within lysosomes, as expected from the trafficking studies described above, we pre-loaded the lysosomes of Huh-7.5 cells with fluorophore-conjugated dextran prior to virus infection. Dextran is a complex, branched glucan that enters cells through fluid-phase pinocytosis and accumulates following its internalization in endolysosomal vesicles positive for LAMP1 and Rab7/LAMP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Humphries et al., 2011</xref>). The release of this pre-loaded dextran from lysosomes into the cytoplasm can be induced by lysosomotropic agents like L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), providing a useful measure of lysosomal membrane permeability. As expected, cells infected with eHAV demonstrated significantly reduced numbers of dextran-positive compartments as early as six hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), a time at which eHAV was seen to be accumulating within lysosomes and sometimes co-localizing with dextran. In contrast, naked virions were never observed in lysosomes and did not alter the number of dextran-containing compartments, even at 12 hpi.</p><p>Collectively, these data indicate that eHAV uncoats within the lysosomal lumen and induces membrane damage congruent with release of its genome to the cytoplasm, whereas uncoating of naked HAV virions takes place within a late endosomal compartment in the absence of detectable endosomal membrane damage. Whether the absence of detectable endosomal rupture during HAV entry reflects a process that is mechanistically different from that by which eHAV releases its RNA genome across endolysosomal membranes is uncertain. It could be simply that late endosomal membranes breached by HAV are more capable of repair than the lysosomal membrane breached by eHAV.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Role of PLA2G16 in eHAV and HAV entry and replication</title><p>PLA2G16 was identified recently as an essential entry factor for several members of the <italic>Picornaviridae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>). A phospholipase, it facilitates the safe translocation of the RNA genome from the endosome to the ribosome, providing for its escape from autophagosome-dependent degradation initiated by galectin-8 recruited to sites of endosomal membrane damage. To determine whether either HAV or eHAV entry is similarly dependent on PLA2G16, wild-type and CRISPR/Cas9-edited H1-Hela cells lacking expression of PLA2G16 (Δ<italic>PLA2G16</italic> cells) or galectin-8 (Δ<italic>LGALS8</italic> cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>) were infected with the nanoluc reporter virus.

Thus, unlike enteroviruses and cardioviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>), PLA2G16 is not required for safe transport of the hepatovirus genome from the endosomal lumen to ribosomes to initiate viral protein synthesis. Although <italic>PLA2G16</italic> knockout reduces the permissiveness of H1-HeLa cells for enterovirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>), longer term studies demonstrated that the replication of both HAV and eHAV was enhanced in Δ<italic>PLA2G16</italic> cells, with increased hepatovirus RNA abundance, more dsRNA, and greater viral protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>-<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

Thus, PLA2G16 restricts, rather than promotes hepatovirus infection. Further experiments demonstrated that this restriction occurs at a post-entry step in replication of the HAV genome, as replication of a subgenomic reporter replicon RNA (HAV-FLuc) lacking capsid-coding sequence was similarly enhanced in <italic>PLA2G16</italic> knockout Huh-7.5 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43983.025</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Dispensability of PLA2G16 during HAV entry.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Translation of HAV RNA during viral entry (~2000 GEs/cell, 12 hpi) measured by HAV-NLuc activity in H1-HeLa cells knocked-out for PLA2G16 or LGALS8 (mean ± SD, n = 2 biological replicates for a representative experiment).

However, PLA2G16 is not required to protect the RNA genome from autophagy during its delivery from the endolysosome to ribosomes, suggesting a fundamental difference in how hepatoviruses and other picornaviruses manage the final step in viral entry and deliver their RNA genomes across endolysosomal membranes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Naked HAV and quasi-enveloped eHAV virions play distinct but equally important roles in the pathogenesis of hepatitis A, with naked HAV virions responsible for fecal-oral transmission of the virus between individuals, and quasi-enveloped eHAV mediating subsequent spread within the newly infected host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hirai-Yuki et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we describe the entry pathways followed by these two virion types. The early endocytic trafficking routes for these different types of infectious virions are quite similar, but they are differentially sorted within the late endosome and uncoat their encapsidated RNA genomes in different endocytic compartments. The entry of both types of virions requires clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis and results in trafficking through Rab5+ and Rab7+ endosomal compartments, but only eHAV continues its trafficking to reach the lysosome, where degradation of the quasi-envelope and uncoating of the genome ensues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). In contrast, naked HAV uncoats in late endosomes shortly after internalization, resulting in relatively rapid translation of its genomic RNA. These results provide new insight into how quasi-enveloped hepatoviruses infect the cell, and are likely relevant to pathogenic quasi-enveloped viruses from other families, notably hepeviruses and noroviruses, that are released from infected cells in EVs of comparable size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nagashima et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santiana et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The quasi-envelope represents an elegant strategy for evading antibody-mediated immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Takahashi et al., 2010</xref>), but it imposes a need for additional steps in cellular entry prior to uncoating of the genome. PtdSer is displayed on the eHAV surface and the initial attachment of eHAV to cells occurs in part through the PtdSer receptor, TIM1 (HAVCR1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Feng et al., 2015</xref>). This interaction likely promotes virus spread within the liver, but TIM1 is not essential for infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Das et al., 2017</xref>). We show here that integrin β<sub>1</sub> is also involved in quasi-enveloped virus entry. It is not required for attachment to the cell at 4˚C, but is essential for efficient internalization of eHAV at 37˚C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). It acts similarly in uptake of the naked virion, but must do so through interactions with a different ligand since integrin β<sub>1</sub> co-localized with both virion types on the cell surface, and within endosomes, hours before degradation of the quasi-envelope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Consistent with this, activating antibodies that stabilize specific conformations of integrin β<sub>1</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Su et al., 2016</xref>) differentially enhanced the uptake of the two virion types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Integrin β<sub>1</sub> facilitates uptake of several other picornaviruses through interactions with their capsids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Merilahti et al., 2012</xref>), and the VP3 capsid protein of HAV contains conserved RGD and KGE integrin recognition motifs. However, neither motif is exposed on the surface of the naked HAV capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), and thus both are unlikely ligands for integrin β<sub>1</sub>. We conclude that integrin β<sub>1</sub> binds elsewhere on the HAV capsid, likely in association with an α integrin, and also interacts with a host protein on the surface of eHAV. We were unable to identify a specific α integrin involved in entry of either virion type, but sub-optimal knockdown conditions and/or promiscuity of integrin β<sub>1</sub> for an α integrin partner, may have masked a specific role for an α integrin(s).</p><p>Collectively, our data show trafficking of quasi-enveloped virus to the lysosome is essential for entry and uncoating of its genome. In addition to Rab5 and Rab7 GTPases, this requires the ESCRT accessory protein, ALIX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), likely due to the critical role it plays in regulating trafficking from late endosomes to the lysosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Murrow et al., 2015</xref>). ALIX mediates the ubiquitin-independent sorting and trafficking of certain G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) to lysosomes through interactions with YPX<sub>3</sub>L motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dores et al., 2016</xref>). The VP2 capsid protein of HAV possesses two such YPX<sub>3</sub>L ALIX interaction motifs, and we have shown that these have an essential role in the biogenesis of eHAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">González-López et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, ALIX is required for both efficient entry and release of quasi-enveloped hepatovirus. However, ALIX mediates sorting of eHAV to the lysosome prior to degradation of its membrane, and thus promotes the entry process at a point during which the VP2 YPX<sub>3</sub>L motifs are occluded by the quasi-envelope, and moreover are within the lumen of the endosome and not available to interact with cytoplasmic ALIX. Rather than a direct interaction with the virus, the requirement for ALIX in eHAV entry is more likely to reflect a role for the ESCRT-associated protein in maturation and trafficking of the late endosome, akin to its suggested role in entry of human papillomavirus and arenaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gräßel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pasqual et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Is there a specific signal that directs the endocytosed eHAV virion to lysosomes? We found that nonspecific EVs released from uninfected Huh-7.5 cells (most likely exosomes) did not traffic to lysosomes, and that PKH26-labelled membranes associated with these vesicles decayed within the cell much more slowly than the eHAV membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results are consistent with previous studies of exosome entry that show PKH26-labeled exosome membranes can be tracked within cells for 24 hr or longer after entry with little or no accumulation in lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dutta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ringuette Goulet et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Svensson et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests the existence (or possibly the absence) of a specific targeting signal within the eHAV membrane that results in these virions being routed to the lysosomal lumen for degradation of the quasi-envelope. Quantitative proteomics studies provide some support for this hypothesis, as such studies show differential enrichment of host proteins associated with eHAV versus exosomes released from the same cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McKnight et al., 2017</xref>). Within the lysosome, both LAL and NPC1 contribute to the degradation of the quasi-envelope required for uncoating of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), recapitulating the function of these lysosomal proteins in the quasi-enveloped hepevirus life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yin et al., 2016</xref>). No other picornavirus is known to be trafficked to the lysosome for uncoating.</p><p>What triggers uncoating of the eHAV capsid after degradation of the quasi-envelope within the lysosome, and is this trigger the same as that for naked capsids within late endosomes? For picornaviruses of the Aphthovirus genus, low pH alone is sufficient to promote the dissociation of the capsid into pentameric subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tuthill et al., 2009</xref>). However, the HAV capsid is highly resistant to acid pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siegl et al., 1981</xref>). An alternative model is provided by poliovirus, which interacts with a specific receptor (CD155) that triggers a massive conformational rearrangement of the capsid providing for safe transfer of genomic RNA across the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Groppelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>). This is accompanied by evidence of endosomal pore formation in ribotoxin assays, such as that we show here for quasi-enveloped hepatoviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schober et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>). However, we did not detect pore formation in cells infected with naked HAV, even under conditions in which we documented translation of the genomic RNA, and thus successful translocation of the genome across the endosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Crystallographic studies have identified substantial differences in the structures of the hepatovirus and poliovirus capsids, including a domain swap in VP2 and the absence of a lipid ‘pocket factor’ in HAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2015</xref>). Interactions of the poliovirus capsid with its cellular receptor lead to the release of this pocket factor and an irreversible expansion of the capsid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Strauss et al., 2015</xref>). Whether a similar expansion of the HAV capsid occurs during the process of its uncoating is unknown. The HAV capsid is exceptionally stable, and how it uncoats is enigmatic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Stuart et al., 2018</xref>). Recent studies show that monoclonal antibodies that bind with high affinity are capable of destabilizing the HAV capsid, possibly mimicking a specific receptor interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2017</xref>). The nature of that putative receptor remains unknown, but data we present here suggest that it is likely to be present in late endolysosomal membranes.</p><p>We found that the phospholipase, PLA2G16, is not required for safe translocation of the RNA genome in either virion type from the endolysosomal lumen to the cytoplasm. These observations stand in sharp contrast to the essential role of PLA2G16 in the entry of multiple other picornaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Staring et al., 2017</xref>). Our data point collectively to fundamental differences in the mechanism(s) by which hepatoviruses and other picornaviruses accomplish the endgame in entry, delivering their RNA genome to the ribosome where synthesis of the viral polyprotein can commence. The data leave open the possibility that this process differs for eHAV and HAV not only in where it occurs spatially within the endolysosomal system, but also in its molecular details. This question is likely to be resolved only after it is determined whether a specific receptor protein exists that is capable of triggering uncoating of the hepatovirus capsid.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Intracellular viral RNA was harvested at 48 hpi, cDNA was synthesized, and HAV RNA levels were quantified by RT-qPCR as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Endosomal and lysosomal membrane integrity assays</title><p>For endosomal membrane integrity, H1-HeLa cells were inoculated with equal amounts (~1000 HAV GEs per cell) of gradient-purified HAV or eHAV, or 10 plaque-forming units (PFU) per cell of human rhinovirus-14 (HRV-14) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McKnight and Lemon, 1996</xref>) in supplemented DMEM presence of α-sarcin or Restrictocin A previously reconstituted in sterile ultrapure water and incubated for 6 hr at 37˚C (for HAV) or 33˚C (for HRV-14). Cells were then incubated with supplemented DMEM containing 20 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup> puromycin for 20 min, rinsed twice with PBS, and total protein lysates were harvested as described above. Specific puromycin incorporation was validated by pre-treating cells with cycloheximide for 30 min prior to the puromycin pulse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). For lysosomal membrane integrity analysis, Huh-7.5 cells seeded in 8-well chamber slides were loaded with 100 µg.ml<sup>−1</sup> anionic-lysine fixable Alexa Fluor 594-conjugated dextran (10 kDa) (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #D22913) diluted in supplemented DMEM for 16 hr at 37˚C.

The pinhole was maintained at 1 Airy unit and images were acquired in two separate channels to prevent bleed-through. The excitation/emission wavelengths were 405 nm/425–520 nm for DAPI, 488 nm/500–520 nm for Alexa Fluor 488, 543 nm/555–647 nm for Alexa Fluor 594 or PKH26, and 635 nm/647–700 nm for Alexa Fluor 647. Intensity plot profiles were generated using the ImageJ software and co-localization indexes (Mander’s coefficients) were obtained with the Just Another Colocalisation Plugin (JACoP) module for ImageJ. All micrographs are representative of at least 10 images for each sample per experiment, and each experiment was performed at least twice. Images were processed for presentation using Photoshop CS4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unless stated otherwise, significance was assessed by unpaired <italic>t</italic> tests or ANOVA calculated with GraphPad Prism seven for Windows software.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wes Sundquist as a Reviewing Editor and Wenhui Li as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joerg Votteler and Mary Estes.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>General Assessment</p><p>This manuscript describes how two different forms of HAV, naked capsids (HAV) and quasi-enveloped virions (eHAV), enter cells. Using multiple complementary techniques (inhibitors, siRNA depletion experiments, immunofluorescence, membrane permeability assays), the authors demonstrate that both virion types enter cells primarily by clathrin- and dynamin-dependent endocytosis, facilitated by the β1 integrin. Virion entry differs in that naked HAV uncoats more rapidly in late endosomes, whereas, eHAV traffics to lysosomes in a pathway that requires the host factor ALIX. In the lysosome, the quasi-envelope of eHAV is enzymatically degraded for particle uncoating and subsequent release from the endolysosomal membrane, in a reaction that induces lysosomal permeability. The entry of both HAV forms is mechanistically different from other members of the Picornaviridae family.</p><p>Overall this is an important contribution that demonstrates that the entry pathways of naked HAV and eHAV differ in important ways, and expands our understanding of our quasi-enveloped viruses enter and infect cells.</p><p>There are no major issues that must be addressed prior to publication.</p><p>Issues for the authors' consideration:</p><p>Do the authors know if the kinetics of HAV and eHAV delivery to the late endosome and lysosome, respectively, parallel other cellular cargos? The times provided, 1-2 hrs and ~ 4hrs, seem quite long even accounting for &quot;uncoating&quot; processes, because fluid phase cargos typically reach lysosomes within 20 minutes or less. Any thoughts on why the viruses seem to be requiring longer times?</p><p>Have the authors co-infected Huh7.5 cells with both HAV and eHAV? For instance, they could detect the naked HAV using the K34C8 antibody and the eHAV with a fluorescent fixable membrane. Do they enter in the same clathrin coated pits, reach the same late endosomes? At what junction is the ALIX-based sorting taking place?</p><p>The discussion of the involvement of ALIX and the ESCRT pathway (data from Figure 2) is confusing. ESCRT proteins, including ALIX, are cytoplasmic (and are involved in sorting cargo proteins into vesicles that bud into the endosome). It is hard to imagine how these processes would affect eHAV trafficking directly, and this should be noted. It is, of course, possible that the ALIX requirement reflects changes in endosomal maturation (as is also suggested), but the discussion should be clarified to note that it is difficult to see how ALIX would come into direct contact with eHAV.</p><p>Many ESCRT-III proteins like CHMP2A have homologues (CHMP2B), and their function is often redundant. This might explain why CHMP2A knockdown has no effect.</p><p>Figures 3/4. Endocytosed eHAV capsids are still inside a membrane envelope at ~6 hpi (Figure 3D). Endocytosed eHAV capsids are stable at 4 hpi, but starting to uncoat 6 hpi (Figure 4A). Can quantitative analyses of the microscopy data determine, which step comes first, degradation of the membrane or capsid uncoating?</p><p>Figures 3E,4E: how many structures in how many cells were analyzed?</p><p>Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B: the authors state that the reduction in protein synthesis in cells infected with eHAV is comparable with cells infected with HRV14. I don't think the data really show that, especially in supplementary Figure 4B. The HRV14 effects seem to be much stronger (but the virus was quantified in a different way, which makes it difficult to compare).</p><p>The (negative) data presented in Figure 5 showing that PLA2G16 is dispensable for HAV entry could be condensed or moved to the supplements.</p><p>Figure 5E should be modified to show naked HAV going to late endosomes. How naked HAV escapes these endosomes also remains unclear and that could be discussed in more depth. This paper currently focuses more on the quasi-enveloped virus.</p><p>Abstract and elsewhere in the manuscript: the authors state that eHAV virions enter cells via a distinct endocytic pathway. However, this language could be clarified since the general entry pathway (β1-integrin-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis seems to be similar (and perhaps identical, albeit with differences in the mode of β1-integrin binding), and the major differences seem to be when (and perhaps how) naked HAV and eHAV exit the endolysosomal compartments.</p><p>It would be helpful if the authors could comment on the purity of the preparations of naked HAV versus eHAV? While these different preparations gave unique results (and the earlier results in their initial Nature paper show that the two species can be well separated on an iodixanol gradient), it would be helpful if information on how the preparations used in this study were characterized.</p><p>Some data suggest that poliovirus expands as part of the entry process. Is it possible this is also true for HAV and does it merit discussion?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43983.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Issues for the authors' consideration:</p><p>Do the authors know if the kinetics of HAV and eHAV delivery to the late endosome and lysosome, respectively, parallel other cellular cargos?

We have not done formal comparative studies with fluid phase cargos, but we agree that the intracellular trafficking of hepatoviruses to their destination is likely to be slower. However, it might not be much slower than for other viruses. We found both HAV and eHAV capsid antigen were associated with Rab7a<sup>+</sup> compartments by 1-2 hrs, and that 4 hrs were required for eHAV to reach LAMP1<sup>+</sup> and VAMP8<sup>+</sup> lysosomes. By contrast, in carefully done kinetic studies, R.M. Mingo et al. (J Virol 89:2931, 2015) reported that 1-2 hrs were required for Ebola virus (EBOV) and SARS coronavirus virus-like particles (VLPs) to reach NPC1<sup>+</sup> late endolysosomes. In addition, M. Huttenen et al. reported that coxsackievirus A9 (like HAV, a picornavirus) did not uncoat in neutral multivesicular endosomes until about 2 hrs postinfection (J Virol 88:5138, 2014). We have no good explanation for why the trafficking of hepatoviruses might be somewhat slower than these other viruses. It is not a phenomenon specific to the hepatocyte-derived cells we used, as many of the results in this manuscript were reproduced in HeLa and U2OS cells with similar kinetics (data not shown). It is possible that hepatoviruses engage atypical sorting signals or must undergo specific modifications during trafficking that impact their sorting kinetics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors co-infected Huh7.5 cells with both HAV and eHAV?

At what junction is the ALIX-based sorting taking place?</p></disp-quote><p>Whether eHAV and HAV enter into the same clathrin-coated pits is an interesting question. We believe this is likely, but we have not formally demonstrated it. The experiments we report in the manuscript were done in parallel with the two virion types, and the cells were fixed and processed at almost identical times. Under these conditions, the initial steps in endosomal trafficking were indistinguishable for naked HAV and quasi-enveloped eHAV. Both the degree and kinetic of co-localization of capsid with clathrin, integrin β1, and the endosomal markers were similar for HAV and eHAV in multiple independent experiments, suggesting to us that they undergo endocytosis through similar clathrin-coated pits and travel through the same early/late endosomes – despite the fact that the specific ligands involved on the virion surfaces must be different. We did carry out the experiment suggested here involving co-infection of cells with gradient-purified naked HAV and PKH26-labelled eHAV virions. However, our ability to interpret the results of the experiment was confounded by our inability to absolutely distinguish between naked virions and eHAV particles that had lost their membrane due to the saponin treatment. (This was not an issue in the experiments shown in Figure 3D,E, in which we quantified only PKH26<sup>+</sup> versus PKH26<sup>-</sup> HAV puncta co-localizing with LAMP1, since naked HAV never trafficked to lysosomes.) With regard to the second part of this question, our data suggest that the ALIX-dependent sorting of eHAV to the lysosome diverges from trafficking of the naked virion at the late endosome stage. Naked HAV uncoats in the late endosome, but eHAV requires further trafficking. A simple, speculative explanation for this is that an essential receptor that binds to and acts as a trigger to initiate uncoating of the capsid is expressed in late, but not early endosomes, and that the naked particle uncoats when it first encounters it. The membrane occluding the capsid in the eHAV virion precludes this trigger from interacting with the capsid until eHAV has trafficked all the way to lysosomes, and the membrane is degraded by the actions of lysosomal acid lipase and NPC1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The discussion of the involvement of ALIX and the ESCRT pathway (data from Figure 2) is confusing.

We have modified the Discussion to state that “ALIX mediates sorting of eHAV to the lysosome prior to degradation of its membrane, and thus promotes the entry process at a point during which the VP2 YPX<sub>3</sub>L motifs are occluded by the quasi-envelope, and moreover are within the lumen of the endosome and not available to interact with cytoplasmic ALIX. Rather than a direct interaction with the virus, the requirement for ALIX in eHAV entry is more likely to reflect a role for the ESCRT-associated protein in maturation and trafficking of the late endosome, akin to its role in entry of human papillomavirus and arenaviruses (Gräßel et al., 2016; Pasqual et al., 2011).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Many ESCRT-III proteins like CHMP2A have homologues (CHMP2B), and their function is often redundant. This might explain why CHMP2A knockdown has no effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that functional redundancy among ESCRT-III homologs could explain the apparent lack of a requirement for these proteins. However, the degree of CHMP2A mRNA depletion was substantially less than that we were able to achieve with siRNAs targeting ALIX (see Figure 2—figure supplement 5). We have modified the text in the Results section to mention both of these possibilities. It is interesting to note, however, that we have previously observed that depleting CHMP2A alone, as done here, resulted in a ~70% reduction in the release of quasi-enveloped eHAV from infected cells (McKnight et al., 2017).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3/4. Endocytosed eHAV capsids are still inside a membrane envelope at ~6 hpi (Figure 3D). Endocytosed eHAV capsids are stable at 4 hpi, but starting to uncoat 6 hpi (Figure 4A). Can quantitative analyses of the microscopy data determine, which step comes first, degradation of the membrane or capsid uncoating?</p></disp-quote><p>Degradation of the eHAV membrane and uncoating of the capsid appear to occur in close linkage temporally and we do not believe that it is possible to identify which comes first with any degree of confidence from imaging data alone. However, we did observe PKH26-negative puncta labelled with capsid antibody that colocalize with LAMP1 at ~8 hrs (Figure 3D), consistent with eHAV particles that have lost their membrane within the lysosome but retain an intact capsid. Rarely did we observe the opposite, PKH-positive puncta colocalizing with LAMP1 but not labeled with capsid antibody – and when these were observed it was not possible to distinguish them from nonspecific exosomes. Other, orthogonal data suggest strongly that membrane decay precedes uncoating of the eHAV capsid. We know from prior studies that the capsid (VP1pX specifically) is protected from proteinase K digestion when it is within the quasi-enveloped virion (Feng et al., 2013). Yet, anti-capsid antibodies quite potently neutralize eHAV infectivity within an endosomal compartment when added to cell cultures as late as 4 hrs post-infection – and even later when lysosomal acid lipase is inhibited (see Figure 3F). The simplest explanation reconciling these observations is that the eHAV membrane degrades prior to uncoating, allowing neutralizing antibody access to the capsid. If uncoating were to occur prior to membrane decay, we would not expect antibody to neutralize intracellular virus at a time consistent with lysosomal localization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures 3E, 4E: how many structures in how many cells were analyzed?</p></disp-quote><p>For Figure 3E, we analyzed an average of 17.7 (DMSO) to 20.0 (Lalistat-2) structures per cell in each of 7 cells for each condition. These values are now included in the Figure 3-source data 1 file. The ratio (PKH26<sup>+</sup>/PKH26<sup>-</sup>) calculated for each individual cell is plotted in the figure. For Figure 4E, the number of dextran<sup>+</sup> compartments in each cell is plotted on the y-axis, and ranged from a mean of 14.0 (mock-infected cells at 6 hrs) to 0.8 (eHAV-infected cells at 12 hrs). Seven to 10 cells were analyzed in each condition; the values for each cell are plotted individually in the figure and are included in the Figure 4—source data 1 file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D and Figure 4—figure supplement 1B: the authors state that the reduction in protein synthesis in cells infected with eHAV is comparable with cells infected with HRV14. I don't think the data really show that, especially in supplementary Figure 4B. The HRV14 effects seem to be much stronger (but the virus was quantified in a different way, which makes it difficult to compare).</p></disp-quote><p>We certainly agree, as this is what our quantification in Figure 4D demonstrated (~40% reduced with HAV vs. ~60% reduced with HRV14), and we also agree that comparing between the two virus types is complicated technically. We have modified the text, and now describe the eHAV effect as “similar but not as strong” as rhinovirus 14. Importantly, as we describe in the manuscript, we saw reductions in protein synthesis only with eHAV and never with naked HAV in the ribotoxin assays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The (negative) data presented in Figure 5 showing that PLA2G16 is dispensable for HAV entry could be condensed or moved to the supplements.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect, we disagree with this particular suggestion. Staring et al. (Nature, 541:412, 2017) recently identified PLA2G16 as a pan-picornaviral host factor required for successful transfer of the genomic RNA to the cytoplasm for translation of viral proteins following uncoating of endocytosed virus. Our data showing that PLA2G16 is NOT required during entry of either eHAV or HAV, and acts instead to restrict replication of the viral RNA distinguishes hepatoviral entry from entry of other picornaviruses. While somewhat philosophical, we consider these data to be positive (not negative), as they are indicative of an important biological difference in these viruses. Pharmacological agents targeting the role of PLA2G16 in enteroviral infections are currently being developed (Patent WO 2015/018797A3 Antiviral Compounds), enhancing the importance of this distinction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5E should be modified to show naked HAV going to late endosomes. How naked HAV escapes these endosomes also remains unclear and that could be discussed in more depth. This paper currently focuses more on the quasi-enveloped virus.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified Figure 5E as suggested, and also have expanded our discussion of the uncoating of the naked virion in the penultimate paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract and elsewhere in the manuscript: the authors state that eHAV virions enter cells via a distinct endocytic pathway. However, this language could be clarified since the general entry pathway (β1-integrin-dependent clathrin-mediated endocytosis seems to be similar (and perhaps identical, albeit with differences in the mode of β1-integrin binding), and the major differences seem to be when (and perhaps how) naked HAV and eHAV exit the endolysosomal compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree, and have modified the Abstract and the introductory paragraph of the Discussion to reflect that the early steps in entry of both virion types are quite similar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful if the authors could comment on the purity of the preparations of naked HAV versus eHAV? While these different preparations gave unique results (and the earlier results in their initial Nature paper show that the two species can be well separated on an iodixanol gradient), it would be helpful if information on how the preparations used in this study were characterized.</p></disp-quote><p>As described in the Materials and methods section, purified populations of quasi-enveloped and naked, nonenveloped hepatoviruses were generated by preparative isopycnic density gradient centrifugation using a protocol nearly identical to that described previously (Feng et al., 2013). Similar and unequivocal results were obtained using multiple batches of virus prepared in this fashion. The two populations of virions are separated at a very high level of resolution, with essentially no quasi-enveloped virus present in the high density, naked virus fractions. Loss of the membrane from purified eHAV virions, generating naked virus, is always a concern, but eHAV is quite stable under storage conditions. The 7-8 log<sub>10</sub> difference we observed in immediate post-entry neutralization of HAV versus eHAV (Figure 3E, 1 h timepoints) provides strong assurance of the purity of the stocks generated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some data suggest that poliovirus expands as part of the entry process. Is it possible this is also true for HAV and does it merit discussion?</p></disp-quote><p>We now mention this in the Discussion (modified penultimate paragraph). There is simply not enough known about the process of HAV uncoating to predict whether its capsid also undergoes the irreversible expansion seen with poliovirus following interactions with its receptor. We have further modified the Discussion to point out some of the salient differences in the structures of these two picornaviruses that might be relevant to uncoating.</p></body></sub-article></article>
