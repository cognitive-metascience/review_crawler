At the core of this amazing capacity lie tissues called meristems, which are found at the growing tips of all plants. Meristems contain dividing stem cells.

To orchestrate this diversity, complex signalling systems have evolved to guide stem cell differentiation based on hard-wired developmental programs and environmental signals (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">[Pfeiffer et al., 2017</xref>]). Plants represent particularly attractive models to study the molecular mechanisms underlying the transition from stem cell to differentiated cell fate: Firstly, plants employ a postembryonic mode of development, which is based on the continuous activity of pluripotent stem cells embedded in specialized tissues, called meristems. Secondly, plant development is modular and thus the same set of organs is initiated repeatedly from a stem cell system, greatly facilitating in vivo analysis of cell-decision-making. Thirdly, due to the encasement by a cell wall, plant cells are immobile and thus their identity is determined by position, rather than lineage and can change multiple times during their development until terminal differentiation.</p><p>In the shoot apical meristem (SAM), the stem cell system responsible for the generation of all above ground structures, two major fate transitions can be identified: From stem cells in the central zone (CZ) to transit amplifying cells in the peripheral zone (PZ) and further on into organ primordia, which will give rise to fully differentiated lateral structures, such as leaves or flowers (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaillochet et al., 2015</xref>]). At the molecular level, cell fate trajectories are instructed by an intertwined communication system between local transcriptional networks and non-cell autonomous phytohormone signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leibfried et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schoof et al., 2000</xref>). Stem cell fate in the SAM is dependent on the homeodomain transcription factor WUSCHEL (WUS), whose RNA is expressed in the organising centre (OC), located below the stem cells. WUS protein moves apically through plasmodesmata into the overlying cells, where it is required to maintain stem cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yadav et al., 2011</xref>). Stem cells in turn express CLAVATA3 (CLV3), a short, secreted peptide that acts to limit <italic>WUS</italic> expression via the CLV1, CLV2, CORYNE (CRN), BARELY ANY MERISTEM (BAM) receptors system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bleckmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clark et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fletcher et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nimchuk et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ohyama et al., 2009</xref>). The resulting negative feedback loop represents the core module of SAM regulation and couples the size of the OC with that of the CZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brand et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schoof et al., 2000</xref>). In parallel, the KNOTTED-like homeobox transcription factor SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM) is required throughout the SAM to inhibit differentiation by stimulation of cytokinin production and repression of gibberellic acid (GA) biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jasinski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Long et al., 1996</xref>). Transcriptional and hormonal regulation interact to control SAM activity in spatially distinct sub-domains: In the centre of the SAM, WUS represses A-Type <italic>ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR</italic> (<italic>ARR</italic>) genes, which encode for negative feedback factors in cytokinin signalling. In essence, WUS acts to sensitize the cellular environment to cytokinin, which in turn promotes <italic>WUS</italic> expression thus creating a positive feedback loop that helps to establish and maintain the OC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Leibfried et al., 2005</xref>). Cytokinin also plays a key role in controlling cell proliferation in the SAM by stimulating <italic>CYCLIN D3</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Riou-Khamlichi et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>In addition to its role in integrating hormonal signals, WUS directly represses the expression of <italic>HECATE1</italic> (<italic>HEC1</italic>), which encodes a bHLH transcription factor that redundantly functions with its closest paralogs <italic>HEC2</italic> and <italic>HEC3</italic> in various developmental contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gremski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schuster et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). In line with this regulation, <italic>HEC1</italic> mRNA is expressed throughout the SAM, but excluded from the OC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). This pattern is faithfully translated into protein accumulation, since HEC1 protein displays limited intercellular movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the precise spatial control of <italic>HEC1</italic> activity by WUS is essential for SAM function, since uncoupling <italic>HEC1</italic> expression from WUS in the OC leads to SAM termination, whereas enhancing <italic>HEC1</italic> activity in stem cells leads to massive over-accumulation of these cells followed by a progressive repression of the core WUS/CLV3 feedback system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). Mechanistically, this function is mediated by the formation of a protein complex between HEC and the bHLH transcription factor SPATULA (SPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to the long term maintenance of stem cells in the centre of the SAM, lateral organ primordia are continuously initiated at the periphery and cells are guided towards differentiation in restricted domains defined by the accumulation of auxin (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Weijers and Wagner, 2016</xref>]). Local auxin signalling maxima are dynamically formed through a combination of different mechanisms that include auxin biosynthesis and the controlled intracellular polarization of the auxin transporter PIN-FORMED1 (PIN1) by the activity of the protein kinase PINOID (PID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benjamins et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pinon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Reinhardt et al., 2003</xref>). Dynamic auxin maxima are translated into robust auxin signalling output by AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR transcription factors, such as ARF5/MONOPTEROS (ARF5/MP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hardtke and Berleth, 1998</xref>). MP associates with the chromatin remodelling factors SPLAYED (SYD) and BRAHMA (BRM), forming a regulatory protein complex sufficient to promote floral fate over undifferentiated SAM fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). In addition to primordia initiation, a boundary zone (BZ), which surrounds the entire SAM like a ring is required for proper spatial separation of organs from the SAM (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Žádníková and Simon, 2014</xref>]). The BZ is dependent on the activity of the <italic>CUP SHAPED COTYLEDONS</italic> (<italic>CUC</italic>) and <italic>LATERAL ORGANFUSION</italic> (<italic>LOF</italic>) genes and loss of their function results in extensive fusions of lateral organs with the active SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aida et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gaillochet et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, the activity of the central domain of the SAM is tightly coupled with the specification of lateral organs at the periphery by inter-domain communication systems. First, MP relays auxin signals to the core <italic>WUS/CLV3</italic> feedback loop by negatively regulating <italic>ARR7</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhao et al., 2010</xref>). Second, organ primordia produce the short peptide CLE27, which signals in the centre of the SAM through AtFEA3 and represses <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Je et al., 2016</xref>). As a consequence of these multiple regulatory loops, the rate of lateral organ initiation correlates with the size of the SAM and larger SAMs tend to produce more organs per unit of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Landrein et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the intertwined nature of the regulatory feedbacks, and their spatio-temporal deployment, the interpretation of the outcome for a particular regulatory interaction may not be intuitive. To overcome this limitation, several studies have used an iterative approach combining experimental quantifications and computational modelling that allowed to predict and reveal new regulatory nodes mediating SAM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Besnard et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chickarmane et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>From a dynamic point of view, cells produced in the central stem cell domain are continuously displaced towards the periphery by the divisions of cells located more centrally until they are incorporated into an organ primordium and finally differentiate. Hence, they undergo two major fate transitions: First, the transition from a slowly dividing stem cell to a more rapidly dividing transit amplifying cell and second, the transition from a non-committed amplifying cell to primordium cell by passing the peripheral zone. Despite the identification of key regulators controlling shoot stem cell activity, and patterning different domains of the SAM, our current understanding of how cell fate progression is modulated remains largely elusive. We used an integrated approach combining live-cell imaging, computational modelling and genome-wide profiling to show that <italic>HEC</italic> function modulates the stepwise fate transition from CZ cell to PZ and from PZ to lateral organ cell fate by coordinating the balance between cytokinin and auxin responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>HECATE genes regulate cell fate transition at the SAM</title><p>In order to dynamically trace cell-behaviour at the SAM, we established an image analysis pipeline that allows identification and quantification of cells within specific sub-domains of the SAM. When we applied this tool to plants that lack <italic>HEC</italic> function (<italic>hec1,2,3</italic> triple mutants), we found that their SAMs were smaller and displayed a reduced cell number, in line with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>).

To discriminate between these scenarios, we developed a novel imaging tool combining a fluorescent timer protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Subach et al., 2009</xref>) driven from a cell cycle dependent promoter (<italic>pKNOLLE:fast-mFluorescentTimer-NLS)</italic> with an ubiquitously and homogeneously expressed GFP (<italic>pUBQ10:3xGFP-NLS</italic>). The timer protein was exclusively expressed during cytokinesis and then slowly matured from a blue form to a form that exhibits red fluorescence. Therefore, the ratio of the fading blue to stable green signal could be used as a readout for time passed since the last division, allowing us to assess the age of cells and thus served as a proxy for division frequency. Interestingly, we observed that although the SAM expanded, cell division activity after stem cell specific induction of <italic>HEC1</italic> was decreased at the centre of the SAM and mostly confined to the PZ as in mock-treated plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>; Materials and methods section). This demonstrated that <italic>HEC1</italic> did not locally promote stem cell division. In contrast, we observed an increase in the mitotic index of the PZ at later stages (day 3 and day 4) despite the fact that <italic>HEC1</italic> protein is largely unable to move from cell to cell, suggesting that cell proliferation in the periphery was stimulated non-cell autonomously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6C</xref>). Next, we addressed fate re-specification of early PZ cells into stem cells. To this end, we analysed the ratio between <italic>CLV3</italic> positive cells and all SAM cells after stem cell specific expression of <italic>HEC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>). Interestingly, although the number of <italic>CLV3</italic> positive cells strongly increased after dex treatment, the ratio between <italic>CLV3</italic> and all SAM cells remained essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). This argued against reprogramming of early PZ progenitor to stem cells by <italic>HEC1</italic>, but rather supported the idea of coordinated cell behaviour in CZ and PZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">5</xref>). Taken together, these two lines of experiments excluded that cell proliferation in the CZ or re-specification of early PZ cells were the main drivers of <italic>HEC1</italic>-mediated meristem expansion and left us with a model in which <italic>HEC1</italic> activity would locally inhibit the transition from stem cell to PZ fate, giving rise to a larger stem cell domain and consequently to an enlarged shoot meristem.</p><p>This idea was in line with the <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> mutant phenotype and suggested that in these plants, stem cells would transit more quickly from stem cell to PZ fate and further on to organ fate.

Although the resulting CZ and total SAM cells number fitted our experimental measurements, the cumulated number of primordia did not increase as observed in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Thus, we further tested the impact of modulating the primordia initiation rate on SAM cell behaviour. By combining an increased CZ to PZ transition with an increased primordia initiation rate, our simulations could reproduce experimental measurements for the number of CZ cells, SAM cells and for the cumulated number of lateral organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Furthermore, these model simulations predicted that increasing initiation rate would lead to a larger number of unseparated organ primordia at any given point in time, which could experimentally be tested by assessing the number of auxin output maxima as a proxy. Therefore, we introduced the auxin output reporter <italic>pDR5v2:3xYFP-NLS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liao et al., 2015</xref>) into the <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> triple mutant and quantified the number of auxin output maxima (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). However, in contrast to the model prediction, we did not observe a major increase in the number of DR5 positive domains in SAMs of <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> compared to wild type (5.25 in wild type; 5.70 in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic>; n &gt; 16)(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>´´´). While the difference was statistically significant, it was substantially smaller than predicted by the model and insufficient to explain the increase in organ formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Hence, we needed to test additional factors in our model for their contribution to the <italic>hec</italic> loss-of-function phenotype. Having experimentally assessed the contribution of organ initiation rate in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> now allowed us to fix this important parameter for wild type and mutant plants and to further explore the parameter space for the time organs take to separate from the SAM after initiation. Indeed, reducing the time from initiation to separation of organs from 52 hr in wild type to 42 hr in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> combined with a slight increase in the rate of organ initiation in the mutant resulted in simulations fitting all our experimental results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Importantly, our simulations not only qualitatively captured the dynamics of <italic>HEC</italic> loss-of-function meristem but also allowed us to compute that in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic>, primordia were initiated at a 15% higher rate and separated 10 hr earlier from the SAM than in wild type, supporting the idea that <italic>HEC</italic> function modulates the dynamics of stem cell differentiation.</p><p>To further test our model, we next simulated <italic>HEC1</italic> gain-of-function experiments in the CZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).

On the other hand, delaying CZ to PZ transition only, increasing the proliferation rate in the PZ only or introducing a re-specification of PZ cells into CZ cells did not reproduce our in vivo data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B–E</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, applying reiterative cycles of experimentation and modelling allowed us to derive a quantitative framework of <italic>HEC</italic> function in the SAM.

Interestingly, auxin response elements (ARE), the DNA cis-regulatory motifs targeted by ARF transcription factors to regulate auxin dependent gene expression, were also significantly over-represented under HEC1 peaks (ARE, E-value = 5.0 e-61). In contrast, GARP elements, bound by type B-ARRs, the cytokinin output transcription factors, were only mildly enriched (E-value = 2.4 e-2), which suggested a specific association between HEC1 and the promoter of auxin responsive genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hosoda et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). To investigate the relevance of these interactions for meristem regulation, we analysed the promoters of all ARF and Aux-IAA factors expressed in the SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vernoux et al., 2011</xref>). Strikingly, we found that HEC1 bound to 23 out of 25 promoters of auxin signalling components known to be active in the SAM, a rate significantly higher than expected by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Consistently, we observed that G-boxes and AREs found in HEC1 binding regions were significantly more closely spaced than expected from their relative positions across the whole genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Along these lines, we found that the most frequently occurring distance between G-Boxes and AREs in HEC1 binding regions was less than 50 bp and in immediate proximity to the peak summit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Examples for a promoter that exhibited such a close distance of HEC and ARF binding sites included the regulatory region of the auxin receptor <italic>TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESPONSE 1</italic> (<italic>TIR1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gray et al., 2001</xref>), (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, we found a significant enrichment of HEC1-regulated genes carrying an ARE and a G-box in their promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G–I</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that HEC1 and ARFs bind to the same genomic regions, either in competition, independently, or as a complex.</p><p>Given the strong but slow negative effect of HEC1 on auxin transcriptional output, we hypothesised that HEC1 could interfere with the positive feedback in auxin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>) either by binding site competition or direct physical interaction with ARFs. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the potential for interaction between HEC transcription factors and MP, the key ARF orchestrating primordia initiation at the SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yamaguchi et al., 2013</xref>). Both Yeast-2-Hybrid and Bimolecular-Fluorescence Complementation assays robustly demonstrated a physical interaction between MP and HEC1, HEC2, or HEC3, respectively and thus suggested that HEC factors could act as transcriptional modifiers for ARF activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Simonini et al., 2016</xref>). In line with these results, HEC1 and HEC2, as well as their key cofactor SPATULA (SPT) were able to physically interact with BRAHMA in Yeast-two-Hybrid assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Efroni et al., 2013</xref>).

To test this, we performed RNA-seq on micro-dissected shoot apices 14 hr after dex induction of <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> plants. In contrast to the set of early targets, we found that transcript levels of essential components for primordia initiation, such as MP itself, but also PID, a kinase required for proper polar localisation of PIN auxin transporters, were substantially reduced in this dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). In line with this finding, we observed a dramatic decrease in MP-GFP protein accumulation at the boundary zone after HEC1 induction in this domain, demonstrating the relevance of this interaction in the SAM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, the expression of the YUCCA auxin biosynthetic genes required for flower primordia formation was not affected by HEC1, suggesting that HEC factors likely do not work via the modulation of auxin production (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with the decrease of MP-GFP accumulation and the global collapse of auxin output observed by DR5v2, we found that PIN1-GFP polarity was severely disturbed after <italic>HEC1</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). In contrast, PIN1-GFP expression levels remained stable or even increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>). Consistently, the activity of the R2D2 auxin input sensor was also changed and domains of low auxin perception, usually restricted to the boundaries of the SAM, expanded substantially towards the centre of the SAM over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To test whether these dramatic alterations in auxin signalling caused by <italic>HEC1</italic> also translated into stable modifications of cell fate, we analysed the expression of the boundary zone marker <italic>CUC2</italic> after <italic>HEC1</italic> stimulation, since the boundary is marked by a small, but stable local auxin minimum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). In line with the idea that <italic>HEC1</italic> potently interfered with cell fate decisions at the periphery by disruption of localized auxin signalling, we found a massive expansion of <italic>pCUC2:3xGFP-NLS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8I–J</xref>).</p><p>The slow effect of HEC1 on the auxin input and output patterns in the SAM and the absence of auxin biosynthetic and signalling components among the direct targets were consistent with the hypothesis that HEC1 may interfere with auxin signalling via its positive feedback loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>). To test this more directly, we aimed at establishing epistasis between the auxin signalling system and HEC activity by using recent evidence that auxin can promote the expression of MP and PIN1, which in turn leads to a stabilization of the signalling system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Heisler et al., 2005</xref>). Therefore, we stimulated auxin signalling by chemical treatment while at the same time boosting <italic>HEC1</italic> expression and scored for expression of a key auxin signalling component, as well as for SAM phenotypes over time. In line with our RNA-seq data, we observed a significant reduction of <italic>MP</italic> expression 24 hr after HEC1 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). However, co-treatment with auxin rescued MP mRNA expression levels, indicating that our approach to stabilize the auxin feedback system was successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We next analysed the phenotypic outcome of this double perturbation. Strikingly, although <italic>pCUC2:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> and <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> inductions alone inhibited primordia initiation, auxin co-treatment suppressed this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Importantly, this suppression was neither the result of reduction of the key cofactor SPT, nor from the inhibition of <italic>CUC2</italic> promoter activity driving HEC1-linker-GR, further supporting that auxin acts downstream of HEC function during primordia initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30135.035</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Auxin feedback stabilization suppresses HEC function at the SAM periphery.</title><p>(<bold>A–B</bold>) Relative expression of <italic>MP</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>SPT</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) 24 hr after <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> induction (M/M: mock/mock, N/M: NAA/mock, M/D: mock/dex, N/D: NAA/dex) (<bold>C–E</bold>) Representative views of <italic>pCUC2:HEC-linker-GR </italic>SAMs four days after mock/mock (<bold>C</bold>) mock/dex (<bold>D</bold>) or NAA/dex (<bold>E</bold>) treatment.

Since plant cell fate is strictly determined by position, the timing of cellular transitions is intrinsic to the system under stable and optimal growth conditions. However, under changing environments, the regulatory system needs to adapt the morphogenetic output to the available resources, while at the same time conserving the functional pattern of the SAM (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pfeiffer et al., 2017</xref>]). Thus, we hypothesized that <italic>HEC</italic> genes could contribute to the modulation of SAM activity and growth in response to the environment. To test this hypothesis, we challenged the nutritional status of wild type and <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> mutants by shifting plants for 14 days to low light conditions (15 µmol m<sup>−2</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) just after bolting and assessed developmental responses at the SAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In line with previous studies, we observed that wild type plants displayed a substantially smaller SAM under low light conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2017</xref>), and additionally observed a three-fold reduction in cytokinin responses compared to plants grown under normal light intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A,C,E,F,H,J</xref>). Importantly, this reduction in the SAM size did not result from changes in cell size, suggesting that meristematic activity was reduced in these plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>). In contrast to wild type, we did not observe significant changes in the size of SAMs in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> plants under low light, demonstrating that <italic>HEC</italic> genes are required for SAM adaptation to environmental changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B,D,E</xref>). Interestingly, even in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic>, cytokinin signalling was responsive to nutritional status and we observed a decreased TCSn reporter activity similar to wild type plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10F–J</xref>). This suggested that cytokinin signalling and SAM size might be uncoupled in the <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> mutants.

Using precise spatio-temporal perturbations of gene expression, quantitative live-cell imaging and computational modelling, we revealed that HECATE bHLH transcription factors modulate cell fate transitions and coordinate the dynamics of cell fate decisions across key developmental domains of the SAM by balancing cytokinin and auxin phytohormonal signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>).</p><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30135.042</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Theoretical model depicting HEC activity controlling cellular fate transition in the SAM by modulating the auxin-cytokinin phytohormonal balance and integrating environmental signals.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-30135-fig11-v4"/></fig><p>In contrast to our earlier findings where using steady state end-point phenotypes we concluded that HEC function act partially independently of the WUS/CLV3 system and repress cytokinin signalling by promoting type-A ARRs expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>), we now show that <italic>HEC</italic> function in the centre of the SAM not only interferes with the core <italic>WUS/CLV3</italic> regulatory system, but also promotes the enlargement of the OC, CZ and the cytokinin signalling domain. These contradicting results can be reconciled by considering the dynamics of HEC function. Early HEC activity promotes CLV3, WUS and cytokinin domain expansion and consequently elevates type-A ARR expression, which are primary targets of cytokinin signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bhargava et al., 2013</xref>). In turn, A-type ARRs act as negative regulators of cytokinin signalling and constitute a negative feedback dampening <italic>WUS</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, the additive regulation of SAM size by <italic>HEC</italic> and <italic>WUS</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>), together with the ability of HEC1 to ectopically promote cytokinin signalling in the root meristem, where <italic>WUS</italic> is not expressed, suggests that <italic>HEC</italic> function primarily acts on cytokinin signalling at the SAM and in turn promotes <italic>WUS</italic> expression. However, given the indirect regulation of both <italic>WUS</italic> and cytokinin, it will be important in future studies to further clarify the network topology and to identify the intermediate regulatory components mediating <italic>HEC</italic> regulatory function.</p><p>These results highlighted the power of time resolved analyses coupled to transient perturbations in studying the SAM, which now allowed us to discriminate direct from indirect effects arising as a consequence of feedback mechanisms. Since traditional loss-of-function mutations are inherently stable and thus do not lend themselves to this type of approach, we employed computational modelling to test divergent regulatory scenarios, which could not be analysed experimentally. The model not only allowed us to identify processes that were sufficient to explain the experimental observations, but also helped to rule out alternative hypotheses, such as stem cell re-specification, for which simulations could not reproduce in vivo data. Modelling and experimentation suggested that the combination of a reduced stem cell system with increased organ initiation rate observed in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> triple mutants likely was caused by a faster differentiation of stem cells. This occurred at least two levels, namely an increased rate of primordia initiation, as well as a reduced time for the primordium to grow and separate from the SAM.</p><p>While the regulation of cell fate transition dynamics has not received much attention in the plant field with the exception of the stomatal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Simmons and Bergmann, 2016</xref>), a large body of work from animal model systems has addressed this issue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Busch et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maduro, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marciniak-Czochra et al., 2009</xref>). It has emerged that cells within a developmental lineage undergo specific phenotypic steps on their trajectory towards terminal differentiation, however whether fate decisions occur deterministically or rather stochastically is still unresolved and might strongly depend on the cell type and the developmental context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moris et al., 2016</xref>). Given the purely position-dependent fate regulation observed in plant shoots, cells do not progress along a deterministic cell fate trajectory, but rather acquire alternative identities until they reach their final position in an organ and fully differentiate accordingly. Consequently, the transition from stem cell to transit-amplifying cell and further on to primordium founder cell mainly pertains to a timing of differentiation rather than providing intrinsic information on final cell fate. We have found that HEC transcription factors act in accordance with this idea and modulate the relative speed of the successive cell fate transitions at the SAM rather than specifying a specific developmental outcome.</p><p>Previous theoretical studies on plant stem cell systems have focused on pattern formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chickarmane et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Espinosa-Soto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Robinson et al., 2011b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yadav et al., 2013</xref>), morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kierzkowski et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kuchen et al., 2012</xref>) or cell division behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Louveaux et al., 2016</xref>), and only few studies investigated how local signals can coordinate the growth of different functional domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grieneisen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mähönen et al., 2014</xref>). While lacking 3-dimensional resolution for the sake of simplicity, our 2D cell population model has allowed us to provide a theoretical framework on how fate decision events are coordinated along stem cell differentiation trajectories and how affecting key transition checkpoints during this process quantitatively modulates dynamics of the stem cell system.</p><p>In line with a multi-step model, we previously showed that <italic>HEC1</italic> is expressed in all relevant domains of the SAM and that its expression is under direct control of WUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, in addition to specifying stem cell fate, WUS may play an additional role in facilitating the transition from CZ to PZ fate via transcriptional repression of <italic>HEC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Using local modulation of HEC activity, and given the low HEC1 protein mobility in the SAM, we also revealed that HEC factors do not promote cell proliferation locally but rather non-cell autonomously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Daum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, these changes in cell behaviour were reminiscent of the increased PZ cell number observed after local perturbation of the <italic>WUS/CLV3</italic> feedback system in the CZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Reddy and Meyerowitz, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yadav et al., 2010</xref>). Although the mechanisms responsible for the communication between CZ and PZ are still unresolved, the convergence of <italic>HEC</italic> and <italic>WUS</italic> function in controlling cytokinin signalling, and its role in promoting cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Riou-Khamlichi et al., 1999</xref>), points towards a potential function of cytokinin signalling in mediating this inter-domain communication.</p><p>In addition to their role in regulating cytokinin, we found that HEC proteins modulate the auxin regulatory loop. One mechanism, which could be responsible for this effect, could be the physical interaction with the auxin response factor MP. MP plays a central role in stabilizing the auxin feedback system via non-cell autonomous control of PIN1 polarity towards the site of MP accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>). This self-reinforcing regulatory system dynamically builds auxin maxima and generates sites of high MP accumulation which subsequently trigger a switch to primordia fate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatia et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, protein-protein interaction data suggest that HEC1, HEC2 and SPT physically interact with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling ATPase BRAHMA (BRM), which also operates in a protein complex with MP during primordia initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 2015</xref>). Although the mechanistic details of their interaction still remain elusive, we propose that the HEC-SPT complex could modify MP-BRM function by direct physical interaction and thereby could modulate the dynamics of the entire auxin feedback system. Consistently, a reduction of <italic>HEC</italic> function would result in increased MP-BRM activity, which in turn enhances the auxin feedback system to instruct the initiation of flower primordia at a higher rate. Alternatively, HEC-SPT complex could indirectly regulate the expression of key components of the auxin feedback system, independently of the physical interaction with MP or locally reduce the levels of available auxin. Both models could explain the fairly slow, progressive changes observed in the dynamics of auxin perception, transport and response after promoting <italic>HEC</italic> activity at the periphery of the SAM. It will therefore be important in the future to mechanistically dissect the function of the physical interaction between HEC factors and MP-BRM complex to further reveal how HEC function impacts on the auxin feedback dynamics.</p><p>Similarly to the shoot stem cell system, the balance between auxin and cytokinin is essential to control the dynamics of stem cell differentiation at the root apical meristem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Di Mambro et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dello Ioio et al., 2008</xref>). Our finding that HEC function can ectopically shift this hormonal balance and can impact on the dynamics of RAM differentiation suggests that plant cells can read out hormonal inputs and integrate this information to specify their identity along their differentiation trajectory. Along the same lines, auxin and cytokinin are essential for several aspects of cambial activity, including restriction of stem cell fate, cambial cell proliferation, and xylem differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhalerao and Fischer, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brackmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hejatko et al., 2009</xref>). However, in this context, the exact function of individual hormones on the progression of cell fate acquisition and the nature of their interaction still remains elusive.</p><p>In addition to the integration of hormonal and transcriptional signals to control cell fate decisions, the SAM adjusts its activity in response to environmental signals including light or nutritional status (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Pfeiffer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2017</xref>). Although this dynamic process is crucial to understand the molecular basis for plant developmental plasticity, the regulatory network mediating SAM homeostasis remains poorly characterized. Our findings that HEC function is required to adjust SAM size in response to low light suggests that it defines a regulatory hub in integrating environmental cues at the SAM. It will be important to further characterize the molecular mechanism underpinning this response and to unravel how HEC function interact with light signalling components during SAM activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhu et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, it will be important in the future to systematically test the role of known stem cell regulators and assess their regulatory function in the SAM upon various environmental challenges including temperature, nutrients, light intensity or biotic interactions. These experiments could reveal the mechanisms of developmental plasticity and how the regulatory landscape of the shoot stem cell system adjusts and rewires in response to the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cloning </title><p><italic>pCLV3:HEC1-linker-GR</italic>, <italic>pCUC2:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> and <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> constructs were generated by ligation of HEC1 coding sequence (CDS) with a 33 aa Serine-Glycin linker and GR tag into pDONOR221 vector and recombined in pGreenIIs constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Schuster et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>pKNOLLE:fast-mFluorescentTimer-NLS</italic> was generated from fast m-FluorescentTimer CDS fused to N7 NLS and introduced by subsequent BP and LR reactions (Thermo Fischer Scientist, Waltham, Massachusetts, USA) in a pGreenIIs vector containing 2.1 kb of genomic sequence upstream of the <italic>KNOLLE</italic> start codon.

For each G-box, the closest ARE in open chromatin was next detected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Distances were reported using bedtools ‘closest’ function and histograms were constructed using R (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.r-project.org/">https://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>).</p><p>To assess the percentage of HEC1 target genes carrying G-box, ARE or both and the distribution of these motifs in open chromatin regions, respective bed files were first used to generate lists of annotated genes using the homer function ‘annotate.peaks.pl’. List of genes regulated by HEC1 (p&lt;0.05) were next used and intersected with the list of genes carrying G-box, ARE or both in open chromatin regions using Microsoft Excel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). Significance tests were performed using two-sided Fisher's exact test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Computational modelling</title><p>We developed a cell population model that takes into account the simplified geometry of the SAM. The model describes the evolution in time of different SAM structures, i.e., CZ, incipient primordia and unspecified PZ cells. Cells are continuously displaced towards the periphery by the divisions of cells more centrally located, with cells located at the outer boundary of the CZ transiting to PZ, depending on local WUS concentrations. Incipient primordia are initiated near the central boundary of the PZ and primordia separate from the meristem at fixed time after their initiation. PZ cells that do not contribute to primordia contribute to longitudinal growth of the plant. The following key processes were considered: (i) proliferation of cells in CZ and PZ, (ii) fate transition from the CZ to the PZ and from the PZ to the organs, (iii) initiation of incipient primordia, (iv) separation of primordia from the meristem and (v) contribution of meristem cells to longitudinal growth.</p><p>Different feedbacks were included in the model. As suggested by our in vivo data, the initiation frequency of incipient primordia and the transition from the CZ to the PZ, both depend on the CZ cell number. The model is formulated using a system of ordinary differential equations, which number may vary in time. A detailed description of the model is found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Che-Yang Liao and Dolf Weijers for sharing R2D2 and DR5v2 reporters before publication, David Ibbersson and the CellNetworks sequencing core facility for conducting next-generation sequencing and Christoph Schuster for helpful discussions.</p></ack><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Investigation, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Writing—original draft, Writing—review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30135.043</object-id><label>Supplementary file 1:</label><caption><title>ChIPseq, RNAseq and QRT-PCR analyses</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30135-supp1-v4.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30135.044</object-id><label>Supplementary file 2:</label><caption><title>List of oligonucleotides</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30135-supp2-v4.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30135.045</object-id><label>Supplementary file 3:</label><caption><title>Description of computational model</title></caption><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-30135-supp3-v4.pdf"/></supplementary-material><sec id="s7" sec-type="datasets"><title>Major datasets</title><p>The following dataset was generated:</p><p><related-object content-type="generated-dataset" id="dataset1" source-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94311" source-id-type="uri"><collab collab-type="author">Gaillochet C</collab><collab collab-type="author">Lohmann JU</collab><year>2017</year><source>Control of plant cell fate transitions by transcriptional and hormonal signals</source><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94311">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE94311</ext-link><comment>Publicly available at the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (accession no.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors’ note: a previous version of this study was rejected after peer review, but the authors submitted for reconsideration. The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Control of plant cell fate transitions by transcriptional and hormonal signals&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that this version of your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers thought the work was well written and interesting, and the experiments performed were of high technical quality. However, all three felt that current data are not sufficient to draw the conclusions made and that alternative interpretations could lead to other explanatory models. The reviewers have each made a number of suggestions for improvement and their detailed reviews are appended below.</p><p>In summary, there are several concerns that would need to be addressed to make this suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, but if the authors can provide experimental data to address these issues, the editor and reviewers strongly encourage submission of an updated manuscript. As this is likely to take more than the 2 months typical for &quot;revision&quot;, a new submission would be required, but the editors will be made aware that the submission was encouraged.</p><p>Priority concerns</p><p>1) The &quot;cell-non autonomous&quot; claim for HEC1 needs to be backed up with experimental evidence appropriate for the tissues being monitored in this study (see reviewer 2 comment 1).</p><p>2) Many claims are made using only gain of function/ectopic expression experiments that are sufficient to show that HEC family members can interfere with a normal process, but not that they normally control it. Experiments done in mutant backgrounds or by reducing HEC expression in tissue specific ways were suggested by all reviewers.</p><p>3) Work presented here contradicts previous work (Schuster et al., 2014) that concluded that HEC1 inhibits CK signaling during control of the SAM. Although the data concerning CK signaling in this new manuscript are convincing, the authors should discuss this (and other) discrepancies with previous work.</p><p>4) The mechanism of &quot;HEC factors directly modulate auxin signal transduction by physical interaction with MONOPTEROUS&quot; is overstated and only one such possible way that HEC1 could influence auxin. Additional data supporting this mode and discussing alternatives are needed.</p><p>5) More functional evidence for the connection between HEC, auxin and cytokinin is needed, as well as better modeling.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this well written and interesting article, the authors go beyond current models of stem-cell maintenance in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> shoot meristem and investigate the transitions cells make from slow dividing behaviors in the CZ of meristem out through the peripheral zone (PZ) which is more of a transit amplifying cell population, and into developing organ primordia. Starting with the counterintuitive phenotype of smaller CZ but faster organ initiation in <italic>hec1/2/3</italic> mutants, they use live imaging and modeling to describe the paths cells take along this transition, and manipulate the system to investigate the roles of well-known hormones (Auxin and cytokinin) and regulatory factors (WUS/CLV3) in the process. They also include a clever &quot;timer&quot; protein to see how quickly cells divide during manipulations. To my knowledge this hasn't been used in plants before, but I think it would be a valuable tool for the community.</p><p>Priority concerns</p><p>A) &quot;HEC function appeared not only required and sufficient to control stem cell to PZ, but also mediated PZ to organ fate transitions&quot; This line of reasoning was based on ectopic expression of HEC in the PZ, which says that it can interfere with a normal process, but not that it controls it. I would like to see an amiRNA (or other LOF) experiment to substantiate this conclusion. Also, the expression patterns of HEC1/2/3 are never described in this manuscript. I imagine since they cite 4 prior publications, the patterns are known. This information would be useful included in this manuscript (at least in text). The same issue hold true for the root experiments. Induction of HEC1 can perturb the system, but does it actually work here?</p><p>B) Reporters for CK and auxin are considered to be evidence for direct regulation of these pathways. However, I wonder whether these reporters might be very downstream. For example, could pTCS-GFP signal report that cells are in a proliferative state and have high hormone response because of that state, rather than the other way around? To really nail the idea that HEC1/2/3 work through auxin or cytokinin, wouldn't doing these overexpression experiment in a background mutant for ARRs or ARFs be more direct?</p><p>C) The ChIP-seq is done on overexpressed HEC1 and the targets include typical bHLH sites. Could this just be generic binding? It would be nice to take the published bHLH ChIP-seq datasets (PIFs, POPEYE, SPEECHLESS) and see that the HEC1 sites are not always overlapping with any bHLH.</p><p>D) I think modeling can be a useful addition to developmental studies and was used well in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> to describe how <italic>hec1/2/3</italic> might affect a cellular behavior to result in the observed SAM phenotypes. Such models could be very helpful in testing the proposed auxin signaling feedback loops, as I felt this part of the manuscript was veering into &quot;just so stories&quot; about how things could work, but that alternative models could also explain the data.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>This manuscript by Gaillochet et al. describes the function of the HECATE1 (HEC1) gene in regulating cell fate in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> shoot meristem. The authors perform experiments to demonstrate that HEC1 both inhibit the progression from Central Zone (CZ) identity to Peripheral Zone (PZ) identity and subsequently inhibits the transition from PZ to primordium. The experiments have been carried out using cell-type specific inducible expression of HEC1 in both the CZ domain (under CLV3 promoter) and in the Boundary Zone (BZ) (under CUC2 promoter). The authors next move to investigate the interaction with auxin and cytokinin (CK) hormone dynamics and propose a model for this. In parallel they analyse HEC1 ChIP-seq and RNA-Seq data to reveal potential target genes and identify the Auxin Response Factor MONOPTEROUS (M) as a potential HEC1 interacting factor.</p><p>There are several interesting aspects of the work, which is also technically well-performed. However, it seems to me that the current data are not sufficient to draw the conclusions that the authors do and that alternative interpretations could lead to other models to explain them.</p><p>Specific issues:</p><p>1) It is throughout the manuscript assumed that HEC1 can mediate its effect non-cell autonomously. This is based on the observation in Schuster et al., 2014, where the authors show that HEC1 expressed in the CZ inhibits WUS expression in the OZ via repression of CK signaling. The situation in this manuscript is different: firstly, the cells where HEC1 is supposed to function non-cell autonomously are not the OZ, but the PZ and secondly in Schuster et al. concludes that HEC1 repress CK signaling whereas here they demonstrate that HEC1 stimulate CK signaling (see further comment on this below). In order for the authors to make the non-cell autonomous claim, they will need to create an immobile version (e.g. HEC1-3xGFP) and show the effects are still there.</p><p>2) The authors list three scenarios for how HEC1 can increase the cell number of the meristem and use elegant inducible systems in specific domains of the SAM. This part is very complicated and I am not convinced about the authors' interpretation. For example, they conclude that HEC1 does not increase stem cell division locally (scenario 1). In order to draw such a conclusion, they should carry out the analysis in a zone-specific manner (as opposed to counting the entire SAM, which will mask local differences) and within 2 days, since CLV3 is downregulated at 4 days. Moreover, to eliminate scenario 2 they argue that the constant ratio of CLV3 positive cells over total SAM cells means that PZ cells are not re-specified to stem cells. In order to make this conclusion, they need a marker for PZ and show that this would not 'turn off' upon induction of HEC1 activity. Finally, based on the elimination of scenarios 1 and 2 (which I am not convinced about), they conclude that scenario 3 must be correct without providing experimental evidence for this, but suggest it is supported by showing that the subsequent transition from PZ to primordia is regulated similarly.</p><p>3) Generally, the experiments using ectopic inducible expression of HEC1 under cell-type specific promoters would be much stronger if they were done in the <italic>hec1/2/3</italic> background to test what aspects of this triple mutant is rescued (or not) by the transgene. Without this, it is hard to conclude what the effect of HEC1 would be on these processes in a WT situation.</p><p>4) In the Abstract and in the text, it is stated that data in this manuscript &quot;show that HEC factors directly modulate auxin signal transduction by physical interaction with MONOPTEROUS […]&quot; This overstates what the experiments actually show and more work would be required to validate this. The authors have shown that 1) MP is one among 12 ARF genes that are expressed in the SAM and which are direct targets of HEC1, 2) that many HEC1 targets contain both G-boxes (predicted HEC1 recognition sites) and Auxin Response Elements (AREs) and 3) that HEC1 can interact with MP in yeast and in BiFC. However, in order to make a convincing case, they need to provide genetic evidence for this interaction and establish if HEC1 actually does modify MP-mediated auxin signaling. Moreover, there are 12 other relevant ARFs according to the authors (i.e. expressed in the SAM). Does HEC1 also interact with them? Modify their activity?</p><p>5) The authors aim to address whether HEC genes can control cell fate transition in other developmental contexts, such as the root apical meristem (RAM) and leaves, through the regulation of auxin/cytokinin crosstalk. The conclusions that the authors draw from their experiments are again overstated, since they only analysed response to CK signaling in <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> roots with no attempt to show how auxin signaling response is affected. At the same time, the authors linked the leaf phenotype of the ectopic HEC1 expression to changes in auxin signaling without any prove nor attempting to understand possible crosstalk with cytokinin. The following lists issues particularly regarding this part:</p><p>– It's not clear whether HEC1 governs meristem size by controlling CK signalling or whether it is the result of a feedback mechanism operated by auxin. How (when and where) is the auxin response affected after HEC1 induction?</p><p>– It would be helpful if the author could better describe in which zones/tissues p16 is expressed in the RAM? From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, it seems <italic>p16:mCherry-linker-GR-NLS</italic> is expressed in the division zone of the root meristem. Does <italic>p16:mCherry-linker-GR-NLS</italic> mark the stem cell niche and/or the transition zone?</p><p>– The control of CK on root meristem size occurs only from the vascular tissue at the transition zone. Is the activity of HEC1 sufficient to regulate root meristem size operating from the transition zone (could use the RCH2 promoter to address this)? Does the TCS expression increase before the meristem size starts diminishing?</p><p>– Generally, 16hrs of CK treatments are sufficient to shrink the meristem. To address whether HEC1 controls root meristem size by recruiting cytokinin signalling, two days of DEX treatment is too long. Moreover, the description of how the authors treated their roots in these experiments is unclear; in the text it is stated &quot;one day after induction of <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> we observed a reduction of RAM size, which correlated with increased cytokinin signaling at the transition zone&quot; referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B-H</xref>. However, the legend to this figure says DEX treatment was for two days.</p><p>– From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3C</xref> the ectopic periclinal divisions within the cortical layer are not very clear. Please provide a better magnification of it.</p><p>– In the text &quot;HEC1 induction in seedlings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3G-J</xref>)&quot; should refer to 3I-L. In addition, panels K and L are out of focus and it is not possible to appreciate the phenotypes that are described.</p><p>6) The conclusion from a previous paper from this group (Schuster et al., 2014) concluded that HEC1 inhibits CK signaling during control of the SAM by inducing ARR7/15. Here, they describe the opposite. Although the data concerning CK signaling in this new manuscript are convincing, it would be desirable if the authors could discuss this discrepancy.</p><p>7) It is concluded that induction of HEC1 leads to PIN1 polarization defects referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>. I would agree that the signal of PIN1-GFP is stronger, but it is not possible from these images to make conclusions on localization. Moreover, even if polarization was compromised, it is possible that this could be due to over-accumulation of PIN1 in these cells and not an effect on HEC1 on PIN polarity as such.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>In this manuscript Gaillochet and colleagues address the interesting question of how cell fate transitions are coordinated in meristems. Utilizing a combination of computational/genetic/molecular approaches they show that a family of BHLH transcription factors called HECATE (HEC) is central in this coordination. Indeed, they demonstrate that HEC transcription factors regulate cell non-autonomously cell fate transition from stem cells to transit amplifying cells and from transit amplifying to organ primordia. Subsequently, they investigate whether HEC might regulate cell transition via phyto-hormones and they focus on cytokinin and auxin. Via analysis of <italic>TCSn::erGFP</italic> and <italic>DR5v2:3xYFP</italic> in loss and gain of functions of HEC they show that HEC induces cytokinin activity and represses the auxin one. They also demonstrate that HECs can control cell fate transition via auxin and cytokinin in the root as expression of HEC1 in p16 domain decreases the root meristem length and increases cytokinin activity. To conclude, they show that HEC1 binds auxin responsive elements and physically interacts with ARF5 and BRAHMA to modulate auxin signalling.</p><p>I really enjoyed reading Gaillochet et al. manuscript, nevertheless the connection of HEC with hormones looks to me not extremely robust, as functional evidences were not reported. I could not understand whether the modulation of auxin and cytokinin is necessary and sufficient to mediate HEC function and this point should be address to validate their model.</p><p>Also, in previous report from the same group (Schuster et al., 2014) it was shown that HEC1 promotes type A-ARR expression, negative regulators of cytokinin activity. The authors should discuss with care this point in the discussion.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what now follows is the decision letter after the authors submitted for further consideration.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Control of plant cell fate transitions by transcriptional and hormonal signals&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Christian Hardtke (Senior editor), three original reviewers (one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors), and one new reviewer.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>Overall the reviewers found this to be an engaging read and an interesting conceptual advance. Some softening of bold statements (e.g. hormone dependency claims somewhat oversold based on the actual evidence) and a bit more testing of how HEC could modulate transitions in a non-mutant condition, would make this a valuable addition to the plant development literature. Below are 4 essential issues to address in a revision, and in a response to reviewers.</p><p>1) A critical issue is whether HEC part of the normal regulatory circuit controlling meristem size, and is hard to really be sure of this when using mutants and mis-expression. Recently, however, there were some interesting studies (Murray lab, Nature Communications) about cell cycle length and cell size in the meristem where changing nutritional status or light allowed them to make meristems of different sizes. If HEC is part of a homeostatic mechanism, then there should be some clear predictions of reporter/mutant behavior under these different conditions. These experiments would not require any new materials, but could be very helpful to define HECs normal function.</p><p>2) We urge caution in interpreting the effects of HEC expression in the RAM by looking just at root length, as length can be changed by altering cell behaviors in different ways.</p><p>Several more precise methods are commonly used to capture the kinetics of transition from proliferation to expansion, and one or more of these should be employed. For example, (1) evaluation of cell division frequency at the root meristems of <italic>P16::HEC-GR</italic> seedlings when compared to wt, or (2) to score the number of cells from QC to first differentiated cell as described (e.g. Perilli and Sabatini Plant Developmental Biology 2010 pp 177-187), and/or progression of cell size (e.g. Kang, Breda and Hardtke, 2017).</p><p>Once this finer dissection of the phenotype is performed, you should reconsider whether HEC has different effects in shoot and root or not.</p><p>3) The distinction between HEC-direct and WUS-mediated effects on CK is not clear. Reviewers were not sure that the pathway as presented is sufficiently supported by the current evidence, In particular, how can HEC direct versus WUS mediated effect on the CK signaling be distinguished? In the <italic>hec</italic> mutant, loss of HEC activity might result in higher CLV3 expression, which suppresses WUS. Attenuation of WUS would lead to high ARR7, ARR15 expression and suppression of CK signalling. In the <italic>CLV3::HEC -GR</italic> enhanced HEC activity correlates with increase of WUS expression which when followed by attenuation of ARR7, ARR15 expression ultimately enhances CK signaling. Hence I am not sure one can exclude that CK signaling (monitored by TCS) is under WUS control.</p><p>To address this, in the PZ zone, the effect of HEC on CK could be measured without the complication of WUS by visualizing the TCS reporter in this background.</p><p>4) The finding of G-boxes and AREs in common regions is not terribly surprising given the high frequency of these motifs in the genome. It would add substance to this section if (1) the global analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1"/>was filtered for euchromatic regions only. Since HEC1 peaks are 75% within 3 KB of genes, they are probably more in euchromatin than heterochromatin. An entire genome comparison therefore would be skewed-best to mask the heterochromatic regions when doing this analysis. Detailed promoter analysis might be considered out of the scope of this article the behavior of dual motif-containing genes should be monitored in the HEC-GR induction data (reviewer 3) to see if the correlation holds. This would provide additional support for relevance of the model.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30135.049</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…] Priority concerns</p><p>A) &quot;HEC function appeared not only required and sufficient to control stem cell to PZ, but also.mediated PZ to organ fate transitions&quot; This line of reasoning was based on ectopic expression of HEC in the PZ, which says that it can interfere with a normal process, but not that it controls it.

We also agree that using a model that would integrate gene networks could greatly help in testing multiple regulatory scenarios. However, although our current model can be used to phenomenologically describe cell population dynamics, its structure does not allow us to implement a complex gene-regulatory network. We feel that building a new model including gene regulatory networks would go beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] There are several interesting aspects of the work, which is also technically well-performed. However, it seems to me that the current data are not sufficient to draw the conclusions that the authors do and that alternative interpretations could lead to other models to explain them.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy that the reviewer found our work interesting and technically well executed. We have carried out more experiments to support our current model and further discussed alternative hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific issues:</p><p>1) It is throughout the manuscript assumed that HEC1 can mediate its effect non-cell autonomously. This is based on the observation in Schuster et al., 2014, where the authors show that HEC1 expressed in the CZ inhibits WUS expression in the OZ via repression of CK signaling. The situation in this manuscript is different: firstly, the cells where HEC1 is supposed to function non-cell autonomously are not the OZ, but the PZ and secondly in Schuster et al. concludes that HEC1 repress CK signaling whereas here they demonstrate that HEC1 stimulate CK signaling (see further comment on this below). In order for the authors to make the non-cell autonomous claim, they will need to create an immobile version (e.g. HEC1-3xGFP) and show the effects are still there.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree that using HEC1-3xGFP fusions would allow us to prove the non cellautonomous activity of HEC1 and we thank the reviewer for this suggestion. However, we previously prepared HEC1-GFP-GR and GR-GFP-HEC1 proteins that proved to be nonfunctional, as increasing protein size interfered with HEC1 functionality. Unfortunately, this technical limitation would make the result of the suggested experiment impossible to interpret. To this address this question, we chose an alternative approach and analysed HEC1-GFP protein mobility by driving its expression under various domains of the SAM. We previously published that HEC1-GFP was restricted to the WUS domain when driven under its promoter (Daum et al., 2014) and fully cell-autonomous when driven from the pML1 promoter (Schuster et al., 2014). Consistently, we now find that <italic>pCUC2:HEC1-linker-GFP</italic> and <italic>pCLV3:HEC1-linker-GFP</italic> in <italic>pCLV3:3xmCherry-NLS</italic>, we observe that HEC1-GFP protein does not move long distance laterally, supporting our statement that HEC function in the CZ mostly acts on the PZ cell non-autonomously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors list three scenarios for how HEC1 can increase the cell number of the meristem and use elegant inducible systems in specific domains of the SAM. This part is very complicated and I am not convinced about the authors' interpretation. For example, they conclude that HEC1 does not increase stem cell division locally (scenario 1). In order to draw such a conclusion, they should carry out the analysis in a zone-specific manner (as opposed to counting the entire SAM, which will mask local differences) and within 2 days, since CLV3 is downregulated at 4 days. Moreover, to eliminate scenario 2 they argue that the constant ratio of CLV3 positive cells over total SAM cells means that PZ cells are not re-specified to stem cells. In order to make this conclusion, they need a marker for PZ and show that this would not 'turn off' upon induction of HEC1 activity. Finally, based on the elimination of scenarios 1 and 2 (which I am not convinced about), they conclude that scenario 3 must be correct without providing experimental evidence for this, but suggest it is supported by showing that the subsequent transition from PZ to primordia is regulated similarly.</p></disp-quote><p>We added experimental data and changed the text accordingly to support and clarify our imaging analysis. First, we quantified the mitotic index in the centre and at the periphery of the SAM independently, as suggested by the reviewer. In line with our previous observations, we found that HEC function does not locally promote cell division in the CZ. To analyse early PZ cell re-specification, the reviewer suggested analysing the expression of a PZ marker after HEC induction. From our experience, no such reporter clearly delimits CZ from PZ domains, making this suggested experiment impossible to perform (we previously tried the UFO promoter which displayed a patchier expression pattern than expected). Therefore, we analysed the ratio between the number of CLV3 cells and the total number of cells, which should increase (especially in the 2 first days of induction) if PZ de-differentiation would take place. By showing no dramatic changes in this value, we excluded this scenario. Importantly, computational modelling simulations were used to test all the results from those experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Generally, the experiments using ectopic inducible expression of HEC1 under cell-type specific promoters would be much stronger if they were done in the hec1/2/3 background to test what aspects of this triple mutant is rescued (or not) by the transgene. Without this, it is hard to conclude what the effect of HEC1 would be on these processes in a WT situation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now applied domain specific rescue by <italic>pCUC2:HEC1-linker-GFP</italic> in <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> mutant background and observed similar phenotypes than in the WT background, supporting our described function of HEC factors within distinct domains of the SAM. This result was in line with our previous experiments using <italic>pCLV3:HEC1</italic> in hec1,2,3 mutants, which showed SAM expansion comparable to WT background (Schuster et al., 2014).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Abstract and in the text, it is stated that data in this manuscript &quot;show that HEC factors directly modulate auxin signal transduction by physical interaction with MONOPTEROUS […]&quot; This overstates what the experiments actually show and more work would be required to validate this. The authors have shown that 1) MP is one among 12 ARF genes that are expressed in the SAM and which are direct targets of HEC1, 2) that many HEC1 targets contain both G-boxes (predicted HEC1 recognition sites) and Auxin Response Elements (AREs) and 3) that HEC1 can interact with MP in yeast and in BiFC. However, in order to make a convincing case, they need to provide genetic evidence for this interaction and establish if HEC1 actually does modify MP-mediated auxin signaling. Moreover, there are 12 other relevant ARFs according to the authors (i.e. expressed in the SAM). Does HEC1 also interact with them? Modify their activity?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and now better discuss alternative hypothesis regarding HEC mode of action in regulating auxin responses in the Discussion section. Given the similar pin-like inflorescence phenotypes of <italic>mp</italic> mutants and <italic>pCUC2:HEC1</italic> mutants and that MP is the only ARFs that we found significantly regulated after 14 hours of HEC1 induction, we focused on characterizing the interaction between HEC and MP during the initiation of primordia. However, we agree that additional ARFs could play a role. We now show that HEC1 can reduce MP-GFP levels at the PZ and that HEC activity represses <italic>MP</italic> expression at the RNA level. We have also included new data that show that this repression can be rescued by auxin application, demonstrating that HEC function acts by modulating <italic>MP</italic> expression and auxin signalling during primordia initiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors aim to address whether HEC genes can control cell fate transition in other developmental contexts, such as the root apical meristem (RAM) and leaves, through the regulation of auxin/cytokinin crosstalk. The conclusions that the authors draw from their experiments are again overstated, since they only analysed response to CK signaling in p16:HEC1-linker-GR roots with no attempt to show how auxin signaling response is affected. At the same time, the authors linked the leaf phenotype of the ectopic HEC1 expression to changes in auxin signaling without any prove nor attempting to understand possible crosstalk with cytokinin. The following lists issues particularly regarding this part:</p></disp-quote><p>We included information on HEC activity in the root meristem and now show that these factors are not expressed in this region. Therefore, our analysis of <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> roots exclusively aims at testing whether HEC function is sufficient to regulate cytokinin/auxin responses and in turn impact cell fate acquisition in another developmental context, rather than characterizing in depth HEC function at the root meristem. We further clarified this in the text and removed data presented at the seedling stage to avoid driving the reader away from the main focus of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It's not clear whether HEC1 governs meristem size by controlling CK signalling or whether it is the result of a feedback mechanism operated by auxin. How (when and where) is the auxin response affected after HEC1 induction?</p></disp-quote><p>We now analysed DR5v2 24 hours after induction and found a reduced intensity at the transition zone, demonstrating that HEC1 can act on auxin and cytokinin signalling in the root. Given the absence of endogenous HEC activity in the root, we feel that determining the chain of events would contribute little to the main story of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It would be helpful if the author could better describe in which zones/tissues p16 is expressed in the RAM? From <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>, it seems p16:mCherry-linker-GR-NLS is expressed in the division zone of the root meristem. Does p16:mCherry-linker-GR-NLS mark the stem cell niche and/or the transition zone?</p></disp-quote><p>We modified the figure accordingly and have marked the transition zone.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The control of CK on root meristem size occurs only from the vascular tissue at the transition zone. Is the activity of HEC1 sufficient to regulate root meristem size operating from the transition zone (could use the RCH2 promoter to address this)? Does the TCS expression increase before the meristem size starts diminishing?</p></disp-quote><p>Although it would be interesting to understand the fine spatio-temporal dynamics of HEC1 activity in the root meristem, we feel that this experiment would contribute little to understanding how HEC1 acts in the SAM, where it is expressed. We have used the root only to test whether the effects on auxin and cytokinin could be transferred to a tissue devoid of endogenous HEC activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Generally, 16hrs of CK treatments are sufficient to shrink the meristem. To address whether HEC1 controls root meristem size by recruiting cytokinin signalling, two days of DEX treatment is too long. Moreover, the description of how the authors treated their roots in these experiments is unclear; in the text it is stated &quot;one day after induction of p16:HEC1-linker-GR we observed a reduction of RAM size, which correlated with increased cytokinin signaling at the transition zone&quot; referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3B-H</xref>.

Here, they describe the opposite. Although the data concerning CK signaling in this new manuscript are convincing, it would be desirable if the authors could discuss this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and further explain the causes of this discrepancy in the Discussion section (short term vs. long term effects).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) It is concluded that induction of HEC1 leads to PIN1 polarization defects referring to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref>. I would agree that the signal of PIN1-GFP is stronger, but it is not possible from these images to make conclusions on localization. Moreover, even if polarization was compromised, it is possible that this could be due to over-accumulation of PIN1 in these cells and not an effect on HEC1 on PIN polarity as such.</p></disp-quote><p>We included magnified pictures to better observe the defects in PIN1 polar localization after HEC1 induction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] I really enjoyed reading Gaillochet et al. manuscript, nevertheless the connection of HEC with hormones looks to me not extremely robust, as functional evidences were not reported.

Recently, however, there were some interesting studies (Murray lab, Nature Communications) about cell cycle length and cell size in the meristem where changing nutritional status or light allowed them to make meristems of different sizes. If HEC is part of a homeostatic mechanism, then there should be some clear predictions of reporter/mutant behavior under these different conditions. These experiments would not require any new materials, but could be very helpful to define HECs normal function.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that studying how plants integrate environmental cues and relay these signals to stem cell systems are of high relevance to further define the mechanisms driving plant developmental plasticity. Surprisingly, the regulatory mechanisms driving SAM size adjustment and the regulatory function of key stem cell factors under various environmental cues remain poorly characterized, although some studies have paved the way by mostly describing the SAM developmental response at the cellular level (Landrein et al., 2015; Jones et al., 2017).</p><p>In this context, we tested whether HEC function could be part of the regulatory system controlling the adjustment of the SAM size to environmental perturbations by growing plants under low light conditions (15 µmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>) (Jones et al., 2017). By monitoring SAM size, we revealed that <italic>hec1,2,3</italic> mutants could not adjust their meristem in response to low light conditions, demonstrating the relevance of HEC function for SAM homeostasis. Interestingly, cytokinin signalling was still responsive to the low light treatment in the HEC loss-of-function mutants, suggesting a complex re-wiring of the regulatory system.</p><p>Although we feel that the fine dissection of the molecular mechanisms underpinning the SAM homeostatic response to low light inputs is certainly be an interesting topic for a follow-up study we feel that more details would go beyond the scope of our present manuscript. Thus, we further discussed the relevance of this approach in the Discussion section for future work in order to understand how the shoot stem cell system integrate various environmental signals–including temperature, light, nutrients or biotic interactions– and fine tune cellular fate transitions to adjust the SAM output.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) We urge caution in interpreting the effects of HEC expression in the RAM by looking just at root length, as length can be changed by altering cell behaviors in different ways.</p><p>Several more precise methods are commonly used to capture the kinetics of transition from proliferation to expansion, and one or more of these should be employed. For example, (1) evaluation of cell division frequency at the root meristems of P16::HEC-GR seedlings when compared to wt, or (2) to score the number of cells from QC to first differentiated cell as described (e.g. Perilli and Sabatini Plant Developmental Biology 2010 pp 177-187), and/or progression of cell size (e.g. Kang et al., 2017).</p><p>Once this finer dissection of the phenotype is performed, you should reconsider whether HEC has different effects in shoot and roo, or not.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their helpful comments. We have now further analyzed HEC activity at the cellular level in the RAM:</p><p>1) By measuring the number of cortex cells after HEC induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3H</xref>).</p><p>2) By calculating the cumulative cortex cell length 2 days after HEC induction</p><p>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3J</xref>).</p><p>3) By qualitatively assessing cell division using the Fluorescent Timer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3M-N</xref>).</p><p>Together with the shortening of the RAM length upon <italic>p16:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> induction, we observed that the number of cortex cells decreases, whereas neither cell length nor cell proliferation are altered in the relevant root regions. These data fully support the idea that HEC function would promote RAM cell differentiation by modulating the auxin/ cytokinin balance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The distinction between HEC-direct and WUS-mediated effects on CK is not clear. Reviewers were not sure that the pathway as presented is sufficiently supported by the current evidence, In particular, how can HEC direct versus WUS mediated effect on the CK signaling be distinguished? In the hec mutant, loss of HEC activity might result in higher CLV3 expression, which suppresses WUS. Attenuation of WUS would lead to high ARR7, ARR15 expression and suppression of CK signalling. In the CLV3::HEC -GR enhanced HEC activity correlates with increase of WUS expression which when followed by attenuation of ARR7, ARR15 expression ultimately enhances CK signaling. Hence I am not sure one can exclude that CK signaling (monitored by TCS) is under WUS control.</p><p>To address this, in the PZ zone, the effect of HEC on CK could be measured without the complication of WUS by visualizing the TCS reporter in this background.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that given the lack of information on the directness of the interaction between HEC and WUS or cytokinin in our genomic data and given that WUS and cytokinin signaling cross-regulate in a positive feedback manner, both scenarios could explain our imaging data and thus required further clarification.</p><p>We further addressed this question by inducing <italic>pCUC2:HEC1-linker-GR</italic> and monitoring TCSn:erGFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>). In contrast to cytokinin treatment, which promotes cytokinin signalling at the SAM periphery, inducing HEC function in this region did not. Although WUS could act downstream of HEC to mediate the domain-specific regulation of cytokinin signalling, other lines of evidence need to be considered.</p><p>First, HEC function represses MP expression at the SAM periphery, which in turn promotes cytokinin signalling by repressing type A ARRs (Zhao et al., 2010). Thus, HEC function indirectly represses CK at the periphery by down-regulating MP and by blocking the formation of lateral organs.</p><p>Second, we previously observed that <italic>pCLV3:HEC1</italic> and <italic>clv3-7</italic> genetically interact to produce larger shoot meristem than individual single mutants (Schuster et al., 2014). This argues against a full epistatic relation between HEC and WUS and thus indicates that HEC function acts partially independently of WUS to control SAM size. Along the same line, we did not observe PZ cell re-specification when inducing <italic>pCLV3:HEC1-GR</italic> as observed when inducing <italic>WUS-GR</italic> in the CLV3 domain(Yadav, Tavakkoli and Reddy, 2010), further dissociating HEC and WUS function in the SAM.</p><p>Finally, when ectopically expressed in the root meristem, HEC can promote cytokinin signalling in the absence of WUS (where it is not expressed), showing that in this context their function on cytokinin signalling can be uncoupled from WUS.</p><p>Together we think that these evidences support the idea that HEC function can promote cytokinin signalling partially independently of WUS. As our data cannot fully clarify the network topology between HEC, WUS and cytokinin, we toned down our conclusions and included this point in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The finding of G-boxes and AREs in common regions is not terribly surprising given the high frequency of these motifs in the genome.
