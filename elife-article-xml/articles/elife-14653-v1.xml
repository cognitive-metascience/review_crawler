the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. We show here that disruption of PAK1 in mice suppresses inhibitory neurotransmission through an increase in tonic, but not phasic, secretion of endocannabinoids (eCB). Consistently, we found elevated levels of anandamide (AEA), but not 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) following PAK1 disruption. This increased tonic AEA signaling is mediated by reduced cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), and COX-2 inhibitors recapitulate the effect of PAK1 deletion on GABAergic transmission in a CB1 receptor-dependent manner. These results establish a novel signaling process whereby PAK1 upregulates COX-2, reduces AEA and restricts tonic eCB-mediated processes. Because PAK1 and eCB are both critically involved in many other organ systems in addition to the brain, our findings may provide a unified mechanism by which PAK1 regulates these systems and their dysfunctions including cancers, inflammations and allergies.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14653.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14653.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14653.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Brain cells communicate by sending chemical signals that activate or excite neighbouring cells. However, too much signalling can be harmful. As such the brain has systems in place to inhibit brain signals, and healthy brain activity relies striking a proper balance between excitation and inhibition. In some brain mental health conditions, like autism or schizophrenia, the balance is skewed which has an impact on the brain’s activity.</p><p>A chemical produced by brain cells called endocannabinoid helps maintain the appropriate balance in brain excitation and inhibition. Endocannabinoid is similar to a chemical found in cannabis, but little is known about how it works and which proteins interact with endocannabinoid. A family of proteins called p21-activated kinases (PAKs) has been implicated in autism and other disorders like Huntingtin disease and Alzheimer disease, but it is not fully understood how these proteins interact with endocannabinoid.</p><p>Now, Xia, Zhou et al. show that one member of this protein family called PAK1 plays a key role in controlling endocannabinoid activity. The experiments showed that mice genetically engineered to lack the PAK1 protein have higher levels of endocannabinoids and, as a consequence, the chemical signals that inhibit brain cells are affected more. The experiments also revealed that PAK1 does not interact directly with endocannabinoids. Instead PAK1 boosts levels of another protein called COX-2 and reduces levels of a molecule called anandamide, which together restrict endocannabinoid’s inhibitory effects.</p><p>Scientists are currently interested in developing drugs that target the endocannabinoids and their regulators in the brain as a way to treat anxiety, pain and sleep problems. Drugs that block PAK1 are already being studied. Future studies are needed to determine if such PAK1-targeting drugs could be useful for restoring excitatory and inhibitory balance in brain diseases or for treating other diseases involving the PAK proteins.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14653.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14653.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cannabinoid signaling</kwd><kwd>P21-activated kinase</kwd><kwd>GABA transmission</kwd><kwd>AEA</kwd><kwd>COX-2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31571040</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhou</surname><given-names>Zikai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hill</surname><given-names>Matthew N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The China National Basic Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012CB517903</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Wei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP119421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Zhengping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RGPIN341498</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jia</surname><given-names>Zhengping</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>PAK1 regulates inhibitory synaptic transmission in mice through a cyclooxygenase-2 dependent restriction in tonic, but not phasic, secretion of endocannabinoids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is generally accepted that normal brain function is dependent upon a balance of excitation and inhibition (i.e. balanced E/I ratio) and that altered E/I ratios are associated with, and thought to cause, a wide range of neurological and mental disorders, including autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichler and Meier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kehrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marín, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). Recent studies indicate that GABA-mediated synaptic inhibition is particularly important to maintain an appropriate E/I ratio and that inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs) mediated by GABA receptors are frequently altered in various brain diseases and their animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braat and Kooy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>). Although subjected to multiple regulations, GABA transmission is strongly inhibited by endocannabinoids (eCBs), a group of neuromodulatory lipids known to affect a wide range of physiological processes and medical conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piomelli, 2003</xref>). In the brain, eCBs are produced and secreted from postsynaptic neurons and activate presynaptic cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors to reduce the release of a multitude of neurotransmitters, including GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piomelli, 2003</xref>). Two types of eCB-mediated suppression of GABA release have been studied: tonic eCB release that regulates basal synaptic transmission, and phasic eCB release, induced by postsynaptic depolarization or receptor-mediated eCB production, which mediates transient decreases in synaptic transmission during short-term plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morena et al., 2016</xref>). Although the metabolic process of the eCBs and the enzymes involved in their regulation have been a focus of extensive research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piomelli, 2003</xref>), cellular signaling mechanisms that regulate eCB signaling, particularly tonic eCB signaling, remain poorly understood.</p><p>p21-activated kinases (PAKs) are a family of serine/threonine protein kinases that are activated by multiple synaptic proteins including Ras and Rho GTPases. Extensive studies have indicated that PAKs are involved in a number of cellular processes, particularly in the regulation of gene expression and cellular cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bokoch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao and Manser, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, changes in PAKs are found to be associated with a wide range of physiological and pathological conditions including various forms of cancers and PAK inhibitors are being actively exploited as therapeutic agents to treat these diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>). Recent human studies have also revealed that PAKs are linked to a number of devastating neurological and mental disorders including autism, intellectual disability, Huntingtin’s diseases and Alzheimer’s diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2012</xref>). Animal studies have indeed shown that PAKs, particularly PAK1, the predominant member of the PAK family expressed in the brain, are involved in the regulation of excitatory synaptic function, including spine structure, synaptic plasticity and memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrar et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2005</xref>). Most remarkably, more recent studies demonstrate that inhibition of PAK1, either genetically or pharmacologically, can ameliorate the cognitive and social deficits in several animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly autism, including genetic models targeting fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molosh et al., 2014</xref>). However, the mechanism by which PAK1 exerts such diverse therapeutic effects remains elusive. Quite interestingly, many of these same animal models of neurodevelopmental disorders also exhibit pronounced alterations in eCB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Földy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jung et al., 2012</xref>), and several reports have now suggested that, like PAK1, targeting eCB signaling may provide benefit in these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Busquets-Garcia et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2015</xref>). As these animal models share a common deficit in E/I balance, which appear to involve critical roles of both PAK1 and eCB signaling, we have hypothesized that PAK1 might be a critical player in the regulation of E/I homeostasis through an interaction with eCB signaling. Consistent with this hypothesis, our data indicate that PAK1 restricts tonic eCB signaling in the hippocampus through the regulation of synaptosomal cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) expression, a non-canonical but relevant pathway in the metabolism of eCB signaling. In turn, this ability of PAK1 to restrict tonic eCB signaling confers an alteration in the E/I homeostasis of the hippocampus through the regulation of tonic GABA transmission. Given the overlapping importance of PAK1, COX-2 and eCB signaling in an array of physiological and pathophysiological processes, the identification of this functional signaling interaction likely has significant implications for a multitude of disease processes, such as autism, inflammatory conditions and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PAK1 disruption enhances the E/I ratio by suppressing inhibitory synaptic transmission</title><p>Since all the animal models of brain disorders that are functionally rescued by manipulations of PAK1 share a common deficit in E/I balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Braat and Kooy, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eichler and Meier, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao and Penzes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kehrer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lewis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Marín, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molosh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>), we therefore examined whether disrupting PAK1 would affect the E/I ratio by performing whole cell patch-clamp recordings in CA1 pyramidal neurons of hippocampal slices acutely prepared from PAK1 KO mice and their WT littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs and IPSCs) were pharmacologically isolated by using respective inhibitors specific to glutamate or GABA receptors (i.e. EPSC recorded by including 100 μM GABAα receptor antagonist picrotoxin and IPSC by including 10 μM AMPAR antagonist NBQX plus 50 μM NMDAR antagonist D-APV). First, we measured the E/I ratio by sequentially recording evoked synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), first in the absence of any inhibitors to obtain total synaptic currents (i.e. eEPSC+eIPSC), then in the presence of NBQX/APV to obtain eIPSC, and finally in the presence of NBQX/APV/picrotoxin to verify the eIPSC component. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, the E/I ratio was significantly increased in PAK1 KO compared to the WT littermates. Because PAK1 KO mice show no deficits in basal excitatory synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrar et al., 2009</xref>), the increased E/I ratio in the KO mice is likely due to impaired inhibitory transmission. To test this possibility directly, we performed input/output experiments of eIPSC and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>, the amplitude of eIPSC was significantly smaller in the KO compared to the WT control over a wide range of stimulus intensities. To exclude the possibility that the KO mice may have suffered developmental compensations that could contribute to the reduced eIPSC, we tested the effect of the group1 PAK inhibitor IPA3 (10 μM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rudolph et al., 2013</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>, bath application of IPA3 caused a rapid and significant decrease in the amplitude of eIPSC in WT, but not in PAK1 KO neurons. To further corroborate this result, we employed an independent short peptide known to specifically inhibit PAK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Shin et al., 2013</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1f</xref>, inclusion of this peptide in the postsynaptic neurons (20 μg/ml) also significantly decreased the amplitude of eIPSC in WT, but not in PAK1 KO neurons. The fast acting nature of these inhibitors (within minutes) indicate that the effect of PAK1 on eIPSC is not likely due to a developmental effect but rather direct involvement of PAK1 at the synapse. These results also indicate that PAK1 disruption specifically in the postsynaptic CA1 neurons is sufficient to cause impaired inhibitory synaptic transmission.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14653.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genetic ablation of PAK1 enhances E/I ratio by selectively suppressing inhibitory synaptic responses.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Diagram of a hippocampal slice showing the placement of stimulating and recoding electrodes. (<bold>b</bold>) A representative whole-cell recording experiment and samples traces at indicated time points showing the time course of evoked synaptic currents in the absence or presence of various inhibitors to determine the E/I ratio.

To address this possibility, we first examined the number of GABA-positive neurons and inhibitory synapses, and the level of GABA receptor associated proteins, but found no significant differences between WT and PAK1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–e</xref>; also see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). To determine if GABA receptors were functionally equivalent, we recorded IPSCs evoked by a brief puff of GABA (1 mM, 100 ms) in a co-culture system where WT and PAK1 KO neurons were grown on the same coverlips in order to minimize the differences in culturing conditions between genotypes (see Materials and methods), but again found no differences between WT and PAK1 KO neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f,g</xref>). To further examine if other postsynaptic processes could contribute to the effect of PAK1, we analyzed the effect of cytochalasin D (5 μM) and NSC23766 (250 μM), pharmacological inhibitors for actin polymerization and Rac1 activation respectively. Both actin and Rac1 are key targets of PAK1 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bokoch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao and Manser, 2012</xref>).

While the tonic secretion of eCB affects basal synaptic transmission, its phasic secretion induced by postsynaptic depolarization regulates synaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morena et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piomelli, 2003</xref>). An enhanced tonic signaling would reduce the probability of GABA release, and thus decrease IPSC frequency similar to what we observed in neurons of PAK1 KO mice or in WT neurons loaded with PAK1 inhibitors. Thus, we hypothesized that disruption of PAK1 would enhance tonic eCB signaling. To test this hypothesis, we first examined the effect of AM251, a CB1 receptor antagonist and inverse agonist. In WT, bath application of AM251 (5 μM) increased eIPSCs to approximately 150% of the baseline response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>), reflecting disinhibition of GABA release by blocking tonically active CB1 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neu et al., 2007</xref>). Remarkably, in PAK1 KO mice, AM251 enhanced eIPSC amplitudes to 250% of the baseline response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Acute inhibition of postsynaptic PAK1 by IPA3 (10 μM) or by the PAK1 inhibitory peptide (20 μg/ml) prior to the AM251 application produced similar results as shown in PAK1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b,c</xref>). These findings indicate that tonic eCB signaling is restricted by PAK1 and that disruption of PAK1 causes a robust increase in tonic eCB effect. Consistent with this, an increase in tonic eCB signaling could explain why the frequency of sIPSC/mIPSC is reduced in PAK1 KO mice as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>. To further investigate whether the enhanced eCB signaling in the KO mice is due to changes in CB receptors and/or their downstream signaling processes in the presynaptic terminal, we examined the protein level of CB1 receptors, but found no differences in either total brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>) or synaptosomal fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). In addition, bath application of the CB1 receptor agonist WIN (5 μM), designed to maximally activate the receptor, depressed synaptic responses to the same degree in both WT and PAK1 KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>), suggesting that CB1 receptors and their downstream events are intact in the KO mice.

Finally, to provide further evidence that this increase in tonic eCB signaling in PAK1 KO mice is mediated by a selective increase in AEA, and not 2-AG, signaling, we examined the effects of specific AEA and 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitors. Similar to what was seen following COX-2 inhibition, the ability of the FAAH inhibitor URB597 (1 μM) to reduce eIPSC was reduced in PAK1 KO mice relative to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref>) and the effect of AM251 (5 μM) on eIPSC was no longer different between the two genotypes after the FAAH treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8d</xref>), consistent with the fact that there is already an elevated AEA tone.

Specifically, genetic or pharmacological disruption of PAK1 signaling reduces synaptic COX-2 levels and increases tonic AEA signaling to reduce constitutive GABAergic synaptic transmission in the hippocampus. Importantly, this effect of PAK1 disruption on GABA transmission is replicated by the direct application of a COX-2 inhibitor, which is also dependent on the activation of presynaptic CB1 receptors. While several reports have identified COX-2 as a regulator of eCB signaling, these data represent the first demonstration of a physiological substrate (PAK1 in this case), which can mobilize COX-2 to the synaptic compartment to modulate eCB signaling in real time. In addition, these data provide some of the first data regarding intracellular signaling mechanisms that can regulate tonic AEA signaling and, importantly, could potentially have significant implications for a wide range of pathologies that involve dysregulation of this cascade.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PAK1 is specifically required for GABAergic synaptic transmission</title><p>Although PAK1 is known to be important in the regulation of spine properties such as spine actin and morphology, its effect on excitatory synaptic transmission is minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Asrar et al., 2009</xref>). In fact, basal excitatory synaptic transmission is not altered in PAK1 KO mice, possibly due to the existence of other functionally redundant PAKs (e.g. PAK2 and PAK3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bokoch, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, disruptions of PAK1, either by genetic deletion or pharmacological blockade, dramatically reduces GABAergic transmission, indicating that the primary role of PAK1 is to facilitate inhibitory but not excitatory synaptic function. This selective effect of PAK1 disruption is rather surprising because it has been shown previously that expression of a dominant negative form (i.e. the autoinhibitory domain) of PAK1 affects the excitatory synaptic morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hayashi et al., 2004</xref>). One possible explanation is that the expression of this mutant PAK1 may affect other members of the PAK family, including PAK3, which is also highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meng et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, the double KO mice lacking both PAK1 and PAK3 display severe deficits in spines and the actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). These results together suggest that while PAK1 and PAK3 are functionally redundant at the excitatory synapses, PAK1 is a unique regulator at the inhibitory synapses, which may not be readily replaced by other members of the PAK family. Therefore, the ability of the PAK1 inhibitors in ameliorating the deficits associated with models of fragile X syndrome and neurofibromatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molosh et al., 2014</xref>) may be mediated by its effect on the GABA function. Consistent with this notion, inhibitory synaptic transmission is commonly altered in these brain disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cui et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Olmos-Serrano et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Radhu et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Postsynaptic PAK1 regulates presynaptic GABA release through the eCB system</title><p>In PAK1 KO mice, the frequency, but not the amplitude of mIPSCs and sIPSCs is reduced. The reduction in the frequency is not caused by changes in the number of inhibitory neurons or synapses because none of these parameters are altered in the KO mice. The lack of changes in synapse number is also consistent with the observations that the frequency reduction can be rapidly induced (within mins) by infusion of the PAK1 inhibitors, a perturbation that is not likely to cause any changes in the number of neurons or synapses. Our data also indicate that although the frequency reduction is induced by postsynaptic inhibition of PAK1, it is independent of postsynaptic GABA receptors or the actin cytoskeleton. Therefore, postsynaptic PAK1 affects GABA transmission through a retrograde messenger to modulate neurotransmitter release. Several lines of evidence support that eCBs are the retrograde messenger to mediate such an effect here. First, the effect the CB1 receptor antagonist AM251 is greatly enhanced by the loss of PAK1; application of AM251 potentiates eIPSC three times greater in PAK1 KO or IPA3 treated neurons than in WT neurons. The simplest interpretation of this result is that loss of PAK1 results in increased tonic eCB signaling and therefore a greater inhibition of GABA release. Thus, blocking eCB inhibition causes a greater potentiation of GABA release and eIPSC in the absence of PAK1. There are at least two possibilities by which the eCB signaling can be enhanced: an increase in the signaling pool of eCB molecules and/or altered signaling processes triggered by activation of the CB1 receptors. Because neither the expression level of CB1 receptors nor the effect of a CB1 receptor agonist are enhanced, a straightforward interpretation would be that eCB secretion is elevated in the absence of PAK1. Consistent with this, biochemical analysis of hippocampi from PAK1 KO mice indicate a significant increase in the tissue level of the eCB AEA, but not 2-AG. While 2-AG has been found to mediate the majority of phasic eCB processes, such as DSI and LTD, AEA is believed to mediate the tonic signaling actions of the eCB system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katona and Freund, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morena et al., 2016</xref>). As such, the selective increase in AEA is consistent with the fact that tonic, but not phasic, eCB signaling is enhanced by disruption of PAK1. In fact, a recent report has suggested that elevations in AEA signaling reduce the ability of 2-AG signaling to modulate GABAergic transmission in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), and again consistent with this finding, our data demonstrate that DSI, a measure of activity-dependent, phasic eCB signaling that is mediated by 2-AG, is reduced in PAK1 KO mice. Finally, PAK1 KO mice exhibit no alteration to the synaptic response of a 2-AG hydrolysis inhibitor, but do demonstrate reduced responses to a AEA-hydrolysis inhibitor, which is to be expected if PAK1 deletion selectively increases AEA, and not 2-AG, signaling. Taken together, these results suggest that PAK1 normally restricts tonic AEA level to enhance GABA release and maintains sufficient inhibitory transmission.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PAK1 regulates eCB signaling by targeting COX-2</title><p>The disruption of PAK1 could increase AEA signaling through a variety of mechanisms, although if AEA synthesis were increased by PAK1 deletion, then the effects of an AEA hydrolysis inhibitor would be expected to be amplified, not impaired, because the inhibitor would lock all of the excess AEA within the synapse. If PAK1 disruption reduced AEA hydrolysis, however, one would expect an occlusion to the addition of an AEA-hydrolysis inhibitor. As the latter, and not the former, is what the current data indicate, this leads us to investigate how PAK1 was modulating AEA clearance, not synthesis. FAAH is the primary enzyme responsible for AEA hydrolysis, however our biochemical analysis did not reveal any difference between total or synaptic expression of FAAH protein in PAK1 KO mice. A growing body of work has identified that aside from the canonical metabolism of AEA by FAAH, COX-2 represents an additional mechanism of AEA clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Glaser and Kaczocha, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>). Notably, the impact of COX-2 inhibition on AEA levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermanson et al., 2013</xref>) is roughly comparable to the increase we documented herein in PAK1 KO mice. Consistent with this, we found that PAK1 KO mice did exhibit reductions in COX-2 protein. It is important to emphasize that only synaptic, but not total COX-2 is affected in PAK1 KO mice, implying that PAK1 is particularly important for COX-2 regulation at the synapse. Furthermore, although COX-2 is expressed at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, the effect of PAK1 deletion on COX-2 appears to be specific to inhibitory synapses, which may contribute to the specific effect of PAK1-COX-2 signaling on inhibitory synaptic transmission. The mechanism by which PAK1 regulates COX-2 localization is unknown, but it is possible that local regulation of COX-2, both at the level of protein synthesis and/or trafficking, could be targeted by PAK1.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Implications and conclusions</title><p>With respect to neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, these data could have significant implications for both the therapeutic potential of PAK1 inhibitors or agents that enhance AEA signaling. For example, PAK1 deletion has been shown to normalize synaptic and behavioral deficits in the Neurofibromatosis model of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molosh et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, deletion of PAK1 resulted in a reduction of mIPSC in the amygdala (similar to what was found within the hippocampus within the current study) that was associated with an improvement in social behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Molosh et al., 2014</xref>). In line with this, elevating AEA signaling within the amygdala (which has been shown to dampen GABA release in the amygdala [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azad et al., 2004</xref>]) has been shown to improve social interaction and increase social behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Trezza et al., 2012</xref>). More so, a recent report has indicated that the neuroligin-3 mutation related to autism causes a disruption in tonic eCB signaling within the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Földy et al., 2013</xref>), resulting in an increase in GABA release and a shift in the E/I balance of the hippocampus that is the exact opposite of what was produced by PAK1 disruption. Finally, PAK1 disruption has also been shown to normalize behavioral changes in the Fragile X model of autism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dolan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hayashi et al., 2007</xref>), which parallels recent behavioral work similarly demonstrating that administration of AEA, but not 2-AG, hydrolysis inhibitors, can normalize some of the same behavioral deficits seen in Fragile X mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Qin et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, while speculative at this time, these data collectively create a compelling picture that impairments in tonic AEA signaling may relate to the pathology of neurodevelopmental disorders, such as autism, and that inhibition of PAK1 may exert its potentially beneficial effects by enhancing tonic AEA signaling. Future research will need to investigate this mechanism more directly, but these data establish a framework to approach this question. More so, as PAK1 has been associated with other disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gilman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kelly and Chernoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumar et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2012</xref>), the relationship between PAK1, COX-2 and AEA signaling could prove to be highly relevant for a wide array of pathological processes, given that COX-2 and AEA have similarly been implicated in the etiology of these disease processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hermanson et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have identified a novel process by which PAK1 regulates the eCB system and inhibitory synaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 1</xref>). Given that PAK1 is involved in both normal physiological and pathological processes as discussed above, that range from cancers, allergies to mental disorders, our results provide a new mechanism and treatment scheme by which PAK operates in these various systems, and opens the door to a mechanism-driven therapeutic approach which targets the interaction of these systems.<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14653.034</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>A hypothetical model.</title><p>In wild type neurons, constitutively active PAK1 is required for maintaining a sufficient level of synaptic COX-2 to keep AEA low, thus less suppression of GABA release and normal inhibitory transmission.

Briefly, mouse brains were quickly dissected and transferred to ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) saturated with 95% O2/5% CO2 and sliced to 360 μm sagittal slices. The slices were recovered at 32°C for at least 2 hrs before a single slice was transferred to the recording chamber. ACSF contained (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3.0 KCl, 1.0 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 11 D-glucose, 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 1.2 MgSO<sub>4</sub>. To obtain evoked synaptic responses, the stimulation electrode was placed near the stratum pyramidal layer of the CA1 area to execute 0.1Hz stimulation. Whole cell recordings were performed under the voltage clamp mode with a holding potential of −70 mV except in those to construct I/V curves of synaptic currents. Series resistance was monitored by a −3 mV step throughout the entire experiment of whole cell access and if it fluctuated more than 20%, the data were excluded from the analysis. For the E/I ratio experiments, slices were first perfused by ACSF to record total postsynaptic current (PSC) for 10 min, then 10 μM NBQX/50 μM APV were added to specifically record inhibitory postsynaptic current (IPSC), and finally 100 μM picrotoxin was added to verify the inhibitory response. The E/I ratio was calculated as (PSC-IPSC)/IPSC. Spontaneous IPSC (sIPSC) and miniature IPSC(mIPSC) were recorded by including 10 μM NBQX plus 50 μM APV with or without 1 μM TTX in ACSF respectively. Spontaneous EPSC (sEPSC) and miniature EPSC (mEPSC) were recorded with 100 μM picrotoxin with or without 1 μM TTX respectively. For the E/I ratio and s/mIPSC/EPSC (except sIPSC with NSC) experiments, whole-cell recordings were made using glass pipettes (3–5 MΩ) filled with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 CsMeSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.05 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 1 Mg-ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP, and 5 QX-314 (pH 7.25) (280–300 mOsm), and for all other measurements, the recordings were made with an intracellular solution containing (in mM): 110 K-gluconate, 25 KCl, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-creatine phosphate, 0.2 EGTA, 10 HEPES, 2 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP(pH 7.25) (280–300 mOsm) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hashimotodani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang and Woolley, 2012</xref>). Some of the experiments were repeated in a high Cl intracellular solution containing (in mM): 130 CsCl, 5 NaCl, 10 HEPES, 0.5 EGTA, 5 QX314, 4 Mg-ATP and 0.3 Na<sub>3</sub>-GTP (pH 7.2–7.4) (280 mOsm) and similar results were obtained, but the data were not included in this study. For whole cell infusion of chemical inhibitors (e.g. peptide, IPA3, and NSC23766), the stock solutions or control vehicle were added to the intracellular solution right before the start of the experiments. The sequence of the PAK1 inhibitory peptides are as follows: active peptide: KKEKERPEISLPSDFEHT; ctrl peptide: GPPARNPRSPVQPPP (final concentration at 20 μg/ml, Genscript). For the DSI experiments, the stimulation frequency was increased to 0.33 Hz and the depolarization was from −70 mV to 0 mV lasting 5 s. For the FAAH inhibitor URB597 experiments, the summary graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c,d</xref>) represented pooled data from both females and males (the ratio of females vs males was balanced between WT and PAK1 KO mice). Because the effect of URB597 is more prominent in female rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tabatadze et al., 2015</xref>), we also repeated the URB597 experiment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c</xref> in female mice only and the result was the same as the pooled data (data not shown). Synaptic depression in response to sustained high frequency stimulation was induced by 5 Hz lasting 3 min. All data acquisition and analysis were done with pCLAMP and MiniAnalysis programs. All evoked data were normalized to the average of the baseline response.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Neuronal co-culture and recordings</title><p>In order to accurately compare the WT and PAK1 KO neurons, we used a co-culture system where we plated the WT and KO neurons on the same coverslips to keep the culture conditions and other procedures identical between genotypes.

The maintenance medium was half replaced by fresh medium every 4 days. At 12-15DIV coverslips were transferred to a recording chamber containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 3 KCl, 25 HEPES, 25 Glucose, 1.2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 2.0 CaCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.2–7.4) (280 mOsm), and whole cell recordings were made as described above.

Briefly, the brain tissues were dissected quickly in ice-cold 0.1 M PBS and transferred to a homogenizer containing ice-cold RIPA lysis buffer (Beyotime) with 0.5% protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and lysed for 45 min at 4°C. Debris was excluded by centrifugation at 15,000 g for 10 min (4°C). For synaptosomal fractions, the protein lysate was first processed by the synaptic protein extraction reagents (Thermo), followed by centrifugations at 1200 g for 10 min to collect the supernatant and additional centrifugations at 15,000 g for 20 min to collect the pellet to be resuspended in RIPA lysis buffer. Proteins were separated on a SDS-PAGE ployacrylamide gel and electrotransfered to a PVDF filter. Filters were then blocked with 5% dry milk TBST (20 mM Tris base, 9% NaCl, 1% Tween-20, pH 7.6) and incubated overnight at 4°C with appropriate primary antibodies in TBST. After washing and incubation with appropriate secondary antibodies, filters were developed using enhanced chemiluminescence (Thermo) method of detection and analyzed using the AlphaEaseFC software as per manufacturer’s instruction.

The authors first found that PAK1 deletion or postsynaptic acute inhibition reduced inhibitory transmission via a presynaptic mechanism, thus increasing E/I balance in CA1 hippocampal neurons. Although they found canonical signaling downstream of PAK1, including actin cytoskeletal remodeling, was not involved in the modulation of GABAergic transmission induced by PAK1 deletion, their data implicate endocannabinoid signaling in this process. In support of this novel mechanism, CB1 blockade reveals a larger endocannabinoid tone at CA1 GABAergic synapses after PAK1 deletion or acute postsynaptic pharmacological inhibition. In addition, AEA but not 2-AG levels were increased in PAK1 KO mice. No changes in CB1 receptor function or expression were observed. Based on these data the authors conclude disruption of PAK1 augments AEA tonic signaling to dampen constitutive GABA release. The data to this point are rigorous and compelling and provide a novel molecular mechanism regulating tonic endocannabinoid signaling at CA1 hippocampal GABAergic synapses.</p><p>In the second part of the paper, the authors attempt to determine the mechanism by which PAK1 regulates tonic AEA signaling. The authors measure protein levels of MAGL, DAGL, FAAH and COX-2 (but not NAPE-PLD), and based on data that only COX-2 synaptosomal content is reduced, conclude that PAK1 deletion enhances AEA signaling via removal of COX-2 from the synapse. To follow up on this hypothesis, the authors show COX-2 inhibition-induced depression of IPSCs is partially occluded in PAK1 KO mice, and that CB1 blockade reveals similar degree of endocannabinoid tone in the two conditions. Lastly, the authors show that FAAH inhibition, but not MAGL inhibition, also eliminated genotype differences in CB1 antagonist-induced unmasking of endocannabinoid tone, supporting AEA as the tonic signaling regulated by the PAK1-COX-2 signaling system.</p><p>Although this second aspect of the work is the most innovative and has the potential to have the highest scientific impact, the execution is relatively weak compared to the first part of the paper. Overall, the evidence presented to support a COX-2 mediated mechanism is far from compelling. Based on this critical issue, as it stands, the data do not support the strong conclusions stated by the authors. Additional studies required to support the conclusions include the following (1 and 2 are critical, 3 may be beyond the scope of the work):</p><p>1) The key biochemical data supporting a COX-2 mechanism is based on n=4 sample that synaptosomal COX-2 is decreased in PAK1 KO mice. This is far from convincing. The sample needs to be increased, and full western blots shown. The biochemical data are the key to the paper, since the subsequent electrophysiological data could all be explained if PAK1 was somehow increasing AEA synthesis, rather than affecting COX-2. The argument made against this possibility in the discussion is not convincing, as occlusion of FAAH inhibition effects could occur due to increased synthesis and release of AEA and subsequent activation of the CB1 receptor; the occlusion being measured is at the level of the receptor.</p><p>2) Showing in a converging and more convincing way that COX-2 localization is changing when PAK1 is deleted or inhibited. High resolution quantitative imaging in cultured neurons could be used to show this. For example, reduced co-localization between COX-2 and PSD-95 in PAK1 KO mice, or after intracellular dialysis with PAK1 inhibitor.</p><p>3) Ideally, determining the mechanisms by which PAK1 affects COX-2 localization. Is this a direct protein-protein interaction, is it phosphorylation? Co-IP experiments and phosphorylation studies should be conducted to test these possibilities.</p><p>4) Sample sizes low in many experiments. For example, a key <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> showing MAGL inhibition does not occlude genotype differences in AM251 unmasking of endocannabinoid tome utilizes n=3 for the KO group. This makes the data essentially un-interpretable.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p>Statistical analysis are not appropriate in many figures. Sample sizes are also too low in several key experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>The research paper entitled &quot;p21-activated kinase…signaling in the hippocampus&quot; by Xia et al., demonstrates that PAK1 inhibition suppresses tonic GABAergic transmission via anandamide. The increased tonic anandamide is mediated by suppression of COX-2 at the synapse. These findings are supported by studies using both KO mice and pharmacological experiments. Also, several control experiments are included to strengthen the conclusion. Following are my specific comments.</p><p>1) A major question remains to be answered is the specific effect of COX-2 in GABAergic synapses but not in glutamatergic synapses. Authors have not provided a clear explanation for this selective effect. Changes in COX-2 levels cause modification of glutamatergic transmission (Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 37 (2008) 682-695). Also, COX2 is not selective for anandamide (Kozak et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275, 33744-33749, 2000; Kozak et al., J. Biol. Chem 277, 44877-44885, 2002).</p><p>2) It is unclear how PAK1 regulates COX-2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic> </p><p>1) Statistics. Time-dependent effects should be analyzed by repeated measures ANOVA. Comparison of one time point using t-test is not adequate. See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D, E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Also, authors need to present the details of statistics results not just p value.</p><p>2) Both number of cells and animals should be provided. It is unclear why n is unbalanced in many experiments. For example, n=10 in wt vs n=16 in KO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14653.036</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The manuscript has been evaluated by two reviewers, who are familiar with the subject of endocannabinoid signaling.

First, we showed that PAK1 was colocalized with PSD95 (excitatory synaptic marker) and (gephyrin (GABAergic synaptic marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A, B</xref>), indicating that PAK1 was localized at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses. In addition, PAK1 was also colocalized with COX-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). Second, we showed that COX-2 was colocalized with PSD95 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), indicating that COX-2 was also expressed at excitatory synapses, but the amount of COX-2 colocalized with PSD95 was not altered in PAK1 KO compared to WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D-H</xref>). These results indicate that PAK1 disruption does not affect COX-2 localization at the excitatory synapse. Finally, we showed that COX-2 was also colocalized with gephyrin, and importantly, the amount of this colocalization was significantly reduced in PAK1 KO compared to WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9I-M</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that PAK1 regulates COX-2 localization specifically at the inhibitory synapse, which may explain the specific effect of PAK1-COX-2 signaling on inhibitory, but not on excitatory synaptic transmission.</p><p><italic>2) The biochemical data showing changes in synaptosomal COX-2 be made more convincing;</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have now performed additional experiments to increase the sample size of the synaptosomal COX-2 blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>) from 4 to 10. In addition, we have increased the sample sizes of the other proteins analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. In support of these biochemical data, we have now performed additional immunostaining experiments using cultured hippocampal neurons and shown that the amount of COX-2 at the inhibitory synapse, but not at the excitatory synapse, was significantly reduced in PAK1 KO neurons (see response to specific demand #1). These results are consistent with the idea that PAK1 regulates COX-2 localization specifically at GABAergic synapses, providing a mechanism for specific effect of PAK1-COX2 signaling on inhibitory synaptic transmission.</p><p><italic>3) A more thorough statistical analysis.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have performed additional experiments to improve the sample size in the following figures: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K and L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H and I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D-K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>. We believe that the sample sizes of these experiments are now up to the standard in the field of slice recordings and Western blot analysis. As suggested, we have indicated the number of cells (indicated by n) as well as the number of animals (indicated by the number in the bracket following each n) for each experiment.</p><p>As requested, we have performed more thorough statistical analyses, which are detailed below.

Following the ANOVA analysis, we used as post-hoc t-tests to compare WT and KO at various stimuli. Because we were interested in the maximal synaptic responses, the post-hoc t-test for the last stimulation intensity was included in the text.</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, we also used repeated measures two-way ANOVA test. All these experiments were to compare the drug effect on eIPSCs in WT and KO mice. Again we had two factors (genotype and time, or peptide and time). Because each neuron’s response to the drug application was collected over all the time points (10 min time interval was used for statistical analysis), the repeated measures two-way ANOVA analysis was an appropriate test. Following the ANOVA analysis, we then performed post-hoc t-tests between genotypes at various time points, but only the results for the last time point (21-30 interval) were included in the text and in the summary graphs). This time point was chosen because at this time point the drug effect has been stabilized, and therefore the difference between WT and KO at this time point represents the true difference in drug effect between genotypes (rather than differences caused by perfusion speed, penetration of drug into the slice/neurons etc.).</p><p>For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, we used two-way ANOVA analysis followed by post-hoc t-tests. In these experiments we had two independent factors (genotype and drug) and each neuron’s response was measured only once (i.e. with or without drug).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p><italic>In the second part of the paper, the authors attempt to determine the mechanism by which PAK1 regulates tonic AEA signaling. The authors measure protein levels of MAGL, DAGL, FAAH and COX-2 (but not NAPE-PLD), and based on data that only COX-2 synaptosomal content is reduced, conclude that PAK1 deletion enhances AEA signaling via removal of COX-2 from the synapse. To follow up on this hypothesis, the authors show COX-2 inhibition-induced depression of IPSCs is partially occluded in PAK1 KO mice, and that CB1 blockade reveals similar degree of endocannabinoid tone in the two conditions. Lastly, the authors show that FAAH inhibition, but not MAGL inhibition, also eliminated genotype differences in CB1 antagonist-induced unmasking of endocannabinoid tone, supporting AEA as the tonic signaling regulated by the PAK1-COX-2 signaling system.</italic></p><p><italic>Although this second aspect of the work is the most innovative and has the potential to have the highest scientific impact, the execution is relatively weak compared to the first part of the paper. Overall, the evidence presented to support a COX-2 mediated mechanism is far from compelling. Based on this critical issue, as it stands, the data do not support the strong conclusions stated by the authors. Additional studies required to support the conclusions include the following (1 and 2 are critical, 3 may be beyond the scope of the work):</italic></p><p><italic>1) The key biochemical data supporting a COX-2 mechanism is based on n=4 sample that synaptosomal COX-2 is decreased in PAK1 KO mice. This is far from convincing. The sample needs to be increased, and full western blots shown. The biochemical data are the key to the paper, since the subsequent electrophysiological data could all be explained if PAK1 was somehow increasing AEA synthesis, rather than affecting COX-2. The argument made against this possibility in the discussion is not convincing, as occlusion of FAAH inhibition effects could occur due to increased synthesis and release of AEA and subsequent activation of the CB1 receptor; the occlusion being measured is at the level of the receptor.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have now performed additional experiments to increase the sample size of the synaptosomal COX-2 blots from 4 to 10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). In addition, we have increased the sample sizes of the other proteins analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> (see response to specific demand #2). Full Western blot images for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref> are now provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>. In support of the Western blot data, we have also performed additional immunostaining experiments using cultured hippocampal neurons and shown that the amount of COX-2 at the inhibitory synapse, but not at the excitatory synapse, was significantly reduced in PAK1 KO neurons (see response to specific demand #1). These results are consistent with the idea that PAK1 regulates COX-2 localization only at GABAergic synapses, providing a mechanism for specific effect of PAK1-COX-2 signaling on inhibitory synaptic transmission.</p><p><italic>2) Showing in a converging and more convincing way that COX-2 localization is changing when PAK1 is deleted or inhibited. High resolution quantitative imaging in cultured neurons could be used to show this. For example, reduced co-localization between COX-2 and PSD-95 in PAK1 KO mice, or after intracellular dialysis with PAK1 inhibitor.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have now performed immunostaining experiments using low density cultured hippocampal neurons and the results are described in responses to specific demands #1.</p><p><italic>3) Ideally, determining the mechanisms by which PAK1 affects COX-2 localization. Is this a direct protein-protein interaction, is it phosphorylation? Co-IP experiments and phosphorylation studies should be conducted to test these possibilities.</italic></p><p>As requested, we have performed immunostaining experiments in low density cultured neurons and the results are described in response to specific demand #1. We have also performed Co-IP experiments using anti-PAK1 and anti-COX-2 antibodies, but unfortunately were not able to show that these two proteins exist in one immunocomplex (data not shown), suggesting that they may not physically interact with each other. Therefore, the effect of PAK1 on COX-2 at the inhibitory synapse is not likely through a protein-protein interaction. We have not been able to analyze the phosphorylation level of COX-2 because we do not have access to phospho-specific antibodies against COX-2.</p><p><italic>4) Sample sizes low in many experiments. For example, a key <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref> showing MAGL inhibition does not occlude genotype differences in AM251 unmasking of endocannabinoid tome utilizes n=3 for the KO group. This makes the data essentially un-interpretable.</italic></p><p>As suggested, we have performed additional experiments to increase the sample sizes of this and other experiments.

The increased tonic anandamide is mediated by suppression of COX2 at the synapse. These findings are supported by studies using both KO mice and pharmacological experiments. Also, several control experiments are included to strengthen the conclusion. Following are my specific comments.</italic></p><p><italic>1) A major question remains to be answered is the specific effect of COX-2 in GABAergic synapses but not in glutamatergic synapses. Authors have not provided a clear explanation for this selective effect. Changes in COX-2 levels cause modification of glutamatergic transmission (Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 37 (2008) 682-695). Also, COX-2 is not selective for anandamide (Kozak et al., J. Biol. Chem. 275, 33744-33749, 2000; Kozak et al., J. Biol. Chem 277, 44877-44885, 2002).</italic></p><p>See response to specific demand #1 for explanation of specific effect of PAK1 deletion on GABAergic responses. In brief, although PAK1 and COX-2 are present at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), the effect of PAK1 deletion on COX-2 expression appears to be specific to COX-2 at the inhibitory synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Thus, the level of colocalization of COX-2 with gephyrin, but not with PSD95, was reduced in PAK1 KO compared to WT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore, although COX-2 may function at both inhibitory and excitatory synapses as shown in Yang et al., Mol. Cell. Neurosci. 37 (2008) 682-695, PAK1 deletion leads to reduced COX-2 only at the inhibitory synapse, thus only reduced IPSC, but not EPSC, was observed in PAK1 KO mice. In the present study, the effects of PAK1 deletion and reduced COX-2 expression seem to relate to an exclusive elevation in AEA signalling, but not 2-AG (based on both biochemical analysis of endocannabinoid content and the occlusion of the effects of a FAAH inhibitor, but not a MAGL inhibitor). While the references the reviewer has included do demonstrate that COX-2 has the ability to regulate 2-AG signalling, the work of the Patel and Marnett group examining COX-2 regulation of endocannabinoid signalling (Hermanson et al., 2013 16, 1291-98) has demonstrated that the magnitude of the effect of COX-2 inhibition of AEA signalling is far more robust than what is seen for 2-AG signalling. In fact, the increase in 2-AG content from COX-2 inhibition was only about 5%, while the increase in AEA content was more than double of baseline values (Hermanson et al., 2013). Thus, while we cannot entirely exclude the possibility that the ability of COX-2 activity is capable of producing subtle alterations in 2-AG signalling, our data are consistent with the reports of Hermanson and colleagues in that the impact of reducing COX-2 activity is much more profound for AEA signalling than 2-AG signalling. Alternatively, other pathways targeting COX-2 that are independent of PAK1 may function to regulate 2-AG and these pathways are not altered in PAK1 KO mice. It would be interesting to identify these pathways in the future.</p><p><italic>2) It is unclear how PAK1 regulates COX-2.</italic></p><p>In both Western blot analysis and immunostaining experiments, the level of COX-2 at the inhibitory synapse, but not the total COX-2 protein, is reduced in PAK1 KO mice. These results suggest that PAK1 regulates COX-2 not likely through affecting its transcription or translation, but rather post-translation mechanisms (such as protein trafficking) specifically at the synapse. The exact mechanism by which PAK1 regulates synaptic COX-2 is unclear, but is not likely through a direct protein-protein interaction because we were not able to show that PAK1 and COX-2 exist in one immunocomplex in the Co-IP experiments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p><italic>1) Statistics.
