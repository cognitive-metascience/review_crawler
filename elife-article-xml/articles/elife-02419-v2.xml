IFT-B and kinesin are associated to anterograde transport whereas IFT-A and dynein participate to retrograde transport. Surprisingly, the small GTPase IFT27, a member of the IFT-B complex, turns out to be essential for retrograde cargo transport in <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>. We reveal that this is due to failure to import both the IFT-A complex and the IFT dynein into the flagellar compartment. To get further molecular insight about the role of IFT27, GDP- or GTP-locked versions were expressed in presence or absence of endogenous IFT27. The GDP-locked version is unable to enter the flagellum and to interact with other IFT-B proteins and its sole expression prevents flagellum formation. These findings demonstrate that a GTPase-competent IFT27 is required for association to the IFT complex and that IFT27 plays a role in the cargo loading of the retrograde transport machinery.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02419.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02419.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02419.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Long, thin structures called cilia and flagella are found on the surface of many cells, and perform a range of roles, including propelling the cells around or sensing changes in the surrounding environment. A process called intraflagellar transport (IFT for short) is responsible for flagellum construction in eukaryotic cells. Protein complexes called IFT trains carry the building blocks that make up flagella along microtubule ‘tracks’ between the base and the tip of a flagellum.</p><p>IFT trains are made from two different protein complexes called IFT-A and IFT-B, which are dragged by various molecular motors. The IFT-B complex is necessary for the train to move towards the tip of the flagellum, and so enables the flagellum to grow. The IFT-A protein complex is required to recycle the train back towards the base of the flagellum.</p><p>Huet et al. examined the role that a protein called IFT27 plays in intraflagellar transport. IFT27 is part of the IFT-B complex, and so it was thought to only affect how flagella grow. However, short flagella still grow when IFT27 is absent, but they are filled with IFT trains that are not able to reverse back from the tip. Huet et al. reveal that the IFT-A complex and the molecular motor that is essential for reversing the train are not transported into the flagellum if IFT27 is not present. This is therefore an unusual case of an IFT-B protein affecting the IFT-A complex and the transport back to the base.</p><p>IFT27 also affects how the IFT-B complex forms. ITF27 can bind to some small molecules, which can switch the protein ‘on’ or ‘off’. Huet et al. found that when IFT27 is switched off it is not transported into flagella, and also cannot bind to some of the other proteins in the IFT-B complex. This means that if IFT27 is locked in an inactive state, the IFT-B complex does not form, and a flagellum cannot grow. Therefore, activated IFT27 is needed for putting together the IFT train and to ensure its movement in either direction along the microtubule tracks.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02419.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02419.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd><italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic></kwd><kwd>flagellum</kwd><kwd>small GTPase</kwd><kwd>IFT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huet</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name><name><surname>Blisnick</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrot</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastin</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre national de la recherche scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huet</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name><name><surname>Blisnick</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrot</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastin</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ANR</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11-BSV8-016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huet</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name><name><surname>Blisnick</surname><given-names>Thierry</given-names></name><name><surname>Perrot</surname><given-names>Sylvie</given-names></name><name><surname>Bastin</surname><given-names>Philippe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale (FRM)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huet</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>French National Ministry of Research and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Huet</surname><given-names>Diego</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A small GTPase within the flagellum can participate in the control of transport from the base to the tip of the flagellum, and back again.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cilia and flagella (interchangeable terms) are microtubule-based organelles surrounded by a specialized plasma membrane. These organelles are found protruding at the surface of a wide range of eukaryotic cells where they exert several roles including cellular motility, sensory reception and developmental signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fliegauf et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Drummond, 2012</xref>). Although cilia and flagella can differ by their functions, they share the same basic structure and are mainly assembled by an evolutionary conserved process called intraflagellar transport (IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozminski et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rosenbaum and Witman, 2002</xref>). During IFT, large protein complexes called IFT trains are moved from the base to the tip of the flagellum by kinesin-2 (anterograde IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kozminski et al., 1995</xref>) and back towards the base by cytoplasmic dynein-1b/2 (retrograde IFT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pazour et al., 1998</xref>). The IFT particles are composed of at least 20 different proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cole et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Follit et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taschner et al., 2011</xref>) and can be divided in two different complexes known as complex A (made of at least 6 proteins) and B (made of at least 14 proteins) that are needed for retrograde and anterograde IFT respectively. Inactivation of IFT-B proteins or of the kinesin motor results in the failure to construct the flagellum whereas IFT-A proteins and the IFT dynein contribute to retrograde transport. Nevertheless, little is known about how the two processes are interconnected, as the interaction between the IFT complexes and their molecular motors is still poorly understood.</p><p>Structurally, IFT proteins contain several protein–protein interaction domains such as WD40, tetratricopeptide repeats, β-propeller or coiled-coil domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cole, 2003</xref>). However, two IFT proteins belonging to the IFT complex B do not share those features. Instead, they exhibit sequence homologies with the family of Rab-like small G proteins, which can function to regulate vesicle movement along actin and tubulin networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stenmark, 2009</xref>). This suggests that they could be involved in IFT regulation. The first one, IFT22 (or Rab-like 5) traffics inside the sensory neurons of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, where its disruption does not affect cilia assembly but produces an intriguing extended lifespan phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schafer et al., 2006</xref>). IFT22 also undergoes IFT in the flagellum of the protist <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic> but surprisingly knocking down the protein resulted in severe flagellar assembly defects, typical of inhibition of retrograde transport (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhiambo et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, IFT22 regulates the availability of IFT proteins inside the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Silva et al., 2012</xref>). Despite being homologous to the Rab-like proteins, IFT22 lacks the G4 domain needed for recognition of the guanine base (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paduch et al., 2001</xref>) and GTP binding and hydrolysis has not been demonstrated to date. Therefore, IFT22 might have diverged from its ancestral GTPase function to complete specific roles in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>T. brucei</italic>, and <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>.</p><p>The second protein is termed IFT27 (or Rab-like 4) and contrary to IFT22, it possesses all five RAS-GTPase consensus sequences needed for GTPase activity and GDP binding. Structurally, the protein is similar to Rab8 and Rab11 and is capable of GTP hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</xref>). IFT27 is part of the IFT complex B core, where the protein interacts directly with IFT25 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lucker et al., 2005</xref>). This IFT25/27 sub-complex is associated with the rest of the IFT complex B prior to flagellum entry, suggesting a possible regulatory role during the entry of the IFT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In <italic>Chlamydomonas,</italic> RNAi-mediated knockdown of IFT27 causes flagellar defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2007</xref>), supporting its role during flagellar assembly, although its exact contribution was not investigated. In this study, we analyzed the function of IFT27 in <italic>T. brucei,</italic> the parasite that causes sleeping sickness and that is also an amenable model to study flagellar assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kohl and Bastin, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ralston and Hill, 2008</xref>) as well as the IFT components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absalon et al., 2008b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhiambo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin and Ullu, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>). We found that IFT27 travels by IFT and associates with other IFT-B proteins<italic>.</italic> RNAi knockdown surprisingly produced short flagella filled with IFT-like material and axoneme assembly defects. This phenotype is explained by the absence of both the IFT140 protein (a member of the IFT-A complex) and the IFT dynein motor from the flagellar compartment. Generation of constitutively active and inactive forms of IFT27 produced further insights: while expression of the active version of the protein complements the RNAi phenotype, this was not the case of the inactive version that was unable to penetrate the flagellar compartment. Surprisingly, its expression in the absence of endogenous protein led to the formation of short flagella that do not accumulate IFT-like material. This inactive version is unable to interact with two other IFT-B proteins, suggesting that IFT27 must be in a GTP-bound state in order to interact with the B-complex and enter the flagellum. These results show that IFT27, an IFT-B protein, performs two separate functions: one in the import of both the IFT-A complex and IFT dynein motors and one in the assembly of the IFT-B complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>IFT27 encodes a putative Rab-like protein</title><p>The <italic>T. brucei IFT27</italic> gene (TritrypDB Accession number Tb927.3.5550) has a 552 nucleotide-long sequence that encodes a predicted protein of 183 amino acids (predicted molecular weight of 20.64 kDa).

Additionally, all IFT27 sequences lack the prenylation motif (two cysteins at the C terminal end) found in Rab proteins suggesting that the protein is not lipid modified and thus unlikely to interact with the cellular membrane.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02419.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequence alignment of deduced amino acid sequences of IFT27 homologues and modified <italic>IFT27</italic> sequences.</title><p>Alignment was generated using CLC main workbench; the most conserved residues are shown in black, the less conserved in yellow.

Second, a GFP::IFT27 fusion protein was expressed in procyclic trypanosomes. Western blot analyses using the anti-IFT27 antibody showed a single band migrating at a position close to the predicted size of 20 kDa in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In trypanosomes expressing the GFP::IFT27 fusion, the same antibody detected an additional band migrating close to the 50 kDa marker. This molecular weight is compatible with the expected mass of the fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The anti-IFT27 antibody was then used in immunofluorescence assays in combination with DAPI to stain both nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, the latter being an easy marker of basal body positioning in trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Robinson and Gull, 1991</xref>). In wild-type cells, the anti-IFT27 antibody produced a signal all along the flagellum, starting at the base of the organelle and reaching its distal tip where it was sometimes brighter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The GFP-fusion protein showed a similar localization, with the presence of the protein at the flagellum base and inside the flagellum. Co-staining of the GFP-tagged protein and IFT27 showed a clear colocalization inside the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the use of live microscopy demonstrated that the fusion protein clearly traffics along the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="other" rid="media1">Video 1</xref>) where typical bidirectional IFT was visualized. Similar IFT trafficking was observed for other IFT-related proteins in trypanosomes including GFP::IFT52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absalon et al., 2008b</xref>), GFP::IFT22 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adhiambo et al., 2009</xref>), and YFP::IFT81 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>).

These speed values are similar to those previously reported for GFP::IFT52 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>).

After induction, the growth rate of the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>Q67L</italic> cell line did not vary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>), while the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cells showed impaired growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11D</xref>). Therefore, the modified T19N protein produces a phenotype only when the endogenous IFT27 expression is inhibited, suggesting a recessive effect of the T19N mutation. Immunofluorescence assays using the monoclonal antibodies Mab25 and L8C4 showed that the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>Q67L</italic> <bold>(GTP-locked)</bold> cells were undistinguishable from their non-induced control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11E</xref>) whereas <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> <bold>(GDP-locked)</bold> cells build unusually short flagella after 3 days of induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11F</xref>, arrows). The flagellar length of the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>Q67L</italic> cell line showed no significant differences between non-induced (16.9 ± 1.9 µm, n = 100) and induced cells (16.6 ± 2.98 µm, n = 100) whereas flagellar length of <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cells dropped to 3.7 ± 3.1 µm (n = 79) after induction compared to 17.6 ± 2.1 µm (n = 100) for the non-induced controls. However, by carefully analysing both <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> and <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>Q67L</italic> cells in non-induced conditions, we noticed that the length of the flagellum was shorter by about 3 µm compared to cell that are not expressing a mutated form of IFT27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). This interesting result indicates that the expression of a GDP or GTP-locked form of IFT27 has a slightly negative dominant impact on the formation of the trypanosome flagellum. Once the endogenous IFT27 is depleted, this effect is exacerbated in the case of the GDP-locked version but not in the case of the GTP-locked version (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). These observations reveal that the sole expression of the GTP-locked version, although able to sustain flagellum formation, is not neutral.<fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02419.015</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Expression of IFT27<sup>RNAiRES</sup>T19N and IFT27<sup>RNAiRES</sup>Q67L produces different phenotypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold> and <bold>C</bold>) <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>Q67L</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cells (<bold>C</bold>) were induced the indicated number of days and western blots were performed using the anti-IFT27 antibody.

While the IFT172 staining looked normal in the non-induced context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13Aa–d</xref>), the induced <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cells did not show signs of IFT B complex accumulation but IFT172 was found concentrated at the base of the organelle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13Ae–h</xref>) in a way reminding of the localization of the IFT140 protein in the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This is in stark contrast with the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> cell line where the depletion of IFT27 is accompanied by accumulation of IFT172 inside the flagellum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13B</xref>). The phenotype obtained in the induced <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cells is reminiscent to the ones observed upon disruption of the anterograde IFT machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pazour et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absalon et al., 2008b</xref>) and shows that the expression of IFT27<sup>RNAiRES</sup>T19N in the absence of endogenous IFT27 triggers an anterograde IFT phenotype. To understand this intriguing phenotype, the flagellar structure of the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cell line was analyzed by TEM and scanning electron microscopy. TEM observations were not conclusive, as no visible defects in the axoneme structure were detected. These results could be explained by the fact that <italic>T. brucei</italic> assembles the new flagellum while retaining the old one and that only this one, formed prior to the RNAi-mediated silencing of IFT27, could be observed. On the other hand, SEM revealed the presence of abnormally short flagella with no visible dilation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13Aj</xref>, arrow) and the presence of a ‘flagellar sleeve’, a long and thin extension of the flagellum membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13Aj</xref>, arrowheads). This is very different from the induced <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> cells that possess a short, bulky flagellum, in agreement with the presence of an excessive accumulation of material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12Bj</xref>, arrow). Since the IFT dynein is found concentrated at the base of flagellum after IFT27 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), we wondered what could be the localization of the motor in the presence of the Q67L and T19N versions of IFT27. This was addressed by immunofluorescence assays using an anti-DHC1b antibody in non-induced and induced <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>Q67L</italic> <bold>(GTP-locked)</bold> or <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> <bold>(GDP-locked)</bold> cells.

In contrast, DHC1b remained at the flagellum base in induced cells solely expressing the T19N mutant protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14e–h</xref>, arrow). In conclusion, the GDP-locked version does not sustain the entry of the IFT-B complex in the flagellar compartment, leading to an anterograde phenotype. Nevertheless, dynein is still targeted to the base of the flagellum.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02419.017</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>The <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cell line displays an anterograde phenotype upon induction.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Non-induced (a to d) and 3-day-induced (e to h) <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cells were fixed in methanol, stained with the anti-IFT172 and Mab25 and counterstained with DAPI.

Amongst the possible regulators, several small GTPases have been associated with the flagellum: ARL-13b is involved in the stabilization of ciliary assembly in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and its mutations are associated with a ciliopathy named Joubert syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cantagrel et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cevik et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Li et al., 2010</xref>). The RAN importin system, known to be involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, is responsible for the entry of the kinesin KIF17 inside the primary cilium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dishinger et al., 2010</xref>). However, none of these proteins are part of any of the IFT complexes.</p><p>Here, we have shown by immunoprecipitation that IFT27 likely is a constitutive member of the IFT-B complex in <italic>T. brucei</italic>. Previous purification assays of the B complex using C3/DYF13 in <italic>T. brucei</italic> identified most of the IFT-B predicted proteins but were not able to detect IFT27, perhaps because of its short molecular weight and the under-representation of small polypeptides inherent to the MS analysis. Significantly, IFT20 and IFT25, the two other predicted IFT-B proteins of short size, were also missing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin and Ullu, 2010</xref>). We observed that GFP-tagged IFT27 traffics in the flagellum in a similar way to IFT52 or IFT81, two well-studied IFT-B members (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buisson et al., 2013</xref>) showing that IFT27 likely associates to the IFT-B complex and participates to the IFT process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16A</xref>).

By TEM, this accumulated material appeared as electron dense regions spread around short, irregular and often disrupted axonemes whereas the basal body and transition zone appeared normal. All these features are reminiscent of a retrograde phenotype, usually caused by a deficit of either the IFT dynein or the IFT-A complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pazour et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absalon et al., 2008a</xref>). Interestingly, DHC1b and IFT140, two essential molecules of the dynein and IFT-A complex respectively, are not able to enter the flagellum in the absence of IFT27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16B</xref>). The IFT dynein is the retrograde motor of IFT that brings back IFT trains from the tip to the base of the flagellum, a process in which IFT-A is also involved although its exact contribution remains to be shown. Being an IFT-B protein, IFT27 could therefore regulate IFT-A and dynein transport at the physical interface between IFT-A, IFT-B and dynein complexes to ensure coordinate import in the flagellar compartment. Supporting that view, some relationships between IFT-B proteins and the IFT dynein motor have been suggested in the literature. First, IFT-B and dynein genes are both controlled at the transcriptional level by the transcription factor RFX whereas IFT-A and kinesin II are regulated differently in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Thomas et al., 2010</xref>). Second, co-immunoprecipitation experiments indicate that DHC1b interacts with the IFT-B protein IFT172 in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pedersen et al., 2006</xref>). In <italic>T. brucei</italic>, we could not detect a direct interaction between IFT27 and DHC1b or IFT27 and IFT140 by co-immunoprecipitation (unpublished data) but the association might be transient, for example taking place only during protein entry in the flagellar compartment.</p><p>It has been shown that IFT27 forms a complex with IFT25, and both could be involved in flagellum entry regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wang et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, the IFT25/27 structure displays a surface patch able to mediate protein–protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</xref>). This IFT25/27 sub-complex could then act as a scaffold mediating the interaction of the IFT-B complex with dynein and IFT-A complexes. In <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>, the RNAi knockdown of IFT27 produced cells with abnormally short flagella but the nature of the IFT defect (effect on anterograde or retrograde IFT) has not been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). In this organism, it is the only IFT protein whose inhibition triggers cell cycle defects. However, the specificity of the phenotype has not been proven and an off-target effect cannot be excluded. In trypanosomes, the flagellum is essential for cell morphogenesis and cytokinesis and inhibition of all <italic>IFT</italic> genes studied so far invariably resulted in growth arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davidge et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absalon et al., 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin and Ullu, 2010</xref>). In the present study, the possibility of this being an off-target effect has been ruled out upon complementation of the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> phenotype by the expression of an RNAi-resistant version of IFT27 that rescued both the observed growth and flagellar phenotype while displaying normal IFT trafficking in non-induced as well as in induced cells. IFT27 has all the necessary features to function as a GTPase, although it displays low intrinsic activity during in vitro assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhogaraju et al., 2011</xref>). The orthologue of IFT27 in the related protozoan <italic>Trypanosoma cruzi</italic> exhibits GTPase activity in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ramos et al., 2005</xref>). As the <italic>T. cruzi</italic> protein is 88.5% similar to IFT27 and all the key residues are conserved, it is very likely that the <italic>T. brucei</italic> protein is also able to hydrolyze GTP. We have shown that the Q67L version apparently behaves like the unmodified protein even in the complete absence of the endogenous protein. Thus, IFT27 likely interacts with other IFT complex B members, controls the entry of the IFT-A complex and DHC1b and enters the flagellum in a GTP-bound state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig16">Figure 16A</xref>). These findings could be compared with previous results showing that a constitutively active GTPase activity does not affect the localization of various Rab proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Richardson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alvarez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nachury et al., 2007</xref>). Another possible caveat to explain the absence of phenotype in the cells expressing the Q67L version of IFT27 is that the protein is not actually impaired in its GTPase activity so that it undergoes a normal chemical cycle. However, this is not likely the case as we noticed that cells expressing both the endogenous and the GTP-locked protein possessed a slightly shorter flagellum compared to cell that are not expressing a mutated form of IFT27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12</xref>). These observations reveal that the sole expression of the GTP-locked version, although able to sustain flagellum formation, is not neutral.</p><p>Since the constitutively active version of IFT27 is found inside the flagellum and interacts with the rest of the IFT machinery, one could argue about the need of an inactive state. However, <italic>T. brucei</italic> has a complex life cycle in which the length of the flagellum can vary from 3 µm to 30 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rotureau et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, it will be interesting to see the impact of the GTP/GDP cycle on assembly of flagella of different length during the life cycle of <italic>T. brucei.</italic></p><p>The expression of the T19N version, predicted to leave IFT27 in a GDP-bound form, did not cause a dominant negative phenotype. However, the modified T19N protein was not found inside the flagellar compartment neither in the presence nor in the absence of endogenous IFT27 and was unable to associate with the IFT-B complex. One would then expect that the exclusive expression of IFT27 in its inactive state should phenocopy the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> cell line. Strikingly, this was not the case as only very short flagella that do not exhibit accumulation of IFT proteins were built, typical of anterograde inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Absalon et al., 2008b</xref>). Several explanations could be proposed to explain this intriguing result. First, the inactive IFT27 protein could sequester other components of the IFT-B complex in the cytoplasm and inhibit their transfer to the base of the flagellum. However, immunofluorescence assays revealed that IFT172 is still found concentrated at the base of the flagellum but not inside organelle. Second, the inactive protein could interfere with assembly or stability of the IFT-B complex in the cytoplasm, a hypothesis supported by the reported decrease in the amount of several IFT proteins in the <italic>Chlamydomonas IFT27</italic> RNAi experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Qin et al., 2007</xref>). However, this seems unlikely here because the total amount of IFT172 and IFT22 did not decrease when the IFT27T19N protein was exclusively expressed in the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAiRES</italic></sup><italic>T19N</italic> cell line (unpublished data). Third, the inactive IFT27 could negatively control the entry of the IFT-B complex hence resulting in an anterograde phenotype while the wild-type protein in non-induced conditions would overhaul this effect.</p><p>Curiously, both IFT27 and IFT25 are absent from <italic>C. elegans, D. melanogaster,</italic> and <italic>Giardia intestinalis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">van Dam et al., 2013)</xref>. This could be the consequence of different organization of the flagellum base, a sub-compartment involved in the regulation of the entry of flagellar components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reiter et al., 2012</xref>). No obvious basal body structure can be found at the base of <italic>C. elegans</italic> cilia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Perkins et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Williams et al., 2011</xref>) and in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, the basal body possesses a unique electron-dense ring structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Enjolras et al., 2012</xref>). The δ- and ε-tubulins, involved in basal body maturation, are also absent from the genomes of these two organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dutcher, 2001</xref>). Finally, the basal bodies are deeply rooted in the cytoplasm in <italic>Giardia</italic>, with long cytoplasmic axoneme segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dawson and House, 2010</xref>). Therefore, the absence of IFT27 and IFT25 could be related to the non-canonical structure of their flagellum base, implying a different process for the entry of the IFT proteins. Alternatively, the requirement for retrograde transport might be different according to the type of cilia, necessitating specific adaptations for IFT-A/IFT dynein trafficking. Inhibition of retrograde IFT moderately affects the length of sensory cilia in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (reduced by one third in IFT140 or dynein mutants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2008</xref>) or <italic>C. elegans</italic> (reduced by 25% in IFT-A mutants, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blacque et al., 2006</xref>) in contrast to the severe reduction observed in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pazour et al., 1999</xref>), trypanosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kohl et al., 2003</xref>) or <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Satir and Christensen, 2007</xref>). In summary, these findings demonstrate that a GTPase-competent IFT27 is required for association to the IFT complex and that IFT27 plays a role in the cargo loading of the retrograde transport machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids, cell lines, and culture conditions</title><p>All procyclic <italic>T. brucei</italic> cell lines were derivatives of the strain 427 and grown in SDM79 medium with hemin and 10% fetal calf serum.

The dsRNA is expressed from two tetracycline-inducible T7 promoters facing each other in the pZJM vector. Primers were selected using the RNAit algorithm to ensure that the fragment lacked significant identity to other genes to avoid cross-RNAi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Redmond et al., 2003</xref>). The fragment was amplified by PCR with the forward primer cgatcg<underline>AAGCTT</underline>aaacttgcgtcttcaggtgg and the reverse primer gtcat<underline>CTCGAG</underline>atttgcgagatctttcccct, digested with XhoI and HindIII (sites underlined) and ligated into the corresponding sites of the pZJM vector.

Generation of the p2845TdTomatoIFT140 plasmid enabling the expression of TdTomato::IFT140 was performed by modifying the p2845IFT140 mCherry plasmid. The mCherry gene was removed from p2845IFT140 using XhoI and HindIII while simultaneasouly getting the TdTomato gene from the p2675TdTomatoIFT81 plasmid with the same restriction enzymes. Ligation was performed between the digested p2845IFT140 plasmid and the TdTomato insert overnight at 16°C, the resulting plasmid was then transfected into XL-10 Gold Ultracomptent Cells (Agilent Technologies, France) to allow amplification. Plasmids from 10 different colonies were double digested with XhoI and HindIII to assess the presence of the TdTomato insert.</p><p>For the RNAi-resistant version of IFT27, a new version of the gene was chemically synthesized modifying the first 411 nucleotides in order to make synonymous mutations, leaving the amino acid sequence unchanged (GeneBank Accession Number KF147877).

Additional point mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) made by GeneCust Europe enabled the creation of the RNAi-resistant versions of IFT27 in a GTP (Q67L) or GDP (T19N) locked state (GeneBank Accession Numbers KF147878 and KF147879). The YFP-tagged version of IFT27RNAires was made by synthetizing and cloning the <italic>YFP</italic> gene into the pPCPFRIFT27RNAires vector between the NheI and BamHI restriction sites.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and 3 reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Three reviewers read your paper, and after discussions with the editor, they recommend publication of the work. The main discussions centered around the biological insight. Those reviewers further from the field had a harder time understanding the insight than those closer to the field. Therefore we would like you to reemphasize the biological discovery here, which is not the fact that IFT27 is an important player in delivering cargo to the flagella, but rather the specific cargo is actually the retrograde machinery. Please make this clear in your Abstract, Introduction, and Discussion.</p><p>Experimentally, the major concern is the surprising and actually quite striking lack of kymograph analysis of anterograde and retrograde trafficking for any protein other than IFT27 itself. At least the most naive expectation would be that if IFT27 affects retrograde but not anterograde transport, then this should be evident as a drop in the retrograde transport frequency without a corresponding drop in the anterograde frequency. We do agree that their end-point phenotypic analysis, showing accumulation of IFTB proteins in short swollen cilia full of electron dense material does strongly support a specific defect in retrograde transport, but wouldn't a live cell analysis make this point much more directly? Perhaps there are tricky timing issues: obviously one would have to do the analysis early enough in the RNAi process that the cilia had not yet become short stumps. The authors do mention that such data exists (for example the authors mention mention having done this analysis for IFT140) but they do not show it. In particular, IFT52 kymographs would strongly support their model of impaired retrograde return being the cause for IFTB accumulation in the RNAi lines. You may have had good reasons why this analysis wasn't possible but I think that you should at least spell those reasons out, since this really seemed like a glaring omission, especially given the incredibly thorough level of treatment that the authors gave to every other aspect of their story.</p><p>Another issue that one of the reviewers brought up was the fact that the GTP locked form of IFT27 can fully replace the function of wild-type IFT27 (if I am understanding the results correctly). This is surprising since one normally thinks of G proteins as executing a cyclic reaction so that jamming the reaction at any point in the cycle should impair function. I bring this up because it was a surprising aspect of the story, but to their great credit the authors face this surprise head on and give several possible explanations. These seem reasonable but worth commenting that this was the one point in the paper where the story suddenly deviated from what one might have expected. Perhaps there is an explanation. IFT is a cycle, with anterograde particles switching to retrograde motion and then re-entering the flagella for another anterograde run. Given the cyclic nature of IFT, and the fact that IFT27 is involved in coupling retrograde and anterograde motion, a palausible model could have been that the GTPase cycle of IFT27 was coupled to the directional cycle of IFT. There was never really any reason to think this, but many readers will make a similar assumption and thus be startled by the active site mutant results. We would thus encourage the authors to emphasize a bit more explicitly the idea that the two cycles might have been coupled but apparently are not. That may help readers to avoid confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02419.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>Two major points were raised by the Reviewing editor:</p><p><italic>1) The lack of kymograph analysis of anterograde and retrograde trafficking for any protein other than IFT27 itself</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting suggestion as it could directly show the role of IFT27 in retrograde transport. We indeed considered doing this experiment in an <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> cell line expressing another IFT protein fused to a fluorescent protein, using our well set-up procedure to extract kymographs. However, we did not do these experiments because a similar approach using the <italic>IFT140</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> strain, a reference strain for inhibition of retrograde transport, turned out to be inconclusive (Fort &amp; Bastin, unpublished data). In this case, the reporter protein was a fusion between YFP and IFT81, a core protein of the IFT-B complex (Bhogaraju et al, Science 2013). Two obstacles probably explain this. First, when cells were analysed at early time points of RNAi when they still possess a flagellum of reasonable length, no statistically significant differences could be found in the ratio between anterograde and retrograde trains (Slide 1, Films 19h and 25h). This could be due to the fact that in these cells, the unbalance is too discrete to be detected. One has to keep in mind that we can monitor IFT only for a few minutes before fading of the GFP/YFP signal whereas it takes 4-5 hours to assemble a full-length flagellum.</p><p>Therefore, a slight unbalance might hence go unnoticed over a short period but could have consequences on the actual amount of IFT-B proteins in the flagellum. Second, as time progresses, the number of cells with a flagellum that can be analyzed drops due to the rapid emergence of cells with a new tiny flagellum filled with IFT particles. In the few cells that can technically be analyzed, the amount of IFT material is high, turning the flagellum very bright and preventing observation of individual trains (Slide 1, Film 49h). Since we could not reach a clear conclusion on the seminal retrograde transport mutant, we did not try the experiment on the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> strain. Nevertheless, as pointed out by the reviewers, we think that the end-stage phenotype of piling-up of IFT proteins in the short flagellum is demonstrating convincingly the involvement of IFT27 in retrograde IFT. This phenotype has been taken as landmark for attributing a retrograde function to multiple genes in for example <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (Pazour et al JCB1999), <italic>C. elegans</italic> (Blacque et al MBC2006) or humans (Perrault et al AJHG2012).</p><p>We examined the trafficking of TdTomato::IFT140 and of GFP::DHC2.1 in the <italic>IFT27</italic><sup><italic>RNAi</italic></sup> strain and could not detect any unbalance between anterograde and retrograde transport. However, this was somehow expected since the defect in that case is due to failure of entry of IFT-A and dynein motors. We did not show the film since a video where nothing moves is not very informative. The distribution of these two proteins is shown by immunofluorescence in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7 fig8">Figures 7 and 8</xref>.</p><p><italic>2) The fact that the GTP locked form of IFT27 can fully replace the function of wild- type IFT27</italic>.</p><p>We wish to thank the reviewers for this important question. By carefully analyzing the GDP and the GTP-locked mutants in conditions where the endogenous IFT27 protein is still expressed, we noticed that the length of the flagellum was shorter by about 3μm. This indicates that the expression of the GDP- or the GTP-locked versions has a slightly dominant negative impact on the formation of the flagellum. Once the endogenous IFT27 is depleted, this effect is exacerbated in the case of the GDP-locked version but not in the case of the GTP-locked version. These results reveal that the sole expression of the GTP-locked version, although able to sustain flagellum formation, is not neutral. A new figure has been introduced to describe this result and a new section has been added to the text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
