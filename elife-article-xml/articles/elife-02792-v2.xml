volume, necessitating greater degrees of chromatin compaction in higher eukaryotes, which have evolved several mechanisms for genome compaction. However, it is unknown whether histones themselves have evolved to regulate chromatin compaction. Analysis of histone sequences from 160 eukaryotes revealed that the H2A N-terminus has systematically acquired arginines as genomes expanded. Insertion of arginines into their evolutionarily conserved position in H2A of a small-genome organism increased linear compaction by as much as 40%, while their absence markedly diminished compaction in cells with large genomes. This effect was recapitulated in vitro with nucleosomal arrays using unmodified histones, indicating that the H2A N-terminus directly modulates the chromatin fiber likely through intra- and inter-nucleosomal arginine–DNA contacts to enable tighter nucleosomal packing. Our findings reveal a novel evolutionary mechanism for regulation of chromatin compaction and may explain the frequent mutations of the H2A N-terminus in cancer.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02792.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02792.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02792.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>There are up to three meters of DNA in a human cell. To fit this length into the cell's nucleus in an organized manner, DNA is wrapped around proteins called histones and then tightly packaged to form a structure called chromatin. The interaction between the histones and the DNA is helped by certain amino acids on the surface of the histones fitting snugly into the DNA molecule.</p><p>Plants and animals have genomes that are significantly larger than those of single-celled organisms. However, although genome size has increased gradually during the evolution of complex organisms, the size of the nucleus has not undergone a similar expansion. Large genomes are therefore packaged more tightly than small genomes. However, we do not fully understand how different species evolved the ability to do this.</p><p>Now Macadangdang, Oberai, Spektor et al. have compared the histones of 160 species ranging from single-celled microorganisms to plants and animals. This revealed that the amino acids in a particular type of histone—histone 2A—vary according to genome size. Organisms with small genomes use histone 2A proteins with fewer arginine amino acids on their surface than organisms with large genomes.</p><p>Further experiments showed that yeast cells engineered to contain arginine-rich histones wind their DNA more tightly; and, in some cases when the chromatin was more compacted, the nuclei were also smaller. On the other hand, removing arginines from histones in human cells cause the chromatin to be loosely packed and the nuclei to be larger than normal. Moreover, chromatin is often abnormally packed in cancer cells and Macadangdang et al. found that many of these cells contained histones with fewer arginines than normal.</p><p>Plants, animals, and other eukaryotes have evolved a variety of mechanisms to control how much they compact their chromatin in addition to the way discovered by Macadangdang et al. Future work is now needed to determine how these different mechanisms work together in different species such that the chromatin is compacted to the optimal level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.02792.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.02792.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>evolution</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>arginine</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Director's Innovator Award, 1 DP2 OD006515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kurdistani</surname><given-names>Siavash K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Medical Student Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macadangdang</surname><given-names>Benjamin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005595</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Philip Whitcome Pre-doctoral Training Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Macadangdang</surname><given-names>Benjamin R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005595</institution-id><institution>University of California</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>UCLA Cancer Cell Biology Postdoctoral Training Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Spektor</surname><given-names>Tanya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The N-terminal domain in histone 2A serves as an evolutionary tool to enable greater chromatin compaction when genome size is disproportionately larger than the nuclear volume across eukaryotes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genome size, defined as the haploid DNA content of a cell, has increased as eukaryotes evolved from single-cell species to more complex, multicellular organisms. Within the same evolutionary timeframe, nuclear volume has also increased but at a slower rate than genome size expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maul and Deaven, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Olmo, 1982</xref>). While the ratio of nuclear to cell size has remained essentially constant in eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalier-Smith, 2005</xref>), the disproportional increase in genome size relative to the nuclear volume has required organisms with larger genomes to compact their chromatin to greater extents than organisms with small sized genomes. Indeed there is a positive correlation between genome size and native chromatin compaction as measured by dye incorporation into chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Vinogradov, 2005</xref>). In most eukaryotes, the genome is organized into chromatin by the repeating nucleosomal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luger et al., 1997</xref>). The nucleosomes stack and fold into higher order structures, serving to systematically compact the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Duan et al., 2010</xref>) and to regulate molecular processes that are based on DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Celeste et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vogelauer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fischle et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kouzarides, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fussner et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The surface of the histone octamer has 14 DNA interaction sites. Each interaction is mediated by an arginine residue that intercalates into the minor groove of the DNA to stabilize the nucleosomal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">West et al., 2010</xref>). Arginine is the most commonly used amino acid for interaction with DNA due to its positive charge and the lower energetic cost compared to lysine for displacing water when intercalating into the minor groove (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohs et al., 2009</xref>). Nucleosomes mediate chromatin compaction through a variety of mechanisms. For instance, nucleosomes form higher order structures through inter-nucleosomal contacts between the histone H4 N-terminal domain (NTD) and the acidic patch of H2A and between two H2B C-terminal domains (CTD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorigo et al., 2003</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gordon et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schalch et al., 2005</xref>). Histone variants, such as H2A.Z or H2A.Bbd, as well as post-translational modifications of histones, such as H4K16ac, can further regulate the degree of compaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Suto et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chandrasekharan et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fierz et al., 2011</xref>). Polycomb complexes compact large domains of chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Eskeland et al., 2010</xref>) and are important for proper development. Histones of the H1 family promote additional compaction by binding between nucleosomes to linker DNA near the DNA entry/exit site on nucleosomes and stabilize the intrinsic ability of nucleosomal arrays to fold in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carruthers et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Robinson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Szerlong and Hansen, 2010</xref>). Linker histones may affect chromatin compaction globally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2005</xref>), at specific stages of the cell cycle such as mitosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Maresca et al., 2005</xref>) or at specific regions of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>). In contrast to canonical histones, the linker histones are much less conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Caterino and Hayes, 2010</xref>), and ectopic expression of human linker histones in the budding yeast even at low levels is lethal for the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miloshev et al., 1994</xref>). Finally, structural proteins such as condensin also contribute to chromatin condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tada et al., 2011</xref>). Many of these modulatory mechanisms are dynamic in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Luger et al., 2012</xref>) and may help explain why multicellular organisms can compact chromatin to different degrees in different cell types. However, despite the existence of these mechanisms for genome compaction in higher eukaryotes, it has not been known whether the canonical histones themselves have evolved sequence features that also contribute to the generally increased chromatin compaction observed in organisms with larger genomes.</p><p>In this study, we provide evidence from analysis of 160 fully-sequenced eukaryotic genomes that arginine (R) residues at specific positions in the N-terminal tail of histone H2A—which protrudes from the nucleosome on the opposite side of DNA entry/exit site—have co-evolved with increasing genome size with a concomitant decrease in serines/threonines. Although increases in genome size are associated with phylogenetic evolution from protozoa to fungi to more complex plants and animals, we present genetic and molecular evidence from the budding yeast and human cells as well as in vitro biochemical data to demonstrate that the evolutionary changes in H2A directly regulate chromatin compaction in vivo and in vitro with consequences for the nuclear volume. The evolutionary changes in H2A regulate chromatin compaction in yeast and human cells, revealing a surprising flexibility in the dynamics of the chromatin fiber that has been conserved across distant eukaryotes. This previously unrecognized structural feature of the nucleosome has evolved to enable greater chromatin compaction when genome size is disproportionately larger than the nuclear volume. Our findings also suggest that the reported mutations in the histone H2A NTD may contribute to the altered chromatin compaction that is commonly observed in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zink et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>H2A acquires specifically positioned arginines as genome size increases</title><p>To determine whether specific residues in the four core histones have co-evolved with increasing genome size, we performed residue composition analysis of canonical histone protein sequences from 160 fully sequenced eukaryotes with genome sizes ranging from 8 to 5600 Mbp encompassing protozoa, fungi, plants, and animals. The canonical histone proteins for each organism were defined based on at least 90% overlap and 35% identity with the histone fold domain of the corresponding human sequence (‘Materials and methods’). Each organism was categorized as having a small (&lt;100 Mbp), medium (100–1000 Mbp), or large (&gt;1000 Mbp) genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

For instance, the human H2A NTD contains arginine residues at positions 3 and 11 that are absent in yeast and at position 20 which is correspondingly a lysine in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). In contrast, the human sequence lacks S10 and S15 that are observed in the yeast H2A NTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Alignment of all H2A NTD sequences also revealed similar trends across all eukaryotes studied here. The heat map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the occurrence of arginines and serines/threonines in the H2A NTD as a function of genome size (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 1—source data 1</xref> for raw data and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref> for statistical analysis). At position 3, an arginine (R3) is predominantly present in medium and large species but is lacking in small species. At position 11, a lysine (K11) is observed in species with medium genomes that evolves to an arginine (R11) mainly in organisms with large genomes. R17 is present in most organisms examined, suggesting a very conserved function for this residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zheng et al., 2010</xref>). At position 20, small genomes contain predominantly a lysine residue, which converts to arginine in medium and large genomes. In contrast, serines/threonines at positions 10 and 15 are found primarily in organisms with small genomes and much less so in organisms with medium and large genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Additionally, each of the four H2A NTD arginines is surrounded by a conserved motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The residues surrounding R3 and R17 are mainly glycine and serine, respectively. At position 11, the motif varies based on genome size. Species with medium-sized genomes contain VKG and those with large genomes contain ARA. The same is true of position 20, where AKA is present in organisms with small genomes and (S/T)RA in larger genome species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, except for R3, the positions of all the other evolutionarily varying residues in the H2A NTD are strongly conserved relative to the histone fold domain and not the N-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). When counting conventionally from the N-terminus, amino acids R11, R17, and R20—which are numbered based on the human sequence—were not observed consistently at the same positions in other organisms. However, these residues are respectively 12, 6, and 3 amino acids away from the histone fold in most species (note the vertical axes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). S10 and S15—which are numbered based on the yeast sequence—also show more uniform positioning when counted from the histone fold. Altogether, as genome size increases, arginines appear in conserved positions within the H2A NTD relative to the histone fold, and serines and threonines are lost.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Arginines 3 and 11 in the H2A NTD increase chromatin compaction</title><p>To determine whether arginines and serines/threonines of the H2A NTD affect chromatin compaction in vivo<italic>,</italic> we took advantage of a strain of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, that has both chromosomal copies of H2A deleted and carries a single copy of H2A on a plasmid (TSY107), to construct mutant strains containing single or multiple insertions of arginines into their conserved motifs, deletions of serines, or combinations thereof (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> for specific amino acid changes and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref> for a description of the mutant strains).

The probes were differentially labeled and visualized by confocal microscopy. The distance between the probes was measured in a single plane in which both probes were present within each nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bystricky et al., 2004</xref>). When compared to the isogenic wild type (WT), addition of a single arginine at position 3 (R3) or 11 (R11) to the H2A NTD was sufficient to significantly decrease the average interprobe distance by 18% and 15%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The average interprobe distance was further decreased by 22% when both arginines were present (R3R11) and even more so (30%) in R3(ΔGS10)R11. Deleting G9S10 (ΔGS10) alone caused slightly increased compaction with low statistical significance (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). The largest decrease in interprobe distance (41%) was observed in the R11ΔS15 mutant, which places R11 12 amino acids from the histone fold, the same position as in organisms with large genomes. Removal of S15 (ΔS15) alone had no effect. The effect of arginines was not simply due to increasing the positive charge of the H2A NTD, as insertions of lysines at positions 3 and 11 did not significantly affect the interprobe distances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Although lysines are found at these positions in certain species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the lack of potential compaction by lysines may be due to the absence of other evolutionary changes in yeast histones (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Additionally, R17K or K20R mutations did not affect compaction, nor did a randomly inserted arginine at position 6 (R6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>), suggesting that not every arginine in the H2A NTD contributes to chromatin compaction.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.02792.008</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Ectopic expression of H2A NTD arginines causes compaction in yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic position of probes on chromosome XVI that were used for FISH.

We therefore conclude that H2A arginines at positions 3 and 11, especially when R11 is placed at the evolutionarily-conserved position relative to the histone fold, increase the degree of chromatin compaction.</p><p>Chromatin is differentially compacted at different cell cycle stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guacci et al., 1997</xref>). Cell cycle profile analysis showed little difference between the strain harboring WT H2A and any of the mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), indicating that the observed differences in chromatin compaction are not due to altered cell cycle profiles. Chromatin compaction may also be influenced by nucleosomal spacing; indeed the linker DNA length is larger in human cells than in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grigoryev, 2012</xref>). We find that there are essentially no differences in nucleosomal density in H2A arginine mutants using Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating that the average nucleosomal spacing is not affected by these mutations.

We tagged a nuclear pore protein, Nup49, in its chromosomal locus with GFP to visualize the nuclear membrane and used confocal microscopy to capture three-dimensional images of the nucleus to quantify volumes of ≥150 cells per H2A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>, see ‘Materials and methods’ for volume calculations). As compared to WT cells, H2A mutants containing R11 or R3R11, both of which contain more compact chromatin, displayed significantly decreased nuclear volumes. The average nuclear volume in the R3 mutant was also less than WT but did not reach statistical significance. Interestingly, H2A mutants from which serines 10 and 15 were removed displayed larger nuclear volumes. Simultaneous insertions of arginines into these strains (R3(ΔGS10)R11 and R11ΔS15) decreased their nuclear volume (R11ΔS15 p&lt;0.001 compared to ΔS15), restoring them to levels similar to WT. The control strains with either lysines or R6 had nuclear volumes similar to or larger than WT. Neither arginines nor serines had any effect on total cell size as measured by concanavalin A staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In the FY406 strain background, ΔS15 did not cause an increase in nuclear volume; and thus both R11 and R11ΔS15 strains exhibited smaller nuclear volumes than isogenic WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD4-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

The H2A gene was HA-tagged and mutated to remove R3 (ΔR3), to replace R11 with alanine (R11A) or lysine (R11K), or to combine two mutations (ΔR3R11A). The H2A constructs were overexpressed using the strong CMV promoter in the normal human IMR90 fibroblasts, the breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-453, or the HEK293 cells. Cells overexpressing ΔR3, R11A, or ΔR3R11A H2A mutants had increased interprobe distances, indicating de-compaction of chromatin. Expression of H2A R11K had modest effects on chromatin de-compaction with marginal statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 4</xref>).

We assembled nucleosomal arrays at different octamer-to-template ratios (0.9, 1, and 1.1 octamer to 1 template) and monitored the quality of the arrays by MgCl<sub>2</sub> precipitation and restriction digest analysis using ScaI. We found that a 1:1 octamer-to-template ratio gave the best results as the ScaI digest demonstrated well-assembled arrays compared to the 5% free DNA loaded as a comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

A survey of the COSMIC database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forbes et al., 2011</xref>), as of the time of writing, revealed 41 documented missense mutations within the H2A NTD with 29 (71%) affecting a residue within one of the four arginine motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). R11, which had the strongest effect of any single arginine residue on chromatin compaction, is the most commonly mutated residue in the H2A NTD. We tested the effects of three of these mutations, R11C, H, and P and found that ectopic expression of each in normal human fibroblasts decreases chromatin compaction significantly with R11P having the strongest effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B,C</xref>).

This mechanism is distinct from several other known chromatin compaction mechanisms in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bednar et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorigo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhou et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fierz et al., 2011</xref>) in that it involves the histone proteins themselves. The H2A-mediated chromatin compaction thus provides a novel but potentially complementary mechanism for genome compaction. Organisms with small genomes but also very small cell size may face similar physical constraints as those with larger genomes, and may therefore use arginine-containing H2A as a means for chromatin compaction. For instance, <italic>Ostreococcus tauri</italic> which possesses an R3-containing H2A, is a free-living unicellular algae that has a very small genome of 12.6 Mbp but a cell diameter of 0.8 µm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Palenik et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, which does not contain an H2A with R3, has a similarly sized genome but has a cell diameter that is approximately five times larger. Furthermore, certain organisms such as <italic>Oikopleura dioica</italic>, which has one of the smallest genomes in animals, have distinctive life cycles and possess H2A genes with and without arginines, which may enable them to dynamically regulate genome compaction at different stages of their life cycles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Moosmann et al., 2011</xref>) (for species with H2A isoforms, see attached spreadsheet). So, the H2A arginines may have evolved in circumstances when the genome size became disproportionately large compared to nuclear volume. Interestingly, the toad, <italic>Bufo gargarizans</italic>, which has a genome size that is twice as large as the human genome, possesses an H2A gene with not only R3 and R11 but also glutamine 6 replaced with an arginine, suggesting that additional arginines in the H2A tail may enable further compaction in organisms with even larger genomes.</p><p>To better understand the three dimensional positions of the H2A NTD arginines, we examined a crystal structure of the mono-nucleosome in which R3, R11, R17, and R20 were all simultaneously crystalized, and visualized interactions between nucleosomes within the crystal lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, while R17 and R20 are more buried within the octamer, R3 and R11 are situated close to the DNA backbone. R3 is at 2.87 Å from the DNA and could potentially bind the DNA gyre as the DNA wraps around the histone octamer. R11 forms close contacts with the DNA phosphate backbone of self and neighboring nucleosomes (4.09, 2.90 Å, respectively). Although these interactions may have helped form the crystal lattice, they also suggest a possible mechanism for tighter nucleosomal stacking in vivo through shielding of the DNA negative charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davey et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, the evolutionary appearance of arginines in the H2A NTD sequence at positions 3 and 11 corresponds to strategic positioning of R3 and R11 within the nucleosome structure that may enable interactions with the DNA, leading to more compact chromatin.</p><p>Our in vivo data in yeast cells demonstrate that interprobe distances shorten in the presence of the H2A arginines R3 and R11. While the mechanism of this shortening is still unknown, the two most likely explanations are due to linear chromosomal compaction or increased chromatin looping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bohn and Heermann, 2010</xref>). However, our data are more consistent with increased linear compaction due to several reasons. First, our analysis of multiple probes along Chr XVI in yeast demonstrates a uniform compaction between all probe pairs examined. Second, our in vivo data with human cell lines shows de-compaction of chromatin in the absence of R11. If chromatin looping was the mechanism, loops would have to be disassembled in human nuclei independent of factors such as CTCF and condensin. Third, our in vitro data show that R11 alone affects chromatin compaction even in absence of divalent cations. Because the in vitro experiments were performed with unmodified histones in arrays with equal linker lengths, this strongly points to a direct effect of H2A NTD arginines on chromatin compaction that occurs in short arrays. Both R3 and R11 are at contact distances from the DNA, and R11 may also contact the DNA backbone of the neighboring nucleosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). These intra- and inter-nucleosomal interactions with the arginines and the DNA may serve to neutralize the negative charge of the DNA backbone, leading to enhanced stacking of nucleosomes and hence increased compaction. Consistent with this model, the other two arginine residues in the H2A NTD, R17 and R20, which are more buried from the surface, do not affect compaction by themselves. However, their functions may be to modulate the effects of the surrounding residues. Although all canonical H2A genes contain R3 and R11 in humans, the cell may still be able to dynamically regulate chromatin compaction by these arginines. For instance, arginines may be subject to posttranslational modifications, such a methylation which makes the arginine residue bulkier, or citrullination which removes the positive charge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wang et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hagiwara et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Lorenzo and Bedford, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waldmann et al., 2011</xref>). Interestingly, the H2A NTD is situated in close proximity to the H2B CTD which when ubiquitylated, disrupts chromatin compaction in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fierz et al., 2011</xref>), lending support to the ability of this region of the nucleosome to modulate chromatin compaction.</p><p>The inability of lysines, especially at position 11, to increase chromatin compaction suggests exquisite structural constraints for H2A-mediated chromatin compaction. Although lysines and arginines both are positively charged, the positive charge of arginine is due to the presence of a guanidinium group that is structurally different from the positive charge of an amino group of a lysine residue. In this regard, it is interesting to note that only arginines contact DNA as it wraps around the nucleosome core (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Luger et al., 1997</xref>); and arginines preferentially bind the minor groove of DNA compared to lysines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rohs et al., 2009</xref>). The context in which lysines appear in evolution may be important as well. We did not observe a lysine at position 3 in our list of organisms, and K11 was present in organisms with medium-sized genomes and surrounded mainly by the motif VKG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>). When tested in our <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, K11 was in the context of AKA. So, it is conceivable that additional amino acid changes would be required for lysines in the H2A NTD to increase genome compaction.</p><p>The nucleoskeletal theory proposes that chromatin structure influences the shape of the nucleus, and thus is a major determinant of nuclear volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavalier-Smith, 2005</xref>), although the amount of DNA per se does not affect nuclear volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Neumann and Nurse, 2007</xref>). Non-chromatin components such as nuclear import factors from the cytoplasm may also modulate nuclear size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Levy and Heald, 2010</xref>). Our data suggest that in particular cases, the effects of H2A NTD mutations on chromatin compaction are linked to nuclear volume, although not in a straightforward relationship. While arginines at positions 3 and 11 increase chromatin compaction and reduce nuclear volume, lysines at the same positions have no effect on chromatin compaction yet increase nuclear volume. Removal of serines at positions 10 or 15 has little effect on compaction but also increase nuclear volume. In human cells, expression of all R11 mutants (R11A, C, H, and P) decreased compaction but only R11A also affected nuclear area. Although we do not observe a clear-cut relationship between nuclear volume and chromatin compaction, our data identify a region of the nucleosome that is directly or indirectly linked to nuclear volume control mechanisms.</p><p>Since alterations in chromatin structure often cause changes in transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parra and Wyrick, 2007</xref>), we were surprised that mutant H2A-containing yeast had very similar gene expression profiles as WT cells, grew at similar rates, did not have altered cell cycle profiles, and were not sensitive to DNA damaging drugs or environmental challenges. These data raise the possibility that H2A-mediated compaction of chromatin may have evolved as a mechanism to enable regulation of chromatin compaction without having to make compensatory changes to all other processes that are also based on DNA such as transcription. Nevertheless, it remains to be determined what molecular or cellular processes govern the optimal level of chromatin compaction and nuclear volume for an organism. The stable alterations of chromatin compaction in eukaryotic model organisms through genetic manipulation of H2A should facilitate further experiments to uncover these processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Strains and media</title><p>The yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 1A</xref>.

C-terminally Myc-FLAG-tagged human H2A, in a mammalian expression vector, was obtained from OriGene (RC200688, Origene Technologies, Rockville, MD). Site directed mutagenesis was performed using the QuickChange Lightning kit (Agilent Technologies) on these expression plasmids. Human cells (HEK293, IMR90 and MDA-MB-453) were grown on glass coverslips in 24-well plates in DMEM containing 10% fetal bovine serum and transfected with the indicated H2A expression plasmids using BioT transfection reagent (Bioland Scientific, Paramount, CA) or Lipofectamine LTX with Plus reagent (Life Technologies). Cells were grown for 48 hr post-transfection. For immunofluorescence only, transfected cells were fixed with ice-cold methanol for 15 min at −20°C followed by washing with PBS-T. For combined immunofluorescence and FISH, transfected cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 10 min at room temperature followed by washing with PBS.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper explores a novel and interesting hypothesis, which is that the inclusion of extra arginine residues at position 3 and 11 in the N-terminal tail of histone H2A allows a greater degree of compaction of the chromatin. The authors found a strong correlation between the number of arginine residues in the N-terminal domain (NTD) of histone H2A and genome size. This observation led them to postulate that the NTD arginines promote chromatin compaction and a consequent reduction in the nuclear volume. A variety of substitution, insertion, and deletion mutations were constructed in the NTDs of yeast and human H2A. A good correlation between NTD arginines and chromatin compaction was observed. There was not, however, a strong correlation between chromatin compaction and nuclear volume. This study was based on an innovative idea and contains information that will be of interest to chromatin biologists. This work could be appropriate for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> if the following points are suitably addressed.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> is flawed and should be deleted as a main figure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows the locations of R3 and R11 on an image of two nucleosomes stacked against each other, to infer that these amino acids are involved in interactions between nucleosomes to promote chromatin compaction. However, the structure used (Davey et al., 2002) was a mononucleosome. This paper itself did not show anything more than a mononucleosome, and any potential nucleosome-nucleosome interactions that have been inferred from the coordinates of the mononucleosome may be crystal-packing artifacts. Furthermore, this modeling should be done using instead Tim Richmond's tetranucleosome structure, albeit that the nucleosome interactions in that structure have not been validated experimentally. As such, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> does not stand on its own and should be deleted. The models should be remade with two nucleosomes from the tetranucleosome structure and presented as a supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. If the authors wish to keep the Davey et al. models, the text also needs to acknowledge that the structure that was used to generate the models was a mononucleosome and that the interactions shown have not been validated and may be crystal packing artifacts.</p><p>2) The authors should consider and discuss the possibility that the changes in inter-locus distances (i.e., apparent chromatin compaction) may be due to chromatin looping rather than chromatin compaction. This chromatin looping hypothesis could be tested with a 3C-like method, such as Hi-C, but we do not request that such extensive experiments be performed for this paper. This issue will, however, ultimately need to be addressed by the authors.</p><p>3) Changes in nuclear volume do not always correlate with chromatin compaction (as summarized in Table 1). Hence, there is not a straightforward relationship between chromatin compaction and nuclear volume. This point needs to be made clearly in the text.</p><p>4) There are two issues with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>:</p><p>a) The authors reconstituted oligonucleosome arrays with either wild-type H2A or deltaR11.

This paper itself did not show anything more than a mononucleosome, and any potential nucleosome-nucleosome interactions that have been inferred from the coordinates of the mononucleosome may be crystal-packing artifacts. Furthermore, this modeling should be done using instead Tim Richmond's tetranucleosome structure, albeit that the nucleosome interactions in that structure have not been validated experimentally.

We have also edited the text to reflect that the internucleosomal contacts are indeed inferred from crystal lattice packing. The reason we performed this analysis in the first place was because the interaction between H4 K16 and the H2A/H2B acidic patch was described initially from crystal lattice packing (Luger et al., 1997).</p><p><italic>2) The authors should consider and discuss the possibility that the changes in inter-locus distances (i.e., apparent chromatin compaction) may be due to chromatin looping rather than chromatin compaction. This chromatin looping hypothesis could be tested with a 3C-like method, such as Hi-C, but we do not request that such extensive experiments be performed for this paper. This issue will, however, ultimately need to be addressed by the authors</italic>.</p><p>This is a valid point that we have now explicitly discussed in the paper (see Discussion section). However, we think that this is a less likely possibility because examination of inter-probe distances for four probe-pairs on the same chromosome suggests linear compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p><italic>3) Changes in nuclear volume do not always correlate with chromatin compaction (as summarized in Table 1). Hence, there is not a straightforward relationship between chromatin compaction and nuclear volume. This point needs to be made clearly in the text</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers and in fact had attempted to make this point in the discussion of the original submission. We have now further amended our discussion on nuclear volume changes to better emphasize this point.</p><p><italic>4) There are two issues with</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref><italic>:</italic></p><p><italic>a) The authors reconstituted oligonucleosome arrays with either wild-type H2A or deltaR11. The sedimentation coefficients of the mutant arrays were decreased, suggesting loss of inter-fiber compaction. It should be noted, however that results from the lab of Jeff Hansen (Gordon et al. 2005) showed that reconstituted nucleosome arrays missing only the H2A N-terminal region have a sedimentation profile that is indistinguishable from that of wild-type arrays. Hence, the results from the Hansen lab argue against an essential role of the H2A N-terminal region in chromatin compaction and appear to be inconsistent with the data in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6"><italic>Figure 6</italic></xref>.</p><p>Although we do not have a satisfactory explanation for this discrepancy, we have two counterpoints.</p><p>1) We have performed additional in vivo experiments in which we ectopically expressed either WT H2A or an H2A gene missing amino acids 1-12 ( H2A-NTD) in IMR90 cells. Both constructs were FLAG tagged at the C-terminus. As would be predicted from our data, expression of H2A-NTD which is missing R3 and R11 decreased chromatin compaction (increased inter-probe distances) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) and also caused an increase in nuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We therefore conclude that deletion of the H2A NTD does indeed affect chromatin compaction in vivo.</p><p>2) In Gordon et al., nucleosomal arrays missing the H4 NTD sedimented at a value almost identical to WT octamers: 23.1 S for ΔH4 NTD vs 23.2 S for WT. (Arrays missing H2A sedimented slightly slower than WT arrays with a sedimentation coefficient of 22.7 S). However, other studies have demonstrated that H4 NTD or acetylation of H4K16 do affect chromatin compaction in vitro (Dorigo et al., 2003; Shogren-Knaak et al., 2006).</p><p>Some of these discrepancies may be attributable to the nature of assembled chromatin (DNA sequence, method of assembly, etc.) and inherent intricacy of such experiments. But we note that none of the referenced studies have validated their findings <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> data are supported by additional <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence for both ectopic addition of the H2A arginines as well as their removal in yeast and human cell line model systems, respectively.</p><p><italic>b) The biochemical experiments provide an excellent opportunity to examine the effect of charge on chromatin compaction in the absence of potential histone acetylation. Thus, it could be informative to test the relative effect of R vs. K in these experiments. However, given the ambiguity in the sedimentation data from different labs (as discussed in point 4a, above), it is not certain how useful such experiments would be</italic>.</p><p>We share the same point of view and in fact did attempt to assemble chromatin in vitro with H2A R11K mutation. But for unknown reasons we were not able to obtain satisfactorily assembled chromatin for sedimentation velocity analysis. However, in addition to the original data on K11 insertion in yeast H2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B-C</xref>), we ectopically expressed an H2A gene with R11K mutation in normal human fibroblasts and found no statistically significant effects on chromatin compaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A-B</xref>), albeit the average values were slightly larger than WT and trending toward significance (p value=0.02 for FISH distances). Also, R11K did increase the average nuclear area. These data suggest that R11K may have subtle effects on chromatin compaction that would be more apparent if more than one region of the genome was analyzed. Together with the findings from yeast, the data suggest that R11 may be somewhat better than K11 in compacting chromatin and has a greater effect on nuclear area, explaining the evolution of R11 in large genome species.</p><p><italic>5)</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7"><italic>Figure 7E</italic></xref> <italic>shows some mutations of H2A that have been found in cancer.
