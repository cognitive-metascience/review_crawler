Since the TFLL lipids are secreted from the meibomian glands, which are distributed behind the eyelids, they are collectively called meibum lipids. The aqueous layer contains nutrients, electrolytes, and bioactive molecules. The mucin-rich glycocalyx layer has a role in maintaining the aqueous layer on the corneal surface.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Generation of <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the cornea, tear film, and structures of major meibum lipids (wax ester [WE], cholesteryl ester [CE], and (<italic>O</italic>-Acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acid [OAHFA]), together with their simplified structures.

The prevalence of dry eye disease varies among countries and regions (7–33% of the population) and is increasing year by year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gayton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dana et al., 2019</xref>). Dry eye disease is roughly classified into two types: aqueous-deficient dry eye (ADDE) and evaporative dry eye (EDE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bron and Tiffany, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craig et al., 2017</xref>). Most cases of EDE are caused by meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD). MGD is the most common cause of dry eye disease: one study reported that 87% of dry eye patients suffer from MGD (either MGD alone or MGD with ADDE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Horwath-Winter, 2003</xref>).</p><p>The TFLL is thought to consist of two sublayers, a nonpolar lipid sublayer and an amphiphilic lipid sublayer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butovich, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Green-Church et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovich, 2017</xref>). The two most abundant meibum lipids are cholesteryl esters (CEs) and wax esters (WEs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), the total amount of which varies among reports but is 60–96% of total meibum lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovich, 2017</xref>). These lipids are highly nonpolar and form the nonpolar lipid sublayer. The major components of the amphiphilic lipid sublayer are (<italic>O</italic>-acyl)-ω-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFAs) (1–5%) and cholesteryl OAHFAs (Chl-OAHFAs; ~3%), which are the cholesterol adducts of OAHFAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovich, 2017</xref>). The amphiphilic lipid sublayer also contains triglycerides (~1%), fatty acids (FAs; 0.1–1%), phospholipids (&lt;0.1%), and cholesterol (&lt;0.5%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovich, 2017</xref>). It is postulated that this sublayer functions in stabilizing tear film by producing an interface between the nonpolar lipid layer, which constitutes most of the TFLL, and the aqueous layer beneath it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butovich et al., 2009</xref>). OAHFAs have a structure in which a C30–C36 ω-hydroxy (ω-OH) FA and a C16–C18 FA are ester-linked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butovich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Butovich, 2017</xref>). However, the biosynthesis pathway of OAHFAs and the genes involved in their synthesis are still unknown. Furthermore, a mouse model that is unable to produce OAHFAs has not yet been created. Therefore, the actual function of OAHFAs in tear film has not yet been elucidated.</p><p>We previously revealed that the cytochrome P450 members CYP4F22 (human) and its mouse ortholog Cyp4f39 exhibit high ω-hydroxylase activity toward ≥C30 FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>CYP4F22</italic> mutations cause the skin disease congenital ichthyosis, and <italic>Cyf4f39</italic> knockout (<italic>Cyp4f39<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) in mice is neonatal lethal because of impaired skin permeability barrier formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lefèvre et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>). The epidermis has a special class of ceramides, ω-<italic>O</italic>-acylceramides, which is essential for skin permeability barrier function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kihara, 2016</xref>), and <italic>CYP4F22</italic>/<italic>Cyp4f39</italic> mutations cause failure to produce ω-<italic>O</italic>-acylceramides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>). ω-<italic>O</italic>-Acylceramides contain ≥C30 ω-OH FAs, as seen in OAHFAs. Therefore, we hypothesize that CYP4F22/Cyp4f39 are also involved in FA ω-hydroxylation in the OAHFA biosynthesis pathway. Whole-body <italic>Cyf4f39</italic> gene knockout is neonatal lethal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>), so we created <italic>Cyp4f39<sup>–/–</sup> Tg</italic> (<italic>IVL-Cyp4f39</italic>) mice (hereafter, <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>–/–</sup></italic>), in which the epidermal barrier defect was rescued by the transgenic expression of <italic>Cyp4f39</italic> in the epidermis.

To confirm the epidermis-specific expression of 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 protein, total cell lysates were prepared from several tissues of <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice and subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody. 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 was highly expressed in the epidermis, and weak expression was observed in the cornea and meibomian glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). It is known that the <italic>IVL</italic> promoter is active in the cornea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adhikary et al., 2005</xref>). The detection of 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 protein in the meibomian gland is probably due to expression in the keratinized epithelial cells that constitute the meibomian gland ducts rather than to the production of meibum lipids by meibocytes. Palpebral ptosis was observed in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>–/–</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,F</xref>).

OAHFAs constitute an amphiphilic lipid sublayer and are thought to have a role in stabilizing the tear film by creating an interface between the nonpolar lipid sublayer and the aqueous layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Butovich et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King-Smith et al., 2013</xref>). However, it has not yet been possible to create a model organism that lacks OAHFAs, due to a lack of knowledge about their biosynthesis pathway. Therefore, the actual function of OAHFAs has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we found that FA ω-hydroxylase Cyp4f39 is involved in OAHFA production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). <italic>Cyp4f39</italic>-deficient mice exhibited dry eye accompanied by meibomian gland obstruction and tear film destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

These results suggest that the observed dry eye was caused by the combined effects of decreased production of OAHFAs and their derivatives.</p><p>Cyp4f39 and its human ortholog, CYP4F22, show high ω-hydroxylase activity toward ≥C30 FAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohno et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>). Alkyl chains are classified according to their chain length: those with C11–C20 are long-chain, whereas those with ≥C21 are very-long-chain (VLC). Long-chain acyl-CoAs are converted to VLC acyl-CoAs through the FA elongation cycle, which comprises four reactions: condensation, reduction, dehydration, and reduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kihara, 2012</xref>). The condensation reaction, which is the rate-limiting step of the FA elongation cycle, is catalyzed by FA elongases. Mammals have seven FA elongase isozymes (ELOVL1–7) that have different substrate specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kihara, 2012</xref>). It is likely that ELOVL1, ELOVL3, and ELOVL4 are involved in the production of ≥C30 monounsaturated very long chain fatty acids (VLCFAs), the components of OAHFAs. ELOVL1 and ELOVL3 are active toward saturated and monounsaturated C22–C24 acyl-CoAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ohno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sassa et al., 2018</xref>), whereas ELOVL4 shows activity toward ≥C24 acyl-CoAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vasireddy et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agbaga et al., 2008</xref>). The contribution of ELOVL1 to FA elongation is high for saturated VLC acyl-CoAs but low for monounsaturated VLC acyl-CoAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sassa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sassa et al., 2018</xref>). Since most of OAHFAs are composed of monounsaturated VLCFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), OAHFAs are not decreased in <italic>Elovl1</italic>-deficient mice, in which the expression of <italic>Elovl3</italic> is increased as a compensatory mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sassa et al., 2018</xref>). However, CEs and WEs, which are rich in saturated VLCFAs and VLCFAls, respectively, are shortened in <italic>Elovl1</italic>-deficient mice, leading to a dry eye-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sassa et al., 2018</xref>).

First, long-chain acyl-CoAs are elongated by ELOVL1 and ELOVL3 to generate VLC acyl-CoAs, and then they are further elongated to ≥C30 acyl-CoAs by ELOVL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). After the removal of CoA, the resulting ≥C30 VLCFAs are ω-hydroxylated by CYP4F22 (Cyp4f39 in mice). Finally, an C16:1/C18:1 acyl group is transferred from C16:1/C18:1-CoA to the ω-OH VLCFAs, generating OAHFAs. In these reactions, the thioesterase that catalyzes the CoA removal and the acyltransferase that catalyzes the final ester bond formation have not yet been identified.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Models of the synthesis pathways of OAHFAs and their derivatives and of the lipid polarity gradient in TFLL.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of synthesis pathways of OAHFAs and their derivatives.

In the present study, we found that both type 2ω and type 2α WdiEs are present, and that type 2ω WdiEs are synthesized in a Cyp4f39-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Furthermore, we revealed that Cyp4f39 is also involved in the production of type 1ω WdiEs and Chl-OAHFAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We propose that the synthesis pathway for these OAHFA derivatives is as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). First, OAHFAs are converted to (<italic>O</italic>-acyl)-ω-OH (OAH) acyl-CoAs. Next, OAH acyl-CoAs are transferred to FAls or cholesterol, producing type 1ω-WdiEs or Chl-OAHFAs, respectively. Alternatively, OAH acyl-CoAs are converted to OAHFAls by acyl-CoA reductase, followed by ester bond formation with FAs, generating type 2ω WdiEs. However, another pathway is also possible for type 2ω WdiE synthesis, in which ω-OH VLCFAs are reduced to α,ω- fatty diols, followed by conversion to OAHFAls and then to type 2ω WdiEs.</p><p>At present, the acyltransferase involved in C16:1 OAHFA production (i.e., forming the ester bond between a C16:1 FA and an ω-OH VLCFA) is unknown. However, it is possible that C18:2 OAHFA, which was detected at higher levels than C16:1 OAHFA in our meibum lipid preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), is derived from ω-<italic>O</italic>-acylceramides via degradation. ω-<italic>O</italic>-Acylceramides, which are important for the skin barrier and exist specifically in the epidermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kihara, 2016</xref>), consist of a long-chain base, an ω-OH FA (C30–C36), and linoleic acid (C18:2); the conjugate of the latter two components is C18:2 OAHFA. The transacylase PNPLA1 catalyzes the formation of an ester bond between ω-OH FA and linoleic acid using triglyceride as the linoleic acid donor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ohno et al., 2017</xref>). We speculate that the C18:2 OAHFA that was detected in meibum lipids is derived from the keratinized epithelial cells constituting the meibomian gland ducts or from epidermis contamination in the samples. On the other hand, since PNPLA1 can produce few ω-<italic>O</italic>-acylceramides containing C16:1 FA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hirabayashi et al., 2019</xref>), it is unlikely that it is involved in the production of C16:1 OAHFA in meibocytes.</p><p>Tears are secreted when the eyes are closed, and the formation of the tear film begins when the eyes open and involves two processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Dervichian, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Willcox et al., 2017</xref>). First, the liquid components of the aqueous layer that has accumulated on the lower eyelid side extend upward due to the negative pressure in the upper eyelid rim that is generated when the eyes are opened. At that time, the TFLL lipids (meibum lipids) remain on the lower eyelid side but are hardly present on the upper eyelid side, creating a surface pressure gradient. Subsequently, the TFLL lipids spread on the aqueous layer from the lower eyelid side to the upper eyelid side, cancelling out the surface pressure gradient (this is known as the Gibbs–Marangoni effect) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brown and Dervichian, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">King-Smith et al., 2009</xref>). For the TFLL to extend, the TFLL and aqueous layers must interact with each other. However, CEs and WEs, which constitute most of the TFLL, are only weakly polar and can barely interact with the aqueous layer, whereas the polar phospholipids are not able to interact sufficiently with the nonpolar CEs and WEs. Therefore, OAHFAs, which have a polar group as well as a long hydrophobic chain, may play an important role in connecting the aqueous layer to the nonpolar lipid sublayer composed of CEs and WEs. Furthermore, in the present study, we have revealed that type 1ω WdiEs, type 2ω WdiEs, and Chl-OAHFAs, all derived from OAHFAs, have polarities intermediate between those of OAHFAs and CEs/WEs. This suggests that these OAHFA derivatives are located between OAHFAs and CEs/WEs and function to connect them. Therefore, we speculate that a lipid polarity gradient is formed from the aqueous layer/TFLL boundary to the external environment (from phospholipids, to OAHFAs, then OAHFA derivatives, and finally CEs/WEs), and that this gradient keeps the TFLL stably on top of the aqueous layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). In fact, <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice showed tear accumulation on the lower eyelid side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), which indicates increased surface tension and decreased interaction between the aqueous layer and the TFLL. In addition, these mice exhibited plugging at the orifices of the meibomian glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). It is likely that the decreased interaction between the aqueous layer and the TFLL causes accumulation of meibum lipids at the eyelid rim, leading to abnormal secretion of meibum lipids from the meibomian glands. The plugging observed in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice was mild (semi-liquid state), and their meibomian glands were not enlarged. If secretion of meibum lipids had been strongly inhibited, the meibomian glands would have been expected to swell. Therefore, we speculate that that most meibum lipids are secreted in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the slight reduction in the secretion of total meibum lipids (not only OAHFA and its derivatives, but also other meibum lipids) due to the plugging causes further progression of dry eye in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p><p>In the present study, we have revealed that Cyp4f39/CYP4F22 is involved in the production of OAHFAs and their derivatives, and have obtained some clues concerning their biosynthesis pathways. Furthermore, on the basis of these findings, we propose a model in which the lipid polarity gradient in the TFLL is important for the stabilization of the TFLL on top of the aqueous layer. Although dry eye drugs targeting the aqueous and glycocalyx layers exist, there are no drugs targeting the TFLL. Considering that the majority of dry eye disease is caused by abnormalities in the TFLL, future studies are needed to develop drugs that target this layer, such as eye drops containing OAHFAs/OAHFA derivatives or drugs that promote their production.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

<italic>Cyp4f39</italic> was amplified by PCR from cDNA from mouse testis and cloned into the <italic>3×FLAG</italic> vector pCE-puro 3×FLAG-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kihara et al., 2006</xref>), producing the pCE-puro 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 plasmid. The <italic>3×FLAG-Cyp4f39</italic> fragment in the pCE-puro 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 plasmid was then transferred to the pH3700-pL2 vector containing a human <italic>IVL</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carroll et al., 1993</xref>), generating the pH3700-pL2−3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 plasmid. The <italic>IVL-Tg-Cyp4f39</italic> fragment in the pH3700-pL2−3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 plasmid was excised, purified, and microinjected into fertilized eggs from C57BL/6J mice. Genomic DNA samples were prepared from the mice thus generated, and the presence of the <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic> transgene was detected by genomic PCR using primers (Involucrin-Tg-F and Cyp4f39-R; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) to amplify the transgene fragment (678 bp). The transgene was present in four founder mice, and their epidermis was subjected to immunoblotting with anti-FLAG antibody to validate the expression of 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 protein. The transgenic mice expressing 3×FLAG-Cyp4f39 protein (<italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>+/+</sup> mice) were crossed with <italic>Cyp4f39</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>) to produce <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice. This strain was maintained by repeated back-crossing with C57BL/6J mice. <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice were prepared by crossing <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>+/–</sup> mice. Genotyping for <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic> was performed as described above, and that for <italic>Cyp4f39</italic> was conducted by genomic PCR using p1 and p2 primers as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>). The mice were housed in a specific pathogen-free, controlled environment (room temperature, 23 ± 1°C; humidity 50 ± 5%; 12 hr light/12 hr dark cycle). They were fed with normal diet (PicoLab Rodent Diet 20; LabDiet, St. Louis, MO) and given water ad libitum. All animal experiments were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee of Hokkaido University (Permit Number: 17–0017).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Immunoblotting</title><p>Immunoblotting was performed as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kitamura et al., 2017</xref>), using anti-FLAG (1 μg/mL; Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) or anti-GAPDH antibody (1:2000 dilution; FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical, Osaka, Japan) as the primary antibody and anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked F(ab′)<sub>2</sub> fragment (1:7500 dilution; GE Healthcare Life Sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) as the secondary antibody. Chemiluminescence was performed using Western Lightning Plus-ECL (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>BUT measurement and corneal damage scoring</title><p>Soon after 3 μL of 0.5% liquid sodium fluorescein (Tokyo Chemical Industry, Tokyo, Japan) had been loaded onto the mouse eyes, the mice were manually forced to blink three times, to ensure that the fluorescein solution covered the entire surface of the eyeballs. The mouse eye surfaces were then observed under a slit lamp microscope (Slit lamp RO800; Luneau Technology Operations, Pont-de-l'Arche, France) with a cobalt blue filter. BUT represents the elapsed time (in seconds) from the moment when the eyeball surface was covered with the fluorescein solution until the uniform staining was destroyed. Scoring of corneal epithelial damage was performed immediately after measurement of BUT. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of 0.05 mg/g (body weight) pentobarbital (Tokyo Chemical Industry), and then their eye surfaces were observed under a slit lamp microscope with cobalt blue and yellow filters. Scoring of corneal damage was performed according to a previous report (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lemp, 1995</xref>). The eyeball surface was divided into five sections, and the corneal damage in each section was evaluated as grade 0 to 3. The corneal damage score was calculated as the sum of the section scores. The grades were determined on the basis of the fraction of the area over which punctate staining was observed: 0, &lt;1/3 area; 1, 1/3 to &lt;2/3 area; 2, 2/3 to &lt;3/3 area; 3, entire area or presence of filamentary keratitis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Tear quantity measurement</title><p>After the mice had been anesthetized through inhalation of isoflurane (FUJIFILM Wako Pure Chemical), tear quantities were measured using the phenol red-thread test using Zone-Quick (Showa Yakuhin Kako, Tokyo, Japan), according to the manufacturer’s manual.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Hematoxylin and eosin staining</title><p>The eyeballs and eyelids were fixed with Super Fix (Kurabo, Osaka, Japan) at 4°C for ≥24 hr.

Real-time quantitative RT-PCR was performed using 50 ng/μL of total RNAs, primer pairs (Awat1-F/-R, Awat2-F/-R, Far1-F/-R, Far2-F/-R, Soat1-F/-R, Cyp4f39-F/-R2, and Hprt-F/-R; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and One Step TB Green PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit II (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Miyamoto et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Lipid analyses by LC-MS/MS</title><p>Meibomian glands were removed from the upper and lower eyelids of the mice under a stereomicroscope and subjected to lipid extraction as follows. Meibomian glands (2.0–3.8 mg) were transferred to zirconia-bead-containing tubes (SARSTEDT, Nümbrecht, Germany) and suspended in 450 μL of chloroform/methanol/12 M formic acid (100:200:1, v/v). Samples were vigorously mixed (4°C, 5000 rpm, 2 min) using a Micro Smash MS-100 (TOMY Seiko, Tokyo, Japan). After removing the zirconia beads, the samples were mixed with 150 μL of chloroform and 270 μL of water. Phase separation was performed by centrifugation (20,400 × g, room temperature, 5 min), and the organic phase was recovered. The aqueous phase was again subjected to lipid extraction by mixing with 150 μL of chloroform, followed by centrifugation. The organic phase was recovered and combined with the previous one. The extracted lipids were dried and dissolved in 200 μL of hexane. Next, the lipids were subjected to a second phase separation by mixing with 200 μL of water and centrifugation (20,400 × g, room temperature, 3 min). The organic phase was recovered, and the lipids were re-extracted from the aqueous phase by mixing with 200 μL of hexane, followed by centrifugation. The combined lipid extracts (meibum lipid fraction) were dried.</p><p>FAs were prepared from the meibum lipid fraction by alkaline treatment as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jojima et al., 2020</xref>). FAs and OAHFAs were derivatized with AMPP using an AMP+ MaxSpec Kit (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hancock et al., 2018</xref>). Meibum lipids were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (1:2, v/v) at a concentration of 0.1 mg tissue/μL, and 0.1 μL (FAs) or 1.0 μL (OAHFAs) of each sample was subjected to derivatization, according to the manufacturer's manual. After the reaction, acetonitrile was added so that the sample volume became 100 μL.</p><p>LC-MS/MS analyses were performed using ultra-performance LC (UPLC) coupled with electrospray ionization tandem triple-quadrupole mass spectrometry (Xevo TQ-S; Waters, Milford, MA). Lipids were separated by UPLC using a reverse phase column (Acquity UPLC CSH C18 column; length, 100 mm; particle size, 1.7 μm; inner diameter, 2.1 mm; Waters) at 55°C. The amounts of meibum lipids injected onto the UPLC column were 0.5 μg (tissue weight) for AMPP-FAs, 5 μg for AMPP-OAHFAs, and 50 μg for each of type 2α/ω WdiEs, type 1α/ω WdiEs, Chl-OAHFAs, and CEs. Lipid separation by UPLC was performed at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min using a gradient system in which mobile phase A (acetonitrile/water [3:2, v/v] containing 5 mM ammonium formate) and mobile phase B (acetonitrile/2-propanol [1:9, v/v] containing 5 mM ammonium formate) were mixed. The gradient conditions for AMPP-OAHFA measurement were as follows: 0 min, 40% B; 0–18 min, gradient to 100% B; 18–23 min, 100% B; 23–30 min, gradient to 40% B. For the type 2α/ω WdiEs, type 1α/ω WdiEs, Chl-OAHFAs, and CEs, the gradient conditions were as follows: 0 min, 60% B; 0–21 min, gradient to 100% B; 21–25 min, 100% B; 25–30 min, gradient to 60% B. Ionization of lipids was performed by electrospray ionization. Quantitative analyses were performed by MRM in positive ion mode. The cone voltage was set at 35 V, and an appropriate collision energy was set for each lipid (AMPP-OAHFA, 60 eV; type 1α/ω and type 2α/ω WdiEs, 20 eV; Chl-OAHFAs and CEs, 15 eV). The <italic>m/z</italic> values of the precursor and product ions of each lipid species were set in the mass filters Q1 and Q3, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yamamoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">6</xref>). Product ion scanning was performed for fragment ion analyses. In the analyses of OAHFAs, [M – H]<sup>–</sup> was detected as the product in negative ion mode, but in the analyses of type 1 and 2 WdiEs, [M + H]<sup>+</sup> was detected in positive ion mode. Data analyses were performed using MassLynx software (Waters).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Lipid analyses by TLC</title><p>The upper and lower eyelids were removed from the mice and cooled on ice.

Lipids in the tear film layer provide a barrier against evaporation and thus prevent evaporative dry eye. In this study, the authors describe a role for <italic>Cyp4f39</italic>, a fatty acid omega hydroxylase, in the biosynthesis of O-acyl-omega-hydroxy fatty acids (OAHFAs), a class of lipids that is crucial for maintaining the proper polarity of meibum lipids in the tear film. Using genetically modified mice and several elegant technical advances, they show that <italic>Cyp4f39</italic> deficiency in the meibomian glands leads to OAHFA deficiency and human dry eye like pathology in mice. All reviewers expressed enthusiasm for this study and felt that it represented a significant advance in dry eye disease research. They did, however, raise some points that need to be addressed, both to support the conclusions of this study and to clarify the findings for the broader audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. Please prepare a revised version for resubmission where the following points are addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some of the major conclusions on mouse pathology of MGD need to be clarified:</p><p>a) Age: All the mouse pathological assessments are done at 12-14 months of age (Figure 1, 2), which is equivalent to mid-age human. Human dry eye disease has been shown to have an association with age. No description or discussion is found on whether this pathology in mice is age-dependent? When do the first symptoms appear?</p><p>b) Plugging of the meibomian gland orifices: no description is provided on how the obstruction is determined? Was it a qualitative or quantitative measurement? How many observations were made and at what age? Please provide better quality images for Figure 2D that more clearly show plugged vs normal meibomian glands.</p><p>c) Histological images of meibomian glands in Figure 3A need a clear description and annotation are needed on what is being shown; is it an acini? Please indicate by arrows the locations of the basal region, the central region, and enucleated cells. If possible, use a micrograph or cartoon of meibomian gland to explain these.</p><p>d) Results on corneal epithelial damage, in Figure 2C, which is higher in transgenic mice is contradictory to the Figure 3B, that shows normal 'formation' of cornea. If the authors wish to say the 'development' or formation is normal, they should show images corresponding to different age points, especially at early age points of 2-3 months when the development of mouse eye completes. In Figure 3B generated from 12-month-old mice, epithelial damage is expected.</p><p>2) A major connection appears to be missing regarding lipid composition and mouse pathology – if the pathology is obstruction of meibomian glands, then that would cause reduction in secretion of all lipids, not only OAHFA containing lipids. Is the mouse dry eye pathology observed here in the <italic>Cyp4f39</italic> knockout due to deficiency of all meibum lipids or only OAHFA containing lipids?</p><p>3) In Figures 1C, 2A, and 2E, the control group includes both <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice, whereas in the rest of the manuscript the control group is simply <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/+</sup></italic>. Please either remove data for the <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice from the control grouping in Figure 1C, 2A, and 2E, or separate into +/+, +/-, and -/- mice groupings. Theoretically, <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/-</sup></italic> mice may not be completely &quot;normal&quot;.</p><p>4) Subsection “Palpebral ptosis and abnormal tear covering on the eyeball surface in <italic>Cyp4f39</italic>-deficient mice”. Please make sure that 3 x FLAG-<italic>Cyp4f39</italic> protein is expressed in keratinized epithelial cells, but not in meibocytes, by immunohistochemistry.</p><p>5) Subsection “<italic>Cyp4f39</italic> deficiency causes a decrease in C16:1 OAHFA levels in meibum lipids”. Is it possible to separate keratinized epithelial cells and meibocytes by flow cytometry and confirm that C18:1 and C18:2 OAHFAs are indeed derived from keratinized epithelial cells?</p><p>6) It is interesting that OAHFAs in meibum lipids contain C16:1 in preference to C18:1. In most tissues and cells, C18:1 is more abundant than C16:1. Do meibocytes contain C16:1 abundantly? Or is there another explanation for the enrichment of C16:1 in OAHFAs? Given that PNPLA1, a transacylase, incorporates 18:2 selectively into w-hydroxy-VLCFA in ceramide to give rise to w-O-acylceramide, a similar reaction with C16:1 specificity could occur in OAHFA production in the meibomian glands? Please comment.</p><p>7) The statements &quot;<italic>Cyp4F39</italic> is essential for WdiE production&quot; or &quot;OAHFAs produced by <italic>Cyp4f39</italic>&quot; are somehow misleading, since the enzyme does not catalyze the esterification of OAHFAs. Strictly speaking, <italic>Cyp4F39</italic> produces OAHFA precursors (omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs), which are subsequently utilized for OAHFA synthesis. The enzyme involved in the esterification step is not described in this study. In this vein, please check the statements throughout the text so as to avoid confusion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53582.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Some of the major conclusions on mouse pathology of MGD need to be clarified:</p><p>a) Age: All the mouse pathological assessments are done at 12-14 months of age (Figure 1, 2), which is equivalent to mid-age human.

Based on this result, we concluded that there is no clear age-dependent progression of dry eye (subsection “<italic>Cyp4f39</italic> deficiency causes dry eye due to plugging of the meibomian gland orifices”). Regarding plugging of the meibomian gland orifice, only data from 14-month-old <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice were presented in the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we have added data for 6-month and 12-month-old mice. As shown in the new Figure 2D, there are no obvious differences in the degree of plugging between the age groups. This result supports our conclusion that there is no clear age-dependent progression of dry eye in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Plugging of the meibomian gland orifices: no description is provided on how the obstruction is determined?

In <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice, plugging was observed in 8 out of 8 mice aged 6 months or older (6 months, 2 mice; 12 months, 3 mice; 14 months, 1 mouse; and 17 months, 2 months). We did not examine mice younger than 6 months for evidence of plugging. Therefore, plugging occurs at least at 6 months of age. On the other hand, no plugging was observed in control mice between 6–12 months (0 out of 9 mice). These descriptions are included in the revised manuscript. An enlarged view has also been added to make the plugging more clearly visible (Figure 2D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Histological images of meibomian glands in Figure 3A need a clear description and annotation are needed on what is being shown; is it an acini?

Figure 3B does not show the damaged part of cornea; rather, it shows a normal part to indicate that there was no abnormality in corneal development. Even in cases where morphological abnormalities were observed by HE staining, it was difficult to discriminate whether they represented true corneal damage or an artifact during the HE staining procedure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A major connection appears to be missing regarding lipid composition and mouse pathology – if the pathology is obstruction of meibomian glands, then that would cause reduction in secretion of all lipids, not only OAHFA containing lipids.

We cannot exclude the possibility that the plugging in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice reduces the secretion of other meibum lipids and causes further progression of dry eye. However, the plugging in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice is mild (the plugs had a semi-liquid state), and the meibomian glands are not enlarged. If secretion of meibum lipids is strongly inhibited, the meibomian glands are expected to swell. Therefore, we speculate that most meibum lipids are secreted in <italic>Tg-Cyp4f39</italic><sup>–/–</sup> mice. In fact, we possess certain mice (other genetically modified mice) that show a firm, solid-state plugging and have swollen meibomian glands (our unpublished data). The above description, except for the unpublished data, is described in the revised manuscript Discussion (paragraph six).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figures 1C, 2A, and 2E, the control group includes both Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/+</sup> and Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/-</sup> mice, whereas in the rest of the manuscript the control group is simply Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/+</sup>. Please either remove data for the Tg-Cyp4f39<sup>+/-</sup> mice from the control grouping in Figure 1C, 2A, and 2E, or separate into +/+, +/-, and -/- mice groupings.

Please make sure that 3 x FLAG-Cyp4f39 protein is expressed in keratinized epithelial cells, but not in meibocytes, by immunohistochemistry.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to this comment, we performed the suggested immunohistochemistry experiment. However, we could not obtain clear results due to non-specific background signal. Since the origin of the residual band in Figure 1D is not an important issue and does not affect the conclusions of our manuscript, we did not examine it further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “Cyp4f39 deficiency causes a decrease in C16:1 OAHFA levels in meibum lipids”. Is it possible to separate keratinized epithelial cells and meibocytes by flow cytometry and confirm that C18:1 and C18:2 OAHFAs are indeed derived from keratinized epithelial cells?</p></disp-quote><p>At present, it is not possible to perform flow cytometry in this case because no cell surface markers specific to meibocytes are known.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It is interesting that OAHFAs in meibum lipids contain C16:1 in preference to C18:1. In most tissues and cells, C18:1 is more abundant than C16:1. Do meibocytes contain C16:1 abundantly? Or is there another explanation for the enrichment of C16:1 in OAHFAs? Given that PNPLA1, a transacylase, incorporates 18:2 selectively into w-hydroxy-VLCFA in ceramide to give rise to w-O-acylceramide, a similar reaction with C16:1 specificity could occur in OAHFA production in the meibomian glands? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We examined the fatty acid composition of meibum lipids and found that C18:1 fatty acid was more abundant than C16:1 fatty acid (New Figure 4G), suggesting that the unknown mouse acyltransferase involved in OAHFA production prefers C16:1 acyl-CoA as a substrate rather than C18:1-CoA.</p><p>Acylceramides, which are important for the skin barrier, consist of a long-chain base, an ω-hydroxy fatty acid, and linoleic acid; the conjugate of the latter two components is C18:2 OAHFA. PNPLA1 catalyzes the formation of an ester bond between the ω-hydroxy fatty acid and linoleic acid. C18:2 OAHFA present in the epidermis is considered to be generated by the degradation of acylceramide. In the present study, we detected C18:2 OAHFA in meibum lipids. This may be derived from the keratinized epithelial cells constituting the meibomian gland ducts or from epidermis contamination in the samples. On the other hand, since PNPLA has low activity toward C16:1 fatty acid, it is unlikely that PNPLA is involved in C16:1 OAHFA production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The statements &quot;Cyp4F39 is essential for WdiE production&quot; or &quot;OAHFAs produced by Cyp4f39&quot; are somehow misleading, since the enzyme does not catalyze the esterification of OAHFAs. Strictly speaking, Cyp4F39 produces OAHFA precursors (omega-hydroxy-VLCFAs), which are subsequently utilized for OAHFA synthesis. The enzyme involved in the esterification step is not described in this study. In this vein, please check the statements throughout the text so as to avoid confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the statement &quot;Cyp4f39 is involved in or essential for the production of OAHFA and OAHFA derivatives&quot; is appropriate, since these lipids cannot be produced in the absence of Cyp4f39. The phrase “Cyp4F39 produces OAHFA precursors (ω-OH VLCFAs), which are subsequently utilized for OAHFA synthesis” is long. Therefore, we would like to avoid such phrasing to prioritize readability. Regarding the phrase “OAHFAs produced by Cyp4f39”, we agree that there is a possibility it could be misread. We have therefore changed it to “Since Cyp4f39 is involved in the production of OAHFAs composed of a C30–C36 ω-OH FA and a C16:1 FA (Figure 4C) […]”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
